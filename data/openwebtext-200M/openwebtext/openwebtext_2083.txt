Although it was n’t surprising to see John McCain spend much of the past few years courting the Religious Right in advance of securing the Republican presidential nomination , he continued to pander even after his primary victory was all but finalized .
Beginning with his speech to the right - wing activists at CPAC — which followed shortly after his main rival , Mitt Romney , dropped out —
McCain seemed to step up his embrace of the fringe , picking up more and more endorsements , campaigning with apocalyptic televangelist John Hagee and “ Patriot Pastor ” Rod Parsley , and reaching out to the Council for National Policy .
McCain ’s search for religious - right support might have raised a few flags .
Hagee , for example , frames his support for Israel in terms of the end times , going as far as warning that any U.S. foreign policy decision that is n’t “ pro-Israel ” enough will result in God bringing a “ blood bath ” of terrorist attacks to America .
Hagee also identifies the Catholic Church as the “ great whore ” of Revelation ( a characterization he now denies ) and said Hurricane Katrina was God ’s punishment on a sinful city .
When confronted with some of Hagee ’s extreme views , McCain simply responded “ all I can tell you is that I am very proud to have Pastor John Hagee ’s support . ’’
After a lot of pressure from the Catholic League , McCain finally issued a bland statement : “ I repudiate any comments that are made , including Pastor Hagee ’s , if they are anti-Catholic or offensive to Catholics . ”
Indeed , McCain would have had difficulty criticizing Hagee any further — much less call the pastor out on his “ profoundly distorted view of this country , ” to quote Barack Obama ’s critique of Rev. Jeremiah Wright — because McCain had sought out Hagee precisely for his extreme stance and the religious - right constituency he can reach .
Just as McCain sought out Hagee for his political clout , it was politics that brought McCain and Ohio televangelist Rod Parsley together on the campaign .
When McCain brought Parsley on stage and called him a “ spiritual guide , ” that did n’t mean the senator had sent the Word of Faith preacher a financial “ seed ” in hopes that God would bolster his campaign contributions .
Instead , McCain was embracing Parsley ’s far - right political views and the political machine of “ Patriot Pastors ” he leads .
David Limbaugh , one of the many right - wing commentators who dismissed Obama ’s speech on his pastor , claimed there was a “ double standard ” when it came to conservatives :
“ When the remotest connection can be inferred between a conservative and a bigoted supporter , there is always hell to pay . ”
But in fact the opposite double standard seems to be in play :
While Obama continues to be attacked for his personal relationship with a pastor whose controversial political ideology he ’s rejected , McCain ’s ongoing ideological relationship with the far Right — consisting , in essence , of him telling them he embraces their political views — remains unconnected to McCain ’s political reputation .

This past weekend I went on a Zero - G flight out of Las Vegas , and was thrilled to see that they use shots of your flight in the training video ( I loudly said ' I know her ' and then realized that that was , of course , a lie ) .

It was great .
An Aussie PhD student has developed an algorithm that he says can turbo charge an ordinary copper phone line to deliver downloads at 200 M bit/s .
John Papandriopoulos of the Universtity of Melbourne has patented maths he did for his thesis last year on " Dynamic Spectrum Management " ( DSM ) .
The algorithm aims to stomp crosstalk interference on DSL , a major reason why current " up to " 8 M bit/s ADSL usually splutters to between 3 and 4 M bit/s .
We 'll let the good doctor do the explaining :
We formulate a ( standard ) model for how DSLs attain their data-rate , considering crosstalk interference effects .
We exploit the fact that interference varies across the frequency spectrum , and that if we are clever about the way in which we allocate transmission power amongst the various frequency bands , we can manage the interference between ( strongly ) coupled lines .
For example , one user that interferes strongly with others within a band may be " turned off " within that band to avoid damaging the other lines , consequently raising the overall network rate .
Papandriopoulos says the work could be applied to ADSL2 + broadband - the type BT is rolling out in its 21CN upgrade - to bring it closer to its theoretical maximum speed .
Substantial kit changes would be needed to get the full benefit , however .
Melbourne University 's technology spin out tentacle is aiming to flog the DSM work for commercialisation .

If you are reading this then you probably recognize some value in meditation , in slowing down , and reducing stress .
At the same time you probably struggle with fitting meditation into your daily routine .
The good news is that establishing a daily meditation practice is easier than you may have thought .
In order to make this work , it will be helpful to :
Lower your expectations of meditation .
Often the reason we are impatient about meditation is we want instant gratification .
Replace that expectation with a desire to experience a “ slow melt ” of your stress .
Be open to non-traditional meditation .
Meditation does n’t have to be done in a seated position .
Any activity in which you can slow down your mind , become more inwardly focused and more rooted in the present moment will pass the test for meditation .
Be kind to yourself .
At all levels , give yourself credit and praise for all your goodness .
Do n’t berate yourself for not being “ good ” at meditating .
That defeats the purpose .
If you make the effort to meditate , then by default , you are good at it .
It ’s more a “ do or not do ” thing versus a “ good or bad . ”
Commit to slow down your mind for 10 minutes each day .
You can obviously do this for longer if you want , but just take your time in building this habit by starting with 10 minutes per day .
How to Easily Incorporate Meditation into Your Day
The way to do this is to transform some of the things you are already doing each day into mindful meditation .
Here are some major areas where you could make this transformation .
Exercise Meditation
Any continuous physical activity over a period of time can work .
Some great choices are walking , jogging , or yoga .
Chores can work too such as sweeping , folding laundry , stacking wood , and washing windows .
The way to transform any of these activities into meditation is to first focus on your breath .
Observe it .
Modify it .
Try long inhalations , holding periods , and slow exhalations if you can .
Observe how each part of your body feels .
When you start to feel the exercise endorphins kick in , you might also want to express those good feelings with a big smile , a raising of the arms and / or a deep “ Ahhhh ” sound .
Silly ?
Maybe .
Feels good ?
Definitely .
Bathing Meditation
The next time you shower or take a bath , create your own spa experience simply by flipping the switch in your mind .
Let go of any limits .
No time limits , no temperature limits .
Breathe deeply .
Close your eyes .
Feel the water .
Feel the sensations it gives your body .
Allow the water to heal you by transforming your bathing time into a meditation .
Focus on your breath and how your body feels .
If thoughts involving the past or future come into your mind , observe them and send them packing by returning to your observations of your breath and body .
What do you see , feel , smell , and hear ?
Let go of words and labels by expressing your good feelings through meaningless sounds such as “ aum , ” “ mmmm , ” or “ ahhhhh . ”
Might your roommates wonder what you are doing ?
Perhaps .
Just let that thought bring you even more joy and laugh .
Music Meditation
This is another activity that most of us do daily .
Listening to music naturally brings us into the present moment .
It can also bring us to good memories or daydreams of the future .
That ’s all good .
You can bring more meditative elements to your music experience by noticing how you feel while you listen , play or sing .
Add full diaphragmatic breathing too .
Some other music ideas are to pick up that instrument you have n’t played in a while .
Do n’t worry if you play well or not .
The point is simply to become immersed in it and to enjoy it .
You also may want to try singing or playing percussion along with your favorite music .
Do n’t have a drum ?
Make one .
Any object can be a percussion instrument .
Just start tapping !
Lastly , consider going to a music based event and enjoy .
You will be engaged in meditation without any effort at all .
No wonder we like music so much !
Hobby Meditation
Similar to the exercise , bathing , and music , immerse yourself in any project that you enjoy such as model building , knitting , car restoration , drawing , painting , crafts , etc .
As you enjoy your hobby , add the elements of deep breathing , awareness of sensation , and focus on the current moment and you ’ll be meditating .
And in the end you ’ll have a physical manifestation of that mediation .
Cool .
Massage Meditation
Schedule a massage for yourself .
As you enjoy the physical sensation , be aware of your breath .
You may want to focus on one word such as Peace , Calm , Love , Ease , or perhaps a sound with no meaning such as Aum .
As everyday thoughts enter your mind , pour them out with the simple mantra “ empty the mind . ”
If All Else Fails – The 10 Minute Dark Room Meditation
If you did n’t have time for any of the above activities in a given day , here is a simple and enjoyable 10 minute meditation routine that even the most impatient can squeeze into their day .
Go into a darkened room and sit in a comfortable position .
Close your eyes .
If it feels good , gently cover your eyes with your hands for a few moments and / or rub your temples .
Start by taking 10 deep breaths .
Hold each for a period of time that is comfortable for you and then release very slowly .
After this simply breath normally .
Be aware of your breath .
Be aware of each part of your body from your feet all the way up to the crown of your body .
Notice each part in turn .
Send an intention of healing to any part that is in need of care .
Then focus on a simple mantra , any word you choose .
As unwanted thoughts enter your mind use the phrase “ empty the mind ” to gently usher them out .
10 minutes will go by pretty quickly .
At the end open your eyes , do any stretches that feel good , and take a few breaths .
Feel the magical rejuvenation !
If you did n’t have time for any of the above activities in a given day , here is a simple and enjoyable 10 minute meditation routine that even the most impatient can squeeze into their day .
Do you have any meditation tips or practices that you ’d like to share ?
We ’d love to hear from you in the comments !
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A suicide bomber killed at least 40 Shiite pilgrims and wounded 60 others Sunday as the pilgrims made their way to Karbala to commemorate one of the holiest days of the Shiite calendar , the Interior Ministry said .
Women and children were among the casualties , the official said .
Most of those killed or wounded were pilgrims .
It marked the second deadly attack on pilgrims Sunday , the official said .
The bomber detonated an explosive vest in Iskandariya about 3 p.m. while the pilgrims were en route to Karbala for al - Arbaeen , the official said .
The holiday falls on Wednesday .
Earlier Sunday , militants armed with guns and grenades attacked a group of pilgrims in southern Baghdad , killing three people and wounding more than 30 others , officials said .
The wounded included two police officers , the ministry said .
Iraqi officials had expected problems for pilgrims and issued a ban on carts in Baghdad on Friday .

A Defense Ministry official said the ban was ordered after a horse - drawn carriage blew up near a restaurant in the Karrada district , killing three civilians and wounding six others .
There was no indication when the ban would be lifted .
Every year , thousands of pilgrims amass in Karbala for al - Arbaeen , which commemorates the end of a 40 - day mourning period for Imam Hussein , the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed .
Hussein is one of the most revered Shiite martyrs .
He died in battle in the 7th century , and is buried in Karbala , about 60 miles southwest of Baghdad .
Karbala 's main holy site is the gold - domed Imam Hussein Shrine .
Violence struck northern Iraq on Sunday as well .
In Hawija , southwest of Kirkuk , a bomb exploded outside a building where tribal leaders were meeting , killing one .
Nine others were injured , including a local council leader , police said .
The person killed was an Awakening Council member .
Groups such as Concerned Local Citizens , Sons of Iraq and Awakening Councils are helping the U.S. and Iraqi militaries fight al Qaeda in Iraq .
The Sunday meeting was aimed at bringing together tribal leaders to sort out differences and cooperate with one another .
In other developments :
• Eight Turkish soldiers and 33 Kurdish rebels were killed Sunday in fighting in northern Iraq , Turkey 's military said .
Turkey began a ground operation against the rebels Thursday -- its first significant ground offensive into Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein .
So far , 15 Turkish soldiers and 112 Kurdish rebels have been killed , according to figures from Turkey 's military .
• Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , 57 , is flying to London on Sunday for medical checkups , two months after doctors examined him for an unspecified condition , his office said .
However , an official with his office said he underwent medical tests related to exhaustion .
Al - Maliki 's office has said there is no cause for concern .
After al - Maliki 's visit to London in December , doctors recommended that he return for periodic checkups , his office said .
• A truck , disguised as a relief vehicle and containing 2 ½ tons of explosives , was removed from a Mosul neighborhood earlier this month after residents reported it to U.S. troops , the military said Saturday .
The truck had markings like those used by the Red Crescent Society , and it also had a " suicide switch " in the cab , an officer said .

All About Iraq War • Karbala
Three humorless guitar heroes who were lampooned in a series of YouTube " shredding " videos have had the clips pulled offline after citing copyright infringement .
The three unnamed artists filed copyright infringement claims against the parody videos of Finnish media artist Santeri Ojala , causing YouTube to shut down his account over the weekend .
( The account used to be here . )
" I feel disappointed , " said Ojala in an email exchange on Wednesday .
" I am amazed that this kind of arbitrary censorship occurs in the free internet . "
Ojala ’s popular videos poked harmless fun at famous guitar soloists by dubbing his own abhorrently bad strummings over rock concert footage .
Ojala created nearly a dozen different parodies of world - famous ax slingers like Eric Clapton , Slash , Eddie Van Halen and Ozzy
Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee .
( See a video of Ojala performing alongside Slash after the jump .
Slash is not one of the artists Ojala suspects filed a claim against his videos . )
The videos often attracted hundreds of thousands of viewers .
Though a spokesperson at YouTube declined to name the artists involved , Ojala suspects Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen and solo guitarist Steve Vai .
They " complained about the videos and YouTube pulled the plug , " said Ojala .
At the time of this post , requests for comment from Steve Vai ’s management had not been returned .
Vai ’s request to have the video pulled is puzzling — in an earlier profile of Ojala ’s videos , the rocker said he enjoyed being featured in the parodies .
" The funny part is that Steve Vai complimented the shreds , " said Ojala .
According to a spokeswoman for YouTube , who asked not to be named , the company has a standing policy to freeze the accounts of users who have multiple copyright infringement claims filed against them .
The spokeswoman said to get his account up and running again , Ojala would likely have to hire a lawyer and appeal the artists ’ infringement claims .
Ojala said that while he has no plans to file a lawsuit , his dubbed creations fall under Fair Use and his censorship by YouTube is unjust .
" While my videos are getting banned , countless number of videos that clearly violate the copyright laws get to be left alone , " said Ojala .
" Just do n’t look for ‘ the shreds ’ . "

Amanda Baggs is at the forefront of a movement that ’s forcing researchers to rethink autism .
Photo : Jessica Dimmock
The YouTube clip opens with a woman facing away from the camera , rocking back and forth , flapping her hands awkwardly , and emitting an eerie hum .
She then performs strange repetitive behaviors : slapping a piece of paper against a window , running a hand lengthwise over a computer keyboard , twisting the knob of a drawer .
She bats a necklace with her hand and nuzzles her face against the pages of a book .
And you find yourself thinking :
Who 's shooting this footage of the handicapped lady , and why do I always get sucked into watching the latest viral video ?
But then the words " A Translation " appear on a black screen , and for the next five minutes , 27 - year - old Amanda Baggs — who is autistic and does n't speak — describes in vivid and articulate terms what 's going on inside her head as she carries out these seemingly bizarre actions .
In a synthesized voice generated by a software application , she explains that touching , tasting , and smelling allow her to have a " constant conversation " with her surroundings .
These forms of nonverbal stimuli constitute her " native language , " Baggs explains , and are no better or worse than spoken language .
Yet her failure to speak is seen as a deficit , she says , while other people 's failure to learn her language is seen as natural and acceptable .
And you find yourself thinking :
She might have a point .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnylM1hI2jc
In My Language
Baggs lives in a public housing project for the elderly and handicapped near downtown Burlington , Vermont .
She has short black hair , a pointy nose , and round glasses .
She usually wears a T - shirt and baggy pants , and she spends a scary amount of time — day and night — on the Internet : blogging , hanging out in Second Life , and corresponding with her autie and aspie friends .
( For the uninitiated , that 's autistic and Asperger's . )
On a blustery afternoon , Baggs reclines on a red futon in the apartment of her neighbor ( and best friend ) .
She has a gray travel pillow wrapped around her neck , a keyboard resting on her lap , and a DynaVox VMax computer propped against her legs .
Like many people with autism , Baggs does n't like to look you in the eye and needs help with tasks like preparing a meal and taking a shower .
In conversation she 'll occasionally grunt or sigh , but she stopped speaking altogether in her early twenties .
Instead , she types 120 words a minute , which the DynaVox then translates into a synthesized female voice that sounds like a deadpan British schoolteacher .
The YouTube post , she says , was a political statement , designed to call attention to people 's tendency to underestimate autistics .
It was n't her first video post , but this one took off .
" When the number of viewers began to climb , I got scared out of my mind , " Baggs says .
As the hit count neared 100,000 , her blog was flooded .
At 200,000 , scientists were inviting her to visit their labs .
By 300,000 , the TV people came calling , hearts warmed by the story of a young woman 's fiery spirit and the rare glimpse into what has long been regarded as the solitary imprisonment of the autistic mind .
" I 've said a million times that I 'm not trapped in my own world , ' " Baggs says .
" Yet what do most of these news stories lead with ?
Saying exactly that . "
Photo : Jessica DimmockI tell her that I asked one of the world 's leading authorities on autism to check out the video .
The expert 's opinion : Baggs must have had outside help creating it , perhaps from one of her caregivers .
Her inability to talk , coupled with repetitive behaviors , lack of eye contact , and the need for assistance with everyday tasks are telltale signs of severe autism .
Among all autistics , 75 percent are expected to score in the mentally retarded range on standard intelligence tests — that 's an IQ of 70 or less .
People like Baggs fall at one end of an array of developmental syndromes known as autism spectrum disorders .
The spectrum ranges from someone with severe disability and cognitive impairment to the socially awkward eccentric with Asperger 's syndrome .
After I explain the scientist 's doubts , Baggs grunts , and her mouth forms just a hint of a smirk as she lets loose a salvo on the keyboard .
No one helped her shoot the video , edit it , and upload it to YouTube .
She used a Sony Cybershot DSC - T1 , a digital camera that can record up to 90 seconds of video ( she has since upgraded ) .
She then patched the footage together using the editing programs RAD Video Tools , VirtualDub , and DivXLand Media Subtitler .
" My care provider would n't even know how to work the software , " she says .
Baggs is part of an increasingly visible and highly networked community of autistics .
Over the past decade , this group has benefited enormously from the Internet as well as innovations like type - to - speech software .
Baggs may never have considered herself trapped in her own world , but thanks to technology , she can communicate with the same speed and specificity as someone using spoken language .
Photo : Jessica DimmockAutistics like Baggs are now leading a nascent civil rights movement .
" I remember in ' 99 , " she says , " seeing a number of gay pride Web sites .
I envied how many there were and wished there was something like that for autism .
Now there is . "
The message : We 're here .
We 're weird .
Get used to it .
This movement is being fueled by a small but growing cadre of neuropsychological researchers who are taking a fresh look at the nature of autism itself .
The condition , they say , should n't be thought of as a disease to be eradicated .
It may be that the autistic brain is not defective but simply different — an example of the variety of human development .
These researchers assert that the focus on finding a cure for autism — the disease model — has kept science from asking fundamental questions about how autistic brains function .
A cornerstone of this new approach — call it the difference model — is that past research about autistic intelligence is flawed , perhaps catastrophically so , because the instruments used to measure intelligence are bogus .
" If Amanda Baggs had walked into my clinic five years ago , " says Massachusetts General Hospital neuroscientist Thomas Zeffiro , one of the leading proponents of the difference model , " I would have said she was a low - functioning autistic with significant cognitive impairment .
And I would have been totally wrong . "
Photo : Jessica DimmockSeventy years ago , a Baltimore psychiatrist named Leo Kanner began recording observations about children in his clinic who exhibited " fascinating peculiarities . "
Just as Kanner 's landmark paper was about to be published , a pediatrician in Vienna named Hans Asperger was putting the finishing touches on a report about a similar patient population .
Both men , independently , used the same word to describe and define the condition : autist , or autism , from the Greek autos , meaning self .
The children had very real deficits , especially when it came to the " failure to be integrated in a social group " ( Asperger ) or the inborn inability to form " affective contact " with other people ( Kanner ) .
The two doctors ' other observations about language impairment , repetitive behaviors , and the desire for sameness still form much of the basis of autism diagnoses in the 21st century .
On the matter of autistic intelligence , Kanner spoke of an array of mental skills , " islets of ability " — vocabulary , memory , and problem - solving that " bespeak good intelligence . "
Asperger , too , was struck by " a particular originality of thought and experience . "
Yet over the years , those islets attracted scientific interest only when they were amazing — savant - level capabilities in areas such as music , mathematics , and drawing .
For the millions of people with autism who were n't savants , the general view was that their condition was tragic , their brainpower lacking .
The test typically used to substantiate this view relies heavily on language , social interaction , and cultural knowledge — areas that autistic people , by definition , find difficult .
About six years ago , Meredyth Goldberg Edelson , a professor of psychology at Willamette University in Oregon , reviewed 215 articles published over the past 71 years , all making or referring to this link between autism and mental retardation .
She found that most of the papers ( 74 percent ) lacked their own research data to back up the assumption .
Thirty - nine percent of the articles were n't based on any data , and even the more rigorous studies often used questionable measures of intelligence .
" Are the majority of autistics mentally retarded ? " Goldberg Edelson asks .
" Personally , I do n't think they are , but we do n't have the data to answer that . "
Mike Merzenich , a professor of neuroscience at UC San Francisco , says the notion that 75 percent of autistic people are mentally retarded is " incredibly wrong and destructive . "
He has worked with a number of autistic children , many of whom are nonverbal and would have been plunked into the low - functioning category .
" We label them as retarded because they can't express what they know , " and then , as they grow older , we accept that they " ca n't do much beyond sit in the back of a warehouse somewhere and stuff letters in envelopes . "
The irony is that this dearth of data persists even as autism receives an avalanche of attention .
Organizations such as Autism Speaks advocate for research and resources .
Celebrity parents like Toni Braxton , Ed Asner , and Jenny McCarthy get high - profile coverage on talk shows and TV news magazines .
Newsweeklies raise fears of an autism epidemic .
But is there an epidemic ?
There 's certainly the perception of one .
According to the Centers for Disease Control , one out of every 150 8 - year - old children ( in the areas of the US most recently studied ) has an autism spectrum disorder , a prevalence much higher than in decades past , when the rate was thought to be in the range of four or five cases per 10,000 children .
But no one knows whether this apparent explosion of cases is due to an actual rise in autism , changing diagnostic criteria , inconsistent survey techniques , or some combination of the three .
In his original paper in 1943 , Kanner wrote that while many of the children he examined " were at one time or another looked upon as feebleminded , they are all unquestionably endowed with good cognitive potentialities . "
Sixty - five years later , though , little is known about those potentialities .
As one researcher told me , " There 's no money in the field for looking at differences " in the autistic brain .
" But if you talk about trying to fix a problem — then the funding comes . "
On the outskirts of Montreal sits a brick monolith , the Hôpital Rivière - des - Prairies .
Once one of Canada 's most notorious asylums , it now has a small number of resident psychiatric patients , but most of the space has been converted into clinics and research facilities .
One of the leading researchers here is Laurent Mottron , 55 , a psychiatrist specializing in autism .
Mottron , who grew up in postwar France , had a tough childhood .
His family had a history of schizophrenia and Tourette syndrome , and he probably has what today would be diagnosed as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder .
Naturally , he went into psychiatry .
By the early ' 80s , Mottron was doing clinical work at a school in Tours that catered to children with sensory impairment , including autism .
" The view then , " Mottron says , " was that these children could be reeled back to normalcy with play therapy and work on the parents ' relationships " — a gentle way of saying that the parents , especially the mother , were to blame .
( The theory that emotionally distant " refrigerator mothers " caused autism had by then been rejected in the US , but in France and many other countries , the view lingered . )
After only a few weeks on the job , Mottron decided the theories were crap .
" These children were just of another kind , " he says .
" You could n't turn someone autistic or make someone not autistic .
It was hardwired . "
In 1986 , Mottron began working with an autistic man who would later become known in the scientific literature as " E.C. "
A draftsman who specialized in mechanical drawings , E.C. had incredible savant skills in 3 - D drawing .
He could rotate objects in his mind and make technical drawings without the need for a single revision .
After two years of working with E.C. , Mottron made his second breakthrough — not about autistics this time but about the rest of us : People with standard - issue brains — so - called neurotypicals — do n't have the perceptual abilities to do what E.C. could do .
" It 's just inconsistent with how our brains work , " Mottron says .
From that day forward , he decided to challenge the disease model underlying most autism research .
" I wanted to go as far as I could to show that their perception — their brains — are totally different . "
Not damaged .
Not dysfunctional .
Just different .
By the mid-1990s , Mottron was a faculty member at the University of Montreal , where he began publishing papers on " atypicalities of perception " in autistic subjects .
When performing certain mental tasks — especially when tapping visual , spatial , and auditory functions — autistics have shown superior performance compared with neurotypicals .
Call it the upside of autism .
Dozens of studies — Mottron 's and others — have demonstrated that people with autism spectrum disorder have a number of strengths : a higher prevalence of perfect pitch , enhanced ability with 3 - D drawing and pattern recognition , more accurate graphic recall , and various superior memory skills .
Yet most scientists who come across these skills classify them as " anomalous peaks of ability , " set them aside , and return to the questions that drive most research :
What 's wrong with the autistic brain ?
Can we find the genes responsible so that we can someday cure it ?
Is there a unifying theory of autism ?
With severe autistics , cognitive strengths are even more apt to be overlooked because these individuals have such obvious deficits and are so hard to test .
People like Baggs do n't speak , others may run out of the room , and still others might not be able to hold a pencil .
And besides , if 75 percent of them are mentally retarded , well , why bother ?
Mottron draws a parallel with homosexuality .
Until 1974 , psychiatry 's bible , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , described being gay as a mental illness .
Someday , Mottron says , we 'll look back on today 's ideas about autism with the same sense of shame that we now feel when talking about psychology 's pre-1974 views on sexuality .
" We want to break the idea that autism should definitely be suppressed , " he says .
Michelle Dawson , right , is autistic .
She 's also a researcher in the lab of Laurent Mottron ( left ) , a psychiatrist who specializes in autism .
Photo : Jessica DimmockMichelle
Dawson does n't drive or cook .
Public transit overwhelms her , and face - to - face interaction is an ordeal .
She was employed as a postal worker in 1998 when she " came out of the closet " with her diagnosis of autism , which she received in the early '90s .
After that , she claims , Canada
Post harassed her to such a degree that she was forced to take a permanent leave of absence , starting in 2002 .
( Canada Post says Dawson was treated fairly . )
To fight back , she went on an information - devouring rampage .
" There 's such a variety of human behavior .
Why is my kind wrong ? " she asks .
She eventually began scouring the libraries of McGill University in Montreal to delve into the autism literature .
She searched out journal articles using the online catalog and sat on the floor reading studies among the stacks .
Dawson , like Baggs , has become a reluctant spokesperson for this new view of autism .
Both are prolific bloggers and correspond constantly with scientists , parents ' groups , medical institutions , the courts , journalists , and anyone else who'll listen to their stories of how autistics are mistreated .
Baggs has been using YouTube to make her point ; Dawson 's weapon is science .
In 2001 , Dawson contacted Mottron , figuring that his clinic might help improve the quality of her life .
Mottron tried to give her some advice on navigating the neurotypical world , but his tips on how to handle banking , shopping , and buses did n't help .
After meeting with her a few times , Mottron began to suspect that what Dawson really needed was a sense of purpose .
In 2003 , he handed her one of his in - progress journal articles and asked her to copy - edit the grammar .
So Dawson started reading .
" I criticized his science almost immediately , " she says .
Encouraged by Dawson 's interest , Mottron sent her other papers .
She responded with written critiques of his work .
Then one day in early 2003 , she called with a question .
" I asked : How did they control for attention in that fMRI face study ? '
That caught his attention . "
Dawson had flagged an error that Mottron says most postdocs would have missed .
He was impressed , and over the next few months he sought Dawson 's input on other technical questions .
Eventually , he invited her to collaborate with his research group , despite the fact that her only academic credential was a high school diploma .
Dawson has an incredible memory , but she 's not a savant .
What makes her unique , Mottron says , is her gift for scientific analysis — the way she can sniff through methodologies and statistical manipulation , hunting down tiny errors and weak links in logic .
Last summer , the peer - reviewed journal Psychological Science published a study titled " The Level and Nature of Autistic Intelligence . "
The lead author was Michelle Dawson .
The paper argues that autistic smarts have been underestimated because the tools for assessing intelligence depend on techniques ill - suited to autistics .
The researchers administered two different intelligence tests to 51 children and adults diagnosed with autism and to 43 non-autistic children and adults .
The first test , known as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale , has helped solidify the notion of peaks of ability amid otherwise pervasive mental retardation among autistics .
The other test is Raven 's Progressive Matrices , which requires neither a race against the clock nor a proctor breathing down your neck .
The Raven is considered as reliable as the Wechsler , but the Wechsler is far more commonly used .
Perhaps that 's because it requires less effort for the average test taker .
Raven measures abstract reasoning — " effortful " operations like spotting patterns or solving geometric puzzles .
In contrast , much of the Wechsler assesses crystallized skills like acquired vocabulary , making correct change , or knowing that milk goes in the fridge and cereal in the cupboard — learned information that most people intuit or recall almost automatically .
What the researchers found was that while non-autistic subjects scored just about the same — a little above average — on both tests , the autistic group scored much better on the Raven .
Two individuals ' scores swung from the mentally retarded range to the 94th percentile .
More significantly , the subset of autistic children in the study scored roughly 30 percentile points higher on the Raven than they did on the more language - dependent Wechsler , pulling all but a couple of them out of the range for mental retardation .
A number of scientists shrugged off the results — of course autistics would do better on nonverbal tests .
But Dawson and her coauthors saw something more .
The " peaks of ability " on the Wechsler correlated strongly with the average scores on the Raven .
The finding suggests the Wechsler scores give only a glimpse of the autistics ' intelligence , whereas the Raven — the gold standard of fluid intelligence testing — reveals the true , or at least truer , level of general intelligence .
Yet to a remarkable degree , scientists conducting cognitive evaluations continue to use tests which presume that people who can't communicate the answer do n't know the answer .
The question is : Why ?
Greg Allen , an assistant professor of psychiatry at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , says that although most researchers know the Wechsler does n't provide a good assessment of people with autism , there 's pressure to use the test anyway .
" Say you 're submitting a grant to study autistic people by comparing them to a control group , " he says .
" The first question that comes up is : Did you control for IQ ?
Matching people on IQ is meant to clean up the methodology , but I think it can also end up damaging the study . "
And that hurts autistic people , Dawson says .
She makes a comparison with blindness .
Of course blind people have a disability and need special accommodation .
But you would n't give a blind person a test heavily dependent on vision and interpret their poor score as an accurate measure of intelligence .
Mottron is unequivocal : Because of recent research , especially the Raven paper , it 's clearer than ever that so - called low - functioning people like Amanda Baggs are more intelligent than once presumed .
The Dawson paper was hardly conclusive , but it generated buzz among scientists and the media .
Mottron 's team is now collaborating with Massachusetts General Hospital 's Zeffiro , a neuroimaging expert , to dig deeper .
Zeffiro and company are looking for variable types of mental processing without asking , what 's wrong with this brain ?
Their first study compares fMRI results from autistic and control subjects whose brains were imaged while they performed the Raven test .
The group is currently crunching numbers for publication , and the study looks both perplexing and promising .
Surprisingly , they did n't find any variability in which parts of the brain lit up when subjects performed the tasks .
" We thought we 'd see different patterns of activation , " Zeffiro says , " but it looks like the similarities outweigh the dissimilarities . "
When they examined participants '
Raven scores together with response times , however , they noticed something odd .
The two groups had the same error rates , but as an aggregate , the autistics completed the tasks 40 percent faster than the non-autistics .
" They spent less time coming up with the same number of right answers .
The only explanation we can see right now , " Zeffiro says , is that autistic brains working on this set of tasks " seem to be engaged at a higher level of efficiency . "
That may have to do with greater connectivity within an area or areas of the brain .
He and other researchers are already exploring this hypothesis using diffusion tensor imaging , which measures the density of brain wiring .
But critics of the difference model reject the whole idea that autism is merely another example of neuro - diversity .
After all , being able to plan your meals for the week or ask for directions bespeak important forms of intelligence .
" If you pretend the areas that are troubled are n't there , you miss important aspects of the person , " says Fred Volkmar , director of Yale 's Child Study Center .
In the vast majority of journal articles , autism is referred to as a disorder , and the majority of neuro - psychiatric experts will tell you that the description fits — something is wrong with the autistic brain .
UCSF 's Merzenich , who agrees that conventional intelligence - testing tools are misleading , still does n't think the difference model makes sense .
Many autistics are probably smarter than we think , he says .
But there 's little question that more severe autism is characterized by what Merzenich terms " grossly abnormal " brain development that can lead to a " catastrophic end state . "
Denying this reality , he says , is misguided .
Yale 's Volkmar likens it to telling a physically disabled person : " You do n't need a wheelchair .
Walk ! "
Meanwhile parents , educators , and autism advocates worry that focusing on the latent abilities and intelligence of autistic people may eventually lead to cuts in funding both for research into a cure and services provided by government .
As one mother of an autistic boy told me , " There 's no question that my son needs treatment and a cure . "
Back in Burlington , Baggs is cueing up another YouTube clip .
She angles her computer screen so I can see it .
Set to the soundtrack of Queen 's " Under Pressure , " it 's a montage of close - up videos showing behaviors like pen clicking , thumb twiddling , and finger tapping .
The message :
Why are some stress - related behaviors socially permissible , while others — like the rocking bodies and flapping arms commonly associated with autism — are not ?
Hit count for the video at last check : 80,000 and climbing .
Should autism be treated ?
Yes , says Baggs , it should be treated with respect .
" People are n't interested in us functioning with the brains we have , " she says , because autism is considered to be outside the range of normal variability .
" I do n't fit the stereotype of autism .
But who does ? " she asks , hammering especially hard on the keyboard .
" The definition of autism is so fluid and changing every few years . "
What 's exciting , she says , is that Mottron and other scientists have " found universal strengths where others usually look for universal deficits . "
Neuro - cognitive science , she says , is finally catching up to what she and many other adults with autism have been saying all along .
Baggs is working on some new videos .
One project is tentatively titled " Am I a Person Yet ? "
She 'll explore communication , empathy , self - reflection — core elements of the human experience that have at times been used to define personhood itself .
And at various points during the clip , she 'll ask : " Am I a person yet ? "
It 's a provocative idea , and you might find yourself thinking :
She has a point .

Help wanted for HR firm
A CEO and rodeo queen
King of the mountain bike
( FORTUNE Small Business ) -- Dear FSB : One of my employees is pretty capable , but she lacks people skills .
No one in the office likes dealing with her .
Recently she called me at home at 9 P.M. on a Friday , crying and saying she was typing up her r�sum� because the entire staff was against her .
I listened , and then hinted that it was n't the time or place to discuss this .
Now office tension is high .
Can I tell this woman that , because she said she was updating her r�sum� , I assume she 's given notice ?
- Joanna , Portsmouth , N.H .
Dear Joanna : Not quite .
" Sending out r�sum�s is not legally the same as saying , ' I quit , ' " says Stephen Sonnenberg , an employment lawyer at Paul Hastings Janofsky & Walker in New York City .
Yet an employee who reveals that she is job hunting " has surely opened the door to a talk , " he adds .
" You have a right to ask whether she plans to leave and , if so , when . "
You do n't say you have cause to fire her , but it 's fine to call her bluff .
Often employers tiptoe around problem employees because of vague fears of violating the Americans With Disabilities Act ( which protects workers with mental illnesses ) .
A staffer may be emotionally unstable or paranoid , but unless she 's been diagnosed with a mental disability , the ADA does n't apply .
And , says Sonnenberg , you have a right to set employee rules - such as no calls at home after 7 P.M. unless the office is ablaze - as long as you apply them consistently .
In cases where workers have been let go for being unruly , hostile , or simply awful to work with , Sonnenberg notes , " the courts have held that employers need not tolerate misconduct on the job .
Personality traits , such as an inability to work with others , are unprotected by law . "
The other day I wrote about the disparity of wealth in this nation of ours .
The old maxim “ The rich get richer , while the poor get poorer has never been as true as today .
The ink is n’t even dry on that article , so to speak , and the Office of The Budget is again cutting programs for low income citizens and implementing a program to make Veterans pay for their medical care .
The Budget Director also wants to do away with the Estate Tax and give tax cuts to the wealthy .
I received a transcript of a debate between Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Budget Director Jim Nussel .
This should be a must read for every American that thinks that talk of a “ Class War ” is just rhetoric .
Here it is ;
The following transcript of February 5 ’s Senate Hearing inquiry and response between Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and the White House Office of Management & Budget Director Jim Nussel should be sent to every qualified voter in America .
http://c-span.org/VideoArchives.asp?CatCodePairs=,&ArchiveDays=100&Page=7
The above sited exchange commences at the 43.09 mark on the progress bar .
Prefatory Remarks :
Remark 1 :
The United States government works on an October 1 through September 30 fiscal year .
The current 2008 budget was submitted and approved in early 2007 .
The budget presented , constitutionally first to the House of Representatives , then to the Senate , is for 2009 , to take effect October 1 this year .
Remark 2 :
In testimony before the Budget Committee , not transcribed here , Director Nussel , under hostile questioning , acknowledged : A. ) the submitted budget proposes only $ 70 billion for the combined wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , B. ) that the president ’s proposals are neither fact - nor experience based , C. ) that the cost of current combat operations approximate $ 85 billion per year , D ) the president ’s budget forecast for 2010 operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are ZERO DOLLARS !
Remark 3 :
The president ’s budget effectively would cut veterans VA medical benefits by requiring most current recipients to pay an up front fee for medical services .

An updated version of this graph is here .
Income inequality in the United States has been rising since the 1970s .
What is the most effective way to succinctly convey this fact ?
Here is my choice ( a pdf version is available here ) :
The chart shows average inflation - adjusted incomes of the poorest 20 % , middle 60 % , and top 1 % of households since the 1970s .
The incomes include government transfers and subtract taxes .
For the bulk of American households , incomes have increased moderately or minimally .
For those at the top , by contrast , they have soared .
Why This Chart ?
Here are what I think should be the principal considerations .
Some are obvious , others perhaps not .
1 . Tell the substantive story clearly .
The graph does a good job of conveying the two key aspects of the rise in income inequality over the past generation .
One is the dramatic increase in incomes for households at the very top .
In 1979 household income among those in the top 1 % averaged $ 325,000 ( in 2005 dollars ) .
By 2005 that had increased to nearly $ 1.1 million .
The other is stagnation at the bottom and modest growth in the middle .
Among the poorest 20 % of households , average income was $ 14,500 in 1979 and $ 15,500 in 2005 .
Among the middle 60 % of households , average income rose from $ 42,000 to $ 51,000 .
2 . Use the best available data .
There are various sources of income data , including the annual Current Population Survey ( CPS ) , the decennial census , IRS income tax records , and others .
The data used in this chart are from the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , which has merged tax records with the Current Population Survey .
They ’re available here .
Tax records are incomplete , because many low - income citizens do not file tax returns .
But they have the advantage of providing relatively good data on those with high incomes .
The CPS data are from interviews of 50,000 or so households .
They are more representative of the population .
But for various reasons the CPS data are not as good for those at the top of the income distribution .
Also , the CPS data are for pretax income .
The CBO data arguably combine the best features of these two sources .
The main disadvantage of the CBO data is that they begin in 1979 .
It ’s thus not possible to see the contrast with earlier periods .
I say more about this below .
3 . Show incomes , rather than a summary inequality measure .
Common inequality measures include the Gini coefficient , percentile ratios ( e.g. , P90 / P50 and P50 / P10 ) , and income shares ( e.g. , the income share of the top 1 % ) .
They are quite useful .
Nice examples from the Economic Policy Institute ’s The State of Working America are here , here , and here .
But they have two drawbacks .
One applies to the Gini index , which is the most commonly - used inequality statistic .
It does n’t identify where in the income distribution the rise in inequality has occurred .
For example , suppose the Gini rises over time .
Is that because those at the top have pulled farther away from everyone else ?
Because those at the bottom have fallen behind ?
Because of a widening spread in the middle ?
All three ?
Something else ?
To address this problem analysts often turn to percentile ratio or income share measures .
These , however , fail to provide information about trends in actual incomes .
Suppose , for example , that the 90/50 ratio increases over time .
Is that because the incomes of those at the top have risen faster than the incomes of those in the middle ?
Because incomes at the top have risen while those in the middle have been stagnant ?
Because both have decreased but those at the top have done so less rapidly ?
Something else ?
Showing trends in actual incomes — adjusted for inflation , of course — overcomes these problems .
A potential drawback of doing so is that it may not be obvious from the raw income data whether or not inequality has increased , or by how much .
If the magnitude of the rise in inequality is small , it may be preferable to use an inequality measure .
For the United States over the past generation , however , the increase in inequality is easy to spot from data on incomes .
4 . Show income levels , rather than growth rates .
A common and helpful inequality graph is a bar chart showing rates of growth of real incomes during different periods for households at various points in the income distribution .
See here for an example .
This gives a good sense of the magnitude of the change in inequality , but it does n’t convey anything about the magnitude of the level of inequality .
5 . Show the full trend , rather than snippets or period averages .
A frequent choice is to show the level of inequality in selected years , or averaged over groups of years ( e.g. , business cycles ) .
That ’s fine in many instances , but when there is relative stability within periods it is usually preferable to show all data points .
A Helpful Supplement
The chief limitation of the above graph is that it does n’t fully convey what has happened at the bottom of the distribution since the 1970s .
It is clear from the chart that incomes for those in the top 1 % have jumped dramatically and that incomes for much of the bottom half of the distribution have been stagnant .
But the latter aspect is not highlighted to the degree it could be .
Here is a second chart that helps to flesh out this point :
This chart shows trends in real incomes for families at the 20th , 40th , 60th , 80th , and 95th percentiles of the income distribution .
In order to go back to the 1940s we have to accept two data limitations : the income data , from the CPS , are pretax ; and the units are families rather than households , so adults living alone are not included .
These data are available here .
Between the late 1940s and the mid-1970s incomes increased at roughly the same pace throughout the distribution ; they doubled for each group .
Since the 1970s the story has been quite different .
At the 95th percentile , incomes have continued to rise .
At the upper - middle levels ( the 80th and 60th percentiles ) , they ’ve increased at a moderate pace .
In the bottom half of the distribution ( the 40th and 20th percentiles ) , they ’ve been fairly stagnant .
This chart makes it clearer that a defining feature of rising inequality in the United States is the stagnation of incomes in the lower half of the distribution .
Even at the 95th percentile , where incomes have increased appreciably since the 1970s , the rate of growth did not accelerate relative to earlier years ; the average growth rate of family income at the 95th percentile was 1.5 % per year between 1979 and 2005 , compared to 2.4 % per year between 1947 and 1979 .
Other Nominations ?
If you ’ve seen an inequality graph that is as good or better , please let me know .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - India 's Tata Motors Ltd TAMO .BO has signed a deal to receive a $ 3 billion one - year bridge loan from Citigroup C.N and JPMorgan JPM.N to help finance a potential purchase of luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover , sources familiar with the deal said on Tuesday .
A combo of pictures shows the logos of carmakers Tata Motors of India ( L ) , Jaguar ( top R ) and Land Rover ( bottom R ) during the first media day of the 78th Geneva Car Show March 4 , 2008 .

“ It is signed , but it ’s still at an early process , ” said one of the sources , who was not authorized to speak to the media .
A separate source briefed on the deal later said the loan would be for one year .
Citigroup , JPMorgan and Tata Motors all declined to comment .
Tata is expected to agree on a deal by the end of the month to purchase the two well - known UK brands from U.S. auto maker Ford Motor F.N , according to media reports in India .
The Indian firm could raise up to $ 4 billion on domestic and overseas debt markets , based on its previous announcements and media reports .
Tata is believed also to need money to help pay for the manufacturing of the world ’s cheapest car , the Nano , that it will launch in the second half of the year .
But Tata will face a tough debt market environment , as a global financial crisis has raised the premiums demanded by investors , especially from riskier Asian issuers .
Standard & Poor ’s placed Tata Motors on review for a possible downgrade in January from its current high - yield “ BB + ” rating , citing the potential increase in its debt load from the acquisition of the venerable Jaguar and Land Rover brands .
Investors have also worried about the amount of leveraged loans held by U.S. lenders , which had in previous years helped to finance a boom in mergers and acquisitions by lending the money to acquirers and then selling off the loans to other investors .
Investors are eagerly awaiting quarterly earnings results from U.S. financial firms , including Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Goldman Sachs GS.N later on Tuesday , for further clues about soured debt holdings in the sector .
JPMorgan on Sunday announced it would buy stricken Bear Stearns BSC.N for only $ 2 a share , valuing the U.S. investment bank at about $ 236 million in a bailout that had received partial backing from the Federal Reserve .
The late - fall night fairly crackled with energy -- from a persistent Santa Ana wind , the high - tension power lines overhead and , especially , from the crowd packed inside the living room of a ranch house at the west end of the San Gabriel Valley .
Eighty people sat elbow to elbow on tight rows of folding chairs , chattering with enthusiasm and ideas .
They would produce wall calendars and a concert .
They would reenact the Boston Tea Party on the Santa Monica Pier .
They would write to every independent voter in Iowa .
The foot soldiers of the Ron Paul Revolution , Pasadena Division , were only getting started .
Founded nine months ago by one of the first followers of the Texas congressman and Republican presidential candidate , the Pasadena “ meetup ” spawned more than 1,200 similar groups that claim nearly 77,000 members nationwide .

These fervent supporters and their freewheeling tactics have helped turn Paul into , first , an Internet sensation and , now , this political season ’s most unlikely phenomenon .
A 45 - year - old artist and adventurer is bicycling from Santa Monica to the Jefferson Memorial in Washington to raise awareness about Paul .
A Nevada brothel owner recently promised to take up a collection from her customers .
One Colorado backer quickly raised more than $ 350,000 online this week , with a plan to launch a Ron Paul blimp .
“ It ’s bigger than one .
It ’s bigger than a group , ” Juliet Annerino , a Silver Lake fitness trainer and singer , said at the recent gathering of the Pasadena group .
“ We are making history right now .
Right here . ”
Paulites tend to be tech - savvy , tired of traditional politics and suspicious of their government and the mainstream media .

But after that , they defy categories .
A quick survey of the Pasadena group found Democrats , Republicans , Libertarians and Constitution Party followers uniting behind some or all of the Paul libertarian agenda -- ending the war in Iraq , abolishing gun control laws , legalizing marijuana and dismantling big hunks of the U.S. government , especially the IRS and Federal Reserve system .
“ I think you could build a case that Ron Paul is part of a tradition of those unhappy with the iron grip of the status quo , from Ross Perot to Ralph Nader right back to Teddy Roosevelt and the Bull Moose Party , ” said Bruce Buchanan , a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin .
“ What they all have in common is a freedom from the normal tendencies toward caution and equivocation . ”
National polls and most political analysts still make Paul a long shot , though he recently climbed into fourth place ( with 8 % ) in three surveys in the early primary state of New Hampshire .
His biggest splash before that came Nov. 5 , when an online effort ( in web - speak , a “ money bomb ” ) brought in $ 4.2 million , one of the largest single - day hauls in the history of political fundraising .

For months , the one - time obstetrician - gynecologist and Air Force flight surgeon had been a growing phenomenon on the Internet ; his YouTube videos and website ( www.ronpaul2008.com) had become more popular than any other presidential candidate ’s , Republican or Democratic .
Those were heady achievements for a campaign that did not exist until January , when a handful of Paul enthusiasts -- two of whom met while promoting a documentary on the government ’s failure to search for POWs allegedly still held in Southeast Asia -- came together in Hollywood .
Over two days in a suite at a Comfort Inn , the organizers mapped out the rudiments of Paul ’s website .
“ Nothing was going fast enough for people , ” said Bill Dumas , who participated in the early strategy sessions .
“ They were really excited and wanted more ways to participate . ”
In particular , the Paulites wanted to organize and meet with each other .
Believing it would take too long to create an organization , Dumas signed on with the social networking site Meetup.com .

He formed the Pasadena group for Ron Paul 2008 in March and put a link on Paul ’s website to help others start meetup groups .
“ It was quickly just bombarded , ” said Dumas , 51 .
“ People began starting their own meetups all over the country . ”
Paul said in a recent television appearance that even he was surprised by the fervent response .
“ We are tapping into this sense of frustration , ” he said .
At the recent Pasadena meeting -- held at the La Canada Flintridge home of Bill Johnson , an international corporate lawyer -- two young men described their plan to send hand - written letters to Iowa ’s 700,000 independent voters , urging them to register Republican and turn out for Paul at the Jan. 3 caucuses .
Annerino talked about two fundraisers she had on the drawing board -- a “ Rock for Ron Paul ” concert Jan. 17 in Hollywood and a “ Hotties for Ron Paul ” 2008 wall calendar .

Yoga teacher Steven Vincent , 42 , finished a brisk series of announcements about his many initiatives for Paul ( including video webcasts he delivers each weekday from his Studio City living room at ronpaulfreedommessage.com ) with the coup de grace : a march on Dec. 16 , the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party .
Vincent beamed as he envisioned a procession through Santa Monica , with participants toting mock tea crates , labeled “ welfare state , ” “ IRS ” and such .
( The event will coincide with another Paul money bomb , which volunteers hope will raise $ 10 million online in a single day . )
He said the procession would continue to the end of the Santa Monica Pier , where the symbols of government excess would be dumped into the bay -- and immediately hauled out to prevent any pollution .
Vincent told the gathering : “ It will be a great visual event . ”
Insurgent campaigns rely on such bursts of creativity to keep enthusiasm high , said Zephyr Teachout , director of online organizing for Howard Dean , the Vermont governor whose Internet fundraising helped him leap to the front of the 2004 Democratic primary field .

“ If you want people to do more , you have to break the stamp - licker paradigm , ” said Teachout , meaning that volunteers should be allowed to do more than get out the mail .
Unlike Dean , who had five organizers shepherd meetup groups with agendas and regular conference calls , the Paul chapters are “ completely decentralized , ” according to Kerri Price , a Paul spokeswoman .
Paul volunteers take pride in making their own rules .
“ Authority , ” said one young man at the start of the Pasadena meetup , “ will never be true . ”
Paulites also do n’t hesitate to criticize the candidate ’s small professional campaign staff , as evidenced last week when many followers flamed fundraising director Jonathan Bydlak .
The protesters , calling Bydlak an “ idiot , ” among other things , said his demand for immediate contributions would steal attention from the Tea Party event .

Given the cacophonous voices gathered under the Paul tent , at least a little dissension should hardly be surprising .
At the recent gathering in La Canada Flintridge , Paul activists described voting in the past for candidates ranging from President Bush and Democratic Sen. John F. Kerry , to Ralph Nader , Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot .
Yoga teacher Vincent , 42 , was not the only one who said he had been too disillusioned to ever vote before : “ What ’s happening right now is a paradigm shift in American politics .
These divisions -- Democrat - Republican , conservative - liberal -- are breaking down . . . because there is really no distinction any more between the parties . ”
Even as they have gained momentum and attention , Paul supporters still believe they are a breed apart .
They talk openly about how some outsiders see them -- as obsessed and perhaps a little loopy .
“ How many of you wear tinfoil hats and dance the macarena ? ” co-host Don Mooney asked at the start of the recent Pasadena meetup .
The crowd laughed .
Bryce Shonka quipped that the letters to Iowa independents might include this line : “ I ’m a normal American .
I ’m not a fringe - er . ”
Most of the 20 Paul followers interviewed over the course of a week hewed to the candidate ’s limited - government themes .
But others described Paul as the antidote to alleged conspiracies that ranged from aerial spraying of toxic “ chemtrails , ” to the coverup of the true source of the Sept.
11 World Trade Center implosions to a plan to force America into a single world government .

Columnist Mona Charen recently argued that , though Paul has not directly supported such theories , he had not done enough to defuse his “ conspiracy - minded fans . ”
She is one of many journalists who has been bombarded with e-mails , sometimes angry and profane , after writing critically about the candidate .
Paul supporters said in interviews they did n’t condone harsh tactics , but some in their camp had become bitter because of the short shrift they said the mainstream media had given their candidate .
The Paulites remain stalwart .
If their candidate does n’t win the Republican nomination , many are determined to push a third - party run , even though Paul has said he does n’t welcome it .
They feel they ’ve already beaten the conventional wisdom and those who would belittle them .
Vincent concludes e-mails with a line from Mahatma Gandhi : “ First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , then you win . ”

Mr. Shogren said advisers were trying to improve relations between police officers and justice officials .
He said police officers routinely disobeyed court orders to release prisoners from station jails or to provide security for investigative judges .
Iraq ’s investigative judges are fashioned after the French legal model , in which the functions of detective , prosecutor and judge overlap .
“ Sometimes judicial investigators complain that police will not escort them , will not provide security , will not cooperate with them , ” Mr. Shogren said .
“ And the Iraqi police , on the other hand , say that judicial investigators are just too afraid or lazy to go out and work the scene . ”
The inability of law enforcement officials to investigate crimes in a timely manner is among the main reasons that Iraq ’s prisons hold so many people without trial , Mr. Shogren said .
Mike Pannek , the program manager of the Iraq Corrections Program , a Justice Department program , said Justice Ministry prisons were filled beyond their capacity .
One of the government ’s largest prisons is a temporary installation at the Rusafa legal complex in Baghdad .
Mr. Pannek said that nearly all of the 6,647 detainees at Rusafa had been captured since the American force was increased early last year , and that 6,079 of them had not been found guilty of any crime .
Thousands more prisoners are held by other agencies , despite findings in 2006 that such disparate detainee systems hindered oversight and led to human rights abuses .
In 2006 , American troops determined that several Interior Ministry jails were being used by Shiite militias to torture and execute Sunni prisoners .
Interior Ministry officials promised to transfer all their prisoners to Justice Ministry facilities .
But Mr. Pannek said that both the Interior and Defense Ministries held significant numbers of detainees , and that the numbers had grown .
Mr. Pannek estimated that Iraq needed space for 50,000 prisoners , and said there were plans to provide about 20,000 more prison beds over the next year .
It 's remarkable , when you think about it .
In New York , Mr. Spitzer was tarred , feathered , driven out of office , and now nearly forgotten .
Yet Louisiana's , Senatorial Pimp , David " Eliot Spitzer " Vitter , is still in office .
Fortunately , the recent attention given Mr. Spitzer has renewed interest in Mr. Vitter 's case .
A quick recap : Vitter 's number was found in the records of the " DC Madam " and locally , he plied his tiny cock frequently in the French Quarters at $ 300 an hour .
It all came out .
Thanks ,
Larry !
After hiding out in his house for a week , Vitter made a short statement with his wife by his side , refused to take questions , and since then , his official line has been that " he has addressed this matter " already when of course , he has n't said a damn thing .
But people have n't forgotten .
Searching for the truth is a powerful instinct , and Vitter was forced to respond recently during a telephone conference call .
( Vitter has resorted to these " telephone conference meetings " as he has cut back his public appearances to safe redneck districts . )
A caller asked about the Vitter / Spitzer comparison ; Vitter claimed there was " an enormous difference " between himself and Spitzer .
One could make endless comparisons of the specifics , in terms of who did what , where ; how much they paid , or what laws were allegedly violated .
These are the usual sort of technicalities offered in Vitter 's defense .
To any rational observer , it seems there are more similarities then differences .
The key similarity , of course , is that both men took strong positions in public , then did something else in private .
If there is an enormous difference ; the one that comes to mind immediately is that Mr. Spitzer had the courage and the class to recognize the hypocrisy in his actions and step down , while Mr. Vitter has not .
That 's an enormous difference that is n't very flattering to Mr. Vitter .
The search for the truth is a powerful instinct , so I called Vitter 's office .
Young Jean - Paul Perrier , the lowly Vitter staffer charged with the thankless task of answering the phones , was a bit overwhelmed .
During our conversation , he had to repeatedly put me on hold while other calls came in .
" A lot of people have been calling about this , " he admitted .
Perrier admitted that the " illegal activities were similar " and suggested that the amount of money paid might be one difference .
Oh , I see .
So since Vitty spent , what , $ 20,000 , it 's a wrist - slap offense ?
Of course , I made that number up .
Mr. Vitter is urged to correct the record .
( Please , call 202-224-4623 and ask how much Vitter spent .
Be as nice as possible ; do n't abuse his poor little puppies . )
Jean - Paul complained that " a lot of people saw this as an opportunity to resurface the issue for political reasons " and went on to whine that most of the people calling were from out of state .
It seems that people from New York and California were so worked up on the issue that they were ringing Vitter 's phones off the hook and making obscene and abusive comments about him .
Oh , the horror .
Perrier suggested that the ongoing rebuilding in Louisiana was a far more important issue , and tried to steer the conversation towards Mr. Vitter 's " leadership " on such issues .
But when I asked how anyone could take Mr. Vitter seriously as a leader when he had n't demonstrated any leadership in addressing his dalliances , Perrier had no substantive answer .
" Times have changed , " he suggested .
" Everything 's changed dramatically . "
Perrier reverted to a familiar GOP trope , making vague suggestions that the media had pushed sex to the forefront and hence shared the blame .
He did agree that what Mr. Vitter did was " definitely wrong .
" But when I tried to get more definitive answers , asking who could answer my questions , Perrier backed off , saying at first that no one was available .
He asked around the office , audibly laughing , trying to find someone " who can talk to this guy . "
Apparently , Vitter 's staffers view any serious inquiry into his whoring as a joke .
Then " Susan " came on the line .
I read her the quote from the article .
What were these " enormous differences ? "
" I 'm not going to answer that , " Susan snippily remarked .
" How do you feel about it ? " I asked her .
She continued to stonewall , and referred me to Vitter 's press secretary , Joel DiGrado -- joel_digrado@vitter.senate.gov

( CNN ) --
As the Olympic torch makes its way westward through London , Paris and San Francisco on its way to Beijing , it has been attracting well - financed , organized protests representing various single - issue groups that normally do not even work together .
L. Ling -chi Wang : " Humility and compassion , not hypocrisy and self - righteousness , is what is needed . "
Among these groups are various factions of the Free Tibet movement , the groups against genocide in Darfur , global warming , Burma 's military dictatorship , job loss in the U.S. , and such diverse groups as the Falun Gong and Taiwan independence activists .
The Beijing Olympics is a godsend for these groups because it affords them the opportunity to disrupt the torch relay .
The media , as usual , have seized the opportunity to pour fuel onto the fire .
Politicians are tripping over each other in their eagerness to condemn China , to call for boycotts , and to claim the high moral ground , even though the United States has been treated as a rogue state worldwide because of our invasion of Iraq , and our unlawful detention , torture , rendition , etc .
Sadly , most Americans know little about international issues and for that matter , China , as demonstrated by the conspicuous absence of information regarding historical context and complexity .
Instead , the media , politicians and organized groups prefer to use only sound bites and , frequently , disinformation to perpetuate ignorance , instill fear , and incite racial hostility , or worse , hatred toward China .
What they do know is this :
Just about everything they use and wear daily comes from China .
Even the new section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge is being made in Shanghai .
What they also do n't know is how Chinese in China are viewing and preparing for the Olympics in August .
Not since the 10 - year nightmare of the Cultural Revolution have the Chinese been more dedicated to and collectively mobilized for a national project : to host the first Olympics in China .
This project aspires to engage the world and to incentivize further reform in China .
More than 200 million Chinese , for example , are learning English and the torch relay will be greeted by all China 's provinces and major cities before reaching Beijing .
China , like many countries in the world , including the U.S. , has problems .
It has much to learn from the rest of the world .
For example , China has yet to learn how to understand and treat its minorities -- such as Tibetans , Uighurs , Muslims , Hmongs -- as equals .
In this respect , they are not that different from us .
We are still learning how to treat minorities such as Native Americans , African - Americans , Latinos , Chinese - Americans and others as equals .
Humility and compassion , not hypocrisy and self - righteousness , is what is needed .
I am not opposed to free speech and legitimate protests against China 's wrongdoings .
However , I am opposed to using the Olympics to demonize China and its people and disruptive , confrontational , and violent tactics .
Such actions have the effect of desecrating the Olympics and humiliating and insulting the people of China .
No good can come of them .
Protests and confrontations along the torch route may even incite Chinese xenophobia and nationalism and result in decisions to retreat from its increased openness to and engagement with the West .
If this should happen , it will be a major setback for the 1.3 billion people in China and for world peace and prosperity .

VANCOUVER , British Columbia --
The best American and Canadian table - tennis players squared off here last weekend for a chance to represent their country this summer at the Beijing Olympics .
Only one of the eight American players was of non-Asian descent .
All but three were born in China .
Six of the eight Canadians also here vying for Olympic berths were either born in China or of Chinese descent .
China 's superpower status in table tennis has created a prickly problem for the sport : Nearly all the world 's most competitive players are Chinese .
And that has made for a lot of mixed feelings .
Dear AWS Developers ,
We are pleased to announce two significant new features - Elastic IP Addresses and Availability Zones - which help you to run reliable web sites and other applications within Amazon EC2 .
Additionally , this release adds the ability to choose between a set of pre-configured Amazon EC2 kernels .
Elastic IP Addresses are static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing , and now make it easy to host web sites , web services and other online applications in Amazon EC2 .
Elastic IP addresses are associated with your AWS account , not with your instances , and can be programmatically mapped to any of your instances .
This allows you to easily recover from instance and other failures while presenting your users with a static IP address .
Availability Zones give you the ability to easily and inexpensively operate a highly available internet application .
Each Amazon EC2 Availability
Zone is a distinct location that is engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones .
Previously , only very large companies had the scale to be able to distribute an application across multiple locations , but now it is as easy as changing a parameter in an API call .
You can choose to run your application across multiple Availability Zones to be prepared for unexpected events such as power failures or network connectivity issues , or you can place instances in the same Availability Zone to take advantage of free data transfer and the lowest latency communication .
With these two new features , it is now easier than ever for you to isolate your application from common failure scenarios and host high availability web sites in Amazon EC2 .
In addition to these two features , this release adds the ability to configure and override the kernel with which your instance is launched .
We have added a number of new Amazon provided AMIs and kernels for you to use .
You can see these by downloading the new APIs or tools and using the describe images API .
There are also descriptions of the new kernels and AMIs in the Resource Center .

This is the story that I would have told last night at The Moth for the theme “ Making Peace . ”
I do n’t think I ’ve run it here before .
Any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated .
I ’d been dating this girl who was confident and cool with beautiful tattoos , so gorgeous she ’d make a whole room turn and feel ugly whenever she walked in the door .
I ’d just lost a pile of weight and was giddy with the sudden attention — giddy enough to miss the warning signs and get my newly narrowed ass dumped in about three weeks .
I had no idea why , did n’t see it coming at all .
I lived in tired little termite buffet painted the color of dingy Band - Aids .
A small community of grizzled vagrants in electric wheelchairs would commune around a trash fire in the alley behind my house most afternoons , drinking Thunderbird .
Sometime around twilight most nights , one guy with a blurry swastika tattooed on his forehead would rev up out into the road , barreling upstream against one - way traffic .
I had decorated the interior of the place myself — carpeted the entire house in Astroturf , green for the living room , the stairs , and upstairs hallway , my bedroom in neon blue with a giant American flag for a bedspread .
Waking up each morning was like a Lego funeral at sea .
All the furniture in the downstairs was inflatable — a couch and two easy chairs .
There was a sculpture on the front porch that I ’d made myself out of several deer carcasses and a giant head covered in glowing white war paint .
In hindsight , I may have been dumped for aesthetic reasons .
Richmond , Virginia is a small town , even smaller if you hate hippies AND the Dave Matthews Band .
There is n’t but one or two awesome things to go out and do each month , and I kept seeing her at bars , rock shows , art openings , whatever — usually accompanied by her new boyfriend .
It was embarrassing , and more than a little awkward .
She asked me one time “ are you , like , following us around ? ”
I was n’t .
Not intentionally , anyway .
A vandal took a knife to her motorcycle seat one night after we ’d awkwardly crossed paths at a bar .
She e-mailed me the next day to ask if I ’d done it .
It was embarrassing and painful to think I came across as the kind of guy that operates that way .
I mean , getting dumped sucked .
And seeing tangible evidence that she ’d moved on to some dude who , had the scene been different , I ’d have probably been friends with — that sucked more .
But what really bugged me the most was being thought of as some kind of common creep , some low - grade weirdo .
I stopped going out so much .
Seeing her around kept picking my scabbed heart open , and what should have been a minor injury was going to get gangrenous if I did n’t just lie low .
I stayed in a lot over the winter — listened to a lot of records , learned to play the drums , wrote a lot of highly regrettable poetry .
Spring came around – ending my social hibernation and thawing my mood .
My roommate and I threw a party to celebrate .
We mopped up the Astroturf and got a real couch , and I e-mailed an invite to everyone I knew , and against my better judgment , included her on the list .
The party was the kind you can only throw if you are in your 20s , underemployed and living in the ghetto .
A few of our neighbors brought a cooler of fresh oysters down from the Eastern Shore , got liquored up and started hooting and shooting their potato cannons out into the night .
I was just flipping over the Rick James record on the turntable when I heard screaming from out on the sidewalk .
Suddenly she burst into the room , this girl of the strange breakup and grabbed me by both shoulders , saying “ Hey — you got to get out here and put a STOP to this ! ”
I was kind of stunned , but ran outside .
A man sat on my curb , feet in the street , swaying and drinking from a tall can of Old English , with a box of more cans next to him .
Someone shouted “ OH SHIT , it ’s coming back ! ” and pointed up the street .
I looked , to see a monstrous pit bull galloping down the street , full - tilt .
I remember thinking that it looked just like one of those things from “ Ghostbusters ” as it leapt , soaring through the air and shoulder - checking the man with the OE cans , sending him flat and the cans scattering .
The dog then grabbed a can in its jaws and bit down hard , puncturing the can and shaking it like a baby — which sent streams of malt liquor shooting out of the holes around its fangs and straight down the monster ’s throat .
It spat the mostly - empty can out into the street , covered in drool and malt liquor and wagged its tail , happily burping .
The man picked himself up and yelled “ motherfucker , what did I JUST TELL YOU , ” and grabbed the dog by its neck and belly , clean - and - jerked it and threw the thing like a soccer ball as far as he could .
It hit the pavement and skidded , snarling and growling and ran straight for him , knocked him down again and grabbed another can .
This cycle had been iterating for a little while .
It was my house and I had to stop this thing , but I had no idea what to do .
I picked up an ax handle from the front porch .
I was n’t sure what to do with it , but it made me feel better .
I mean , a gigantic drunken pit bull that ’s ready to fight is n’t just gonna sit and stay .
And a guy that ’s already been fighting that drunken pit bull — you ca n’t talk a lot of sense with that guy , either .
I yelled out to them to knock it off and go home .
The dog looked at me , wavering , and crashed to the pavement , panting .
The dude said “ you ca n’t make us leave , man , this is the road , it ’s public property , man , I got just as much right to be here as anybody and I ’d like to know what you ’re gonna do about it . ”
I looked over my shoulder , nervously , at the crowd on my porch , girl and her guy standing there open - mouthed , hand - in hand .
We all wanted to know what I was going to do , especially me .
I pulled out my phone and said “ Alright , look .
I ’m calling the cops and I ’m calling Animal Control .
Whoever gets here first , wins . ”
He sighed and said “ Shiiiit .
Come on , buddy , let ’s go home , ” and picked the pit bull up like a giant baby , slung it over his shoulder and walked off into the night , his box of malt liquor dangling from a free hand .
I turned back to my house , extending my hand for a handshake with the boyfriend and said “ Thanks for coming out , guys … it ’s really good to see you . ”
And she gave me a big , friendly hug and said “ yeah , man , it ’s good to see you , too . ”
Their eyes met across a crowded room .
The party chatter ebbed away , and the music slowed .
That first lovers ' glaze is the staple of the romantic novelist , and scientists believe they have now revealed the true nature of its true attractive power .
According to new research , romance has very little do to with it .
That " look " is all about sex and ego .
" It does seem to be a sort of narcissistic thing .
People are attracted to people who are attracted to them , " said Ben Jones in the Face Research Laboratory at the University of Aberdeen .
" It 's really a very basic effect that we are all , at some level at least , aware of - which is that if you smile at people and you maintain eye contact , it makes you more attractive . "
He said the work challenges most previous studies of facial attractiveness that have focused on physical characteristics , such as a preference for symmetrical faces or masculine versus feminine features .
" Social signals about how attracted someone else is to you actually seem to be quite important , " he said .
" You are attracted to people who are attracted to you , and that shows attractiveness is not just about physical beauty . "
Dr Jones and his colleagues say they have shown that attraction is based on social cues that say , " I 'm interested in you " .
The most important cue seems to be whether someone is looking directly at you .
The team put together four different sets of digital images - women looking happy , women looking disgusted , men looking happy and men looking disgusted .
In each case , the scientists made up pairs of images which were identical except that in one the person was looking directly at the camera and in the other their gaze was averted .
Volunteers then rated the relative attractiveness of the images in each pair .
The team found that a direct stare is attractive only if the person giving it looks as if they like you .
This preference was even higher if the face in the picture was of the opposite sex .
" What we found at the most basic level is that people like faces with direct gaze more than they like the same faces with averted gaze , " said Dr Jones .
" In other words , people find it more attractive when they are being looked at . "
The results are published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society .
Dr Jones said the results make sense from an evolutionary perspective .
" It takes quite a lot of effort to attract a mate and what you want to do is allocate that effort in a more efficient way , in other words in a way that is more likely to help you secure a mate . "
So it seems there is no point wasting your time on someone who is just not interested .

The gaming luminaries span the games industry
" Everything is moving towards the network , " said Neil Young , general manager of EA Los Angeles .
Phil Harrison , Sony 's head of worldwide studios , said : " Public utility computing is absolutely the future of the games industry . "
The panel was assembled by developer Dave Perry to discuss industry issues .
The panel included online gaming pioneer Raph Koster , Fable creator Peter Molyneux and Dungeon Siege creator Chris Taylor .
" A huge game changer for our industry is for there not to be a requirement for there to be a machine in the home , " said Mr Young .
" [ Instead ] the game is playing as an instance on a Google server farm in Oregon , for it to be rendered , sent down the pipe and shown on a television that you paid an extra five or 10 dollars to your cable company to guarantee you had good enough bandwidth for gaming .
" That to me seems inevitable . "
Flash is pointing the way to the future more so than the current generations of hardware
Raph Koster
Mr Koster added : " The games will be playing off the same back end , and will be serving different heads of the game on different devices . "
Mr Harrison pointed out there would always be an issue with delivering gaming content to players from servers due to the " speed of light " .
Data sent over fibre optic networks is subject to the limitations of the speed of light , which means interactivity between the server and gamer will never have a latency below 70 milliseconds .
That could impact the kinds of experiences it was possible to offer people in the future because data could not move back and forth fast enough .
In the short term , Mr Young , said different devices , from consoles to the web and PCs , would co-exist in the home .
" For content creators your canvas just got bigger , " he said .
Raph Koster , who was the lead designer on Ultima Online and Star Wars Galaxies , said the console industry was already being beaten by the web .
" Overall if you look at audience reach , quantity of games made and for that matter , although its difficult to measure , creativity , the web is kicking the console industry 's ass in a major way . "
He said Flash was the next big platform .
Are the days of the console numbered ?
" It 's pointing the way to the future more so than the current generations of hardware precisely because it is well on its way to becoming completely ubiquitous . "
He said advances in the graphic possibilities of Flash in the coming year would further challenge the console business .
But he admitted that no - one was making money from Flash games at the moment .
Mr Harrison , who oversees the software line - up for the PlayStation 3 , said : " In our proprietary view of a platform , it is a combination of technology , business model and consumer experience .
" The web , with Flash , is missing the business model aspect and consistency of consumer experience .
" Once it has figured it out then what you [ Raph Koster ] have said will become absolutely true . "
Scientists have genetically modified tobacco plants to knock out a gene that helps turns nicotine into one of the carcinogens in cured tobacco .
The Philip Morris - funded North Carolina State researchers say the work could lead to less cancer - causing chewing tobacco .
In large - scale field trials , they compared the levels of N - nitrosonornicotine , a chemical known as NNN , between GM tobacco plants and a control group .
They found a six - fold decrease in NNN and a 50 percent overall drop in a whole class of nasty substances known as tobacco - specific nitrosamines .
The new work appears in Plant Biotechnology Journal .
The researchers do not state how much the use of the tobacco could reduce the health risks from chewing tobacco .
Given the other 15 - odd carcinogenic substances present even in chew , they do note that the best way to avoid cancer from nicotine is not to use it .
Not oblivious to consumer opposition to many genetically modified crops , the researchers then created a line of tobacco plants missing the same gene they 'd previously knocked out through conventional breeding techniques .
They are currently trying to introduce that mutation into commercial tobacco lines , presumably avoiding a genetically modified organism label .
According to U.S. Department of Agriculture records , Philip Morris , a tobacco giant which had $ 66 billion in revenue last year , has run dozens of field trials for genetically modified tobacco varieties .
All those studies beg the question : Can Big Tobacco genetically engineer the cancer out of the cancer stick ?
And if so , at what cost ?
( One can almost imagine an advertising slogan : New GM Chewing Tobacco – Now Lower in Cancer ! )
We 'll be trying to find an answer for you over the next week with a rolling investigation .
UPDATE ( 3/20 ) :
The first post on my research is now up .
The USDA says that Philip Morris has conducted 33 field trials of genetically engineered tobacco , more than twice as many as any other tobacco company .

Kosovo Serbs are refusing to recognise Pristina 's authority
The protesters broke into the building in the Serb - dominated part of the city , forcing UN police to retreat .
A Kosovo police spokesman said a UN official was negotiating with Serb leaders to try to resolve the issue .
Kosovo Serbs and Serbia have refused to recognise Kosovo 's declaration of independence last month .
Most EU states and the US have recognised Pristina 's unilateral move .
Tension
UN riot police did not intervene when the crowd seized the court .
" We have returned to a building that belongs to us , and in which we worked until 1999 , " municipal public prosecutor Milan Bigovic was quoted as saying by Reuters .
Many of the protesters are reported to be former staff who lost their jobs in 1999 at the end of the war in Kosovo , when it came under UN administration .
Serbs had staged rallies outside the court for several weeks , preventing ethnic Albanian court employees from crossing the bridge over the Ibar River that divides Mitrovica into a Serb-run north and an ethnic Albanian south .
Tension in the region has risen sharply since Kosovo declared independence on 17 February .
Last week , Serbs tried to take control over a railway line in the northern Kosovo .
In February , some 150 Kosovo Serb police officers were suspended for refusing to take orders from the ethnic Albanian authorities in Kosovo 's capital , Pristina .
Yingsel Rangzen from Students for a Free Tibet points us to a blog post about a protest against China 's occupation of Tibet that took place in Lhasa , Tibet yesterday — captured by tourists ' cameras .
Snip from post :
[ The Tibetan protesters ] form a strong , silent , peacefull circle around the police who keep the middle of the square open .
Soon they call for backup .
Undercover agents , not so difficult to recognize , film the whole happening .
Especially the faces .
This is one method to create fear .
Suddenly there is panic .
6 or 7 monks are arrested and driven away .
Tibetans are very scared because of the stories about the prisons and tortures .
In the meanwhile , big numbers of policemen arrive .
They drive everybody apart .
But until sunset small groups of people stay around .
There are tourists , Tibetans and Tibetan resembling spies .
Apparently we stick around to long because some Tibetans start to warn us to be careful about the undercoverpolice who are watching us closely .
We even get a note that says we are being followed and have to be carefull about what we say .
The whole evening misty figures keep following us , even to the restaurant and the bar .
The Chinese police almost manages to give the impression that it´s just a small manifestation that they can easily control .
From our Portugees friends , Miguel and Clara , who visit one of the biggest monasteries ( Drepung ) nearby , we learn that the Chinese approach ( away from touristic eyes ) is much harder .
Link .
The protest in Lhasa was one of many around the world on March 10 , Tibetan Uprising Day .
Participants aim to …
… draw attention to the worsening human rights situation inside Tibet ( … ) , use the Olympics spotlight to shame and embarrass the Chinese government , and show them that until Tibet is free , China will never be never be accepted as a leader on the world stage .
I have been to the place where this event occurred , and am familiar enough with the region 's political history to understand that a protest of this scale , at this site , is unusual and significant .
From what I can gather , hundreds of ethnic Tibetans gathered on Barkhor Square , an open - air market area that surrounds Jokhang Temple ( a very large temple that is the heart of Lhasa 's traditional quarter , generally considered to be the most important temple in Tibet ) .
I spent time in and around this place , and saw surveillance cameras throughout the site .
Students for a Free Tibet is covering the story , and claims this is the largest protest of the Chinese occupation of Tibet to take place inside Tibet in over 50 years .

Just as additives help gasoline burn cleaner , a research report published in the January 2008 print issue of The FASEB Journal shows that the food industry could take a similar approach toward reducing health risks associated with fatty foods .
These “ meal additives ” would be based on work of Israeli researchers who discovered that consuming polyphenols ( natural compounds in red wine , fruits , and vegetables ) simultaneously with high - fat foods may reduce health risks associated with these foods .
“ We suggest a new hypothesis to explain polyphenols , ” said Joseph Kanner , senior author of the report .
“ For the first time , these compounds were demonstrated to prevent significantly the appearance of toxic food derivative compounds in human plasma . ”
For the study , six men and four women were fed three different meals consisting of dark meat turkey cutlets .
One meal , the control , consisted of turkey meat and water .
The second meal consisted of turkey meat with polyphenols added after cooking ( one tablespoon of concentrated wine ) followed with a glass of red wine ( about 7 ounces ) .
The third meal consisted of turkey meat with polyphenols added before cooking and then followed by a glass of wine .
At various points during the study , researchers took blood and urine samples to measure levels of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , a natural byproduct of fat digestion known to increase the risk for heart disease and other chronic conditions .
The researchers found that MDA levels nearly quintupled after the control meal , while MDA was nearly eliminated after subjects consumed the meals with polyphenols .
“ As long as deep fried candy bars are on menus , scientists will need to keep serving up new ways to prevent the cellular damage caused by these very tasty treats , ” said Gerald Weissmann , MD , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
“ This study suggests that the time will come where people can eat french fries without plugging their arteries . ”

Airport Security Study
Surprising nobody , a new study concludes that airport security is n’t helping :
A team at the Harvard School of Public Health could not find any studies showing whether the time - consuming process of X - raying carry - on luggage prevents hijackings or attacks .
They also found no evidence to suggest that making passengers take off their shoes and confiscating small items prevented any incidents . [… ]
The researchers said it would be interesting to apply medical standards to airport security .
Screening programs for illnesses like cancer are usually not broadly instituted unless they have been shown to work .
Note the defense by the TSA :
“ Even without clear evidence of the accuracy of testing , the Transportation Security Administration defended its measures by reporting that more than 13 million prohibited items were intercepted in one year , ” the researchers added .
“ Most of these illegal items were lighters . ”
This is where the TSA has it completely backwards .
The goal is n’t to confiscate prohibited items .
The goal is to prevent terrorism on airplanes .
When the TSA confiscates millions of lighters from innocent people , that ’s a security failure .
The TSA is reacting to non-threats .
The TSA is reacting to false alarms .
Now you can argue that this level of failures is necessary to make people safer , but it ’s certainly not evidence that people are safer .
For example , does anyone think that the TSA ’s vigilance regarding pies is anything other than a joke ?
Here ’s the actual paper from the British Medical Journal :
Of course , we are not proposing that money spent on unconfirmed but politically comforting efforts to identify and seize water bottles and skin moisturisers should be diverted to research on cancer or malaria vaccines .
But what would the National Screening Committee recommend on airport screening ?
Like mammography in the 1980s , or prostate specific antigen testing and computer tomography for detecting lung cancer more recently , we would like to open airport security screening to public and academic debate .
Rigorously evaluating the current system is just the first step to building a future airport security programme that is more user friendly and cost effective , and that ultimately protects passengers from realistic threats .
I talked about airport security at length with Kip Hawley , the head of the TSA , here .

WTC Building # 7 , a 47 - story high - rise not hit by an airplane , exhibited all the characteristics of classic controlled demolition with explosives :
In the aftermath of WTC7's destruction , strong evidence of demolition using incendiary devices was discovered :
FEMA finds rapid oxidation and intergranular melting Several tons of molten metal Chemical signature of the incendiary thermite
WTC7 exhibited none of the characteristics of destruction by fire :
REAL estate bubbles have burst before , without bringing such trouble to the financial system .
What is distinctive today is the drying up of market liquidity  the inability to buy and sell financial assets  caused by a lack of good information about asset values .
The American economy is suffering from an old conundrum : that liquidity is there when you do n’t need it , but missing when you do .
The results have been a form of financial gridlock .
If you think that traders have been well informed of late , take another look at the wild path of Bear Stearns shares :
A year ago , the stock was selling for $ 170 a share .
At the close on March 14 , just before the deal by which Bear Stearns was to be bought by JPMorgan Chase , Bear had a book value of $ 80 a share  and a share price of $ 30 .
The JPMorgan transaction , arranged two days later , valued the company at about $ 2 a share .
Since then , the shares have been trading above $ 2 , which in part reflects the possibility of the deal breaking up .
Every step of the way , the pricing of the stock has surprised the market  and yet Bear Stearns is a firm with a lengthy history , not an Internet start - up or a biotech whose value is based on a new but untried wonder drug .
To understand the depths of the current crisis , let ’s go back to an apparently unrelated episode in economic thought : the socialist calculation debate .
Starting in the 1920s , Ludwig von Mises , the leader of the so - called Austrian School of Economics , charged that socialism was unable to engage in rational economic calculation .
Without market prices , he reasoned , no one knows how much economic resources are worth .
Modern approaches to machine translation between languages require the use of a large ‘ corpus ’ of literature in each language .
Now a European project has demonstrated a cheaper solution which compares favourably with the market leaders in translating from Dutch , German , Greek or Spanish into English .
The European Union now has 23 official languages .
That means documents written in one language may need to be translated into any of 22 others , a total of 253 possible language pairs .
Small wonder that the institutions of the European Union , and organisations dealing with international commerce , among others , have a keen interest in automating the process where they can .
Efforts to use computers to translate languages , known as machine translation , date from the 1950s , yet computers still cannot compete with human translators for the quality of the results .
Machine translation works best for formal texts in specialised areas where vocabulary is unambiguous and sentence patterns are limited .
Aircraft manufacturers , for example , have devised their own systems for quickly translating technical manuals into many languages .
The EU has been active in promoting research in this field since the large Eurotra project of the 1980s .
In common with other projects of the time , Eurotra used a ‘ rules - based ’ approach where the computer is taught the rules of syntax and applies them to translate a text from one language to another .
This is also the basis of most commercial translation software .
But since the early 1990s the new concept of ‘ statistical ’ translation has gained ground in the machine translation community , arising out of research into speech recognition .
This dispenses with rules in favour of using statistical methods based on a text ‘ corpus ’ .
A corpus is a large body of written material , amounting to tens of millions of words , intended to be representative of a language .
Parallel corpora contain the same material in two or more languages and the computer compares the corpora to learn how words and expressions in one language correspond to those in another .
An important example is a parallel corpus of 11 languages based on the proceedings of the European Parliament .
Pattern matching
“ Parallel corpora are expensive and rare , ” says Dr Stella Markantonatou , of the Institute for Language and Speech Processing in Athens , which coordinates the EU ’s METIS II project .
“ They exist only for a very few languages and in small amounts and in specialised texts .
So our idea was to try to do statistically based machine translation without this resource , using just monolingual corpora of the target language .
For instance , to translate from Greek into English we use a large English corpus . ”
To use a single corpus you need a dictionary for the vocabulary and a way to understand the syntax .
In the original METIS project , completed in 2003 , the corpus was processed to analysis sentence patterns and the text to be translated was then matched against the patterns .
In Greek , for example , the verb can precede the subject of a sentence .
“ So if you come in with a Greek sentence , ‘ Eats Mary a cake ’ , you would like the machine to be able to translate it into English and rearrange the words to make ‘ Mary eats a cake ’ , ” explains Dr Markantonatou .
“ Pattern matching is a good way of doing that because it is able to take patterns from the source language and make them like the target language . ”
METIS II takes the principle further by matching patterns at the ‘ chunk ’ level , a phrase or fragment of a sentence rather than a sentence as a whole , as this makes the pattern matching more efficient .
It can also use grammar rules to generate alternative possibilities for the translation and then use the corpus to identify which is the more probable .
For example , where English would say ‘ I like cakes ’ , some European languages might use the form ‘ cakes please me . ’
So in translating into English , METIS II can test alternative interpretations against the English language corpus .
In this example , ' cakes please me ' would get a very low score while the closest match ' I like cakes ' would score highly .
Four languages
The partners have now built a system that translates from Greek , Spanish , German or Dutch into English .
Trials so far show that it performs well in comparison with SYSTRAN , the rules - based market leader in machine translation .
Considering that SYSTRAN is based on half a century of development while METIS II has only run for three years , that is quite an achievement .
A prototype is already available on the internet .
The problem now is what to do next .
Results from METIS II are being followed up in national research programmes in Spain and Belgium , but there are no plans as yet to further develop the whole system .
Some of the components created in the project , such as dictionaries and associated language tools , could be marketable in their own right , but would need an industrial partner to provide the investment needed to turn the prototype into a commercial product .
“ For Greek , it would be an excellent opportunity because there is nothing really good for [ translating it ] at present , ” Dr Markantonatou tells ICT Results .
“ With a better lexicon , fixing bugs and making algorithms more efficient , this kind of thing could work .
In another two or three years , METIS could be a very serious competitor to SYSTRAN .
It ’s a matter of funding . ”

The other day I found myself in a sports centre with a lot of time to kill while I waited for someone .
There in the foyer was an internet kiosk .
Great , I thought , waste some time on the net !
It was just a browser with a keyboard .
OK , no problem .
But the browser was locked down : you could only view the pages it had loaded , or pages linking from them .
You could n't enter a URL .
At that moment the browser was showing the fantastic benefits of recent investment in the sports centre .
Borrrrring !
Most importantly , you could n't use the search box in any page ( which otherwise might have thrown up a Google result , or outbound link ) .
Huh .
Unless I could find a way to break out of the kiosk 's limited pages onto the wider internet , it looked like I 'd have to find some other way to pass the time .
From Beeb to Guardian
Then I noticed that the main page also had little links to the BBC 's " latest news " page - just the links , but you could follow them to land on the BBC 's site .
Now , how could I get from there to the Guardian to see what was going on at the Technology blog ?
( Go ahead , try .
Remember , you 're not allowed to use any search boxes or search engines such as Google .
And because you 're pretending to be using a public kiosk , you do n't trust it with your username or password for any sites ; you can only get to pages that any passing person would . )
While I went back and forth on the BBC site , playing a sort of web Breakout , I considered how the internet has changed in the past decade or so .
Years ago , the paradigm was all about trapping people on your site .
There were in essence two species of site : " portals " ( which tried to get people to go there by linking out to everywhere else , the ur- portal of course being Yahoo ! ) and " destinations " , which tried to be an internet black hole , offering no way out and aiming to keep you there until you clicked on an ad in sheer frustration .
No way out
The classic destination was Deja News , a would - be commercial service that started up in 1995 aiming to archive all the Usenet newsgroup discussions , and to offer a searchable archive .
I once did a similar experiment to my web kiosk one on Deja News and discovered that you simply could n't get out ; its walls were thickly coated with internal links .
It simply did n't offer any " outward - going link love " , as we 'd call it today .
Deja News was bought by Google , which rolled it into its Google Groups offering .
And Google , as we know , is a portal .
The thing is this : the fewer " destinations " you have on the web , and the more places that ( in whatever way ) act as portals , the more interconnected it all is .
Which has to be a good thing , because it means that the " connectedness " algorithms that search engines use to determine your ranking in results will be more efficient .
Ultimately , search triumphs when everyone is connected to everyone via the fewest intermediate links .
I 'd love to say that I 've found all sorts of scientific research that validate these assertions , but unless I 've been looking in completely the wrong place , or in the wrong way , I can't find anything examining interconnectedness and the way it is changing .
But changing it is - and the sites that got me to the Guardian from the BBC are doing it .
Escape route
So , the solution to my challenge .
The BBC now offers links at the bottom of every story that let you submit them to Delicious , Digg , Reddit , Facebook or StumbleUpon .
Now , all it requires is that you have an account - but if you go to Digg , you can follow a link to the front page .
Then you can browse the archives .
I followed through until I found something from the Huffington Post , which I happen to know links to the Guardian .
I read a couple of pieces there and then followed a link from the " links - news sources " part of the front page to move on to the Guardian - where , knowing that the finish line was almost in sight ( click the " blogs " link in the top navigation bar , choose " Sci / Tech " , choose " Technology " ) , I paused to read some more articles , chosen by serendipity .
The clue ?
These days , social networks and aggregation sites provide the web 's backbone , the core that links everything to everything else .
The rise of social networking makes a huge difference ; you only have to look at the graph of Digg stories at Neoformix to see that interconnectedness is growing .
So , in answer to those who worry that the web is becoming Balkanized - that we 're only listening to opinions we like , or people we already agree with - I say : try navigating without your search and location bars .
This will take you to more interesting places than you might expect .
If I had n't set myself a place to go , I could have ended up anywhere .
Which is how , in the modern web , it ought to be - not scrabbling around for a link to the outside world , as I all too frequently found myself doing back in the 1990s .
The price for West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) oil touched $ 100 on January 2 , 2008 , a new milestone .
According to TheOilDrum.com , WTI oil price has been giving a very clear signal of pending shortage for over five years now , and in breaching the symbolic $ 100 a barrel mark , continues to do so .
Those driving the world economy have steadfastly ignored this red warning light .
In doing so , they are steering the world toward an energy disaster characterized by shortages , high energy prices , inflation , growing inequity , civil unrest and famine .
( PRWEB ) January 4 , 2008 -- A Signal Ignored
Coming as it does on the eve of the Iowa caucuses , the breaking of the $ 100 dollar barrier for oil prices will likely be treated by many as an almost imperceptible change in our world .
By Friday it will likely be lost in the discussion of the political events unfolding .
The $ 100 a barrel price is a sign that times will never be the same again .
According to TheOilDrum.com , the world is entering a new era , where the supply of energy will come to dominate the political landscape in a way that is currently not recognized by any of the leading candidates .
Over the past two years , citizens have been repeatedly assured that there is no problem with future oil supply .
Because of a perceived need to present both sides of the argument , the public has heard false promises of lower future prices , and been beguiled by the possibility of a price collapse in the face of excess supply .
Recently , various qualifiers have started to appear in oil discussions .
These qualifiers include the need for increased investment in exploration and improved production technologies .
The media fails to mention that the needed investment will be at an increasingly diminished rate of return , to the point where it becomes economically unattractive to search harder and harder for very small quantities of oil and gas .
Both oil and natural gas resources around the world are found in underground reservoirs of a finite size .
Many of these oil reservoirs have now been producing for over fifty years .
In that time , the vast quantities of oil that were in place have been reduced .
As the quantity of oil remaining in place falls , the rate at which oil can be recovered also falls .
This makes it necessary to drill additional wells into the reservoir in order to maintain the level of output .
According to TheOilDrum.com , at some point enough oil will have been extracted that no matter how many more wells are drilled , overall production from the field will go into irreversible decline .
And as field after field reaches this condition , the overall production of oil for the region will begin to fall .
This happened to the United States in 1970 when oil production reached a peak .
US production has since declined from a maximum of over 9.6 million barrels a day ( mbd ) , to the current level of around 5 mbd .
More recently , the oil fields of the North Sea , the Alaskan fields on the North Slope , and the huge Cantarell field in Mexico have entered irreversible decline .
As these fields deplete , smaller fields have been brought into production , but these small fields do not last as long .
Drilling activity must be increased in order to find even smaller fields .
These , in turn , deplete more and more rapidly , exacerbating the need for new wells .
According to TheOilDrum.com , the world is now reaching the point where all of the oil fields of the world are in aggregate coming to peak production .
As peak world production draws near , the rate of increase in oil production can be expected to stall because of constrained resources .
This can happen even with rising demand .
Once production falls short of what is needed , oil prices can be expected to increase , so that demand is brought in line with available supply .
At this point , countries that still have a surplus of oil to export are seeing their economies boom .
This growth brings an increase in their own demand for oil , which reduces the amount that can be made available for export .
This higher oil use by exporting countries reduces the available supply to importing countries , further accelerating the rise in price .
The countries least able to afford the increase are likely to be affected most .
The consequences of energy supply shortages can be surprisingly great .
Energy shortages can lead to public unrest , such as occurred recently in Myanmar .
In times of inclement weather , energy shortages can lead to a loss of export supply , if the supplier finds that domestic demand is consuming all that is available .
Problems for importing nations then suddenly become worse .
One such example is the Iranian gas import situation this past week , and the consequent cut in exports to Turkey .
According to TheOilDrum.com , the world has now entered a period of fragile balance between demand and available supply .
Unfortunately the situation cannot be expected to improve .
The increasingly limited ability of nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia to increase oil production is already becoming evident , leading to a reduced potential for raising world production .
It now appears unlikely that the world will ever see a daily oil production rate of 90 mbd , even when natural gas liquids and condensate are included .
Thus , future projections that speak glibly of numbers above this level are foisting a canard on the world 's population that all will come to regret .
In the coming months , the $ 100 per barrel marker will be lost in the debate over other issues .
According to TheOilDrum.com , limited oil supply is not an issue that will go away .
Rather , it is an issue that will steadily increase in importance .
Eventually , the cries for action , and for culprits to blame will become over - riding -- at a time well within the first term of the presidential candidates .
These candidates now pay little attention to energy policy , but that must and will change .
Hopefully , greater concern for energy policy will occur before events force a change , but so far the grim markers along the way have largely been ignored .

Cue the jokes about godless politicians and Bay Area liberals .
Secular groups Monday applauded a public acknowledgment by Rep. Pete Stark that he does not believe in a supreme being , making the Fremont Democrat the first member of Congress -- and the highest - ranking elected official in the U.S. -- to publicly acknowledge not believing in God .
The American Humanist Assn. plans to take out an ad in the Washington Post today congratulating the congressman for his public stance and highlighting the contributions of other prominent secular humanists , such as writers Barbara Ehrenreich and Kurt Vonnegut and actress Julia Sweeney .
Fred Edwords , a spokesman for the group , said non-theistic Americans often faced discrimination for their views .

“ So often throughout American history , people who are non-theistic or do n’t believe in a supreme being ca n’t get elected to public office or , if they inform the public of their view , they do n’t get reelected , ” he said .
“ We ’re trying to increase the acceptance of non-theists as every bit as American as everybody else . ”
Stark ’s declaration came in response to a search by the Secular Coalition for America to find the most prominent nonbelieving politician .
The advocacy group , which according to its website calls for extending “ religious tolerance ... to people of all religions and to those without religious beliefs , ” offered a $ 1,000 prize to the person who could identify the “ highest - level atheist , agnostic , humanist or any other kind of non-theist currently holding elected public office in the United States . ”
A member of American Atheists California nominated Stark .

Ron Millar , associate director of the Secular Coalition for America , said the group wanted to highlight how hard it was for politicians to take a public stance about not believing in God .
He said members were “ pleasantly surprised ” with Stark ’s candor .
“ We did n’t think we ’d have any member of Congress come forward , ” Millar said .
Stark , who has served in Congress since 1973 and chairs the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee , clarified his views in an e-mail statement .
“ When the Secular Coalition asked me to complete a survey on my religious beliefs , I indicated I am a Unitarian who does not believe in a supreme being , ” Stark said .
“ Like our nation ’s founders , I strongly support the separation of church and state .
I look forward to working with the Secular Coalition to stop the promotion of narrow religious beliefs in science , marriage contracts , the military and the provision of social services . ”

Unitarian Universalism describes itself as creedless , meaning that it has no underlying authoritative statement of religious belief .
Some members believe in God ; others do not .
A USA Today / Gallup poll last month found that 45 % of respondents said they would vote for a “ well qualified ” presidential candidate who was an atheist .
Ninety - five percent said they would vote for a Catholic candidate , 92 % a Jewish candidate and 72 % a Mormon candidate .

A Tic - Tac - sized lightbulb that gives off as much light as a streetlamp may offer a peek at the ultra - efficient lighting of the future .
The bulb , developed by Luxim of Sunnyvale , California , uses plasma technology to achieve its brightness .
The tiny bulb contains an argon gas in the middle , as well as a component called a " puck . "
The bulb is partially embedded in a dielectric material .
When electrical energy is delivered to the puck , the puck acts like an electrical lens .
It heats up the argon to a temperature of 6000 degrees Kelvin , and turns the gas into a plasma that gives off light .
The plasma , whose 6000 - degree temperature is similar to that of the surface of the sun , also emits a spectrum that looks very similar to the spectrum of sunlight .
The plasma bulb uses 250 watts , and achieves around 140 lumens per watt , making it very bright and highly efficient .
By comparison , conventional lightbulbs and high - end LEDs get around 15 and 70 lumens per watt , respectively .
" A key advantage is that the energy is driven into the bulb without any electrodes , so you do n't need any electrical connections to get the energy into the bulb , " Luxim CEO Tony McGettigan explained to ZDNet .
Luxim is using different versions of its electrode - less plasma technology to develop lighting for ultra - bright projection displays , retail and street lighting , microscope lighting , and various medical applications .

Statement of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division on its Decision to Close its Investigation of XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc.'s Merger with Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. Evidence Does Not Establish that Combination of Satellite Radio Providers Would Substantially Reduce Competition
WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice 's Antitrust Division issued the following statement today after announcing the closing of its investigation into the proposed merger of XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. with Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. :
" After a careful and thorough review of the proposed transaction , the Division concluded that the evidence does not demonstrate that the proposed merger of XM and Sirius is likely to substantially lessen competition , and that the transaction therefore is not likely to harm consumers .
The Division reached this conclusion because the evidence did not show that the merger would enable the parties to profitably increase prices to satellite radio customers for several reasons , including : a lack of competition between the parties in important segments even without the merger ; the competitive alternative services available to consumers ; technological change that is expected to make those alternatives increasingly attractive over time ; and efficiencies likely to flow from the transaction that could benefit consumers .
" The Division 's investigation indicated that the parties are not likely to compete with respect to many segments of the satellite radio business even in the absence of the merger .
Because customers must acquire equipment that is specialized to the satellite radio service to which they subscribe , and which cannot receive the other provider 's signal , there has never been significant competition for customers who have already subscribed to one or the other service .
For potential new subscribers , past competition has resulted in XM and Sirius entering long - term , sole - source contracts that provide incentives to all of the major auto manufacturers to install their radios in new vehicles .
The car manufacturer channel accounts for a large and growing share of all satellite radio sales ; yet , as a result of these contracts , there is not likely to be significant further competition between the parties for satellite radio equipment and service sold through this channel for many years .
In the retail channel , where the parties likely would continue to compete to attract new subscribers absent the merger , the Division found that the evidence did not support defining a market limited to the two satellite radio firms that would exclude various alternative sources for audio entertainment , and similarly did not establish that the combined firm could profitably sustain an increased price to satellite radio consumers .
Substantial cost savings likely to flow from the transaction also undermined any inference of competitive harm .
Finally , the likely evolution of technology in the future , including the expected introduction in the next several years of mobile broadband Internet devices , made it even more unlikely that the transaction would harm consumers in the longer term .
Accordingly , the Division has closed its investigation of the proposed merger . "
ANALYSIS
During the course of its investigation , the Division reviewed millions of pages of documents , analyzed large amounts of data related to sales of satellite radios and subscriptions for satellite radio service , and interviewed scores of industry participants .
Extent of Likely Future Competition between XM and Sirius
The Division 's analysis considered the extent to which the two satellite radio providers compete with one another .
Although the firms in the past competed to attract new subscribers , there has never been significant competition between them for customers who have already subscribed to one or the other service and purchased the requisite equipment .
Also , competition for new subscribers is likely to be substantially more limited in the future than it was in the past .
As to existing subscribers , the Division found that satellite radio equipment sold by each company is customized to each network and will not function with the other service .
XM and Sirius made some efforts to develop an interoperable radio capable of receiving both sets of satellite signals .
Depending on how such a radio would be configured , it could enable consumers to switch between providers without incurring the costs of new equipment .
The Division 's investigation revealed , however , that no such interoperable radio is on the market and that such a radio likely would not be introduced in the near term .
For example , in the important automotive channel , such a radio could not be introduced in the near term due to the engineering required to integrate radios into new vehicles .
The need for equipment customized to each network means that in order to switch from XM to Sirius , or vice versa , a subscriber would have to purchase new equipment designed for the other service .
In the case of a factory - installed car radio , switching satellite radio providers would have the additional disadvantage of requiring an aftermarket radio that would be less integrated into the vehicle 's systems .
Data analyzed by the Division confirmed that subscribers rarely switch between XM and Sirius .
As to new subscribers , XM and Sirius sell satellite radios and service primarily through two distribution channels : ( 1 ) car manufacturers that install the equipment in new cars and ( 2 ) mass - market retailers that sell automobile aftermarket equipment and other stand - alone equipment .
Car manufacturers account for an increasingly large portion of XM and Sirius sales , and the parties have focused more and more of their resources on attracting subscribers through the car manufacturer channel .
Historically , XM and Sirius engaged in head - to - head competition for the right to distribute their products and services through each car company .
As a result of this competitive process , XM and Sirius have provided car manufacturers with subsidies and other payments that indirectly reduce the equipment prices paid by car buyers to obtain a satellite radio .
However , XM and Sirius have entered into sole - source contracts with all the major automobile manufacturers that fix the amount of these subsidies and other pertinent terms through 2012 or beyond .
Moreover , there was no evidence that competition between XM or Sirius beyond the terms of these contracts would affect customers ' choices of which car to buy .
As a result , there is not likely to be significant competition between XM and Sirius for satellite radio equipment and service sold through the car manufacturer channel for many years .
The Division 's investigation identified the mass - market retail channel as an arena in which XM and Sirius would compete with one another for the foreseeable future .
Both XM and Sirius devote substantial effort and expense to attracting subscribers in this arena , with both companies offering discounts , most commonly in the form of equipment rebates , to attract consumers .
Retail channel sales have dropped significantly since 2005 , and the parties contended that the decline was accelerating .
However , retail outlets still account for a large portion of the firms ' sales , and the Division was unable to determine with any certainty that this channel would not continue to be important in the future .
Effect on Competition in the Retail Channel
Because XM and Sirius would no longer compete with one another in the retail channel following the merger , the Division examined what alternatives , if any , were available to consumers interested in purchasing satellite radio service , and specifically whether the relevant market was limited to the two satellite radio providers , such that their combination would create a monopoly .
The parties contended that they compete with a variety of other sources of audio entertainment , including traditional AM / FM radio , HD Radio , MP3 players ( e.g. , iPods® ) , and audio offerings delivered through wireless telephones .
Those options , used individually or in combination , offer many consumers attributes of satellite radio service that they may find attractive .
The parties further contended that these audio entertainment alternatives were sufficient to prevent the merged company from profitably raising prices to consumers in the retail channel – for example , through less discounting of equipment prices , increased subscription prices , or reductions in the quality of equipment or service .
The Division found that evidence developed in the investigation did not support defining a market limited to the two satellite radio firms , and similarly did not establish that the combined firm could profitably sustain an increased price to satellite radio consumers .
XM and Sirius seek to attract subscribers in a wide variety of ways , including by offering commercial - free music ( with digital sound quality ) , exclusive programming ( such as Howard Stern on Sirius and " Oprah & Friends " on XM ) , niche music formats , out - of - market sporting events , and a variety of news and talk formats in a service that is accessible nationwide .
The variety of these offerings reflects an effort to attract consumers with highly differentiated interests and tastes .
Thus , while the satellite radio offerings of XM and Sirius likely are the closest substitutes for some current or potential customers , the two offerings do not appear to be the closest substitutes for other current or potential customers .
For example , a potential customer considering purchasing XM service primarily to listen to Major League Baseball games or one considering purchasing Sirius service primarily to listen to Howard Stern may not view the other satellite radio service , which lacks the desired content , as a particularly close substitute .
Similarly , many customers buying radios in the retail channel are acquiring an additional receiver to add to an existing XM or Sirius subscription for their car radio , and these customers likely would not respond to a price increase by choosing a radio linked to the other satellite radio provider .
The evidence did not demonstrate that the number of current or potential customers that view XM and Sirius as the closest alternatives is large enough to make a price increase profitable .
Importantly in this regard , the parties do not appear to have the ability to identify and price discriminate against those actual or potential customers that view XM and Sirius as the closest substitutes .
Likely Efficiencies
To the extent there were some concern that the combined firm might be able profitably to increase prices in the mass - market retail channel , efficiencies flowing from the transaction likely would undermine any such concern .
The Division 's investigation confirmed that the parties are likely to realize significant variable and fixed cost savings through the merger .
It was not possible to estimate the magnitude of the efficiencies with precision due to the lack of evidentiary support provided by XM and Sirius , and many of the efficiencies claimed by the parties were not credited or were discounted because they did not reflect improvements in economic welfare , could have been achieved without the proposed transaction , or were not likely to be realized within the next several years .
Nevertheless , the Division estimated the likely variable cost savings – those savings most likely to be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices – to be substantial .
For example , the merger is likely to allow the parties to consolidate development , production and distribution efforts on a single line of radios and thereby eliminate duplicative costs and realize economies of scale .
These efficiencies alone likely would be sufficient to undermine an inference of competitive harm .
Effect of Technological Change
Any inference of a competitive concern was further limited by the fact that a number of technology platforms are under development that are likely to offer new or improved alternatives to satellite radio .
Most notable is the expected introduction within several years of next - generation wireless networks capable of streaming Internet radio to mobile devices .
While it is difficult to predict which of these alternatives will be successful and the precise timing of their availability as an attractive alternative , a significant number of consumers in the future are likely to consider one or more of these platforms as an attractive alternative to satellite radio .
The likely evolution of technology played an important role in the Division 's assessment of competitive effects in the longer term because , for example , consumers are likely to have access to new alternatives , including mobile broadband Internet devices , by the time the current long - term contracts between the parties and car manufacturers expire .

A series of head - to - head polls shows Barack Obama is more likely to beat John McCain than Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Obama backers highlight breadth
Super Tuesday was a draw on paper , but Sen.
Barack Obama ’s strategists have begun arguing that his broadly - distributed wins — in states as varied as North Dakota and Georgia — make him especially well - positioned for a fall match - up with the likely Republican nominee , Arizona Sen .
John McCain .
Kansas Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius , one of a number of Obama ’s prominent endorsers from states that either swing or consistently vote Republican in presidential elections , told Politico in a phone interview that Obama ’s appeal reaches well beyond the Democratic base .

“ I hear every day from Republicans and independents in Kansas that they would be willing to cross party lines if they like the candidate ’s vision , ” Sebelius said .
“ I hear every day that Barack Obama is a candidate they would feel very comfortable supporting and would be eager to support . ”
Indicative of his red-state allure , Obama also has been endorsed by Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) , whose state went 67 percent for President Bush in 2004 ; Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano ( D ) , whose state went 55 percent for Bush ; and Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) , who represents a state that delivered 53 percent for Bush .
At the same time , Obama has defied conventional wisdom by attracting endorsements from prominent women , including Kate Michelman , former president of NARAL Pro-Choice America , and Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D - Conn . ) , who was the first executive director of EMILY ’s List .
A series of head - to - head polls shows Obama is more likely to beat McCain than Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y . ) .
Among them is a new Time magazine poll showing Obama with a 7 - point advantage in the theoretical matchup , while McCain and Clinton are deadlocked .
On Tuesday , Obama won in states holding primaries , which tend to attract more casual voters , and caucuses , which consist largely of party activists .
He won more states in total , and essentially tied Clinton in the popular vote and in the delegate count .
He won in states with high percentages of African - American voters and in those with almost none .
He registered wins in the Northeast ( Connecticut ) , the Midwest ( Missouri ) , the South ( Georgia ) and the Mountain West ( Idaho and Utah ) .
By winning across the national landscape and in both primaries and caucuses , Obama helped put to rest one of the key reservations that Democrats harbored about his candidacy — whether he has the kind of broad appeal that can carry him to victory in November .
The Obama campaign on Friday released a strategy memo that made explicit an argument that the senator has increasingly been making on the stump .
It was titled , “ The Candidate Who Can Win : Barack Obama is beating Hillary Clinton with Independent voters and can beat John McCain in November . ”
The memo points to the general election as a reason for Democrats to support Obama now — encouraging activists to consider Electoral College math nine months ahead of time .
“ On Super Tuesday , in six red states that had primaries or caucuses for both Republicans and Democrats , Obama won and got more votes than the top two Republicans combined , ” the memo said .
“ These states — Colorado , Georgia , Iowa , Missouri , North Dakota and South Carolina — account for a total of 53 Electoral College votes . ”
Clinton campaign spokesman Phil Singer called the idea that Super Tuesday revealed red-state strength for Obama “ a rather ridiculous argument . ”
“ Sen . Clinton won in every region and pulled a significant number of voters in states that will be crucial to Democratic efforts to take back the White House , ” Singer said .
“ She won in red states like Oklahoma , Tennessee , Arizona and Arkansas , as well as in reliably blue states like California , New York and Massachusetts .
She beat Sen. Obama in the youth vote , the supposed source of his strength , in California and Massachusetts .
She won 110 of the 115 jurisdictions in Missouri , including rural regions — if you look at a map of how the votes were distributed , the entire state looks like Clinton country . ”
But in Kansas , a state that went 62 percent for Bush in 2004 and where Obama won 74 percent of the vote Tuesday , Sebelius said Obama has the best chance to “ rebrand Democrats ” to broaden the party ’s appeal in what has been a closely divided nation .
“ This is very good for our party in the long term , ” she said .
“ People have been identified and mobilized , and an army is being put together in a state where , frankly , Democratic presidential campaigns have not seemed interested or involved in years and years . ”
In early - 1960s Israel pornographic , possibly anti-Semitic novels that detailed sensational tales of the torture and rape of male concentration camp prisoners by curvaceous female Nazi guards rapidly rose from marginal pulp reading to mass - market popularity .
Ari Libsker ’s documentary “ Stalags ” is named for these pocket - size books , which were written under American pseudonyms in a style that suggested translation .
( They were in fact done in Hebrew by Israeli writers , some of whom appear on screen . )
The film examines the rise and fall of this short - lived craze and the doors it opened for discussing the Holocaust , a previously hush - hush subject in Israel .

The film also considers possible inspirations for the Stalags , from the 1961 trial of the high - ranking Nazi Adolf Eichmann , which exposed sexual abuse within concentration camps , to the works of K. Tzetnik , a Holocaust historian or fabricator , depending on whom you ask .
( His books recounted similar atrocities . )

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The U.N. investigator on torture said on Tuesday the United States had denied his request to visit U.S. - run jails in Iraq and insisted a visit could help clear its legacy of the prison abuse scandal in Abu Ghraib .

Manfred Nowak , United Nations special rapporteur on torture , said he had received credible information the situation had improved at U.S. detention facilities in recent years , but stressed only a visit would allow him to verify them .
An international outcry erupted in 2004 after images of prisoner abuse by U.S. military personnel at Abu Ghraib west of Baghdad , including naked detainees stacked in a pyramid and others cowering before snarling dogs , became public .
“ I was a little astonished that the U.S. government is not willing to grant me access because it might perhaps even be in their own interest if I compared different detention facilities , ” Nowak told a news briefing in Geneva .
“ It might also be in their interest in overcoming the legacy of having been criticized so much for torture practices in Abu Ghraib and other detention facilities up to 2004 , ” he added .
Nowak , who has an Iraqi government invitation for his Oct 18 - 26 planned visit , said he would also expect full access to Iraqi - run detention facilities , although this was still under negotiation .
British authorities have agreed to allow him to visit their detainees in Iraq , he added .
At least 30,000 prisoners are held by Iraqi authorities , according to the International Committee of the Red Cross which made its first visit to security detainees held by Iraq ’s central government last October .
The neutral Red Cross -- whose reports are confidential unlike those of U.N. investigators -- still seeks a wider agreement for access to all prisoners held by Iraq .
Sunni Arabs have accused the Shi’ite - led interior ministry of operating torture centers and dungeons holding Sunni detainees .
Nowak also voiced dismay at President George W. Bush ’s veto last Saturday of legislation passed by Congress that would have banned the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) from using waterboarding .
The U.N. envoy reiterated that the interrogation technique which simulates drowning amounted to torture .
“ I think that the ( U.S. ) government wishes to maintain certain positions of principle which they have taken at the beginning of the so - called war on terror , and if they now would take them back as a government , they would kind of admit that what they had done in the past was wrong , ” he said .
“ I think that the current administration still sticks to its legal position although there is enough evidence that these legal positions are untenable under international law , ” he said .
Nowak , an Austrian law professor who has served in the independent post since 2004 , spoke on the sidelines of the U.N. Human Rights Council .
Its 47 member states are holding a four - week session until March 28 to examine abuses worldwide .
LONDON  Shares of Carlyle Capital plunged on Thursday , losing most of their value , after the company said it expected its lenders to promptly take over all its assets after discussions with banks to refinance the fund failed .
Carlyle Capital , an Amsterdam - listed affiliate of the Carlyle Group , the private equity fund , said it “ has not been able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement to stabilize its financing . ”
Its shares fell more than 87.5 percent Thursday , ending the day at 0.35 euros , .
They have fallen more than 90 percent since the company ’s problems became public last week .
“ It has become apparent to the company that the basis on which lenders are willing to provide financing against the company ’s collateral has changed so substantially that a successful refinancing is not possible , ” Carlyle Capital said in a statement late Wednesday .
Carlyle Capital invested in triple - A rated mortgage debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and like other investment vehicles it had leveraged its capital aggressively , borrowing $ 31 for every dollar of equity .
As of February , it had $ 21.7 billion worth of assets in its investment portfolio .
But as those investments lost value , creditors demanded that it put up more and more money in margin calls .
A $ 150 million line of credit from its parent , the Carlyle Group , was not enough to keep it out of trouble as lenders demanded more collateral to back up their loans .

Luti Fagbenle may be the luckiest man alive , what with being young , handsome and the owner of a film company in Notting Hill .
Oh , and the recipient of £ 208,100 for doing nothing .
One Sunday morning last autumn , scaffolding appeared on Fagbenle 's office wall as Portobello Road market was in full swing .
When it came down a few hours later , the wall had been sprayed with graffiti .
Being streetwise , Fagbenle did not dance with rage .
Instead , he called in an expert , who confirmed that the stencilled figure of a painter at his easel was by Banksy , the artist once described as a cross between Michelangelo and the Scarlet Pimpernel .
In April , Banksy 's Space Girl and Bird sold at auction for £ 288,000 , 20 times its estimate .
Accordingly , Fagbenle put the work on his wall up for sale on eBay , where , last month , it fetched slightly less .
But then , as its seller wisely noted , whoever bought the piece was also buying a wall , and walls are tricky to take home .
A happy ending – though it might not have been .
Before Fagbenle had had time to confirm his work 's provenance , it had been dogged .
For those of you over 19 , dogging is not what you 're thinking .
In the context of graffiti – or street , cult or urban art – to dog is to add to , or re-graffitise .
( This may be the moment for a short graffitist 's glossary .
A writer = a graffiti artist ; a burner = a masterpiece .
To buff = to paint over , usually by enraged local councils .
To bite = to imitate , or possibly rip off .
Thus , from a blog : " All graffiti is born from biting , someone creates a style and others copy it . " )
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Now , Banksy has always been good about dogging .
One of his works – a mural of two characters from Pulp Fiction on an air shaft at Old Street Tube station – was once dogged by a 19 - year - old writer called Ozone , who added insult to injury with the tart line , " If it 's better next time , I 'll leave it . "
When Ozone was run down and killed by a train he was trying to spray - paint not long afterwards , Banksy 's website ' mourned him thus : " When we lost Ozone we lost a fearless writer and , as it turns out , a pretty perceptive art critic .
Rest in piece ( sic ) . "
The dogged mural was later buffed ( see above ) by Transport for London , then re-dogged by Banksy as a memento mori in Ozone 's honour : it now depicts a putto in a flak jacket , contemplating a baseball - capped skull .
But would Banksy 's collectors – and these include Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie , who recently spent £ 1 m on his work – be as broad - minded about dogging as the artist himself ?
In other words , is a dogged Banksy as good a buy as an undogged one ?
It 's the kind of question that taxes art dealers mightily .
On Tuesday , a sale of urban art – a term about which more later – will be held at the Bond Street auction rooms of Bonhams , the house that sold Space Girl and Bird .
Along with a number of Banksys , this sale will include works by Paul Insect , D*Face , Invader , Toxic and Cyclops .
There will be no walls for sale , though , nor Tube carriages or ventilation shafts .
The auction is billed as the " first devoted solely to urban art " , a term notable for its avoidance of the words " street " and " graffiti " .
In terms of technique , the works in Bonhams ' sale are no different from those in most art auctions .
For all the grunge of their imagery – spray - painted policemen with smiley faces , stencilled Churchills with green mohicans , HM The Queen sticking out her tongue – these are not things of the street .
They are canvases , drawings and small - run screenprints , signed and numbered .
Bonhams ' Gareth Williams , in charge of the sale , suggests its logic .
" In 2003 , " he says , " you could have picked up a Banksy print for £ 300 .
Last year , we sold one for just under £ 300,000 . "
Will Brad and Angelina be there ?
" We very much hope so . "
The figures are compelling , but why are there no walls ?
Williams picks his words with care .
" What we 're selling is n't street art , " he says .
" People have seen art in the street and liked its aesthetic , but the market has moved on .
The Banksys in our sale are on a different level from the one in Portobello Road .
We 're very conscious of not wanting to get involved in the whole question of ownership , nor of encouraging people to go out and damage private property . "
It 's an interesting point .
Whatever else Banksy 's Portobello Road stencil may have been , it was an offence under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 .
To sell it at public auction might be to incite crime .
This , presumably , accounts for the caginess of the Lazarides Gallery in London 's Soho , which represents Banksy , Paul Insect , Invader and various other artists in Bonhams ' sale .
It was at Lazarides that Brangelina splashed out their £ 1 m on Banksy ; in July , an entire show of works by Paul Insect was bought off the wall for a knockdown £ 500,000 by one Damien Hirst .
Yet , according to the gallery 's PR company , Lazarides had forbidden its artists to talk to the press in the run-up to the Bonhams sale , so that my phone calls and emails were left unreturned .
( So , too , was my call to Luti Fagbenle . )
This caution also explains the curious shifts in name of the thing that Lazarides and Bonhams are selling .
Lazarides goes for cult art , Bonhams prefers urban art .
Both terms put space between themselves and the legally troublesome street art , which in turn distances itself from the downright criminal graffiti art .
" Naming is a tricky issue , " agrees Tate Modern 's Cedar Lewinsohn , who has just finished writing a book on the subject .
" I went for ' street art ' .
Some artists like it , some do n't , but it was the easiest in the long run , " he admits .
Lewinsohn's own interest in the subject began on trawls of the East End art scene , where he " kept seeing better art between galleries than in them " .
He points out that what ' is happening in London now happened in New York in the 1980s with the crossover from graffiti to fine art by people such as Jean - Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring .
( Bonhams has included Haring prints in its sale , giving some historical legitimacy to the current generation . )
" Street art and graffiti art are two different things , and the artists are hyper - aware of that , " says Lewinsohn .
" But if the best ones want to make some money out of what they do , then why not ? "
One answer to this comes from an artist known in the graffiti world as Aroe .
The difference between the graffiti Lewinsohn sees on East End walls and work by the same artists in West End sale rooms is that the former is illegal , the latter not .
Put another way , urban art is to graffiti what Cliff is to Elvis : a derivation , but a distant one .
Illegality is part of the aesthetic of graffiti art , what it is about .
Lawful graffiti art is a contradiction in terms , as are screenprints and numbered editions that claim graffiti credentials .
The latter irritate Aroe , who has faced continuous brushes with the law over his 20 - year career .
( His spelling of " arrow " was chosen because double letters and w's do n't look good in spray - paint ) .
" I 've just had a prosecution against me fail , in spite of house raids , " he says .
Having hung up his spray can , it was , he hopes , his last .
" The three ways you can end your career as a graffiti artist are to be caught , injured or quit , " he says .
" The last is the most difficult , and I chose it . "
All of which is to say that graffiti art is a genre with strict rules .
To write well is not enough .
Respect is earned through a combination of skill and notoriety , the last – pace Ozone – based on a daredevil disregard for personal safety .
Aroe once pulled the emergency cord on a packed Madrid metro and sprayed the train while it stood in the tunnel : " That , " he says , flatly , " got me my name . "
This willingness to risk death is part of graffiti's aesthetic , visible to other writers and " the roughnecks in the street " – you and me – who see the end product .
We 're not talking conventional art appreciation here .
" The point , " Aroe says , " is to annoy the greatest number of people you can . "
As you might expect , his views on street art are robust .
" Real graffiti artists could n't give a shit about selling a canvas for £ 20,000 , " he says .
" If people want that , good luck to them .
What irritates me is when they piggyback on what we do , claiming a credibility they have n't earned .
There 's a world of difference between sitting in a studio making screenprints and spending 20 years evading guards to paint trains . "
As you will read in the interviews on these pages , this is not a view shared by the artists whose work is in Bonhams ' auction .
Yet Aroe raises a compelling question : can grit be bought and sold ?
Urban art is the new hot collectible , and not just for Hollywood stars and the ubiquitous Russians .
There will also be institutional investors at Bonhams ' sale , buying Banksys for their market potential .
But will they be getting blue - chip stock , or mere derivatives ? *
The Urban Art sale , including works by D*Face , Cyclops , Adam Neate , Nick Walker and Andrew McAttee , will take place at Bonhams , London W1 ( 020 7393 3900 ) on Tuesday .
' Street Art ' by Cedar Lewinsohn ( Tate Publishing , £ 18.99 ) is out in May .

Sickboy :
The all - rounder
Sickboy has a slogan that he sprays on surfaces across London : " Save the Youth " .
" It 's not that I 'm trying to ' save the youth ' .
It 's just a line from a Northern Soul tune , " he says .
" I like the sentiment of it and the lettering – and it's a bit more interesting than " Stop the War " .
People are jumping on the political bandwagon , because work with that sort of message has a niche , but most of my work is not political . "
The 28 - year - old sees himself as neither a street nor a graffiti artist , but as somewhere between .
" If anything I 'd rather be seen as a graffiti artist , as I come from a graffiti background .
Graffiti has a stronger subculture ; anyone can be a street artist . "
Now his paintings and prints sell in galleries and online .
He makes a comfortable living although , he insists , he has never compromised his art for commercial reasons .
When a print run is released , it sells out in minutes .
He continues to work on the streets , picking the right spot , which is ideally a large wall near a main road and close to traffic lights where drivers can stop to admire his craft .
" Most of the time , " he says , " I just want to make people smile . "
Adam Neate :
The maverick
Neate , 30 , roams the streets of London salvaging scraps of cardboard or wood , on which he paints tense , angst - ridden human forms .
He then leaves the work hanging from a nail or attached to a lamppost for passers - by to pick up .
" I put it out for people to enjoy , " says the 30 - year - old .
" I never went to a fancy art college ; I just enjoy painting .
I did n't get any feedback for years as I never saw where the paintings ended up . "
Neate was n't interested in the commercial art world until a gallery unexpectedly approached him , at which point he gave up his day job as a graphic designer and took to painting full - time on canvas , with an astonishing degree of success .
A recent painting sold at auction for £ 78,500 .
Now , he divides his time between producing highly finished paintings for the gallery , and his street paintings , which are rough and made quickly .
Success has an inevitable price ; he 's had trouble with stalkers .
" An old man on a bicycle with a basket used to follow me around picking up my paintings .
I had to change my route to avoid him . "
These street paintings now go for £ 2,000 on eBay .
Not that Neate minds : " Of course some people sell them ; it 's human nature , " he says .
" It does n't bother me what happens to them once they 're gone . "
Andrew McAttee :
The fine artist
Before studying fine art at Central St Martins in London , McAttee was a graffiti artist , spray - painting large , colourful pieces on walls at night .
" I did n't take my graffiti painting into art school , " says the 35 - year - old .
" I separated the two and just did graffiti in the holidays .
" I never use my street tag in my canvases , but I think describing me as a sellout for working on canvas is a weak argument .
They 're completely different things .
" It 's frustrating that people try to pigeonhole me as a street artist or graffiti writer .
It 's all very tenuous . "
After leaving St Martins , McAttee worked on canvas for five years , then went through a crisis about his work and decided to go back to painting on the streets full - time .
" It was a kind of breakdown , " he says .
" From making grey canvases I went to spray - painting large pieces that were colour assaults .
It was a release of frustration . "
Influenced by Pop Art , comics and , of course , graffiti , he uses spray - paint and acrylic in acid candy colours – lilac , pink and blue – to make images that burst from the canvas in a psychedelic explosion .
It 's happy art , with not a hint of grim reality .
" I call it ' poptimism ' , " he says .
" I know it 's not for everyone . "
D*Face :
The player
" D " still works on the streets , using humble stickers as his tag , yet he is one of the more ambitious and professional street artists around .
From his well - organised studio , with a full - time assistant , he is putting together a museum exhibition of his work in Hamburg and gallery shows in New York and London – as well as continuing large - scale street work .
Recently he took over three billboards on the A3 , painting " Call in Sick " in giant letters for people driving past on their first day back to work after the New Year .
" I do n't see myself as a sellout [ for selling through galleries ] , " he says .
" It 's about integrity .
I work with museums and on the street — the two can co-exist .
I would rather live as an artist and make money from it than be a pure graffiti writer and have to take a second job in order to live . "
His works on paper and canvas , often featuring death and destruction , have a political anger against the injustices of consumerism and war .
His aesthetic is influenced by comics , skateboarding and punk .
Now in his mid-thirties , he started out as an illustrator who , frustrated with the creative constraints of his industry , took to graffiti in his spare time .
" It was just a way to fill a gap , " he says .
" It was n't such a big deal back then ; we just enjoyed it . "
Aroe :
The purist
A graffiti writer since the age of 13 , Aroe makes a strong distinction between what he does and " Hoxton trendy " street artists .
" Street art and graffiti are completely different , " he says .
I do graffiti just for the fame and for respect from peers within my sub-culture .
For those so - called street artists , it 's all about money .
They would be laughed off by proper graffiti artists .
It 's not about their work , it 's their attitude .
I 'm not interested in galleries .
" I 'm not a trained artist and I do n't look at it as something noble ; I 'm just writing my name – although I would never damage a private house . "
Aroe makes huge pieces the world over : he has covered buildings in San Francisco and Brighton and his tag adorns trains in India and Eastern Europe .
This year a music festival is inviting him to Senegal , to put on a graffiti showcase and give a masterclass .
While his attitude to his art may seem radical , his life is anything but .
In his late thirties , he lives in Brighton , where he has a house , a full - time job , long - term girlfriend and four children .
" Me and my girlfriend have a car each , " he says .
" I suppose you could say it 's a middle - class life , although I do n't really see myself as middle class . "
Cyclops and Sweet Toof :
The tag team
Cylops and Sweet Toof blend easily into the young artistic crowd that hangs around Brick Lane , east London – which is fortunate , as the pair wish to remain anonymous .
( They were recently arrested for some graffiti that looked similar to , but was not , their work : " The police kept us until 5 am , then let us go . " )
The distinguishing feature of their graffiti , which is all over east London , is a tooth , a skull and a character called Lenny .
" We do large - scale stuff , " says Sweet Toof , an affable type in his early thirties .
" We want to stop people in their tracks , or make them chuckle on their way to work .
It 's about reclaiming space .
We have to put up with advertising , that can take up the whole side of a building .
We have no say in that . "
Cyclops , a little angrier , adds : " Your opinion does n't count if you have no money . "
Both are trained artists : Sweet Toof graduated from the Royal College a few years ago ; Cyclops , in his late twenties , is still studying fine art .
Their gallery paintings sell for thousands , yet they have not abandoned the spirit of their work .
" With the gallery stuff , " says Sweet Toof , " it 's a disciplined approach for the canvas .
With the street stuff , it 's the other side where we can go out and paint the town red . "
Nick Walker :
The existentialist
The late , great director Stanley Kubrick employed Walker for his final film , Eyes Wide Shut , to recreate graffiti along the streets of New York .
" It was the worst style of graffiti ; it had to look as if it had been done by crack - heads , " says the 39 - year - old .
Walker never trained at art college .
He started his career as a graffiti painter , writing on the streets of Bristol .
It was when he moved to London that he started to work on feature films .
For Judge Dredd , the Sylvester Stallone vehicle , he studied Hebrew and Japanese letters to come up with a futuristic style .
He still works on the street but does not consider himself a graffiti artist .
" I 'm just an artist , " he says .
" That 's how I make my living . "
There is an existential flavour to his art .
" The whole thing with graffiti is that it 's about making your mark , leaving something behind , " he says .
" We are here to create . "
He uses images of butterflies , because they live for only a week , to depict the fragility of life .
" These butterflies shed their colour before they die , " he says , mournfully .
Not that his work is always so serious .
His Moona Lisa , for example , is an image of the Mona Lisa showing her bare behind to the viewer .

Congressional oversight office at NSA headquarters sits empty Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday March 4 , 2008
|
Print This Email This With lack of requests from Congress , GAO staff would ' twiddle their thumbs '
The Government Accountability Office -- Congress 's investigative arm -- has an office at the super - secretive National Security Agency 's headquarters , but it keeps no staff there because lawmakers have not made enough oversight requests , the agency 's head told Congress last week .
 We still actually do have space at the NSA .
We just dont use it and the reason we dont use it is were not getting any requests , you know , " Comptroller General David M. Walker told a Senate subcommittee Friday .
" So I dont want to have people sitting out there twiddling their thumbs . "
Walker 's comments were reported by Steven Aftergood at Secrecy News , the blog he runs as director of the Federation of American Scientists ' Project on Government Secrecy .
Aftergood also testified at the Senate Homeland Security oversight subcommittee hearing .
During the hearing , Aftergood stressed the need for oversight of an Intelligence Community with a growing budget and increasing reliance on private - sector contractors .
He said spending on contractors doubled between 1996 and 2006 .
" There are literally thousands of new contractual relationships between intelligence agencies and commercial entities that the intelligence oversight system is clearly equipped to regulate , oversee or even verify that they 're doing what they 're supposed to be doing , " Aftergood told the subcommittee , according to a transcript of the proceedings .
He said GAO would not be able to fully solve the intelligence oversight problems , but it would be able to make a " tangible contribution " as it does overseeing other aspects of the government .
Sen. Daniel Akaka ( D - HI ) , who chairs the subcommittee , has introduced legislation that would clarify GAO 's right to audit programs and financial activities of US intelligence agencies , according to CongressDaily .
Walker told the committee that the Intelligence Community has long been against GAO 's oversight efforts , but he said relationships with intelligence agencies was improving .
He said the GAO could evaluate management issues and reforms without exposing the " sources and methods " of the Intel Community .
Aftergood told the committee that Akaka 's bill likely would not overcome intelligence officials ' objections because they try to keep everything hidden under the same guise of protecting sources .
KATHMANDU ( Reuters ) - A controversial young Nepali girl worshipped by many Buddhists and Hindus as a Kumari , or “ living goddess ” , has given up her divine position following a request from her family , an official said on Sunday .
Sajani Shakya , 11 , the controversial young Nepali girl worshipped by many Buddhists and Hindus as a " Kumari " , or living goddess , smiles in her home at Bhaktapur in the Nepali capital of Kathmandu March 2 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Shruti Shrestha
The 11 - year - old Sajani Shakya was revered for nine years as the Kumari of the ancient temple - town of Bhaktapur , near Kathmandu , in a centuries - old tradition .
“ She is no more a Kumari , ” said Dipak Pandey , a senior official of the state - run Trust Corporation that oversees the cultural affairs in the deeply religious nation .
Pandey said Sajani ’s family wanted to perform their own religious rituals which required her to give up her divine position and rejoin her family .
Kumaris traditionally retire when they reach the age menstruation .
Last year , Sajani made international headlines after she visited the United States to promote a film by British company about the ancient practice .
Some religious authorities criticized the trip , saying it was against tradition .
They even threatened to strip her of the title , but the threat was later withdrawn .
Under the Kumari tradition a girl selected from a Buddhist Newar family through a rigorous cultural process becomes the “ living goddess ” .
She is considered as an incarnation of the powerful deity Kali and is revered by the Hindus and Buddhists until she menstruates after which she must return to the family and a new one is chosen .
“ We are trying to find a replacement for Sajani , ” Pandey said .
Some human rights activists have petitioned the Supreme Court to end the practice saying it denies the girl her normal life .
The apex court is yet to deliver a judgment .

At their height , the Blacks cut an imposing sight on the social scene .
For former media tycoon Lord Black of Crossharbour , it will be a rude awakening - at six in the morning - to his first day as an prisoner in a Florida jail .
Lord Black - or inmate 18330 - 424 as he is listed on the Federal Bureau of Prisons website - will climb out of the bunk bed in his prison dormitory , don his regulation green shirt and trousers and join the queue for the communal washing and toilet facilities .
Then , after a breakfast of " mediocre high - school cafeteria - type food " , he is likely to begin a tightly regulated day of " work - calls " , " controlled movements " and strictly defined " recreation time " before an early bedtime of 9 pm .
It is a far cry from what the 65 - year - old former chairman of Hollinger International is used to .
Before his six - and - a- half year sentence for fraud and obstruction of justice last year , multi-millionaire Black and his wife , journalist Barbara Amiel , had led what jurors heard described as a lifestyle of almost unbelievable excess .
The important thing about Conrad Black is that he has never felt that he needed to obey the rules
Tom Bower
Author of Conrad and Lady Black Money stolen from Hollinger shareholders helped to finance a life so lavish that the Blacks owned two Park Avenue apartments in New York - one of these set aside solely for the use of their servants .
Their butler even had his own American Express card to finance their spending sprees .
' Cosseted ' Black 's biographer Tom Bower predicted that the former multi-millionaire would be " traumatised " by his change in circumstances .
" He has been cosseted all his life , " said Mr Bower .
" He wo n't know how to handle it . "
A revealing insight into Black 's daily life for the next six and half years - or less depending on whether he earns points for good behaviour - is provided by the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex 's ( FCC ) Inmate Information Handbook .
The front cover of the 39 - page prison inmates manual .
Presented to every inmate on admission it provides a wealth of detail on inmates ' daily lives , the dos and don'ts of prison life and - in Black 's case , a telling contrast to the life he led on the outside .
As a " low - risk " inmate in Florida 's largest prison , Black will live in the Low Security Unit , where bars are at a minimum and the prisoners ' daily lives directed towards learning a trade for life after release .
With a fellow inmate for company in the dormitory - style cell , space and privacy are likely to be restricted .
These are not familiar surroundings for a man who at the height of his wealth owned mansions in Toronto and Palm Beach , apartments in New York , plus a luxury house in Kensington , west London .
And rather than the global movers and shakers who attended his lavish parties , experts say Black 's new companions will be prison guards as well as other non-violent low - risk offenders including drug dealers and child pornographers .
Stripped and searched Mr Bower , who helped expose Black 's profligacy in his book Conrad and Lady Black , said : " Conrad Black is a very arrogant man .
He will not like the idea of mixing with people who are poorer or less intelligent than he is .
He will find that very hard to deal with . "
On arrival Black will have been stripped , searched , given a medical examination and an identification card .
He would then have been issued with the standard prison clothing allowance , namely : four green shirts ; four pairs of green trousers ; four T - shirts ; a pair of safety shoes ; four sets of underwear and socks ; bed - sheets ; a belt ; a pillow and a few toiletries .
Black left his Palm Beach home for prison surrounded by the media .
Black will be required to wear this clothing at all times before 4 pm , apart from weekends , holidays and when he is en route to and from the recreation yard .
He will be also be " required " to tuck his shirt tails into his trousers during the work day .
For a man whose wife was revealed to have five separate closets in the their London townhouse for evening gowns , shoes and handbags , the contrast will be a marked one .
Regulations
And for someone used to having his own way , Black will discover that there are regulations governing his every move .
Among the prohibited acts are fighting , blackmail , extortion and stealing from other inmates .
Breaking these rules can result in loss of parole , or time spent in " disciplinary segregation " - solitary confinement .
Other , less serious infractions , include unauthorised use of the telephone , using abusive or obscene language and " unauthorised kissing or embracing " .
Mr Bower said : " I predict he will have major problems adjusting to the idea that other people can tell him what to do .
Black was driven the 220 miles to Coleman FCC " The important thing about Conrad Black is that he has never felt that he needed to obey the rules .
One of the reasons he stole so much money was that he genuinely felt the rules did not apply to him . "
Compared to his former jet - set lifestyle , the daily life of inmate 18330 - 424 is likely to be somewhat mundane .
With a taste for the finer things in life - his lifestyle was described to jurors as " champagne and caviar " - Black may need to adjust his culinary standards .
A former inmate told the Toronto Star that food at a US minimum - security prison was high in starch , with " lots of spaghetti and fried and baked chicken , macaroni and cheese " .
Black will be expected to hold down a job during his incarceration .
But instead of the £ 7 m that an internal company inquiry estimated he stole from shareholders , his rewards will be somewhat more modest .
Low pay Rates of pay in Coleman range from 23 cents ( 12 p ) an hour for unskilled jobs such as working in the laundry , to " First Grade " pay rates of $ 1.15 ( 55 p ) an hour for skilled workers such as carpenters or plumbers .
But while the pay may be a fraction of what he was used to earning , it is how much he is permitted to spend in prison that is likely to surprise him .
At his trial , the court heard how on a single day the Blacks spent $ 2.6 m ( £ 1.3 m ) on a diamond ring and $ 604,000 ( £ 302,000 ) on an antique brooch .
Over six years
Black billed his company $ 1.4 m ( £ 700,000 ) for staff wages alone .
Now he is in prison , he will be allowed to buy goods from the commissary to the value of $ 290 ( £ 145 ) a month .
Even that modest amount is regarded as a " privilege " , which can be withdrawn if rules are broken .
During his leisure periods
Black is likely to have access to a television in a communal area .
THE BLACK FACTFILE Born in Montreal in 1944 to a wealthy brewing family
At his height Black owned the Daily Telegraph and 400 smaller papers in North America
In 2004 his personal wealth was estimated at £ 175 m Married journalist Barbara Amiel in 1992 Became a life peer in 2001 after renouncing Canadian citizenship Sentenced to 6.5 years in a US prison for mail fraud and obstruction of justice
And from 4 pm to 8.30 pm every day he will be also be offered the choice of activities designed to " maintain a healthful living and the enjoyment of participating with others in structured activities " .
These include soccer , softball , cricket and " boccie ball " .
Compared with higher - security jails , the visiting rules for inmates in Coleman are relatively relaxed .
But when Black 's wife Barbara does visit him she will discover that while she is allowed to shake his hand , kiss and embrace him at the start and end of each visit , such behaviour is prohibited at all other times .
She herself will be subject to strict sartorial rules : no " provocative " clothes or styles " not in good taste " are permitted .
Skirts must be no higher than two inches above the knee and " plunging necklines " are banned .
One comfort for the couple will be that Coleman is just 220 miles - about three and half hours drive - from the Blacks ' beachfront home in Palm Springs home , scene of a reported " farewell party " for the disgraced peer over the weekend .
It means Lady Black is unlikely to avail herself of one of the local motels that the manual recommends for prison visitors - the Super 8 Motel at nearby Wildwood where room prices start at just $ 100 ( £ 50 ) a night .

I RickRolled 25,000 People .
If there were an island , named RickRollia , inhabited by wouldbe rickrollers , I would be the king of that island .
If there were a
“ lifetime achievement ” award , or perhaps a “ living legacy ” trophy for RickRolling , I would win it .
And , perhaps , they would rename it to the Russ Jones RickRolled Award of Excellence , which they would then give out in the future to those who aspire to my torchbearing greatness .
Why do you I say this ?
What have I done to deserve such RickRolling glory ?
I rickrolled Reddit .
If you are not familiar with reddit , it is much like Digg.com , only it does n’t suck .
Reddit allows you to vote up or down on stories submitted by their users .
Stories are then “ promoted ” to the first page if they receive a large enough number of up votes .
Â
If a story hits the front page , it is destined to get tens of thousands of visitors .
Alexa ranks it as the 1,163 most popular site on the web , reaching millions of people monthly .
So , I post the following headline : “ Rick Astley ( of RickRolld Fame ) Requests Youtube Remove Videos ” , an all - to - familiar pattern of artists demanding YouTube to remove their precious copyrighted materials .
But , of course , the link was tohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2b1D5w82yU&s=rss
Within a few hours , it was one of the top stories on Reddit , as users one - after - the - other were duped into visiting the Rick Astley music video .
So , how did I do ?
According to spez , the amazing site administrator who is ridiculously helpful for a site this large , let me know that …
“ 5928 clicks from logged - in users .
I ’m guessing that ’s about 10 % of the total . ”
I thought 50,000 + views was a little ambitious , so I checked the actual YouTube numbers .
Approximately 25,000 views between the time at which the story went live and this morning , when it finally dropped off the front page .
So , for the record , I rickrolled 25,000 people .
I win .

Michael Todd 's body was found on Snowdon
Michael Todd profile
Mr Todd , 50 , was found dead about 100 m from the summit of Snowdon on Tuesday afternoon , his body covered in snow .
There was no sign of trauma on his body and the north Wales coroner said a post - mortem examination had found " no obvious cause of death " .
The inquiry into his death is looking at the possibility of suicide .
Mr Todd had been off - duty on Monday and had spent the day walking in the Welsh mountains .
The alarm was raised after he sent the messages to various people , which caused concern for their safety and his own , the BBC has learnt .
The search for him began in the early hours of Tuesday but it was later in the day that hill walkers reported seeing a body near the summit of Snowdon .
His body was found on part of the mountain called Bwlch Glas at about 1500 GMT , with some of his outer clothes missing .
Sources said Mr Todd was found lying down on a sloping track next to a bottle of spirits .
Tests have found no obvious signs of trauma , suggesting he did not jump or fall to his death .
Further tests are being carried out to determine if any alcohol or drugs were in his blood .
Coroner Dewi Pritchard Jones said the post - mortem examination took place on Wednesday morning .
He added : " We 're hoping to have the toxicology done by tomorrow morning . "
A number of letters addressed to his loved ones have since been found but police said no letters were found at or near the scene of his death .
As a force we feel a huge loss with Michael , but it pales into insignificance to the loss his family are facing
Assistant Chief Constable David Thompson
Officers ' tributes
An inquest into Mr Todd 's death is to open on Thursday .
The father - of - three , who lived in a flat in Manchester city centre , was known to have previously separated from his wife .
The BBC has also learnt that Mr Todd suffered from bouts of depression , and had previously threatened suicide .
On Wednesday , a series of front line officers gave their tributes to their former chief , while Assistant Chief Constable David Thompson described Mr Todd as one of the " world 's best police leaders " .
" He put the Great back into Greater Manchester by his charismatic leadership , the trust and confidence he placed in all our staff and the new and innovative thinking he brought to the challenges we face and , of course , his unique sense of fun , " said Mr Thompson .
He said crime was down in Greater Manchester since 2002 when Mr Todd joined the force , which he had turned into an " effective crime fighting organisation " .
But he added : " As a force we feel a huge loss with Michael , but it pales into insignificance to the loss his family are facing .
And we 're offering them all the support we can at a really terrible time for them . "
One officer - 32 - year - old Pc Geoffrey Hince - described Mr Todd as a great leader whom he was honoured to work for .
" He was just a copper 's cop .
He wanted to get out there , he wanted to feel people 's collars , he got out there in the thick of it , " said Pc Hince .
Books of condolence have been opened at Manchester Cathedral and online at the Greater Manchester Police website .

In late October 2004 , when a military court sentenced Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick to eight years in prison , busted him to private , stripped him of pay , and handed him a dishonorable discharge for his involvement in the Abu Ghraib fiasco , Stanford University psychologist Phil Zimbardo reacted with anger and frustration .
It was n’t as though Frederick , who goes by “ Chip , ” had n’t done horrible things .
The 38 - year - old had admitted to his role in the very incident that came to symbolize the scandal — Frederick had been the one who ’d affixed wires to a hooded prisoner and told the man he’d be electrocuted if he stepped down from atop the flimsy box on which he stood .
The soldier also admitted he ’d sucker - punched another man , forced prisoners to masturbate publicly , and made detainees pile , naked , one atop the other .
To avoid a lengthier sentence , Frederick agreed to cooperate with prosecutors , and pleaded guilty to dereliction of duty , assault , conspiracy , maltreatment of detainees , and committing indecent acts .
Despite all of this , Zimbardo felt Frederick ’s sentence was too harsh .
The professor emeritus is an expert in the “ situational ” dynamics that can lead otherwise decent people to do wrong , or stand by while others do wrong .
As such , Frederick ’s defense team had hired him as an expert witness , but the psychologist ’s arguments for leniency went unheeded by judge and prosecutor .
“ Theirs was the standard individualism conception that is shared by most people in our culture , ” the professor writes in the preface of his recent book , The Lucifer Effect .
“ It is the idea that the fault was entirely ‘ dispositional , ’ the consequence of Sergeant Chip Frederick ’s freely chosen rational decision to engage in evil . ”
The Lucifer Effect describes at length Zimbardo ’s now - infamous 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment , designed to measure the degree to which situational dynamics affect people ’s behavior .
Paid student volunteers were split into two groups and asked to assume the roles of inmates and guards in a mock prison the research team had constructed in the basement of the campus psych building .
Although they knew it was just an experiment , these long - haired hippie kids ( they were “ against authority , ” Zimbardo notes ; “ nobody wanted to be a guard ” ) were subsumed by their roles within 48 hours .
The “ guards ” began heaping psychological abuses on their charges ( as superintendent , Zimbardo limited physical cruelty ) , whereas the “ prisoners , ” who could simply have quit , remained to do the guards ’ bidding .
“ A guard could say [ to a prisoner ] , ‘ Spit in his face , tell him he ’s a prick , tell him he ’s a bastard ’— they would punish their fellow prisoner , no question about it , ” Zimbardo told me .
“ Each day the level of psychological aggression escalated significantly on all of our measures until the prisoners started having emotional breakdowns . ”
Things got so out of control that Zimbardo halted the two - week experiment in just five days .
“ It ’s hard to believe , ” he says , “ that psychologically what started out as an experiment , where everybody knew it was a psychology experiment in a mock prison , in several days became a prison . ”
The same dynamic , he believes , is at play on Solitary , a reality TV show in which contestants are placed in isolation pods for up to 12 days and run through a series of arduous “ treatments ” by an all - seeing computer - voiced host .
( Although Zimbardo has n’t watched the show , I described to him the overall concept and some of what contestants endure . )
“ It starts off as a game , ” Zimbardo says .
But “ especially if you ’re talking about 12 days that they ’re living this thing , you lose your usual reality basis .
You lose whatever ethical stance you had , whatever sense of morality you had .
That ’s remote , and now it ’s a new sense of norms that control behavior in that situation .
When they get into that mode , there are no limits to what you could get those people to do .
Absolutely none . ”
Lincoln Hiatt , cocreator of the show along with Andrew Golder , did n’t put it quite that way , but he did profess a similar sentiment .
“ One of the reasons it really works , and one of my particular fascinations , is that we ’ve managed to achieve a kind of suspension of disbelief , ” he said .
“ Nobody believes this place existed someplace in the world and we just happened to drop in on it with our cameras .
We created this place .
But within that wholesale creation , as soon as the contestants are in the world and as soon as the audience is in the world , because we ’re very consistent with it , nobody questions it anymore . ”
Of course , Hiatt considers that good television , whereas the professor considers it a “ debasement of human nature . ”
Several years ago , Zimbardo says , he was working as a consultant for NBC , and the network producers wanted to do a show that explored the degree to which people would humiliate themselves in order to get on TV .
The casting call was ostensibly a competition to be on a subsequent reality program , he recalls .
In fact , the audition was the reality program .
“ The producers started coming up with , ‘ Let ’s try this , let ’s try that , ’ and they began to do these , and they were relatively mild compared to [ Solitary ] , ” Zimbardo says .
“ And I quit .
I said , ‘ This is a disgrace . ’
It became clear people would do anything , literally anything — have sex , disgrace themselves . ”
The psychologist also takes issue with Hiatt and Golder ’s contention that their contestants must want to be subjected to the rigors of Solitary since they are free to leave the show at any time , but do n’t .
His “ prisoners , ” after all , were free to leave , too .
The human brain , Zimbardo points out , is a rationalizing organ .
“ At any point you have to justify why you did this much , ” he says .
“ And once you do that , the next day is only slightly more horrendous , but it ’s horrendous nevertheless .
I ’m saying you lose your moral compass in those situations . ”

University of Nebraska - Lincoln particle physicists Ken Bloom and Aaron Dominguez have teamed up with computer scientist David Swanson to build a computing center for the benefit of scientists at their university and across the country .
The center ’s goal is to manage the flood of information that will pour from the world ’s next - generation particle accelerator , the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , an underground ring 27 kilometers around located at the European Centre for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) in Geneva , Switzerland , starting in mid-2008 .
Detectors stationed around the LHC ring will produce 15 trillion gigabytes of data every year , data that will be farmed out to computing centers worldwide .
The Nebraska center will allow physicists from many universities to analyze data from the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment — a more than 12,000 - ton detector that will record tracks created by hundreds of particles emerging from each collision in the accelerator — while also providing computing power for researchers in other scientific fields .
As CMS began looking for computing centers to host its data , professors Bloom and Dominguez considered whether such a project would suit the University of Nebraska .
" After talking with David Swanson , who directs our Research Computing Facility , we realized that this was an ideal project for us to collaborate on , " said Bloom .
In the LHC computing model , data from the experiments will flow through tiers .
The Tier 0 center at CERN takes the data directly from the experiments , stores a copy and sends it to Tier 1 sites .
CMS has seven Tier 1 sites in seven nations , and each site partitions its portion of the data based on the types of particles detected and sends these sub -samples off to Tier 2 sites .
At the Tier 2 sites , researchers and students finally get their hands on the data .
CMS has thirty such sites , seven in the U.S. , and one of these is at the University of Nebraska .
Physicists will use the data stored at these sites to search for never - before - seen particles or extra dimensions of space by submitting specialized programs to run on the data .
With forty U.S. institutions involved in the CMS collaboration , the seven centers will see a lot of traffic .
One of the challenges of building a Tier 2 site is preparing it for heavy data flow .
Already , the Nebraska group has achieved the fastest transfer rates in the national network that connects Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , the U.S. Tier 1 site , with the U.S. Tier 2 sites .
" We are really good at moving data from Fermilab to our Tier 2 center , " says Bloom without pretension – they have achieved the fastest rates for any Tier 1 - to - Tier 2 connection worldwide .
" We can manage a terabyte an hour easily , and a terabyte in half an hour is possible . "
Because the LHC will produce so much data , the terabyte , or 1,000 gigabytes , is the standard unit of data among scientists involved with LHC computing .
Apart from building lightning - fast network connections , Bloom and Dominguez are creating a computing center whose benefits extend beyond particle physics research .
According to Dominguez , " It ’s a challenge to build a facility that could be effectively shared with a worldwide community and local researchers , to make something bigger , better , more useful to university research as a whole . "
With this goal in mind , they designed a system that could support parallel computations .
Programs that perform multiple , simultaneous calculations on different processors and bring the results together at the end are powerful tools for chemists and nanoscientists in particular .
As the CMS Tier 2 site at University of Nebraska is part of the U.S. Open Science Grid , researchers from many fields will analyze data using its computing power during times when CMS researchers are n’t keeping the site busy .

A Washington - based anti-union group hopes to " jump - start a conversation " about the difficulty schools face in getting rid of bad teachers — with a contest that sounds as if it were designed for reality TV .
The Center for Union Facts will ask parents , students and other teachers Tuesday to nominate the " worst unionized teacher in America . "
The center says it will choose 10 and offer each $ 10,000 to quit ; " winners " must allow the center to write about them on its website .
The center plans full - page ads today in USA TODAYand The New York Times .
It also plans TV ads .
If the idea seems breathtaking in its political incorrectness , consider that it's the brainchild of Rick Berman , a union - bashing attorney known for his in - your - face attacks on consumer , safety and environmental groups .
" We 're not trying to humiliate anyone , " Berman says .
" We 're trying to jump - start a conversation that maybe people need severance packages to find themselves another line of work . "
Critics have long said collective - bargaining agreements in many school districts make it difficult , if not impossible , to fire poorly performing or misbehaving teachers .
" The next - best idea , " he says , " is to get people to voluntarily quit . "
Berman says he hopes to persuade education advocates to adopt his " severance package " idea as a school improvement strategy , much as they now view investing in innovative charter schools .
" Maybe we would n't need to fund charter schools if the public schools are pristine models of excellence on their own , " he says .
The contest will be hosted on Berman 's website , teachersunionexposed.com , which goes live Tuesday .
He says nominations must be backed up by written documentation , including police reports if criminal activity is alleged .
He also promises not to publish details about teachers who do n't consent to contest terms or accept the $ 10,000 award .
Edward McElroy , president of the American Federation of Teachers , says Berman " is coming after teachers at a time when most Americans support education and want to make improving education a top national priority . "
McElroy says the AFT " has been a longtime advocate for sound , common - sense public education policies , including high academic and conduct standards for students , and greater professionalism for teachers and school staff . "
But Berman says keeping poor teachers on the job " demoralizes the good ones . "
Rick Hess , an education researcher with the American Enterprise Institute , a Washington , D.C. , think tank , has mixed reactions to Berman 's plan .
He says unions and school districts are " not doing a good job of identifying ineffective teachers and removing them , so publicity which casts a light on that is helpful . "
But , he adds , " that kind of stunt is not what I have in mind when advocating a more informed and honest debate , or seeking to raise the level of debate . "
Hess co-wrote a study last month of collective - bargaining agreements in the USA 's top 50 school districts .
It found that while one - third have contracts that tie the hands of administrators , most agreements give them a fair measure of flexibility in firing poorly performing teachers .

It 's possible that the Linux desktop will never be anything more than a fad among geeky enthusiasts .
If so , a growing swell of people appear to be much more faddish of late , as numbers from W3Counter.com appear to indicate .
Looking at the data , Linux clearly has a ways to go .
But consider just how far it has come :
Linux went from 1.25 percent in May of 2007 to 2.02 percent in March of 2008 .
That is 61.6 percent increase in market share in nine months .
[ Put another way , ] that is 82 percent annual growth in installed computers .
These numbers do n't match up with similarly gathered data from Hitslink , which has Linux market share still hovering around 0.61 percent market share .
But even Hitslink shows strong growth over time : 41 percent - plus growth since May 2007 .
It 's not a perfect way to measure adoption .
It 's highly fallible .
But one thing does seem clear to me from the data : Linux on the desktop is growing .
It may only be growing within a small class of users , but it is growing .
But if my grandma can use it , perhaps that " small class " will grow , too .

Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s superdelegate advantage appears to be in danger .
A week ago , she had about 80 more public endorsements than Barack Obama .
That lead is now less than 60 , and the Clinton campaign is panicking , according to a Huffington Post story by Tom Edsall .
According to the article , the Clinton team is now trying to convince superdelegates to stay mum on endorsing and let the primaries play out .
Throughout the campaign , superdelegate silence has been considered the domain of Obama supporters who did n't want to muck with the process or , more likely , offend the Clinton political machine .
But now , with several polls showing Texas a toss - up and Clinton holding only a narrow lead over Obama in Ohio , there 's limited time to get on the bandwagon without looking too fairweather .
On Wednesday , Hillary lost the support of Texas State Rep. Senfronia Thompson and – after weeks of rumors – Georgia Rep. John Lewis , the revered civil right leader .
Following those defections came Thursday ’s announcement that Georgia Rep. John Barrow , who barely won re-election in 2006 , would be backing Obama .
ALSO : Former DNC Chairman Kenneth Curtis moved from Maine to Florida , where none of the delegates count , bringing Clinton 's count down by one and the overall superdelegate tally down to 794 .

Counting super - delegates is like an endless game of whack - a- mole : Every time you think you ’ve pinned them all down , another little bugger pops up and changes their mind .
A couple of weeks of intense press scrutiny shoved the 795 or so kingmakers into the spotlight , gauged their preferences , and now things seem to have settled .
Most remaining superdelegates seem either unwilling to pick a side or more than willing to wait it out .
When we launched our superdelegate site two weeks ago , we calculated that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( N.Y. ) led Sen. Barack Obama ( Ill. ) by a 222 to 128 margin .
As of last Wednesday afternoon , Clinton lead 247 to 168.5 — as of today , she leads 245 to 177.5 , with Obama snagging endorsements from prominent black figures in Pennsylvania and Ohio .
Remember , these numbers are estimates prone to mood swings , dips , and margins of error – every superdelegate , from Al Gore to an obscure committeeman from Oregon , can always switch their support .
And while Clinton still holds a numeric lead in superdelegates the dynamic of the race bodes well for Obama .
There is an emerging consensus among superdelegates that they should n’t override the pledged delegate results , and he ’s steadily chipping into Clinton ’s lead .
Superdelegates have become aware of their power and role in the party .
John Knutson , chairman of the Maine Democratic Party , announced his support for Barack Obama because he won the state 's caucus Feb. 10 . Rep. Ron Kind ( Wis. ) and Rep. Steve Kagen ( Wis. ) endorsed Obama because he won every Wisconsin district last Tuesday .
Sen . Russ Feingold , who admitted that he voted for Obama , said his performance in Wisconsin meant he 'd probably vote for him at the convention .
Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown , whose state is holding its primary March 4 , said last week he was staying uncommitted .
“ I just think , ‘ Let the voters decide , ’ ” Brown told Politico .
Michael Thurmond , the Georgia State Labor Commissioner , who endorsed Clinton in the primary , told the Atlanta - Journal Constitution that his endorsement does n't necessarily translate into a vote for her at the convention .
Rep. Jay Inslee ( Wash . ) seemed to back off his choice of Hillary because she lost the Washington caucus – before explaining that there had been a miscommunication and that he still supports the former first lady ’s White House bid .
To hold fire to the feet of any superdelegate who tries to vote against the wishes of his or her constituents , a gaggle of Democratic bloggers and activists have launched the Superdelegate Transparency Project .
( The Wall Street Journal also put together a handy list . )
Many superdelegates around the country , such as Jean Marie Lehrman of Montana and party chair Michael Cryor of Maryland , told Politico that they were going to wait to endorse , so that they could let Democratic voters decide .
That wait - and - see attitude likely works to the advantage of Obama , who has had a good couple of weeks .
New Jersey DNC member Roz Samuels and Rep. David Scott of Georgia both shifted their support from Clinton to Obama about two weeks ago .
This was followed by a reported rumor that Rep. John Lewis of Georgia was switching .
The veteran lawmaker later clarified his statement to suggest that while he was still endorsing Clinton , he was n't going to stand in Obama 's way .
All of these Democratic officials are African - American .
Then the SEIU endorsed Obama , snagging him the votes of Secretary - Treasurer Anna Burger and prompting a switch to Obama by Iowa DNC member Sarah Swisher , who had at different points endorsed Clinton and former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards .
While the machinations continue among existing superdelegates , there are still some slots to be filled .
An updated list of superdelegates provided by the Democratic National Committee to Politico ( officially " unpledged delegates " ) shows vacancies in Illinois , for two members - at - large , on the National Democratic Conference of Mayors and the National Democratic Seniors Coordinating council .
The list also reflects the ambiguity over the status of superdelegates from Michigan and Florida , which have been officially stripped of representation at the national convention in Denver .
No names of superdelegates from the Wolverine and Sunshine states were to be found on the list .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A New York man who discovered that millions of dollars had mysteriously appeared in his bank account , and withdrew more than $ 2 million , has been arrested on charges of grand larceny , prosecutors said on Wednesday .
Benjamin Lovell , 48 , pleaded innocent on Tuesday to charges that he withdrew money from a Commerce Bank account that had been opened by someone with the same name , prosecutors said .
The account belonged to Woodlawn Trustees Inc , a Delaware property management company , and was listed under the name of its finance director , who is also named Benjamin Lovell , court papers said .
Lovell had just $ 800 in his own Commerce Bank account when he went to make a deposit , but a teller , mistaking the Woodlawn account for Lovell ’s personal account , told him that his account contained more than $ 5 million , prosecutors said .
Lovell made multiple withdrawals even though he knew that the money was not his , prosecutors said .
He used the money to buy jewelry for his girlfriend and to make several investments , they said .
Commerce Bank and Woodlawn Trustees did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
The Legal Aid attorney representing Lovell could not be reached for comment either .
Lovell is being held on $ 3 million bail .
He faces up to 25 years behind bars if convicted , prosecutors said .
Ours are ominous times .
We are on the verge of eroding away our ozone layer .
Within decades we could face major oceanic flooding .
We are close to annihilating hundreds of exquisite animal species .
Soon our forests will be as bland as pavement .
Moreover , we now find ourselves on the verge of a new cold war .
But there is another threat , perhaps as dangerous :
We are eradicating a major cultural force , the muse behind much art and poetry and music .
We are annihilating melancholia .
A recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Center shows that almost 85 percent of Americans believe that they are very happy or at least pretty happy .
The psychological world is now abuzz with a new field , positive psychology , devoted to finding ways to enhance happiness through pleasure , engagement , and meaning .
Psychologists practicing this brand of therapy are leaders in a novel science , the science of happiness .
Mainstream publishers are learning from the self - help industry and printing thousands of books on how to be happy .
Doctors offer a wide array of drugs that might eradicate depression forever .
It seems truly an age of almost perfect contentment , a brave new world of persistent good fortune , joy without trouble , felicity with no penalty .
Why are most Americans so utterly willing to have an essential part of their hearts sliced away and discarded like so much waste ?
What are we to make of this American obsession with happiness , an obsession that could well lead to a sudden extinction of the creative impulse , that could result in an extermination as horrible as those foreshadowed by global warming and environmental crisis and nuclear proliferation ?
What drives this rage for complacency , this desperate contentment ?
Surely all this happiness can’t be for real .
How can so many people be happy in the midst of all the problems that beset our globe — not only the collective and apocalyptic ills but also those particular irritations that bedevil our everyday existences , those money issues and marital spats , those stifling vocations and lonely dawns ?
Are we to believe that four out of every five Americans can be content amid the general woe ?
Are some people lying , or are they simply afraid to be honest in a culture in which the status quo is nothing short of manic bliss ?
Are n’t we suspicious of this statistic ?
Are n’t we further troubled by our culture ’s overemphasis on happiness ?
Do n’t we fear that this rabid focus on exuberance leads to half - lives , to bland existences , to wastelands of mechanistic behavior ?
I for one am afraid that American culture ’s overemphasis on happiness at the expense of sadness might be dangerous , a wanton forgetting of an essential part of a full life .
I further am concerned that to desire only happiness in a world undoubtedly tragic is to become inauthentic , to settle for unrealistic abstractions that ignore concrete situations .
I am finally fearful of our society ’s efforts to expunge melancholia .
Without the agitations of the soul , would all of our magnificently yearning towers topple ?
Would our heart - torn symphonies cease ?
My fears grow out of my suspicion that the predominant form of American happiness breeds blandness .
This kind of happiness appears to disregard the value of sadness .
This brand of supposed joy , moreover , seems to foster an ignorance of life ’s enduring and vital polarity between agony and ecstasy , dejection and ebullience .
Trying to forget sadness and its integral place in the great rhythm of the cosmos , this sort of happiness insinuates that the blues are an aberrant state that should be cursed as weakness of will or removed with the help of a little pink pill .
I ’m not questioning joy in general .
For instance , I ’m not challenging that unbearable exuberance that suddenly emerges from long suffering .
I ’m not troubled by that hard - earned tranquillity that comes from long meditation on the world ’s sorrows .
I ’m not criticizing that slow - burning bliss that issues from a life spent helping those who hurt .
And I ’m not romanticizing clinical depression .
I realize that there are many lost souls out there who require medication to keep from killing themselves or harming their friends and families .
I ’m not questioning pharmaceutical therapies for the seriously depressed or simply to make existence bearable for so many with biochemical disorders .
I do , however , wonder why so many people experiencing melancholia are now taking pills simply to ease the pain .
Of course there is a fine line between what I ’m calling melancholia and what society calls depression .
In my mind , what separates the two is degree of activity .
Both forms are more or less chronic sadness that leads to continuing unease with how things are — persistent feelings that the world is not quite right , that it is a place of suffering , stupidity , and evil .
Depression ( as I see it , at least ) causes apathy in the face of this unease , lethargy approaching total paralysis , an inability to feel much of anything one way or another .
In contrast , melancholia generates a deep feeling in regard to this same anxiety , a turbulence of heart that results in an active questioning of the status quo , a perpetual longing to create new ways of being and seeing .
Our culture seems to confuse these two and thus treats melancholia as an aberrant state , a vile threat to our pervasive notions of happiness — happiness as immediate gratification , happiness as superficial comfort , happiness as static contentment .
Of course the question immediately arises :
Who would n’t question this apparently hollow form of American happiness ?
Are n’t all of us late at night , when we ’re honest with ourselves , opposed to shallow happiness ?
Most likely we are , but is n’t it possible that many of us fall into superficiality without knowing it ?
Are n’t some of us so smitten with the American dream that we have become brainwashed into believing that our sole purpose on this earth is to be happy ?
Does n’t this unwitting affection for happiness over sadness lead us to a one - sided life , to bliss without discomfort , bright noon with no night ?
My sense is that most of us have been duped by the American craze for happiness .
We might think that we ’re leading a truly honest existence , when we ’re really just behaving as predictably and artificially as robots , falling easily into well - worn “ happy ” behaviors , into the conventions of contentment .
Deceived , we miss out on the great interplay of the living cosmos , its luminous gloom , its terrible beauty .
The American dream of happiness might be a nightmare .
What passes for bliss could well be a dystopia of flaccid grins .
Our passion for felicity hints at an ominous hatred for all that grows and thrives and then dies .
I ’d hate for us to awaken one morning and regret what we ’ve done in the name of untroubled enjoyment .
I ’d hate for us to crawl out of our beds and walk out into a country denuded of gorgeous lonely roads and the grandeur of desolate hotels , of half - cracked geniuses and their frantic poems .
I ’d hate for us to come to consciousness when it ’s too late to live .
On November 30 , 1820 , as the autumn orange decayed into earth ’s winter muck , John Keats , suffering from the tuberculosis that killed his mother and his brother Tom , sat down to draft a letter to his good friend Charles Brown .
This was to be his last known correspondence .
Between horrific bouts of coughing — coughing that stained his tongue with blood —
Keats wrote these striking lines : “ I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past , and that I am leading a posthumous existence . ”
At the age of 25 , when he should have been relishing opportunities for love and for growth , for summer ’s larks and pretty girls , Keats already felt like a corpse .
It seemed to him as though he were already in the grave and therefore looking back on his days as one would witness a character in a finished story .
There he was , composing , viewing the world with a dead man ’s eyes .
When he was only nine years old , his father fell from his horse and died the next day .
A few years later , his mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis .
Though Keats nursed her assiduously , sitting up with her all hours of the night , cooking for her , reading to her , she died in 1810 , during Keats ’s 15th year .
Keats was assigned to a guardian and soon after taken from a beloved boarding school and required to apprentice as an apothecary .
He found the work tedious , for during these years , his late teens , he was awakening to the grandeurs of poetry , especially the verse of Spenser and Shakespeare .
To complete his training , Keats had to learn surgery .
Day after day , he toiled in a hospital , malodorous and bloody , where he witnessed nothing but suffering .
As he was turning from surgery to poetry , his first substantial poem , “ Endymion , ” was published in 1818 .
Two of the leading literary magazines of the time attacked the poem for not making sense .
Around this time , Keats ’s brother Tom died after a long and painful illness .
While attending Tom , Keats met the love of his life , Fanny Brawne , and became engaged to her .
However , he soon realized that he would never be able to marry her because he himself was doomed to fall prey to the same disease that killed his family members .
He knew he would die without ever consummating his ardent love .
One would think that Keats ’s life would have fostered bitterness in him , but he remained generous in the face of his difficulties .
He did n’t flee to the usual 19th - century escapes : Christianity or opium , drink or dreaming .
Though he unsurprisingly underwent pangs of serious melancholia ( who would n’t , faced with his disasters ? ) , he nonetheless never fell into self - pity or self - indulgent sorrow .
In fact , he consistently transformed his gloom , grown primarily from his experiences with death , into a vital source of beauty .
Things are gorgeous , he often claimed , because they die .
The porcelain rose is not as pretty as the one that decays .
Melancholia over time ’s passing is the proper stance for beholding beauty .
Keats understood that suffering and death are not aberrations to be cursed but necessary parts of a capacious existence , a personal history attuned to the plentiful polarity of the cosmos .
To deny death and calamity would be to live only a partial life , one devoid of creativity and beauty .
Keats welcomed his death so that he could live .
Taking this double stance — suffering death while transcending death — Keats was in his pain and yet above it .
He developed this interplay between detachment and attachment in one of his most famous letters , written in 1819 .
“ Do you not see how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence and make it a Soul ? ” he asked .
He ’s here implying that an abstract mind can develop into a full - hearted person only through enduring long periods of sadness and pain .
In another famous letter , this one from 1818 , Keats compares a human ’s life with a “ large Mansion of Many Apartments . ”
He states that the only way to engage the great mysteries of life is to suffer “ Misery and Heartbreak , Pain , Sickness and oppression . ”
Undergoing these troubles , one moves from the “ Chamber of Maiden Thought , ” the room of innocence , into darker passages , the regions of profound experience .
In this latter place , one finds the inspiration for poetry , poetry that explores the mysterious burdens of life .
In this case , too , Keats shows himself to be intensely aware of the painful world but also keenly willing to embrace this same pain .
It ’s as if he were somehow in the world but not of it , able to suffer sadness but also able to see beyond it .
In his 1819 “ Ode on Melancholy , ” he urges us not to alleviate our blues with befuddling chemicals , seek escape through suicide , or “ drown the wakeful anguish of the soul . ”
Remaining conscious of our dark moods , we might fall into a “ melancholy fit , ” a deep experience of life ’s transience but also of its beauty .
This melancholy fit is a mixed affair .
It falls from heaven “ like a weeping cloud , / That fosters the droop - headed flowers all . ”
But it also brings rain and nourishment .
Indeed , this cloud “ hides the green hill in an April shroud . ”
What can we call this fit but a meaningful experience of generative melancholy , of that strange feeling that sadness connects us to life ’s vibrant pulses ?
Alienated from home and happiness , we sense what is most essential : not comfort or contentment but authentic participation in life ’s grim interplay between stinking corpses and singing lemurs .
This “ fit ” shivers our souls .
In this tense mood , we are in a position to understand the relationship between beauty and death .
Keats urges us to “ glut ” our sorrow on a “ morning rose ” or “ on the rainbow of the salt sand - wave ” or “ on the wealth of globèd peonies . ”
He then says that if our “ mistress ” shows “ rich anger , ” we should take her hand and let her “ rave ” and “ feed deep , deep upon her peerless eyes . ”
Each of those recommendations features the melancholy soul ’s experiencing something beautiful but also something transient .
There is a connection among melancholy , beauty , and death .
These associations make for several conclusions .
The “ wakeful anguish ” of sharp melancholia can lead to a shuddering experience , a “ fit . ”
This vital moment grows from an insight into the nature of things :
Life grows from death ; death gives rise to life .
This insight animates melancholy , makes it vibrant .
But it also intensifies the pain , for it emphasizes this : Everything , no matter how beautiful , must die .
Rather than flee from this difficult position , the melancholic appreciates things all the more because they die .
In enjoying the beauty of the world , the melancholic himself wants to create beauty , to commemorate his resplendent experience of earth ’s transient gorgeousness .
Melancholia , far from a mere disease or weakness of will , is an almost miraculous invitation to transcend the banal status quo and imagine the untapped possibilities for existence .
Without melancholia , the earth would likely freeze over into a fixed state , as predictable as metal .
Only with the help of constant sorrow can this dying world be changed , enlivened , pushed to the new .
These are not metaphysical claims , not some New Age claptrap .
On the contrary , these statements are attuned to the sloppy world as it simply appears to us in our everyday experience .
When we , with apparent happiness , grab hard onto one ideology or another , this world suddenly seems to take on a static coherence , a rigid division between right and wrong .
The world in this way becomes uninteresting , dead .
But when we allow our melancholy mood to bloom in our hearts , this universe , formerly inanimate , comes suddenly to life .
Finite rules dissolve before infinite possibilities .
Happiness to us is no longer viable .
We want something more : joy .
Melancholia galvanizes us , shocks us to life .
Melancholia pushes against the easy “ either / or ” of the status quo .
It thrives in unexplored middle ground between oppositions , in the “ both / and . ”
It fosters fresh insights into relationships between oppositions , especially that great polarity life and death .
It encourages new ways of conceiving and naming the mysterious connections between antinomies .
It returns us to innocence , to the ability to play in the potential without being constrained to the actual .
Such respites from causality refresh our relationship to the world , grant us beautiful vistas , energize our hearts and our minds .
Indeed , the world is much of the time boring , controlled as it is by staid habits .
It seems overly familiar , tired , repetitious .
Then along comes what Keats calls the melancholy fit , and suddenly the planet again turns interesting .
The veil of familiarity falls away .
There before us shimmer bracing possibilities .
We are called to forge untested links to our environments .
We are summoned to be creative .
Given these virtues of melancholia , why are psychiatrists and psychologists attempting to “ cure ” depression as if it were a terrible disease ?
Obviously , those suffering severe depression — suicidal and bordering on psychosis — require serious medications .
But what of those who possess mild to moderate depression ?
Should these potential visionaries and innovators eradicate their melancholia with the help of a pill ?
Right now , if the statistics are correct , about 15 percent of Americans are not happy .
Soon , perhaps , with the help of psychopharmaceuticals , melancholics will become unknown .
That would be an unparalleled tragedy , equivalent in scope to the annihilation of the sperm whale or the golden eagle .
With no more melancholics , we would live in a world in which everyone simply accepted the status quo , in which everyone would simply be content with the given .
This would constitute a nightmare worthy of Philip K. Dick , a police state of Pollyannas , a flatland that offers nothing new under the sun .
Why are we pushing toward such a hellish condition ?
The answer is simple : fear .
Most hide behind a smile because they are afraid of facing the world ’s complexity , its vagueness , its terrible beauties .
If we stay safely ensconced behind our painted grins , then we wo n’t have to encounter the insecurities attendant upon dwelling in possibility , those anxious moments when one does n’t know this from that , when one could suddenly become almost anything at all .
Even though this anxiety , usually over death , is in the end exhilarating , a call to be creative , it is in the beginning rather horrifying , a feeling of hovering in an unpredictable abyss .
Most of us habitually flee from that state of mind , try to lose ourselves in distraction and good cheer .
We don inauthenticity as a mask , a disguise to protect us from the abyss .
To foster a society of total happiness is to concoct a culture of fear .
Do we really want to give away our courage for mere mirth ?
Are we ready to relinquish our most essential hearts for a good night ’s sleep , a season of contentment ?
We must resist the seductions of mindless happiness and somehow hold to our sadness .
We must find a way , difficult though it is , to be who we are , sullenness and all .
Suffering the gloom , inevitable as breath , we must further accept this fact that the world hates :
We are forever incomplete , fragments of some ungraspable whole .
Our unfinished natures — we are never pure actualities but always vague potentials — make life a constant struggle , a bout with the persistent unknown .
But this extension into the abyss is also our salvation .
To be only a fragment is always to strive for something beyond ourselves , something transcendent .
That striving is always an act of freedom , of choosing one road instead of another .
Though this labor is arduous — it requires constant attention to our mysterious and shifting interiors — it is also ecstatic , an almost infinite sounding of the exquisite riddles of Being .
To be against happiness is to embrace ecstasy .
Incompleteness is a call to life .
Fragmentation is freedom .
The exhilaration of never knowing anything fully is that you can perpetually imagine sublimities beyond reason .
On the margins of the known is the agile edge of existence .
This is the rapture , burning slow , of finishing a book that can never be completed , a flawed and conflicted text , vexed as twilight .

The results could increase the power of Ayatollah Khamenei ( L )
They did particularly well in the capital , Tehran , which is seen as the key to parliamentary power .
However , many of the conservative winners are critics of hard - line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Reformists saw a small increase in their representation , despite the disqualification of many of their proposed candidates .
They are claiming a relative success , given the circumstances of the poll .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says that if the new parliament causes problems for Mr Ahmadinejad , this will strengthen the supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei .
That , he adds , is likely to mean an even tougher line on Iran 's nuclear programme and its foreign policy .
Presidential battle
The conservative critics of Mr Ahmadinejad include the former nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani , who could become the new parliamentary speaker .
IRANIAN POLL Eighth parliamentary election since 1979 revolution 43 million eligible voters 290 seats from 30 provinces About 40 % of those who applied to stand disqualified by the Guardian Council
New challenges for president Iran in facts and figures
In pictures : Iran votes
Our correspondent says there could be quite a battle within the conservative camp to challenge Mr Ahmadinejad in the presidential elections next year .
Reformists had said the election was unfair , but still urged voters to turn out for the country 's eighth parliamentary elections since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Reformist candidates made up the bulk of about 1,700 candidates barred from running by Iran 's Guardian Council - an unelected body of clerics and jurists that vets election candidates .
The Guardian Council has denied bias .
' Cooked '
The Associated Press news agency reports that 188 out of 290 parliamentary seats have been decided so far .
Quoting state television and official news agency Irna , AP says pro-Ahmadinejad politicians have won about 70 seats , reformists 31 , and conservative critics of Mr Ahmadinejad about 43 .
Independents whose political leanings were not immediately known claimed 39 , the agency says , although reformists said at least 14 of these candidates were pro-reform - which would raise the reformists ' number of seats from 40 to 45 .
The remaining five seats are designated for Iran 's Jewish , Zoroastrian and Christian minorities .
At least 70 further races are expected to go to run-offs , the agency reported .
The EU criticised the conduct of the vote as " neither fair nor free " .
Washington said Iran 's leadership had " cooked " the election by barring reformists .

If I were the Chinese bureaucrat responsible for guarding the sacred Olympic flame , the place I ’d worry about most is Australia .
It was there , just before the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 , that a student pretending to be an Olympic athlete ran up to the mayor of Sydney and presented him with an " Olympic torch " consisting of burning underpants in a can nailed on top of a chair leg .
He was gone before they realized it was not the real thing .
His intention was to mock this pathetic neo-pagan ceremony that was originally invented by the Nazis to spice up the 1936 Olympics in Berlin .
The 1936 Olympics was Nazi Germany ’s coming - out party , so Hitler ’s people arranged for 3,442 racially pure Aryan runners to do a relay race with an " Olympic torch " along the 3,442 - kilometre route from the Temple of Hera on Mount Olympus to the stadium in Berlin .
There had never been a torch connected with the original Olympic games in ancient Greece , and the revived Games got along without an international relay race just fine for 40 years before the Berlin Olympics of 1936 — but if there was one thing the Nazis did well , it was propaganda .
Leni Riefenstahl even made a documentary film about how the torch came from Athens to Berlin ( and within five years , Hitler ’s armies had occupied all the countries along the route ) .
This year ’s Olympic Games were supposed to be Communist China ’s coming - out party , and the route is even more ambitious : 21 countries on all six inhabited continents .
But that includes Australia , and I really would n’t send the torch there if I wanted to preserve China ’s dignity .
As England is the spiritual homeland of irony , so is Australia the world capital of mockery , and by the time the torch gets there ( if it ever does ) , the Australians are going to feel challenged .
It was burning underpants in 1956 ; what might it be in 2008 ?
The bar will have been set quite high by the time the torch reaches Canberra .
After the propaganda triumphs for the " Free Tibet " movement in London , Paris , and San Francisco , the rain of humiliations for the Chinese regime may ease off for a while ( although I would n’t guarantee the torch an easy ride in Buenos Aires , either ) .
But after Dar es Salaam , Muscat , and Islamabad , where they do n’t care much about Tibet , comes New Delhi , where some people care a great deal .
There will be a lot of Tibetans in New Delhi , so the run there , if it happens , may resemble a low - intensity war .
Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , and Jakarta may be quiet , but then comes Canberra , where Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has already said that the track - suited Chinese thugs who have jogged alongside the torch bearers in other countries to fend off protesters will not be allowed to operate .
The " thug " description is courtesy of Sebastian Coe , the chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games , who was overheard on the phone saying that the organizers should " get rid of those guys .
They tried to push me out of the way three times .
They are horrible ” ¦I think they were thugs . "
It has become a nightmare for the poor , doomed Chinese bureaucrats who set this thing up : constant humiliations if they carry on with the planned route ( which also goes through Tibet itself ! ) and utter humiliation if they cancel it .
For the moment , they are brazening it out .
" The Olympic flame belongs to the people around the world , " said Wang Hui , a spokesman for the Beijing Olympic organizing committee , " so the behaviour of a few separatists would not gain sympathy from people and will cause strong criticism and is doomed to fail . "
So far , though , I have n’t been hearing much criticism .
Never mind the silly torch and the equally bizarre three - layer cake that is the actual Olympics Games of today .
( An international athletics competition on the bottom , an orgy of nationalist self - congratulation in the middle , and a sickly sweet pantomime of international love and brotherhood on the top . )
What ’s actually colliding here are two irreconcilable views of the world .
For almost all Chinese , the turmoil in Tibet is a threat to national unity .
Only in the past century have Tibet and the Turkish - speaking , Muslim province of Sinkiang come to be seen as a necessary part of that national unity , but they are now .
Chinese propaganda insists that the local people support that consensus , but it makes no difference if they do n’t .
They have to stay , because national unity is at stake .
For almost everybody else , China and Tibet is obviously a colonial relationship , and it ’s perfectly natural for the Tibetans to seek independence .
They wo n’t get it this time around , and they may never get it , but why would you be surprised that they try ?
Indeed , why would n’t you support them ?
Foreign governments will never support Tibet ’s independence , because they depend on China ’s trade and they value " stability " in China above all else .
Foreign individuals are under no such constraints , and the interminable , multinational tour of the torch is giving them a lot of opportunities to show their feelings .
It is n’t " anti-Chinese " , just pro-Tibetan , but there will be much anger and many hurt feelings by the time this is done .

Feb. 21 , 2008  --
If you thought " Grey 's Anatomy " writers invented Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome ( PSAS ) , think again .
PSAS , identified and named just six years ago , remains a mysterious condition that thousands of women wish they did n't have .
They are constantly on the edge of orgasm regardless of time , place or circumstance .
And while this situation might sound desirable , funny or just plain weird it is actually akin to being a prisoner : a nightmarish reality where a woman 's body acts independently of her own desires .
ABC News spoke with four women who all experience unwanted sexual sensations .
Heather Dearmon , Nancy Austin , and two women who requested anonymity ( referred to as Lauren and Emily ) all suffer from unintended sexual arousal .
" It 's unwanted sexual sensations in your vagina , " Dearmon said .
" And sex does n't help it , " Lauren said .
" Orgasm does n't relieve it , sometimes it makes it stronger .
This is to me , irritating , torture . "
" You spend a lot of time avoiding situations that will set you off , " Austin chimed in .
Dr. Irwin Goldstein , a professor of surgery at UC San Diego and the head of the Sexual Health Program at Alvarado Hospital , is one of the few researchers studying it .
" It 's spontaneous , intrusive , and unwanted genital arousal — consisting of throbbing , pulsing or tingling without the person 's sexual interest or desire , " Dr. Goldstein said .
Searching for the Cause
Dearmon , Austin , Lauren and Emily searched for years to find out what was wrong but their doctors could n't help them .
" I thought I was alone in this , " Dearmon said .
" And this is after seeing every kind of doctor imaginable , gynecologist , psychologist , psychiatrist — you know , everything .
And none had ever heard of anything . "
The medical consultations were not only confusing but , at times , condescending .
Dearmon said one of her doctors told her to get a hobby , and another doctor suggested she become a lesbian .
Dr. Goldstein thinks thousands of women may suffer from PSAS , but the actual number is not known because so few seek a doctor 's help -- and most doctors do not know about it .
" Every lecture I give on this , there 's always smirks in the audience : ' Oh I wish my wife was like this . '
These are professional physicians , " Dr. Goldstein said .
" And I said , ' No , no , you 're , you do n't really want this .
You do not want your wife to have this , please . ' "
Constant sexual arousal is not due to raging hormones .
In fact , it is n't at all sexual in nature .
Nobody really knows what causes this strange ailment , or what sets off these sensations .
" Is it coming from the brain ?
Is it coming from the body ?
Is it , is it a nerve ? "
Emily asked .
Men can have a similar problem with unwanted and prolonged arousal called Priapism , which is an engorged penis lasting for more than four hours .
In males it is a medical emergency that includes complications such as blood clots and gangrene .
PSAS affects women differently , but the impact upon their lives can be equally devastating .
" Their genitals are aroused 24/7 , 365 and they can't concentrate , " Dr. Goldstein said .
" They can't work .
Anything that moves or vibrates will lead them into orgasmic release . "
Dearmon was one of those women who had symptoms day - in and day - out .
" It 's like it 's living on its own , with its own mind , " she said .
Living with the Symptoms
Dearmon and her husband Jeremy have been dealing with PSAS since it began during her pregnancy 12 years ago .
" I felt like I lost myself , " Dearmon said .
At first , they thought the sensations would stop when she gave birth .
Instead they intensified , lasting 24 hours a day .
Dearmon found only one way to stop them .
" I was masturbating in the morning , in the afternoon , and at night , " Dearmon said .
" I would be crying while I was , you know , masturbating because — nobody wants to do that all day long . "
Dearmon is not a nymphomaniac : none of these women are .
They hate the constant sexual arousal .
Pinpointing the cause is difficult but Dr. Goldstein thinks one source may be a brain reflex gone awry .
" You could visualize at some level that this is a form of recurrent seizure activity — an area of the brain that activates without the person 's permission , " he said .
Brain scans of patients have turned up nothing yet , but the research is continuing .
Without knowing the cause , treatment can be difficult , especially because the syndrome varies among patients .
Dearmon 's PSAS began in pregnancy but Lauren 's problem has been lifelong .
" I can remember episodes when I was three , " Lauren said .
Emily 's PSAS also began when she was a toddler .
She remembers always moving her legs to stop the " itch . "
" I always knew it was n't normal — but I knew nothing else , " Emily said .
Austin's PSAS began after menopause .
Her doctor tried to block the nerves to her genital area , via an extremely painful process .
But even that did n't work .
The women who suffer often resort to home remedies in an effort to get some relief .
" We have a woman who ices a condom and puts the condom in the genitalia to basically survive the day , " Dr. Goldstein said .
Nancy tried ice , but found it too cold .
Dearmon has also tried ice , and creams , but to no avail .
PSAS still found a way to intrude on their lives .
It even ended Lauren 's relationship with her boyfriend
" I 'd go sleep in the other room so I would n't wake him up with my thrashing , " Lauren said .
" You 're flapping around , your legs are moving just to — it 's like a tickle that you can't get to . "
Lauren tried using vibrators but they only provided temporary relief .
" It works at the moment , but as soon as you stop , it 's right back there again , " she said .
And as she gets older , the symptoms get worse .
" Now it 's every night , " she said .
" I do n't sleep for days sometimes , maybe an hour at about five in the morning . "
" I just want to sleep , " Lauren said tearfully .
" I just want to be normal .
I want to sleep .
That 's what I want . "
" It 's Not Something We've Chosen "
Nancy said she would n't wish this on her worst enemy .
" You do n't make fun of people who are sick , " Dearmon said .
" To me this is a sickness .
This is not , it 's not something we 've chosen . "
All of the women told " Primetime " it was not a yearning for sex .
Some women are so desperate to end PSAS they try electroshock therapy .
So far it has produced uneven results , but Dr. Goldstein thinks it is helping " re-set " the brain in at least one of his patients .
" The electroconvulsive therapy causes her to re-regulate her sexual reflex , and she no longer has PSAS , " he said .
Dearmon said if she knew for sure the electric shock therapy could work she would try it .
She has even considered surgery " just to cut everything off down there . "
" I would rather never have another orgasm in my life for the rest of my life — than to have this problem , " she said .
Dr. Goldstein is also experimenting with a new drug that affects the brain 's dopamine levels .
So far it has shown some success , but more research will be needed to decide if it is effective .
Desperate Measures
Dearmon , a poet and artist , kept trying to tame what she called her " beast . "
But the beast kept winning until she decided there was only one way out -- to take her own life .
" I was going to commit suicide , I mean it was that bad , " Dearmon said .
" She just really got to the end of her rope , " Jeremy said .
Frightened by her suicidal thoughts , Dearmon committed herself to a psychiatric hospital
" And the nurse came in and said , ' Honey , I wish I could stay home and masturbate all day long . '
I 'm like in the psychiatric ward because I 'm going to take my life and , and here you are belittling me , " Dearmon said .
And then one day , while glancing at a magazine at the barbershop , Jeremy discovered an article that described his wife 's symptoms exactly .
" She immediately started crying — like oh my God , you know , I 'm not alone , " Jeremy said .
Dearmon now takes an anti-depressant .
It does n't work for everyone with PSAS , but it does help reduce her symptoms to a more manageable level .
Even so , PSAS permeates every aspect of her life and marriage .
Because sex triggers even stronger symptoms Dearmon sometimes avoids it altogether .
" I would tell him that , you know , I , I was having my problems bad , " Heather said .
" You can't fix it , so it 's like , hard , you know , hard to respond sometimes , " Jeremy said .
" It 's not like he could n't satisfy me sexually , " Dearmon said .
" It had nothing to do with him , there was just something going on in my body that I had no control over . "
" We can only be affectionate at certain times so there 's not like the casual kissing for us , so yeah , we need to take that easy , " Jeremy said .
" That 's part of dealing with our — problem . "
Despite PSAS Dearmon and Jeremy remain committed .
" I believe we 're honestly happily married — it's what we still choose , you know , we love one another , " Jeremy said .

US firms likened with al Qaeda on Indian campus over ethics John Byrne

A rising tide of India 's scientists and engineers in waiting are aiming to blockade US arms and chemical corporations from recruiting at the Indian Institutes of Technology .
Students and faculty see three US companies -- Dow Chemical , Halliburton and Lockheed Martin -- as symbols of America 's toxic influence in business ethics , according to a report Sunday in the Calcutta Telegraph .
According to the paper , " students and faculty want the companies to be scrutinized for their past record in business ethics , environmental issues and human rights before being allowed into any IIT campus . "
 We dont allow al Qaida to come and recruit from our campuses .
There clearly is some line which has to be drawn ,  Siddharth Sareeen , an IIT Madras student , told the paper .
Dow Chemical 's notorious history in India involves the Union Carbide disaster , a massive chemical leak in 1984 .
The company 's plant in Bhopal , India released 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas , immediately killing 2,500 to 5,000 people .
The subsequent death total has climbed to 20,000 ; an estimated 120,000 continue to suffer from its effects .
Photographs of skulls of the dead collected after the disaster are shown above right .
Dow did not own Union Carbide at the time .
They acquired the company in 1999 .
Students and professors also condemn the company for its production of napalm .
 Dow s history , particularly its role in the Vietnam war , is an important reason for our opposition ,  Milind Brahme , assistant professor at IIT Madras , told the Telegraph .
Dow and Halliburton are looking to send recruiters to the Indian campuses , while Lockheed is looking to specifically partner with specific departments , the paper asserts .
Lockheed Martin is cited for its role as an arms dealer as one of the world 's largest defense contractors .
Students rebuke Halliburton for its association with Iraq and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Madras ' Institute of Technology invited
Dow to a debate on whether they should be allowed to recruit on campus Friday .
They did not send an envoy .
At IIT Madras on Friday , students and faculty  including some who believe Dow should be allowed to come to the campus  held a debate .
They had invited a Dow representative to participate , but the company did not send one .
 Our officials who were to visit the campus could not come on the pre-decided date as other meetings suddenly came up ,  Nand Kumar Sanglikar , Dow Indias spokesperson , told the paper .
 We are expanding in India .
We want the best brains in the country to join us . 

THE planet Earth has dismissed claims it is in danger from global warming , insisting the most likely outcome is the extinction of humans .
The Earth broke its silence after years of environmental campaigns urging people to ‘ Save the Planet ’ .
Earth said : “ I ’ll be absolutely fine , seriously .
I might get a bit warmer and a bit wetter , but that actually sounds quite nice .
Try living through an ice age .
Pardon my French , but it ’s absolutely fucking freezing . ”
The four billion year - old planet , based 93 million miles from the Sun , said it was ‘ sick and tired ’ of being drawn into arguments about human behaviour .
“ Look , I ’m just a planet doing its thing , alright ?
If you want to live on me , that ’s your business , but I ’ve got important planet stuff to do .
Try being in elliptical orbit , or balancing your gravitational pull with a medium - sized moon .
Trust me , it ’s difficult . ”
The planet said environmental campaigners should change their slogan from ‘ Save the Planet ’ to something more relevant such as ‘ Save Your Sorry Arse ’ .
Earth added : “ Okay , so there may come a time when I am no longer able to support pandas , polar bears , and humans , but you know what ?
Life goes on .
“ Who knows , I might end up being a haven for toads . ”
Mr Sarkozy also announced hundreds more French troops for Afghanistan President Nicolas Sarkozy says France will make a decision on Nato by the end of the year , indicating it will return to the organisation 's military command .
He told a Nato summit the move would come at the end of France 's six - month EU presidency later this year .
France withdrew from Nato 's military structure in 1966 in protest at the dominance of US commanders .
The summit will discuss links with Georgia and Ukraine after Nato said it would not offer them membership .
France and Germany had opposed US calls for the two former Soviet republics to be allowed to join the alliance .
Afghan battalion
At the second day of the summit in Bucharest , Romania , Mr Sarkozy said : " I reaffirm here France 's determination to pursue the process of renovating its relations with Nato .
" At the end of the French [ EU ] presidency [ on 31 December this year ] the moment will have come to conclude this process and to take the necessary decisions for France to take its full place in Nato 's structures . "
France withdrew from Nato in 1966 over US dominance in the alliance Analysts say France 's full return to Nato could be formally announced at the alliance 's next summit in April 2009 .
France has not taken full part in Nato 's integrated military command since former president Charles de Gaulle withdrew , although it rejoined the military committee more than a decade ago .
Mr Sarkozy also confirmed on Thursday that France would deploy a battalion - about 800 troops - to eastern Afghanistan , easing fears of a crisis within the Western coalition there .
France currently has 1,430 troops in Afghanistan as part of a 47,000 - strong Nato force .
US President George W Bush said the move would free up some of its troops to bolster Canadian forces in the south .
Canada has threatened to withdraw its contingent in Kandahar province unless other Nato countries sent reinforcements .
On Thursday , Mr Bush and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown are expected to urge more Nato members to commit troops or extra resources to the battle against the Taleban .
' Poisoned atmosphere '
The BBC's Jonathan Marcus in Bucharest says Mr Sarkozy 's announcement is a piece of good news after the summit atmosphere was poisoned by a night of diplomatic wrangling .
Mr Bush had wanted Nato membership invitations to three new members - Albania , Croatia and Macedonia .
He had also sought membership action plans for Georgia and Ukraine , a kind of enhanced partnership that would set them firmly on the path to Nato membership .
But the Americans seem to have badly judged the mood , says our diplomatic correspondent .
Greece strongly opposed Macedonia 's membership due to a dispute over the country 's name .
Germany and France resolutely opposed closer ties with Georgia and Ukraine .
And there was sufficient support for the objectors to thwart US ambitions .
Our correspondent says damage limitation is now the order of the day - Albania and Croatia will be asked to join .
Nato spokesmen insist Macedonia will get its invitation once the name issue is resolved and a membership action plan for Georgia and Ukraine is not a matter of if , they say , but when .

What are these ?
I occasionally receive IMs from people who ask “ why do I have you on my buddy list ? ”
Most of the time I do n’t have them on my buddy list , so I have no idea why I am on theirs .
I will make up something like “ I bought weed from your mom ” or “ You !
You owe me back child support ! ” and then I never hear from them again .
Mission accomplished .

As the mortgage and financial crisis continues to notch more victims , the question on many economists ' minds is not whether a recession will happen , but how deep it will get and how long it will last .
But one prominent voice thinks the high - flying finance industry is n't going to bounce back – and that we 'll need to look elsewhere to set the U.S. economy back on firm footing .
Eric Janszen is an angel investor and founder of the contrarian market website iTulip.com , which The New York Times credited with " accurately predicting that the [ internet ] bubble would pop . "
Now Janszen believes the American economy needs a fundamental restructuring away from its foundations in finance , insurance and real estate .
His prescription : a new bubble based on green technologies .
In a widely discussed Harper 's article in February , " The Next Bubble : Priming the Markets for Tomorrow 's Crash , " Janszen argued that clean tech is the only sector that could create enough " fictitious value " to replace the losses from the housing bubble , if only temporarily .
Neither a clean - tech skeptic nor a booster , he wrote , " Given the current state of our economy , the only thing worse than a new bubble would be its absence . "
Wired.com recently spoke with Janszen to discuss the state of the economy , his plan to pay for alternative energy with a tariff on oil , and how running fiber to your home is good energy policy .
__Wired : __Though you focus on clean tech , you are making a broader argument about the U.S. economy and its reliance on the finance industry .
How is the economy now bubble - based ?
__Eric Janszen : __The elevator pitch is that we 've gone through a series of asset - price inflations that started back in 1995 .
What really kicked the whole series off were some changes that the Feds made to the U.S. banking system to get us out of the recession that we were in during the early 1990s .
That facilitated the beginnings of a growth in credit that supported the two bubbles : internet and real estate .
__Wired : __And you argue that the next step is a clean - tech bubble that could create $ 20 trillion of fictitious wealth ?
__Janszen : __It 's not really a bubble .
I think of it as a legitimate use of the way that our economy works and [ how ] our financial markets function now .
The alternative title for the Harper 's piece was " The Good Bubble . "
Clean tech could be an extremely efficient use of capital .
My editors over at Harper 's wanted to make this thing as controversial as possible .
My forthcoming book goes deeper into the issue of how we 're going into the period of time where the FIRE – finance , insurance and real estate – economy is in a steep decline .
Within a year or so , it 's going to be very obvious that resuscitating it in its old form will be impossible .
What 's going to be necessary are some structural changes to the economy that are longer - term and somewhat more painful .
__Wired : __What kind of structural changes are you talking about ?
__Janszen : __Reduction of dependency on debt financing to stimulate the economy .
Over the last seven years , every new job that has been created has resulted in $ 1.8 million of new public - and private - sector debt .
That 's obviously not sustainable .
That 's way too inefficient .
It used to be about 50 cents of new debt was required to generate $ 1 in gross - domestic - product growth .
Now it 's $ 9 for $ 1 of GDP growth .
__Wired : __How bad do you think the U.S. economy is going to get ?
__Janszen : __It 's going to surprise people .
The impact that housing is having on our credit system is just starting to be felt .
It 's not clear , in the absence of the concerted effort to make investments in the clean - tech sector , what geographies or sectors are going to pull the U.S. out of the recession .
What tends to happen is that policymakers survey this scene and say : " What are we going to do to get people working ? "
The focus on one sector of the economy can drag us out .
__Wired :
__You propose several prospective sectors to do that , including health care and biotechnology , but toss them out .
Why is clean tech different ?
__Janszen : __Alternative energy and infrastructure is the only area of the economy that is scalable and politically expedient .
I mean infrastructure in economic terms , so [ that includes ] roads , bridges , communications and the energy infrastructure .
__Wired : __You do n't mention carbon dioxide emissions , anthropogenic global warming or the environment a single time in the Harper 's article .
Do you believe that there is the need for alternative energy because of environmental realities , or are economics or politics driving these investments ?
__Janszen : __My own feeling , when I look at what would be entailed in digging tar sands up so we can keep driving big cars , is that I 'd do everything I could to prevent that .
The first order of business is conservation .
Real political leadership means putting together long - term interest ahead of short , and it 's clearly in the long - term interest to look at the environment .
__Wired :
__Is it possible to have an energy policy that promotes alternative energy without promoting a bubble ?
__Janszen : __Absolutely .
The whole mechanism of financing these speculative bubbles needs to change .
What 'll happen is that we 'll revert back to how markets should operate .
Capital will be much more risk - averse .
__Wired : __What do you see as the nascent financing and credit vehicles that could come up with the trillions of dollars needed to finance clean tech without creating a bubble ?
__Janszen : __One way to do it is to put a floating tariff on the price of oil and gradually raise the price up to $ 200 or $ 300 a barrel .
As long as you do it gradually , the economy can respond to it .
That 's the beauty of our system .
It has responded very calmly to an increase from $ 20 to $ 100 .
The economy has n't collapsed .
It 's definitely slowing , but it 's not wrecking it .
You could create a process that gradually forced a lot of relatively painless transition without wrecking the economy .
__Wired : __What types of infrastructure changes would be part of that transition ?
__Janszen : __Transportation .
The big capital - intensive effort is high - speed rail .
You need government to get its act together to pull something off .
I 'm also proposing public - private corporations that have the deep pockets of government but the obligations to shareholders of a private corporation .
There are going to be market mechanisms , so you do n't end up years late and billions of dollars over budget .
Another part of it is energy infrastructure .
It 's an archaic system with a lot of coal power .
I 'm suggesting a lot of nukes , but modern ones – pebble - bed reactors .
Communications is also a big part of it .
If the high - level objective is to reduce the energy intensity of the U.S. economy , why do n't we run fiber - optic cable to everyone 's house ?
That will support applications to allow people to stop commuting .
It has to be a comprehensive , well - thought - out plan .
We have to use less energy , period .
Q. So what happened ?
A. NeuStar sent our engineers into a locked conference room , and we did n’t let them out until they came back with a better solution .
It was a number pooling system that we proposed to the industry and the Federal Communications Commission .
It was mandated by the F.C.C. so that all telephone companies must adhere to it .
As a result , the life of the 10 - digit telephone number system now extends beyond 2030 or 2035 .
Q. What ’s the concept of pooling in a nutshell ?
A . It used to be when a telephone company needed a number , the smallest block of numbers we could give them was 10,000 numbers , or the equivalent of an entire local exchange .
If you were a telephone company and had a single customer in a town , you ’d come to me and I ’d have to give you an area code , say 422 , and all 10,000 numbers that come with that .
But we used an advanced technology in the routing database and , for the first time , were able to allocate blocks of 1,000 telephone numbers .
Q . So it was your company that was involved in deciding that some people in Manhattan could not have 212 numbers but instead had to have 646 area codes ?
A. I knew that NeuStar was playing an important role in the industry when I saw there was a “ Seinfeld ” episode on exactly that problem .
The fact is , there are only so many telephone numbers associated with any one area code .
So with the explosive growth in the number of telephones and network endpoints , there ’s been a huge demand , and area codes have been altered .
What ’s a fascinating twist on this , it used to be that when you dialed a 212 area code number , you knew you were dialing a telephone number on the island of Manhattan .
Now with the coming of voice over the Internet , VoIP , you can dial a 212 telephone number and have the number ring a phone in Buenos Aires or Moscow .
The significance of telephone numbers has changed .
The system is becoming much more complex and increasingly requires the routing capability of the central directory that NeuStar manages on behalf of all networks .
Q . What other areas have had to introduce new area codes ?
A . It has n’t happened just in established cities but also in rural areas as well .
That ’s where the growth often has been the fastest .
Frequently , some of the exurbs that have grown very quickly over the past 10 years have required new area codes to bolster the supply of telephone numbers to meet demand .
Sterling , Va. , where our company is based , now has a 571 area code that supplements the 703 area code that covers much of northern Virginia .
Q. Why did you spin off from Lockheed Martin in 1999 ?
Why would n’t they want to keep you ?
A. When NeuStar got started , this business had never existed before .
For the first time , rivals from different telephone companies had to sit at a table and say , “ For the common good , we need an independent company to provide a trusted routing directory we all will depend upon .
Each of us will put information about all our customers and where their telephone calls should be routed into this database . ”
AT&T , Verizon , TMobile and Comcast do n’t trust each other  they are competitors .
But they trust NeuStar to hold this very valuable data .
So we needed to manage the trust of those competing carriers , and part of that trust was a contractual pledge that we would be neutral , hence the name .
Separately , Lockheed Martin was acquiring Comsat , a carrier .
As a result , they had to divest either Comsat or NeuStar .
Even the appearance of NeuStar managing telephone numbers in favor of a network owned by the corporate parent would have violated that trust .
LOS ANGELES – Sex , death and mind games are just another day on the job for Tricia Helfer , the honey - haired actress who plays Battlestar Galactica 's skin- job Cylon Six .
Her character 's intensity – and Six 's propensity for dying horribly brutal deaths , only to be reincarnated , Cylon - style – might intimidate fanboys who spot Helfer at sci- fi conventions .
But she 's really just an easy - going Canadian farm girl made good , far from the angry and erotic part she brings to life on the show .
At a recent party at Electronic Arts ' Playa Vista headquarters , Helfer showed up in skin - tight blue jeans , a red silk tank top and 4 - inch stiletto heels to promote the videogame Command & Conquer 3 : Tiberium Wars ( she plays Gen. Kilian Qatar in the game 's videos ) .
Settling into a lounge chair , she chatted with Wired.com about sci- fi fanboys , sex , Six and Battlestar Galactica , which begins its final season Friday on SciFi Channel .
Wired : On Battlestar Galactica , you 're pretty tough .
Do people get intimidated by that ?
Tricia Helfer :
It 's almost like they do n't want to come too close – I 'm sitting there smiling , being friendly , and it's as if they do n't really want to disturb you , like I might actually be the kind of intense , angry person I play in the show .
Wired :
You make a lot of appearances at sci- fi conventions .
Do you enjoy meeting fans up close and personal ?
Helfer : Science - fiction fans and gamers get a bad rap .
I find they 're highly intelligent and generally really nice .
Sometimes I feel like I 'm letting them down because I do n't have a lot of the answers about where Battlestar is going .
But I love the Q&A sessions , aside from the occasional odd person who 's just trying to grab you and kiss you .
It 's just like , " Whoa dude , I 'm married ! "
Tricia Helfer shoots the breeze at a Battlestar Galactica convention .
Wired : Six is one overheated Cylon .
How do you relate to the whole sex - symbol thing ?
Helfer : I 'm not the type of person who thinks I am who I play .
Obviously , you do n't walk around in a rage or being a real seductress .
Wired :
But getting to perform some of those dark scenes for the camera must be gratifying for you as an actress .
Helfer :
If there 's really a tense , angry scene , it is fun getting to bring out those little bits of your own personality , almost like going to a therapy session .
You get it all out so you feel relieved at the end of the day .
Wired : Actors love doing death scenes .
Playing Six , you 've gotten killed many times .
Can you count the ways ?
Helfer : I 've blown myself up with a nuclear device .
I 've gotten shot in the forehead .
I 've gotten shot in the back .
I got knocked off of a two - story building .
I got impaled by steel rebar .
Most of my death scenes have been abrupt and brutal .
Wired :
And you keep coming back for more .
Which version of Six is your favorite ?
Helfer : I really liked Gina .
She 'd been gang - raped , beaten , tortured and starved , so she was a lot darker and a complete departure from what I had been playing .
In that respect , it was fun to get into what was almost a whole new character .
That 's much more interesting than just playing the pretty face , which would get really boring .
Wired :
You and your three sisters grew up on a farm near Donalda , Alberta , Canada .
Were you into sci-fi TV shows back then ?
Helfer : I drove tractors and fixed machinery .
We had a garden and chickens and a grain farm , so I had after - school chores that took up most of my time .
There was no TV in the house .
I can go for weeks without the TV turned on .
Wired : I know you like to ride motorcycles in your free time .
Other hobbies ?
Helfer : I 've always been an animal lover .
I have three rescued cats .
Bella and Delilah are sisters and they 're New Yorkers .
Bug is from the streets of L.A .
Wired :
You 've posed for Playboy , and Six has had some pretty intense love scenes with your Battleship Galactica co-star James Callis , who plays Dr. Gaius Baltar .
Does your husband get jealous ?
Helfer :
No , he was supportive of the Playboy shoot and is very cool when it comes to kissing scenes with James .
It 's just a day at the office .
He totally gets it .

The Bush administration is blocking an inquiry into the delay - plagued construction of the $ 736 m US embassy in Baghdad , a senior Democrat in Congress said today .
Henry Waxman , who is chairman of the oversight committee in the House of Representatives , asked US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice today to explain why her department certified the embassy as " substantially completed " in December despite inspections that reveal continued deficiencies in the facility 's water , fire alarm and kitchen systems .
The Baghdad embassy , which stands to become the largest US diplomatic facility in the world , had an original opening date of mid-2007 .
But the project stalled amid ballooning cost estimates as well as charges of corruption and shoddy work by the private contracting company overseeing the project .
In addition , two US state department employees who worked on the embassy project are now under criminal investigation .
Waxman urged Rice to release subpoenaed documents related to the Baghdad embassy project next week or risk being forced to do so .
" It appears that the state department is concealing from Congress basic information about the status of the embassy project and the activities of the individuals and contractors involved , " Waxman wrote to Rice .
" This continued intransigence is inappropriate . "
The private construction company , First Kuwaiti General Trading & Contracting , declined repeatedly to provide safety inspectors with reports on fire protection systems at the embassy , according to reports released by Waxman .
First Kuwaiti , based in Kuwait , remains the target of a separate US criminal probe into allegations of labour trafficking .
The state department has not yet received Waxman 's letter but plans to address the Democrat 's concerns by his March 7 deadline , spokesman Tom Casey told reporters today .
Casey defended the delay in construction of the embassy , asserting that the building would not be occupied until its fitness for use could be certified .
" [ W]e certainly have no intention of taking occupancy or establishing occupancy in a facility that does n't fully meet all our standards , " Casey said .
He reminded reporters that First Kuwaiti is required under its contract to bear the cost of any needed additional work .
The new director of building operations at the state department has ordered a review of the embassy project and may revoke the building 's " substantially completed " certification , McClatchy news service reported this week .

In the Matter of ) ) Industry Guidance
On the ) File No. EB -00 - IH - 0089 Commission's ) Case Law Interpreting 18 U.S.C. ) § 1464 ) and Enforcement Policies ) Regarding Broadcast Indecency POLICY STATEMENT
Adopted : March 14 , 2001 Released : April 6 , 2001
By the Commission : Commissioners Ness and Furchtgott - Roth issuing separate statements ; Commissioner Tristani dissenting and issuing a statement .
I. INTRODUCTION
The Commission issues this Policy Statement to provide guidance to the broadcast industry regarding our case law interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and our enforcement policies with respect to broadcast indecency .
This document is divided into five parts .
Section I gives an overview of this document .
Section II provides the statutory basis for indecency regulation and discusses the judicial history of such regulation .
Section III describes the analytical approach the Commission uses in making indecency determinations .
This section also presents a comparison of selected rulings intended to illustrate the various factors that have proved significant in resolving indecency complaints .
The cited material refers only to broadcast indecency actions and does not include any discussion of case law concerning indecency enforcement actions in other services regulated by this agency such as cable , telephone , or amateur radio .
Section IV describes the Commission 's broadcast indecency enforcement process .
Section V is the conclusion .
II .
STATUTORY BASIS / JUDICIAL HISTORY
It is a violation of federal law to broadcast obscene or indecent programming .
Specifically , Title 18 of the United States Code , Section 1464 ( 18 U.S.C. § 1464 ) , prohibits the utterance of ``any obscene , indecent , or profane language by means of radio communication .
" 1 Congress has given the Federal Communications Commission the responsibility for administratively enforcing 18 U.S.C. § 1464 .
In doing so , the Commission may revoke a station license , impose a monetary forfeiture , or issue a warning for the broadcast of indecent material .
2 See 47 U.S.C. Sections 312( a ) ( 6 ) and 503 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( D ) .
The FCC 's enforcement policy under Section 1464 has been shaped by a number of judicial and legislative decisions .
In particular , because the Supreme Court has determined that obscene speech is not entitled to First Amendment protection , obscene speech cannot be broadcast at any time .
3
In contrast , indecent speech is protected by the First Amendment , and thus , the government must both identify a compelling interest for any regulation it may impose on indecent speech and choose the least restrictive means to further that interest .
4
Even under this restrictive standard , the courts have consistently upheld the Commission 's authority to regulate indecent speech , albeit with certain limitations .
FCC v. Pacifica Foundation , 438 U.S. 726 ( 1978 ) , provides the judicial foundation for FCC indecency enforcement .
In that case , the Supreme Court held that the government could constitutionally regulate indecent broadcasts .
5
In addition , the Court quoted the Commission 's definition of indecency with apparent approval .
6
The definition , ``language or material that , in context , depicts or describes , in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium , sexual or excretory activities or organs , '' has remained substantially unchanged since the time of the Pacifica decision .
7
Moreover , the definition has been specifically upheld against constitutional challenges in the Action for Children 's Television ( ACT ) cases in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals . 8
Further , in Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844 ( 1997 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down an indecency standard for the Internet but did not question the constitutionality of our broadcast indecency standard .
Rather , the Court recognized the ``special justifications for regulation of the broadcast media that are not applicable to other speakers . ''
Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. at 868.9
Although the D.C. Circuit approved the FCC 's definition of indecency in the ACT cases , it also established several restrictive parameters on FCC enforcement .
The court 's decisions made clear that the FCC had to identify the compelling government interests that warranted regulation and also explain how the regulations were narrowly tailored to further those interests .
In ACT I , the court rejected as inadequately supported the Commission 's determination that it could reach and regulate indecent material aired as late as 11:00 p.m. , and remanded the cases involved to the Commission for proceedings to ascertain the proper scope of the ``safe harbor '' period , that is , the time during which indecent speech may be legally broadcast .
Before the Commission could comply with the court 's remand order , however , Congress intervened and instructed the Commission to adopt rules that enforced the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1464 on a ``24 hour per day basis . '' 10 The rule adopted to implement this legislative mandate was stayed and was ultimately vacated by the court in ACT II as unconstitutional .
In 1992 , responding to the decision in ACT II , Congress directed the Commission to adopt a new ``safe harbor '' - generally 12 midnight to 6:00 a.m. , but 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for certain noncommercial stations .
The Commission implemented this statutory scheme in January 1993.11
Before this rule could become effective , however , the court stayed it pending judicial review .
In 1995 , the D.C. Circuit , en banc , held in ACT III that there was not a sufficient justification in the record to support a preferential ``safe harbor '' period for noncommercial stations and that the more restrictive midnight to 6:00 a.m. ``safe harbor '' for commercial stations was therefore unconstitutional .
The court concluded , however , that the less restrictive 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. ``safe harbor '' had been justified as a properly tailored means of vindicating the government 's compelling interest in the welfare of children and remanded the case to the Commission ``with instructions to limit its ban on the broadcasting of indecent programs to the period from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. ''
ACT III , 58 F.3d at 669-70 .
The Commission implemented the court 's instructions by appropriately conforming Section 73.3999 of its rules .
12 These changes became effective on August 28 , 1995.13
Thus , outside the 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. safe harbor , the courts have approved regulation of broadcast indecency to further the compelling government interests in supporting parental supervision of children and more generally its concern for children 's well being .
Act III , 58 F.3d at 661 ( and cases cited therein ) .
14
The principles of enforcement articulated below are intended to further these interests .
III .
INDECENCY DETERMINATIONS
I.A. Analytical Approach Indecency findings involve at least two fundamental determinations .
First , the material alleged to be indecent must fall within the subject matter scope of our indecency definition - that is , the material must describe or depict sexual or excretory organs or activities .
WPBN / WTOM License Subsidiary , Inc. ( WPBN - TV and WTOM - TV ) , 15 FCC Rcd 1838 , 1840 - 41 ( 2000 ) .
Second , the broadcast must be patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium .
In applying the " community standards for the broadcast medium " criterion , the Commission has stated :
The determination as to whether certain programming is patently offensive is not a local one and does not encompass any particular geographic area .
Rather , the standard is that of an average broadcast viewer or listener and not the sensibilities of any individual complainant .
WPBN / WTOM License Subsidiary , Inc. , 15 FCC Rcd at 1841.15
In determining whether material is patently offensive , the full context in which the material appeared is critically important .
16
It is not sufficient , for example , to know that explicit sexual terms or descriptions were used , just as it is not sufficient to know only that no such terms or descriptions were used .
Explicit language in the context of a bona fide newscast might not be patently offensive , 17 while sexual innuendo that persists and is sufficiently clear to make the sexual meaning inescapable might be .18 Moreover , contextual determinations are necessarily highly fact - specific , making it difficult to catalog comprehensively all of the possible contextual factors that might exacerbate or mitigate the patent offensiveness of particular material .
19
An analysis of Commission case law reveals that various factors have been consistently considered relevant in indecency determinations .
By comparing cases with analogous analytical structures , but different outcomes , we hope to highlight how these factors are applied in varying circumstances and the impact of these variables on a finding of patent offensiveness .
I.B. Case Comparisons
The principal factors that have proved significant in our decisions to date are : ( 1 ) the explicitness or graphic nature of the description or depiction of sexual or excretory organs or activities ; ( 2 ) whether the material dwells on or repeats at length descriptions of sexual or excretory organs or activities ; ( 3 ) whether the material appears to pander or is used to titillate , or whether the material appears to have been presented for its shock value .
In assessing all of the factors , and particularly the third factor , the overall context of the broadcast in which the disputed material appeared is critical .
Each indecency case presents its own particular mix of these , and possibly other , factors , which must be balanced to ultimately determine whether the material is patently offensive and therefore indecent .
No single factor generally provides the basis for an indecency finding .
To illustrate the noted factors , however , and to provide a sense of the weight these considerations have carried in specific factual contexts , a comparison of cases has been organized to provide examples of decisions in which each of these factors has played a particularly significant role , whether exacerbating or mitigating , in the indecency determination made .
It should be noted that the brief descriptions and excerpts from broadcasts that are reproduced in this document are intended only as a research tool and should not be taken as a meaningful selection of words and phrases to be evaluated for indecency purposes without the fuller context that the tapes or transcripts provide .
The excerpts from broadcasts used in this section have often been shortened or compressed .
In order to make the excerpts more readable , however , we have frequently omitted any indication of these ellipses from the text .
Moreover , in cases where material was included in a complaint but not specifically cited in the decision based on the complaint , we caution against relying on the omission as if it were of decisional significance .
For example , if portions of a voluminous transcript are the object of an enforcement action , those portions not included are not necessarily deemed not indecent .
The omissions may be the result of an editing process that attempted to highlight the most significant material within its context .
No inference should be drawn regarding the material deleted .
III .
A.1 . Explicitness / Graphic Description Versus Indirectness / Implication
The more explicit or graphic the description or depiction , the greater the likelihood that the material will be considered patently offensive .
Merely because the material consists of double entendre or innuendo , however , does not preclude an indecency finding if the sexual or excretory import is unmistakable .
Following are examples of decisions where the explicit / graphic nature of the description of sexual or excretory organs or activities played a central role in the determination that the broadcast was indecent .

In assessing explicitness , the Commission also looks to the audibility of the material as aired .
If the material is difficult or impossible to understand , it may not be actionably indecent .
However , difficulty in understanding part of the material or an attempt to obscure objectionable material will not preclude a finding of indecency where at least some of the material is recognizable or understandable .

III .
A.3 . Presented in a Pandering or Titillating Manner or for Shock Value
The apparent purpose for which material is presented can substantially affect whether it is deemed to be patently offensive as aired .
In adverse indecency findings , the Commission has often cited the pandering or titillating character of the material broadcast as an exacerbating factor .
Presentation for the shock value of the language used has also been cited .
As Justice Powell stated in his opinion in the Supreme Court 's decision affirming the Commission 's determination that the broadcast of a comedy routine was indecent , " [ T ] he language employed is , to most people , vulgar and offensive .
It was chosen specifically for this quality , and it was repeated over and over as a sort of verbal shock treatment . "
FCC v. Pacifica Foundation , 438 U.S. 726 , 757 ( 1978 ) ( Powell , J. , concurring in part and concurring in the judgment ) .
On the other hand , the manner and purpose of a presentation may well preclude an indecency determination even though other factors , such as explicitness , might weigh in favor of an indecency finding .
In the following cases , the decisions looked to the manner of presentation as a factor supporting a finding of indecency .

In determining whether broadcasts are presented in a pandering or titillating manner , the context of the broadcast is particularly critical .
Thus , even where language is explicit , the matter is graphic , or where there is intense repetition of vulgar terms , the presentation may not be pandering or titillating , and the broadcast may not be found actionably indecent .

Responding to the licensee 's argument , the Mass Media Bureau stated that " although the program . . . arguably concerned an incident that was at the time `in the news , ' the particular material broadcast was not only exceptionally explicit and vulgar , it was . . . presented in a pandering manner .

The licensee claimed that the program was a clinical discussion of oral sex .
The Enforcement Bureau rejected this argument on the grounds that the disc jockeys ' comments on her material showed that the material was offered in a pandering and titillating manner .
`` The disc jockeys ' invitation to have Dr. Terry use a prop on a radio program , and their laughter and statements ( such as ``oh yeah , baby ' ' ) while she conducted that demonstration shown that the material was intended to be pandering and titillating as opposed to a clinical discussion of sex . ''
The absence of a pandering or titillating nature , however , will not necessarily prevent an indecency determination , as illustrated by the following case .

The Mass Media Bureau found the material to be patently offensive .
In response to the licensee 's assertion that this song was not pandering or titillating and therefore should not be considered indecent , the Bureau stated : " We believe . . . that it is not necessary to find that the material is pandering or titillating in order to find that its references to sexual activities and organs are patently offensive .
( Citations omitted . )
Moreover , humor is no more an absolute defense to indecency . . . than is music or any other one component of communication . "

ENFORCEMENT PROCESS
The Commission does not independently monitor broadcasts for indecent material .
Its enforcement actions are based on documented complaints of indecent broadcasting received from the public .
Given the sensitive nature of these cases and the critical role of context in an indecency determination , it is important that the Commission be afforded as full a record as possible to evaluate allegations of indecent programming .
In order for a complaint to be considered , our practice is that it must generally include : ( 1 ) a full or partial tape or transcript or significant excerpts of the program ; 20 ( 2 ) the date and time of the broadcast ; and ( 3 ) the call sign of the station involved .
Any tapes or other documentation of the programming supplied by the complainant , of necessity , become part of the Commission 's records and cannot be returned .
Documented complaints should be directed to the FCC , Investigations and Hearings Division , Enforcement Bureau , 445 Twelfth Street , S.W. , Washington , D.C. 20554 .
If a complaint does not contain the supporting material described above , or if it indicates that a broadcast occurred during " safe harbor " hours or the material cited does not fall within the subject matter scope of our indecency definition , it is usually dismissed by a letter to the complainant advising of the deficiency .
In many of these cases , the station may not be aware that a complaint has been filed .
If , however , the staff determines that a documented complaint meets the subject matter requirements of the indecency definition and the material complained of was aired outside " safe harbor " hours , then the broadcast at issue is evaluated for patent offensiveness .
Where the staff determines that the broadcast is not patently offensive , the complaint will be denied .
If , however , the staff determines that further enforcement action might be warranted , 21 the Enforcement Bureau , in conjunction with other Commission offices , examines the material and decides upon an appropriate disposition , which might include any of the following : ( 1 ) denial of the complaint by staff letter based upon a finding that the material , in context , is not patently offensive and therefore not indecent ; ( 2 ) issuance of a Letter of Inquiry ( LOI ) to the licensee seeking further information concerning or an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the broadcast ; ( 3 ) issuance of a Notice of Apparent Liability ( NAL ) for monetary forfeiture ; and ( 4 ) formal referral of the case to the full Commission for its consideration and action .
22 Generally , the last of these alternatives is taken in cases where issues beyond straightforward indecency violations may be involved or where the potential sanction for the indecent programming exceeds the Bureau 's delegated forfeiture authority of $ 25,000 ( 47 C.F.R. § 0.311 ) .
Where an LOI is issued , the licensee 's comments are generally sought concerning the allegedly indecent broadcast to assist in determining whether the material is actionable and whether a sanction is warranted .
If it is determined that no further action is warranted , the licensee and the complainant will be so advised .
Where a preliminary determination is made that the material was aired and was indecent , an NAL is issued .
If the Commission previously determined that the broadcast of the same material was indecent , the subsequent broadcast constitutes egregious misconduct and a higher forfeiture amount is warranted .
KGB , Inc. ( KGB - FM ) , 13 FCC Rcd 16396 ( 1998 ) ( ``higher degree of culpability for the subsequent broadcast of material previously determined by the Commission to be indecent ' ' ) .
The licensee is afforded an opportunity to respond to the NAL , a step which is required by statute .
47 U.S.C. § 503 ( b ) .
Once the Commission or its staff has considered any response by the licensee , it may order payment of a monetary penalty by issuing a Forfeiture Order .
Alternatively , if the preliminary finding of violation in the NAL is successfully rebutted by the licensee , the NAL may be rescinded .
If a Forfeiture Order is issued , the monetary penalty assessed may either be the same as specified in the NAL or it may be a lesser amount if the licensee has demonstrated that mitigating factors warrant a reduction in forfeiture .
A Forfeiture Order may be appealed by the licensee through the administrative process under several different provisions of the Commission 's rules .
The licensee also has the legal right to refuse to pay the fine .
In such a case , the Commission may refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice , which can initiate a trial de novo in a U.S. District Court .
The trial court may start anew to evaluate the allegations of indecency .
V. CONCLUSION
The Commission issues this Policy Statement to provide guidance to broadcast licensees regarding compliance with the Commission 's indecency regulations .
23
By summarizing the regulations and explaining the Commission 's analytical approach to reviewing allegedly indecent material , the Commission provides a framework by which broadcast licensees can assess the legality of airing potentially indecent material .
Numerous examples are provided in this document in an effort to assist broadcast licensees .
However , this document is not intended to be an all - inclusive summary of every indecency finding issued by the Commission and it should not be relied upon as such .
There are many additional cases that could have been cited .
Further , as discussed above , the excerpts from broadcasts quoted in this document are intended only as a research tool .
A complete understanding of the material , and the Commission 's analysis thereof , requires review of the tapes or transcripts and the Commission 's rulings thereon .

ORDERING CLAUSE
Accordingly , it is ORDERED that this Policy Statement is ADOPTED .
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION
Magalie Roman Salas 1 . Secretary Separate Statement of Commissioner Susan Ness In Re : Industry Guidance on the Commission 's Case Law Interpreting 18 U.S.C. 1464 and Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast Indecency
Our enforcement of the broadcast indecency statute compels the FCC to reconcile two competing fundamental obligations : ( 1 ) to ensure that the airwaves are free of indecent programming material during prescribed hours when children are most likely to be in the audience ; and ( 2 ) to respect the First Amendment rights of broadcasters regarding program content .
Understandably , the public is outraged by the increasingly coarse content aired on radio and television at all hours of the day , including times when children are likely to be listening or watching .
The flood of letters and e-mails we receive reflect a high degree of anger .
As a parent , I share the public 's frustration .
Many parents feel that they cannot enjoy watching daytime or primetime television with their children for fear that their youngsters will be exposed to indecent material - content that just a few years ago would have been unimaginable on broadcast television .
Despite an onslaught of on - air smut , the Commission necessarily walks a delicate line when addressing content issues , and must be careful not to tread on the First Amendment -- the constitutional bulwark of our free society .
Even words that might be construed as indecent are subject to some constitutional protection against government regulation .
24 That said , the Supreme Court has seen fit , despite declining broadcast audience shares , to reaffirm the FCC 's broadcast indecency enforcement role , given the ``pervasive ' ' and ``invasive '' characteristics of the free over the air broadcast medium .
25 Our Policy Statement on indecency reconciles our statutory mandate and constitutional obligation by providing helpful guidance to broadcasters and the public alike .
The guidance we offer - a restatement of existing statutory , regulatory , and judicial law - establishes a measure of clarity in an inherently subjective area .
Recommended Procedural Improvements
We should strive to make our complaint procedures as user - friendly as possible .
26 I believe that our complaint process could be improved if , prior to acting on an indecency complaint , the Commission routinely forwarded the complaint to the licensee in question .
The Policy Statement concedes that in ``many [ indecency ] cases , the station may not be aware that a complaint has been filed . '' 27 Moreover , many consumers feel that the Commission mechanically dismisses their complaints .
I do not believe that broadcasters '
First Amendment rights would be threatened if we were to send broadcasters a courtesy copy of complaints filed with the FCC .
Indeed , most broadcasters want to be made aware of audience complaints .
And consumers would be reassured that their views were being treated seriously .
Broadcasters Are Part of a National Community Release of this Policy Statement alone will not solve the festering problem of indecency on the airwaves .
However , it is entirely within the power of broadcasters to address it -- and to do so without government intrusion .
It is not a violation of the First Amendment for broadcasters on their own to take responsibility for the programming they air , and to exercise that power in a manner that celebrates rather than debases humankind .
It is time for broadcasters to consider reinstating a voluntary code of conduct .
I encourage broadcasters , the Bush Administration , and Congress swiftly to resolve any antitrust impediments to such action and move ahead .
We all are part of a National Community .
As stewards of the airwaves , broadcasters play a vital leadership role in setting the cultural tone of our society .
They can choose to raise the standard or to lower it .
I hope that broadcasters will rise to the occasion by reaffirming the unique role of broadcasting as a family friendly medium .
The public deserves no less .
2 . 3 . Separate Statement of Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott - Roth 4 . 5 . In the Matter of Guidance on the Commission 's Case Law Interpreting 6 . 18 U.S.C. Section 1464 and Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast Indecency
The Commission is obliged , under a settlement agreement , to issue guidance on its broadcast indecency policies .
As the courts have noted , there is a certain ``vagueness inherent in [ this ] subject matter . '' 28 I find that the policy statement establishes necessary boundaries for this elusive and highly subjective area of the law .
I must note , however , that Commission action to enforce the indecency guidelines would set the stage for a new constitutional challenge regarding our authority to regulate content .
To be sure , Red Lion v. FCC29 and its progeny , FCC v. Pacifica,30 have not yet been overruled .
Nevertheless , their continuing validity is highly doubtful from both an empirical and jurisprudential point of view .31
If rules regulating broadcast content were ever a justifiable infringement of speech , it was because of the relative dominance of that medium in the communications marketplace of the past .
32
As the Commission has long recognized , the facts underlying this justification are no longer true .33
Today , the video marketplace is rife with an abundance of programming , 34 distributed by several types of content providers .35
A competitive radio marketplace is evolving as well , with dynamic new outlets for speech on the horizon .
36
Because of these market transformations , the ability of the broadcast industry to corral content and control information flow has greatly diminished .
37
In my judgment , as alternative sources of programming and distribution increase , broadcast content restrictions must be eliminated .
For these reasons , I believe that the lenient constitutional standard for reviewing broadcast speech , formally announced in Red Lion , rests on a shaky empirical foundation .
38 Technology , especially digital communications , has advanced to the point where broadcast deregulation is not only warranted , but long overdue .
In my view , the bases for challenging broadcast indecency has been well laid , and the issue is ripe for court review .39 I must note my amazement that it has taken over seven years for the Commission to fulfill its obligation to issue this item .
While broadcast indecency is a delicate issue to discuss , it has not benefited the industry or the Commission to ignore the matter .
I commend the Chairman for taking the initiative to move this item .
Norm Goldstein and others staff members deserve special credit for crafting a document that makes the best of a difficult situation for the Commission .
With these observations in mind , I vote to adopt this policy statement .

IN THE MATTER OF INDUSTRY GUIDANCE ON THE COMMISSION'S CASE LAW INTERPRETING 11 . 18 U.S.C. § 1464 AND ENFORCEMENT
POLICIES REGARDING BROADCAST INDECENCY , EB 12 .
FILE NO .
00 -IH - 0089
I dissent from the issuance of this ``Policy Statement '' ( hereinafter ``Statement ' ' ) for three reasons .
First , the Statement creates a false impression that it satisfies an obligation assumed by the Commission in 1994 .
Second , the Statement perpetuates the myth that broadcast indecency standards are too vague and compliance so difficult that a Policy Statement is necessary to provide further guidance .
Most importantly , this Statement diverts this Agency 's attention and resources away from the ongoing problem of lax enforcement , which is a pressing concern of America 's citizens .
The Statement notes that on February 22 , 1994 the Commission entered into a Settlement Agreement with Evergreen Media Corporation ( hereinafter ``Agreement ' ' ) .
40
At fn 23 the Statement cites the terms of the Agreement as the source of our obligation to produce this Statement : Specifically , in paragraph 2 ( b ) of the settlement agreement , the Commission agreed to " publish industry guidance relating to its caselaw interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and the FCCs enforcement policies with respect to broadcast indecency . '' 41 The Agreement actually imposed a significantly more restricted obligation .
Within nine months of the date of this Agreement , the FCC shall publish industry guidance relating to its caselaw interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and the FCCs enforcement policies with respect to broadcast indecency .
42
Six and one half years later , it is clear the FCC did not observe the terms of the Agreement .
While I cannot support the FCC 's failure to comply with the timeline set forth in the original Agreement , the record does not disclose a single effort by Evergreen to seek specific performance under the Agreement .
It is well settled that ``equity aids the vigilant , not those who slumber on their rights , '' and doctrines such as laches are designed to promote diligence and prevent enforcement of stale claims .
43
The public interest is not served by permitting Evergreen to sit silently on the sidelines while Commission after Commission failed to act .
Even if the FCC shirked its duty under the Agreement , as long as Evergreen retained the benefit of dismissal of indecency cases against it as set out in the Agreement , a strong case exists that Evergreen ratified this agency 's inaction for almost 7 years .
44 If Evergreen Media Corporation had an enforceable interest in the Agreement , it has long since been waived .
Moreover , the obligation to issue the Statement was subject to several conditions precedent that bound Evergreen Media .
45
The Statement itself does not disclose whether Evergreen complied with its obligations , and with the exception of noting payment of $ 10,000 forfeiture , the record on file at the Commission is silent on the same point .
FCC Mass Media Bureau records disclose that Evergreen Media no longer owns the license to which the Agreement 's terms attached .
Finally , the Agreement does not bind the Commission to provide to Evergreen 's assigns the relief set forth in the Agreement .
46
In the absence of the party executing the Agreement , and no successor to accede to those interests , it appears there is no extant legal duty or enforceable right upon which the issuance of the Statement can be based .
I turn next to the underpinnings of the need for this statement .
The Statement provides : The Commission issues this Policy Statement to provide guidance to the broadcast industry regarding our case law interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and our enforcement policies with respect to broadcast indecency .
47 First , settlement of a case involving a single licensee should not compel the FCC to adopt our most significant industry - wide Policy Statement on this subject , particularly when doing so does not serve the public interest .
Second , there is nothing in the record demonstrating that Evergreen Media failed to understand the FCC's , or the U.S. Supreme Court 's , cases on broadcast indecency .
In fact Evergreen agreed to issue to its employees a ``policy statement '' that was to be based upon ``the FCC 's definition of broadcast indecency . '' 48
It his difficult to understand how Evergreen could both issue a policy statement containing the FCC 's definition of indecency to its employees and simultaneously be unable to understand the FCC 's definition .
But leaving that quirk aside , there is simply no proof that broadcast licensees are in need of this Policy Statement .
No factual basis exists for concluding that confusion about the standards or overreaching enforcement by the FCC requires this Statement .
Moreover , I am aware of no rush of inquiries by broadcast licensees seeking to learn whether their programs comply with our indecency caselaw .
In the absence of such requests , this Policy Statement will likely become instead a ``how - to '' manual for those licensees who wish to tread the line drawn by our cases .
It likely may lead to responses to future enforcement actions that cite the Statement as establishing false safe harbors .
In the absence of proof that the Statement addresses concerns supported by the FCC 's history of enforcement , or the record of the Evergreen case , the Statement is nothing more than a remedy in search of a problem .
It would better serve the public if the FCC got serious about enforcing the broadcast indecency standards .
For these reasons , I dissent .

The court did not address the validity of that interest .
ACT III , 58 F.3d at 660-61 .
The Supreme Court has noted , however , that the ``uniquely pervasive presence '' of the broadcast media , with the audience continually tuning in and out , so as to make content warnings less effectual , is a reason for affording broadcast media more limited First Amendment protections as compared to other forms of communications .
FCC v. Pacifica Foundation , 438 U.S. at 748-49 .
15 The Commission 's interpretation of the term ``contemporary community standards '' flows from its analysis of the definition of that term set forth in the Supreme Court 's decision in Hamling v. United States , 418 U.S. 87 ( 1974 ) , reh'g denied , 419 U.S. 885 ( 1974 ) .
In Infinity Broadcasting Corporation of Pennsylvania ( WYSP ( FM ) ) , 3 FCC Rcd 930 ( 1987 ) ( subsequent history omitted ) , the commission observed that in Hamling , which involved obscenity , ``the Court explained that the purpose of `contemporary community standards ' was to ensure that material is judged neither on the basis of a decisionmaker 's personal opinion , nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group . ''
3 FCC Rcd at 933 , citing 418 U.S. at 107 .
The Commission also relied on the fact that the Court in Hamling indicated that decisionmakers need not use any precise geographic area in evaluating material .
3 FCC Rcd at 933 , citing 418 U.S. at 104-05 .
Consistent with Hamling , the Commission concluded that its evaluation of allegedly indecent material is ``not one based on a local standard , but one based on a broader standard for broadcasting generally . ''

23 This Policy Statement addresses the February 22 , 1994 , Agreement for Settlement and Dismissal with Prejudice between the United States of America , by and through the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission , and Evergreen Media Corporation of Chicago , AM , Licensee of Radio Station WLUP ( AM ) .
Specifically , in paragraph 2 ( b ) of the settlement agreement , the Commission agreed to ``publish industry guidance relating to its caselaw interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and the FCC 's enforcement policies with respect to broadcast indecency . ''
United States v. Evergreen Media Corp. , Civ. No. 92 C 5600 ( N.D. Ill. , E. Div. 1994 ) .
The settlement agreement also provides that the forfeiture order imposed in Evergreen Media Corporation of Chicago AM WLUP ( AM ) ) , 6 FCC Rcd 502 ( MMB 1991 ) , is null and void and expunged from the record .
It further specifies that the Notice of Apparent Liability issued to WLUP on February 25 , 1993 , Evergreen Media Corporation of Chicago AM ( WLUP ( AM ) ) , 8 FCC Rcd 1266 ( 1993 ) , became null and void and expunged from the record six months from the date of the agreement .
Accordingly , those decisions are officially vacated .

31 Since Pacifica , the Courts have repeatedly struck down indecency regulations and other content - based restrictions .
See , e.g. , United States v.

32See , e.g. , FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co. , 309 U.S. 134 , 137 ( 1940 ) ( ownership rules justified by " a widespread fear that in the absence of governmental control the public interest might be subordinated to monopolistic domination " ) ; see also Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC , 395 U.S. 367 ( 1969 ) ( justifying , at that point in history , a " less rigorous standard of First Amendment scrutiny " on the basis of " spectrum scarcity " ) .

34 There are well over two hundred channels of video programming developed by the cable and broadcast industries .
In addition , hyper - localized programming , produced by public , educational and governmental entities , is now available on cable systems throughout the United States .
Also , dozens of pay - per - view programming options exist for cable and satellite subscribers .
Finally , internet users have access to tens of thousands of audio programming sources and streaming video technology will soon advance to the point that broadcast quality television will be available to anyone connected to the world wide web .
35 Cable operators , cable overbuilders , OVS operators , internet service providers , wireless video systems , SMATV , common carriers , and satellite carriers are just some of the possible outlets for distributing video content .
The promise of multiplexed digital television signals , available to everyone over - the - air , adds even more video programming choices for the American public .
36 Satellite radio will debut soon and digital audio broadcasting holds out much promise for the future of terrestrial radio transmission .
Both types of services will offer listeners more channels of programming at higher quality levels than is available today .
Moreover , hundreds of radio stations are currently streaming content over the internet , with thousands of more to follow .
37 See Joint Statement of Commissioners Powell and Furchtgott - Roth , In re Personal Attack and Political Editorial Rules , FCC Gen .
Docket No. 83-484 , at 5 and n. 15 ( citing statistics on boom in communications outlets ) .
38 It is ironic that streaming video or audio content from a television or radio station would likely receive more constitutional protection , see Reno , than would the same exact content broadcast over - the - air .
A more interesting First Amendment question will soon arise when digital television stations begin offering subscription services over - the - air .
Will intermediate scrutiny apply because the pay service is akin to cable television or will a lesser standard apply because it is available over - the - air ?

Clintons are trying to steal the nomination from Barack Obama – and he ca n’t let them .
The Clintons ’ campaign attacks put Obama in a bind .
If he does n’t answer in kind , he ’s toast .
But if he does , they ’ll have forced him off his winning message of hope and change from the bitter politics of the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush eras .
If they pull him off his game and onto theirs , they can wrest away the Democratic convention victory that he ’s earned .
The solution for Obama is clear : Reply in kind , but do it through surrogates .
Obama must answer Hillary ’s negative attacks and make counterpunches of his own to rock her back on her heels .
His holier - than - thou posture is fine for the opening stages of a campaign , but when your opponent starts throwing mud , you ’ve got to answer .
While Hillary takes aim at Obama ’s buddy , Tony Rezko , the Obama people need to explore the dimensions of Hillary ’s relationship with con artist Norman Hsu , who donated almost a million dollars to her campaign , money he ’d scammed from gullible investors .
Obama needs to enlist the likes of Ted Kennedy and his other supporters in making the case against Hillary .
After her victories in Texas and Ohio , Hillary is once again in play .
Negatives about her matter .
A full frontal assault on her integrity and on Bill ’s conflicts of interest ( remember they have joint finances ) will work and will stop the bleeding in the Obama campaign .
The Clintons would like nothing better than for Obama to remain passive , clinging to his desire to raise the tone of our politics .
If Sen . Clinton resorts to negative ads in the remaining primary states , Obama needs to do so , too , always keeping himself off camera and using an announcer to articulate his message .
As long as his attacks center on Hillary ’s and Bill ’s financial dealings and their relationships with lobbyists and special - interest groups , he will remain on message and his attacks will be in sync with his general approach to the race .
But Obama must make no mistake – it ’s time to fight back .

" Congo blue " filters pass infrared light !
If you lay three layers of Congo Blue on one layer of Primary Red , you form an opaque black filter which is very transparent to IR !!!!!
Oh , so you 're not impressed ?
Well , read on .
Back in 1994 when I was working for Eaton photocontrols , we had all these big sheets of opaque black Lexan plastic which was IR - transparent .
It was intended for curved , vacuformed covers for the infrared sensors in truck 's backup - alarms .
Viewing this plastic through an infrared - converter scope was very strange , since the IR - scope changed the opaque black sheets into glass - clear Lexan .
Some black boxes had been built for custom test equipment , and the IR scope turned them transparent , so you could see all the circuitry inside .
And if I put these black sheets in a window , human eyes saw opaque black plastic , while IR scopes ( and monochrome security cameras ) would see right through it , as if it was glass .
The IR scopes thought the black window was totally transparent .
Other tricks were possible .
I could hide lettering and artwork behind those opaque black squares against a wall , and the IR video cameras would see the hidden art or message .
At one point I started wondering just how much IR light a human eye could see .
After all , if the infrared light was EXTREMELY BRIGHT ( such as the IR of a sunny day , ) human eyes might still detect it .
And remember , if 30 KHz ultrasonic sound is loud enough , you will hear it .
Same basic idea .
I took a small piece of our black IR filter - plastic and cut it into 2in. oblong disks to fit over the eye - depressions in my own skull .
I taped them onto my face with black electrical tape .
Yes , I looked odd , but it worked !
After I became accustomed to the darkness inside the filters , I could see through them .
Going outside on a sunny day was stunning .
The sky was almost black , while the trees and shrubs were all frosty pink .
The grass looked like fluorescent red cherry Koolaid powder .
Different colors of human skin were always the same light grey .
People 's eyes looked very black , and certain dark clothing looked white .
I was afraid that I might damage my eyes , since the IR sunlight was very bright , and my pupils were wide open .
( After years of playing with these , I still have n't hurt my eyes , so they 're PROBABLY somewhat safe to use . )
I could n't see anything indoors though , and I could barely see anything during a cloudy day .
This " IR vision " requires a sunny day in order to work .
YOU CAN'T USE THESE FILTER - GOGGLES FOR NIGHT VISION !
BRIGHT SUNLIGHT IS REQUIRED .
In darkness the goggles do nothing .
If you want to actually convert IR to visible , or to amplify light , get a CCD security cam , or go buy a cheap night - vision scope from Harbor Freight Tools instead .
Or try putting an IR filter over the lens of a $ 20 Casio monochrome wrist camera
Later I found some $ 7 welders ' goggles and cut some of that black " IR plastic " into 2in. disks to fit the lenses .
This worked great .
I could stagger around in the noonday sun while observing the strange twilight - dark world of the near infrared spectrum .
Frosty white trees against a black sky .
Driving with the goggles was dangerous : I could see just fine , and cars ' non-LED tailights looked abnormally bright , but red traffic lights were totally dark ( here in Seattle they use red LEDs for stoplights which lack the IR output of the original incandescent bulb . )
Some sorts of car tail lights , the LED kind , were also dark .
Goggles for everyone Making your own Rude infrared t- shirts Congo Blue or better Goth - ray vision Deeper IR DIY cheap IR floodlight How they work Frequently Asked Questions FAQ Spectrum graphs LINKS Photo Gallery Goggles for All Years later I finally used up my last small piece of black IR plastic .
I still had several pairs of the goggles , but it was sad that I could n't show others how to make their own .
Perhaps some # 89 Kodak Wratten filters would work , but that stuff is wicked expensive , and I never tried it .
But then one day I was messing with a Rosco filter booklet and happened to hold a red filter over the IR filter - goggles and look outdoors .
The view was different .
The red Rosco filter seemed to remove a greyish - violet color that I had n't really noticed before .
The IR goggles pass lots of infrared , but for some reason they also seemed to pass some deep blue .
Why would IR filters let some blue light through ?
Heyyyyy ... which of the Rosco filters does the same thing ?
Which filter passes a spike - spectrum of deep blue , but it also lets through lots of IR ?
CONGO BLUE !
Maybe our IR plastic supplier cheated .
Maybe when Eaton ordered some visible - opaque , IR - transparent plastic , they actually gave us Congo Blue plastic with lots of extra dye added to the mix ( so barely any visible blue light would get through . )
Sure enough , when I stacked several sheets of Congo Blue filters and stuck them in my welding goggles , they acted much the same as those Lexan IR - pass filters .
I could go out in bright sunshine and see the familiar pink - tree , dark - sky world .
A few small pieces of Congo Blue filter costs about $ 0.50 ... which means that ANYONE can make these goggles now .
No expensive Wratten filters or exotic custom - ordered IR Lexan is needed .
Make Your Own Needed : Bright sunshine or many hundreds of watts of 725nM IR floodlights
Cheap welding goggles ( w/ removable filters ) ( looks like these # 702020 from staples.com , or maybe these flip - front types )
Sheet of " Congo Blue " filter gel ( Lee # 181 from leefilters.com , or Rosco # 382 ) costs maybe $ 9 for 24 " sheet
Optional : sheet of " Primary Red " filter gel ( Lee # 106 or Rosco # 27 ) Search Amazon.com for " Congo Blue " filter material .
Or try bulbamerica.com # 9181 $ 1.80 for 10 in. square congo blue .
One sheet makes LOTS of goggles .
Find yourself a pair of inexpensive welding goggles : the ones with round , unscrewable lenses with circular filter - disks are only $ 7 at my local welding supply shop .
If you wear glasses , buy the larger green version with the removable rectangular filter - window .
Buy some " Congo Blue " theatrical filter gel , and for later experiments get some " Primary Red " as well .
( I got mine from pnta.com , PNTA theater supplies here in Seattle . )
Remove the dark - green filter disks from the goggles and use them as guides to cut out twelve disks of Congo Blue filter plus two disks of Primary Red .
Stick six layers of Congo Blue into each goggle eyepiece .
Do n't use the dark green disks that came with your goggles .
Use only the filters you 've made .
Wait for a sunny day , strap 'em on , and go for a walk outdoors .
What will you see ?
The whole world looks blue - grey with deep red highlights .
But then you start to notice some strange things .
Get away from the buildings and look at grass , bushes , and trees .
Look at different plants with the goggles , then take them off .
Many plants look frosty - whitish - pink with the goggles , but for normal human eyes they look green or greenish black .
Sometimes you can see birds moving around deep inside the frosty white bushes and trees , yet normal human eyes would see nothing , just a dark green shady bush .
Look at people 's clothing and skin color w / the goggles , then take them off and look again .
Many items of clothing look white in the infrared , yet they look black or dark blue to normal eyes .
If you use Congo Blue filters alone , and do n't include the Primary Red , then the filters will let some blue light through also .
This is useful , since whenever there is too little IR light to be seen , you can still stumble around using the remaining blue - grey visible light .
Without the Primary Red filters added , the world appears dim blue - grey , and the IR scenery appears bright red .
Place one or two Primary Red in each lens of your goggles and this gets rid of the blue .
It lets you see purely Infrared light .
I 've come to enjoy the blue / IR mixture , since an all red world is less interesting , even though it's an all - Infrared world .
A dim blue world with bright red patches is cool , since those bright red patches are actually the Infrared scenery that normally would be invisible .
Will these goggles let you see IR lasers and LEDs ?
Maybe .
The LED or laser must make some 730 nM light .
The goggles do n't amplify .
The goggles work by cutting out the bright background light .
They let you see the dim IR light that remains .
It 's as if they " turn off " the visible room lights so that you can see the bits of infrared .
They do n't work any better than using a black background or going into a darkened room .
So , take your IR laser or LED into a pitch black room .
Can you see its dim reddish light without using the goggles ?
If yes , then you probably can see its light if you use the IR filter goggles in a brightly - lit room .
However , if you find that can't see your IR LED by eye in a darkened room , then these IR goggles wo n't help , since they do n't amplify the light .
They work by making the whole world into a " darkened room " while still letting the bright IR light get to your eyes .

Microsoft and Novell are partners now , but the companies used to be fierce competitors in the office software space .
We know how that war turned out : Word and Excel gradually squeezed WordPerfect and Quattro Pro out of the market , and Novell eventually got out of the office software business .
Today , the Supreme Court rejected Microsoft 's attempts to halt an antitrust lawsuit filed by Novell , ruling that the case can proceed to trial ( Chief Justice John Roberts , a Microsoft shareholder , recused himself from the case ) .
Novell sued Microsoft in 2004 , accusing the software giant of anticompetitive practices in the office software market .
According to Novell , Microsoft withheld technical information necessary to get WordPerfect and Quattro Pro up and running under Windows 95 .
A key piece of evidence comes from a 1994 e-mail from outgoing Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in which he ordered that some details on Windows ' inner workings not be provided to his company 's competitors .
" I have decided that we should not publish these extensions , " wrote Gates .
" We should wait until we have away to do a high level of integration that will be harder for likes of Notes , WordPerfect to achieve , and which will give Office a real advantage ...
We can't compete with Lotus and WordPerfect / Novell without this . "
Novell also accuses Microsoft of improperly using the operating system monopoly that got it in trouble with the Department of Justice .
In order to raise the profile of Word and Excel , the software giant reportedly used its OS clout with manufacturers to keep WordPerfect and Quattro Pro from being bundled with new machines .
Microsoft argued unsuccessfully that the statute of limitations over its conduct had expired , and that Novell should be barred from bringing an antitrust lawsuit because it did not compete in the operating system market .
The software giant has consistently blamed Novell for WordPerfect 's woes , saying that the company 's mismanagement was the real issue .
" WordPerfect deliberately chose not to develop a version for early versions of Windows in the hope that depriving Windows of a key application would limit the success of Windows , " argued Microsoft in 2004 .
At the beginning of the 1990s , WordPerfect had almost half of the word processor market , while Word had about 30 percent between the DOS and Windows versions ( the next - most - popular app was IBM's DisplayWrite ) .
By June 1994 , when Novell purchased WordPerfect , the application 's market share had dipped below 20 percent while Word for Windows soared past the 50 percent mark .
Novell unloaded WordPerfect to Corel in 1996 for $ 186 million , a mere fraction of the $ 855 million it had paid less than two years previous .
Microsoft expressed its disappointment in the Supreme Court 's decision in a statement given to Ars .
" We realize the Supreme Court reviews a small percentage of cases each year , but we filed our petition because it offered an opportunity to address the question of who may assert antitrust claims , " a company spokesperson said .
" We look forward to addressing this and other substantive matters in the case before the trial court .
We believe the facts will show that Novell 's claims , which are 12 to 14 years old , are without merit . "
Microsoft and Novell 's 2006 interoperability and patent cross-licensing agreement allowed Novell to continue pursuing the WordPerfect case , and the Supreme Court 's ruling clears the way for an eventual trial .
Microsoft may choose to settle this case out of court , as US antitrust laws allow for damages to be trebled .

SUGAR , SUGAR / Cane and beet share the same chemistry but act differently in the kitchen

Carolyn Weil and her crew at The Bake Shop in Berkeley were hard at work one morning , boiling down large pots of sugar syrup to make buttercream for the day 's buns , cakes and confections .
It was a task the staff had done hundreds of times .
But this morning the normally silky syrup crystallized into large , chunky granules .
Weil tossed it , along with plans for most of the baked goods she wanted to sell that day .
Not happy with a day 's work and income wasted , Weil investigated , checking her equipment and ingredients and determining the one variable .
Sugar .
Weil 's supplier had substituted another brand and , as it turns out , another type of sugar altogether .
Weil thought she was getting cane sugar , but instead she got beet .
Despite what sugar industry officials claim , beet and cane sugar are not alike .
And the sugar industry is n't bothering to tell .
The labels of most brands of sugars on supermarket shelves neglect to say whether what 's inside is cane or beet .
In some brands , the contents can vary from day to day .
The Chronicle tested and blind - tasted creme brulee , cookies and cakes made with beet and cane sugar and found that indeed there is a difference .
In all cases , the products made with cane were superior .
However , many in the sugar industry disregard such results , because the conventional wisdom is that beet and cane are the same -- both types are sucrose and chemically identical .
NOT QUITE EQUAL
It 's true that both kinds are sucrose , but only 99.95 percent , and that minuscule 0.05 percent -- made up of trace differences in minerals and proteins -- can have an effect .
Much of the 0.05 percent difference comes from the fact that cane and beets are two different plants altogether .
Beets are a root , growing below ground ; cane is a grass , waving in the breeze .
" That alone can account for mineral profile and content differences , " says Charles Baker , vice president for scientific affairs for The Sugar Association , a nonprofit group focusing on sugar 's role in diet and health .
Other variations are the result of processing .
The beet versus cane controversy is a new development .
Cane was once the dominant sugar in U.S. markets , but within the last few years beet has taken the lead .
Beet now accounts for 55 percent of the 10 million tons of refined sugar consumed in the country each year .
And , according to Ben Goodwin , executive manager of California Beet Growers Association , the percentage is expected to grow .
One reason is that beet sugar is generally cheaper to produce .
It requires just one refining process at a single plant .
Traditional cane refining demands two processes at two different facilities .
Beets can also thrive in a wider range of climates .
This large , homely root -- not anything like a regular beet -- is cultivated in 12 states ; cane grows in just four .
And while total U.S. cane and beet acreage has declined dramatically over the last few years , cane has dropped most precipitously .
Hawaii alone has lost more than 60 percent of its cane fields over the last five years -- victims of urbanization and conversion to better - paying crops like macadamia nuts and coffee , says Roehl Flores , director of marketing for C & H Cane Sugar Co .
Many in the industry continue to dispute the signifigance of the shift from cane to beet .
" I can't tell any difference , and I do n't think anyone else can , " says Joseph Terrell , director of public affairs for the American Sugar Alliance , a trade association .
" The difference is where it is grown and some of the processing , but once it becomes sugar , there 's no difference . "
But others see disaster looming on the horizon .
Marion Cunningham , The Chronicle 's " Home Cooking " columnist and author of the " Fannie Farmer Cookbook , " says the shift from beet to cane endangers some traditional American recipes .
" It matters in recipes for baked goods like angel food cake .
It just is n't right with beet sugar .
Lazy Daisy
Cake , a wonderful old sponge cake from the past , is a real problem when it 's made with beet sugar .
It 's coarse .
All of those types of recipes are different . "
BROWN - SUGAR DILEMMA
Brown sugar can be a particular problem because of the way it 's made .
Brown cane sugar -- a combination of sugar and molasses , both inherent in the sugarcane plant -- is produced naturally as part of the process of refining white cane sugar by the traditional method , crystallization .
Brown sugar from C & H Sugar Co. and other cane refiners uses the process , but beet sugar is different .
It 's made by refining the sugar all the way to the final white granular stage , stripping off all the molasses because beet molasses is unfit for human consumption ( it 's recycled as cattle feed ) .
Then cane molasses is added back into the sugar through a process called " painting . "
Painting coats the granules but does not necessarily penetrate them -- the molasses can sometimes be rubbed right off .
As with white sugar , these different types of sugars act differently in the kitchen .
PROOF IS IN THE BAKING
The Chronicle Food staff baked five batches of bar cookies in our test kitchen , each using a different brand of light brown sugar .
Tasters did n't know which was which .
The cookies made with cane were far superior in taste and texture to those made from beet ( see related story ) .
We then made a second batch , using just one brand of sugar -- C & H Light Brown Sugar -- to see if results would be consistent between different packages .
We used a new bag , right off the store shelf , and a partly used one that had been stored in a home pantry for several weeks .
Again , there were differences , but they were slight compared to the ones in the first tasting .
Moisture differences , industry experts say , may account for the variation in both instances .
The effect is less dramatic with white granulated sugar .
" I 'm sure I 've used beet sugar for baking cakes , and there have not been any problems that I know of , " says The Chronicle 's baking columnist Flo Braker .
However , when we baked four versions of her Butterscotch Pound Cake -- using white granulated beet sugar , white granulated cane , light brown beet and light brown cane -- the differences in crumb texture , appearance and flavor were apparent , although subtle ( see related story ) .
They were n't subtle in creme brulee , however .
In our testing of white beet sugar we found that it refused to caramelize on top ( see photo on cover page ) .
We prepared several ramekins of creme brulee , topping them with either beet or cane granulated sugar .
When caramelized with a small blow torch -- the traditional way of browning the topping -- the cane sugar became brown and bubbly and the beet burned in seconds .
These are reasons that some professionals specify a type or even a brand of sugar .
Because of her own experiences at The Bake Shop and as a cooking teacher , Weil always requests C & H .
In fact , Weil has become so devoted to the brand that she became a spokesperson for the company after research for this story began .
San Francisco confectioner Joseph Schmidt , nationally renowned for his chocolate truffles and other candy , also prefers cane sugar .
" I always order C & H , " he says .
" When I make caramel , it seems to be cleaner .
And it ' snaps ' better when I make brittle and things like that . "
Most manufacturers who specify a type or brand of sugar will not reveal what it is because their recipes are proprietary .
But C & H's Flores says that some caramel popcorn and cinnamon roll producers are asking for his company 's brown sugar because of its molasses content and uniformity .
Consumers , however , do n't have the luxury of knowing what they 're getting .
Labeling law does n't require a cane or beet designation .
C & H is the only mass - market producer to do so ; other refiners decline .
The question is why .
MORE THAN MARKETING
The Sugar Association 's Baker suggests that some manufacturers may consider the beet or cane designation simply " a marketing tool . "
Goodwin of the state 's beet growers ' association says he 's puzzled .
" I do n't know why beet sugar producers do n't label their sugar . "
He theorizes that perhaps beet producers can't compete with the ad program of a company like C & H , which has been touting its " pure cane " product for years .
" Cane sugar has a long tradition and beet sugar is starting from scratch , " he says .
" I guess the beet sugar people are able to sell the product through other channels without building consumer loyalty . "
But Cunningham argues that the source should be on the label regardless .
At the very least , she says , " people need to know what they 're getting .
Otherwise they 'll be frustrated .
They wo n't understand why things are turning out the way they are . "
COOKS , TASTERS PUT SUGAR TO THE TEST
The Chronicle Food staff baked five batches of the Brown Sugar Walnut Squares recipe on this page , each using a different brand of light brown sugar .
Tasters did n't know which was which when they sampled .
Here are our results :
-- Best Yet ( beet sugar ) .
Cookies were very chewy , with unpleasant grainy texture and brittle crust .
-- Springfield ( beet sugar ) .
These cookies had a datelike " dark , sticky " flavor , with a very crunchy top and bottom and lots of separation among top , interior and bottom .
-- Safeway ( cane sugar ) .
Softer and moister than Best Yet and Springfield , not as sweet , clean tasting with no date flavor , lots of nut flavor and a buttery quality and uniform texture .
It was some tasters ' favorite .
-- C & H ( cane ) .
More depth of flavor than Safeway , with a hint of molasses , most uniform texture and golden - brown color , no separation .
Many tasters ' favorite .
-- Lady Lee / Lucky ( unknown source ) .
Dark , dense , sticky , with a raisinlike texture , red - brown color and distinct separation among top , interior and bottom .
We also baked four batches of Butterscotch Pound Cake , each using a different sugar .
-- Spreckels white granulated ( beet ) .
Pleasantly crunchy top ; relatively coarse , dry crumb , yet gummy when chewed .
Very sweet .
-- C & H white granulated ( cane ) .
Finer , more even texture than Spreckels , with moister crumb and better flavor .
Less sweet .
-- C & H light brown ( cane ) .
Nice flavor and texture , more golden than first two cakes .
-- Springfield light brown ( beet ) .
Top is crunchier than C & H , but appearance and flavor not significantly different .
WHICH SUGAR IS BEET , WHICH IS CANE
For the typical consumer buying sugar off the grocers ' shelf , economics rather than performance determines what they will get .
" It 's based on price from the producers , " says Judie Decker , spokeswoman for Lucky Stores , Inc. Lady Lee and Lucky , Lucky 's house brands , can be cane one time , beet another , she admits .
" We buy from C & H and from Holly .
If the supplier is Holly , it 's beet sugar .
If it 's C & H , it 's cane .
It 's random .
We never know ahead of time . "
Lucky does not specify either cane or beet on the label .
On the West Coast , Spreckels , with factories in Woodland and Mendota , and Holly , with a plant in Tracy , manufacture beet sugar and sell it under the Spreckels , Albertson's , Best Yet and Springfield labels .
Spreckels and Holly are owned by Imperial Holly of Sugar Land , Texas .
C & H , with a sole refinery in Crockett , is the only cane producer on the West Coast .
C & H also produces cane sugar for the Safeway label found in Northern California stores .
Safeway label brown sugar in Arizona and the Pacific Northwest is beet sugar produced by Imperial Holly , according to Bob Baldwin of Imperial Sugar Co. in Tracy .
Domino , another cane brand , is scarce in the West .
BROWN SUGAR WALNUT SQUARES

BUTTERSCOTCH POUND CAKE
This recipe from The Baker columnist Flo Braker is a nontraditional pound cake because it is baked in a tube pan .
You may substitute white sugar for the brown , if you like ; if you do , omit the baking soda .
The cake will have a slightly more delicate crumb and lighter color .
INGREDIENTS :
-- 3 cups unsifted all - purpose flour
-- 2 teaspoons baking powder
-- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
-- 1/2 teaspoon salt
-- 8 ounces unsalted butter
-- 2 cups brown sugar
-- 3 large eggs , whisked to combine
-- 1 cup milk
-- 1 teaspoon vanilla
INSTRUCTIONS : Have all ingredients at room temperature .
Adjust rack to lower third of oven ; preheat oven to 350 degrees .
Grease and flour a 10 - inch tube pan or other 12 - cup decorative tube pan .
Sift the flour , baking powder , baking soda and salt onto a sheet of wax paper .
Using an electric mixer , preferably with a paddle attachment , cream the butter at medium speed until it is smooth and creamy .
Maintaining the same speed , add the sugar in a steady stream .
When all the sugar has been added , stop the machine and scrape the mixture clinging to the sides of the bowl into the center of the bowl .
Continue to cream at the same speed for 4 to 5 minutes , or until the mixture is very light in color and fluffy .
With the mixer still on medium speed , pour in the eggs , cautiously at first , tablespoon by tablespoon .
If at any time the mixture appears watery or shiny , stop the flow of eggs , and increase the speed until a smooth , silken appearance returns .
Then decrease the speed to medium , and resume adding eggs .
Continue to cream , stopping the mixer and scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally .
When the mixture looks fluffy , white and increased in volume ( adding the eggs and incorporating them into the mixture takes 3 to 4 minutes ) , reduce the mixer speed to low .
Add the flour mixture in 4 additions alternately with the milk in 3 additions .
Scrape the sides of the bowl often , and mix until smooth after each addition .
Stir in the vanilla at the end .
Spoon the batter into the pan and spread it level .
Bake for 55 to 65 minutes , or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean .
Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes .
Invert the cake onto a rack , and cool completely before slicing thinly with a serrated knife .
Serves 16 to 20 .

To many parents , Web sites like My Space and Facebook are a threat , a door open to the outside world that lets strangers into homes .
But the benefits of online interaction may far outweigh the risks .
A commentary in this month ’s Journal of Adolescent Research notes that networking sites provide teens with opportunities to develop social and communication skills and to bridge racial and ethnic divides .
These benefits often are overlooked by parents worried that adult predators are lurking online .
“ We may do adolescents a disservice when we curtail their participation in these spaces , because the educational and psychosocial benefits of this type of communication can far outweigh the potential dangers , ” writes Brandesha Tynes , an educational psychologist at the University of Illinois who authored the commentary .
In her article “ Internet Safety Gone Wild ? , ” Dr. Tynes suggests some parents may be going overboard .
While teens need to be warned about “ digital dangers ” like adult predators , parents also need to consider the benefits of spending time in online settings , she argues .
These sites provide a chance to augment critical thinking and argumentation skills , she says .
Online , kids find support from peer groups , get help with homework and talk about sensitive issues they might be too embarrassed or afraid to discuss face - to - face .
Discussions of race and ethnicity are common online , Dr. Tynes adds .
In one study of open - topic chat rooms , race was mentioned in 38 of 39 discussions .
At a time when schools are increasingly segregated , Dr. Tynes says educators may want to encourage online interactions as a substitute for racial interactions that no longer occur in classrooms or hallways .
Tech - savvy teens already are aware that online socializing can generate unwelcome advances in cyberspace , she says .

A professor of mine synthesized two human biases into something he called the Devil Shift .
He said that for parties locked in longterm conflict , the combination of :
1. valuing losses more than gains , and
2. assimilation bias
result in demonizing your opponents .
Parties in conflict may struggle over policies for decades .
Over the course of years , both will win and lose some battles .
If people value losses more than gains , they will remember their loses more strongly than their wins .
Over years , this will accumulate into a feeling that they frequently lose to their opponents , which will then feel as if their opponents are disproportionately powerful .
Assimilation bias is fairly straightforward .
It says that people see and accept evidence that supports their positions better than they see and accept evidence against their positions .
It can be as blatant as simply seeing the words on a page .
If you give people numbered lists of ten statements that oppose their position , take the paper away and ask them how many sentences were on the page , they say " oh , you know .
Seven or eight . "
They are n't lying .
They did n't see the rest .
Because of biased assimilation , people in policy conflicts think data and evidence that opposes their position is weaker than it is .
Over time , they come to believe that people drawing conclusions from that data are exaggerating or outright liars .
Once you believe your opponents are disproportionately powerful liars , you have completed the Devil Shift .

The investment banking crisis on Wall Street is already drying up the flow of capital to Silicon Valley , and while money should find new ways to reach local startups , a cash drought of unknown duration and severity is under way .
That 's the synthesis of interviews with a half - dozen sources , each of whom have what valley people call " skin in the game " - personal financial stakes in the startup economy that depend on Wall Street firms like Bear Stearns to keep the whole system working .
" I'm on the board of one startup that is closing a $ 1 million financing March 31 and we 're making certain to get in touch with all the investors to ensure an orderly closing , " said Jon Fisher , a serial entrepreneur who recently sold a software startup to Oracle Corp .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Although logically the turbulence in New York 's money markets should not affect such a tiny deal in Northern California , the fact is that the financial ecosystem of Silicon Valley is much like the water cycle - lake water evaporates and rises to form clouds and rains down to fill the lake again .
In the startup economy , the lakes are the venture capital funds that raise money to create startups , which then go public or get sold to a bigger firm .
Confidence takes the place of evaporation to keep the cycle going .
At the moment , however , confidence has all but evaporated .
" There 's so much fear and doubt out there , " said Sam Colella , a founding partner of Versant Ventures , which invests in biotech and health care startups .
Colella , who has been a venture capitalist for 22 years , said right now the financial picture is fine in the health care sector that is his bailiwick , but he 's been around long enough to know how the confidence crisis can spread .
It all goes back to how the money gets recycled through the startup economy , and a good place to start is with the venture funds that raise money from institutional investors like pension funds that like to sweeten their returns by betting a little bit of their hoard on high - risk but , one hopes , high - return VCs .
The venture capitalists then invest in startups that spend the money to build their companies .
Spending the money is the easy part .
But VCs eventually want to get their money back .
" Three to five years is about the time we like to stay invested , " said Arno Penzias , a Nobel Prize - winning scientist and partner in New Enterprise Associates , a venture firm that invests in alternative energy , among other markets .
And in order to recoup their investments , the venture capitals turn to big investment banks like Bear Stearns and smaller boutique banks to do one of two things : sell the startup on Wall Street through an initial public offering or sell it to a big company like Oracle through the merger - and - acquisition process .
Both types of transactions are called liquidity events in valley - speak .
Brenon Daly , who tracks IPOs and mergers in the technology and telecom industries for the 451 Group in San Francisco , said both the avenues VCs use to achieve liquidity have been drying up for months .
" The IPO market is dead , " Daly said flatly .
Acquisitions had been strong through 2007 , when big firms spent $ 476 billion to buy 3,559 smaller firms in Daly 's market , but a good chunk of that activity was buyouts by private - equity firms like the flailing Carlyle Group , now caught in the credit crunch .
So that means fewer M&A buyers in 2008 , he said .
No wonder Mark Cannice , a professor at the University of San Francisco who regularly surveys the sentiment among VCs , started to detect a drop in their confidence through much of last year .
That means they 'll be throwing around less of the money that startups use to fund everything from new hires to paper clips .
How long or tough this cash drought will be not even the insiders can guess , but already the regional ecosystem is sprouting new boutique investment banks , like Catapult Advisors in San Francisco , to help VCs bring their startups to the fabled liquidity event .
" We 're lickin ' our chops to fill in if Bear Stearns drops the ball , " said Catapult Managing Partner Ron Lissak .
But what no one knows is how long it will be before the larger investment community , everyone from the individual to the pension fund , regains its appetite for the sine qua non of high returns - Wall Street risk .
" I 'm starting to be concerned about what may be the next shoe to drop , " said Colella , the biotech guy .
So for now it looks like it's a hard rain that 's not gonna fall on Silicon Valley .
Geologists wonder if they should add a new epoch to the geological time scale .
They call it the Anthropocene – the epoch when , for the first time in Earth 's history , humans have become a predominant geophysical force .
Naming such a new epoch would also recognize that humans now share responsibility with natural forces for the state of our planet 's ecological environment .
Geologists have been using the term informally for at least half a decade .
Now members of the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London have laid out the case for giving the term official scientific status .
Presenting that case in the February issue of GSA Today magazine , the team notes that " since the start of the industrial revolution , Earth has endured changes sufficient to leave a global stratigraphic signature . "
It is different from anything found in the entire geological record up to that point .
That means the team expects future geologists examining this record will recognize a distinct break with the Holocene ( " recent whole " ) epoch that covers the past 10,000 years .
Atmospheric chemist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen at Germany 's Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz says this presents humanity with an awesome challenge .
He has pointed out that what the London team calls the " novel biotic , sedimentary , and geochemical change " now being written into the geological record reflects the emergence of human intelligence and technology as a geophysical force .
On his website , he explains this means that " to develop a world - wide accepted strategy leading to sustainability of ecosystems against human stresses will be one of the great future tasks of mankind . "
He adds that it will take " intensive research and wise application of the knowledge " gained to develop sustainable environmental management .
Soil scientist Daniel Richter at Duke University in Durham , N.C. , would agree .
In an announcement of his work last month , he explained that human - induced changes to the world 's soils are enough in themselves to justify saying we have entered the " Anthropocene ( or man - made ) age . "
He notes , " With more than half of all soils on Earth now being cultivated for food crops , grazed , or logged for wood , how to sustain Earth 's soils is becoming a major scientific and policy issue . "
He adds , " If humanity is to succeed in the coming decades , we must interact much more positively with the great diversity of Earth 's soils . "
Dr. Richter cites Africa as an example of this challenge .
There , widespread farming without nutrient recycling threatens continent - wide soil infertility .
He adds that , globally , " expanding cities , industries , mining , and transportation systems all impact soil in ways that are far more permanent than cultivation . "
Richter is part of an international group that has set up the first global long - term soil research network .
This will help develop the knowledge needed for worldwide soil management .
In making the case for a new epoch , geologists such as the London team cite many other aspects of human geophysical impact .
It will be up to the International Commission on Stratigraphy to decide whether or not to establish a new Anthropocene epoch .
But it is clear that Earth has taken an unpre­cedented geological turn in our time and there is no turning back .
A new report describes a way of mimicking the event horizon of a black hole — that infamous point of no return , the boundary beyond which light and matter are forever lost — using nothing more than light pulses transmitted along an optical fiber .
With luck , researchers will be able to use the system to study faint particles emerging from the artificial horizon that are analogous to Hawking radiation , theorized by physicist Stephen Hawking to stream from real black holes .
The black holes that astronomers can see , such as the supermassive behemoths in the cores of galaxies such as our own Milky Way , are surrounded by clouds of hot gas that make it hard to study their event horizons in any detail .
Although researchers have theorized that microscopic ( quantum ) black holes might spring from collisions inside the highest energy particle accelerators or when cosmic rays strike the atmosphere , these effects are still speculative .
" We 're trying to create an object that is similar to the event horizon of a black hole , and then to study the quantum physics of the black hole in a real laboratory setting , " says physicist Ulf Leonhardt of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland .
That may be easier said than done , notes theoretical physicist Ted Jacobson of the University of Maryland , College Park .
" It does seem more feasible to set it up and make useful measurements in the near term than anything else I 've seen , " he says , but he notes that if the pulses can be tweaked to liberate Hawking radiation at all , the particles may still be drowned out by other effects at the horizon .
Black holes are born when matter and energy become so tightly packed that they implode under their own gravity , puncturing a hole of sorts in the fabric of spacetime , known as a singularity .
Think of the singularity as a waterfall at the end of a ( gravitational ) river full of fish .
The river speeds up as it approaches the cascade , and passing light waves are like fish swimming upstream .
If they venture too close to the waterfall ( the river 's event horizon ) , they will take a plunge no matter how fast they swim .
The analogy is close enough that researchers have proposed creating black hole analogues in scores of different ways to try to study the still - mysterious interplay between gravity ( the river ) and quantum particles ( the fish ) .
You can make your own event horizon quite easily by pouring liquid onto a flat surface [ see slideshow ] .
The key to producing a black hole analogue , Leonhardt and his colleagues explain , is to force a fluidlike medium to slosh faster than waves can ripple through it .
For their demonstration , reported in Science , the researchers took advantage of the fact that as a light pulse zips through an optical fiber at light speed , it distorts the fiber 's refractive index ( a measure of how easily light waves pass through a material ) .
In effect , the pulse acts as a speed bump for light .
The researchers sent a red pulse through a fiber , followed by a beam of longer wavelength , faster - moving infrared light to chase down the pulse .
The wavelength of the infrared beam shortened , or blue - shifted , indicating that its wave fronts had piled up behind the trailing edge of the pulse , Leonhardt says .
Technically , blue - shifting is a feature of a white hole event horizon , which is like an inside - out black hole in that it prevents any light from crossing it , but the researchers note that the leading edge of the pulse would mimic the horizon of a black hole .
Leonhardt says that if researchers can refine the technique to make the pulses sharper — like a shark fin instead of a hill — they may be able to study an effect imagined in the 1970s by physicist Stephen Hawking .
He argued that quantum uncertainty should produce pairs of particles straddling a black hole 's event horizon such that one member of each pair would flow downstream into the singularity whereas the other would escape .
The outgoing Hawking radiation would leave the black hole glowing faintly like a warm coal and would gradually shrink it to nothing .
Hawking radiation as an idea has stood the test of time , but detecting it directly would be impossible amid the maelstrom surrounding a real black hole .
Jacobson says he does n't expect that demonstrating the analogous effect in optical fibers would confirm Hawking 's prediction in anyone 's mind .
But it might stimulate new ideas , he says , adding that " it may even lead people to useful insights or techniques unrelated to the original problem of understanding Hawking radiation . "
Exile Tribute : the story of the game 's development
Early conception
Technical issues aside , and against all modern business rules , the Exile game itself was allowed to evolve from little more than having a spaceman exploring a cavern system .
We did n't know where it was going in the early stages and really just thought about new experiences for the hero and new technical features ( like line of sight vision for inhabitants ) as we went .
Personally I believe that the best creations occur if allowed to develop at least partly in this evolutionary way rather than completely designed from scratch at the outset .
It takes much longer of course to produce something this way and you are in danger of never finishing if you lose sight of the goal , but is worth it in the end .
It is possibly this natural progression of ideas between Smith and Irvin which allowed the game to become so full of features .
Peter admits though that from the outset he and Jeremy wanted the game to be as high quality as possible given the technical abilities of the BBC Micro .
The novella apparanlty had some influence in the game 's features but only in the final stages of development ( see below ) .
Technical accomplishments and programming
We hit the physical limits of the BBC machine very early on in the game 's development and it became a constant battle rewriting or removing code to release RAM yet keeping the speed up ( though when writing in assembler it is typically the case that small code is fast code ) .
This was good experience which most programmers learning today wo n't have because of the current fast processors with piles of RAM and " high level " development languages like C++ that insulate the programmer from what the processor is actually doing .
Apart from the novella we really did all of it ourselves .
There were probably some useful suggestions from others but the system restrictions we were up against prevented most of these being implementable .
The implementation of the authors ' ideas resulted in numerous innovative and ingenious programming routines being developed and Peter describes a number of these .
For example , could one generate a map as vast as that of Exile and yet retain space for the rest of the game ?
The huge map of Exile was generated by an algorithm which from an input of the xy map coordinates created tunnels , solid rock , or one of the few special blocks that could have manually defined objects in them , like creatures , doors , guns , etc .
It took a long time to fiddle with this algorithm to produce a tunnel system that was all linked up and interesting , but the storage required for it was actually tiny .
To my knowledge , speech had never been used as part of a BBC game before Exile .
Also , a sophisticated artificial intelligence was incorporated for the objects and inhabitants within the world of Exile which , along with realistic motions and the sound , created the ' immersive ' atmosphere that Peter and Jeremy wanted .
This is hidden from the player who usually does not appreciate the finer details on the final atmosphere and Peter gives several examples of these routines :
The immersive atmosphere was surely a major thing for the player , but like a swan gliding serenely across a lake , you do n't see it 's legs flapping away like mad beneath the surface .
So it was with Exile with lots of subtle things going on that nobody is aware of .
I like to think that there were some quite innovative routines like the creature strategy code that knows about noises nearby , line of sight vision through the caves , memory of where the target was last seen , etc .
Oddly , the real time background speech code , which was a quite an innovation for the BBC micro , was quite quick to implement and used little RAM .
But then I 'm not sure anyone knew what the speech said unless they had been told before hand !
In contrast to many games developers today , software for games development was less common for those wishing to write for the 8 - bit machines .
For example software houses , one imagines , may have a range of routines which can be used repeatedly for subsequent releases .
The most immediate example is the use of ' 3D engines ' at the core of three dimensional games upon which different graphics are overlain depending on the game being developed .
The authors of Exile created a range of programs specifically for the creation of the game as Peter explains :
It was all done by us .
In those days there were no real development tools available and when for example a nose is one pixel big and one of only 4 colours there was no need for artists .
It would have been near impossible to have non-programmer graphics as the interaction with the game code was critical because e.g. of the size of things fitting in holes in tunnels , and saving memory by careful positioning of the sprites in the graphics source area .
Besides it was fun doing the graphics too .
We had various tools we wrote in the wonderful BBC BASIC .
Another example of how we saved memory was that x or y flipped versions of graphics were all reflected on the fly at plotting time , and some shapes were taken from parts of other shapes , particularly the background graphics .
In fact the graphics were a major technical accomplishment in themselves , this is particuarly astonishing when you look at the source in it 's compactness ( kindly donated by Peter Irvin ) :
The file illustrates the points Peter makes above with areas being extracted from the total graphics data and being coloured or flipped for final use to generate different forms of creatures and objects .
The whole graphics file is 128 by 113 pixels and I think that the lower region including text and status graphics was discarded after the menu screen thus minimising to the extreme the amount of space taken by graphics data and freeing highly limited space for the game engine and less general routines .
This attention to efficient use of space would manifest itself again in the later Amiga versions of the game .
The hackers view
This game gave me HOURS of enjoyment , both in playing it and , later on , in hacking through the code .
To this day I still remember ( I hope ) &78 ED as the start address of exilemc :)
The disk copy protection was first class .
The disk was a dual 40 /80 track format with track 1 ( or 2 , depending on whether 40/80 mode ) being " invalid " .
The disk sector IDs ( read using OSWORD 7F if I recall ) normally inform the programmer of the number of sectors for the track and what their logical sector numbers are .
Track 1 had been formatted strangely with far too many sectors and cryptic looking IDs .
The data block containing all this information , when looked at as ASCII , spelt out " Well good evening , I hope you 're having fun ! " ( or words to that effect ) .
That really made me laugh .
Following that ( ie also part of the sector IDs ) was another osword 7 F data block which is used as the parameters for loading the next part of the code .
This way without this track ( which contains no real ' information ' except for the sector ids themselves ) the game could not be loaded .
Hence this fooled virtually all disk copy programs .
Alas the OPUS disk drives ( have I remembered their names correctly ) could n't cope with the normal 8271 command set and so superior had to release a protection - free version .
Pity .
There were also 2 variants of the disk , due to a bug ( I think ) being fixed early on .
I 'm not sure what the bug was , but that 's the story I heard .
The result was that the memory addresses within the code were slightly different between the two versions , making cheat programs harder to write .
Somewhere I have all 4 versions ( 2 protection schemes * 2 releases ) .
Yes , I 'm ashamed to say it , I did indeed cheat .
I wrote the Exile cheat and saved game editor that appeared in BBC Micro User .
As I recall they paid me 300 pounds for them !
Good money back then - it more than paid for my ( 2nd hard ) BBC Micro and it was the first time that my mother finally started to believe that I was n't " wasting my time up there , playing those silly computer games " ;-)
I did consider writing a map editor , but once I found where the map was " stored " I realised how god - like the programmers were .
There 's about 1.5 K of bitmapped " map " , stored in triangular regions .
This encodes the complex bits like the ship and a few important locations elsewhere .
The rest of it is generated by code .
The algorithm takes X and Y as input , and outputs one a tile value ( 0 to 255 , or perhaps less ) .
It accounts for rock strata , water levels , rooms , corridoors , etc. Fantastic !
James was understandably impressed by the mapping code and I 'm still trying to get my head around how it could be done !
After pressing him for further details James explains from memory what he was able to do with it , the most visible result being the Micro User Mapper program :
The algorithm is hideous .
It has lots of things like : Get X shift left twice ( * 4 ) EOR with Y shift right add Y multiply by 2 if < 20 then ....
Ghastly !
It had a couple of K or code like that .
Staggering .
I did work out how the graphics were stored , and how to generate maps .
Indeed I think I had a scrolling map viewer at some stage , although I forget now whether that was part of the published cheats .
One thing is for certain though - all my notes on this are almost certainly long gone and my memory for 6502 code is poor .
He then goes on to explain about the self - modifying code which , if I remember correctly , Peter mentioned to me originally :
The disk loading mechanism was entertaining .
After all the clever disk encoding it loaded the program into memory , but the entire thing is encrypted .
At the end of this is a decoder routine with self modifying code ( it just updates the arguments such as the # 40 in LDA # 40 , not the code itself ) .
This starts low down in memory ( &1100 for example ) and starts decrypting code byte by byte .
It has no check for when it 's reached the end though - it just keeps stepping through memory until it reaches itself at which point it " decrypts " the decrypting routine , turning it into a jump statement to start the game proper .
To decode it you have to copy the decryption routine elsewhere in memory , but update both your copy and the original so that the decryption works .
With PC beeb emulators I 'm sure this all becomes trivial as we can just set a break point when the program counter reaches a certain point .
Takes half the fun out of it though - to me cracking the code was always a significant part of the fun ( sometimes more fun than the game itself ) .
Kevin Edwards was the king of copyright protection and the only game author that truely defeated all my attempts :-)
He had the bright idea of encrypting using the 1MHz hardware timer values , the code doing the encryption , and the program counter .
This means that the code cannot be modified , it cannot be moved ( as it 's position dependent ) and it cannot be easily simulated due to the real - time nature of the hardware clocks .
Truely a genius .
It 'd be interesting to see if any of the beeb emulators can work with his software .
Even given that emulation - compatible versions exist I 'm not convinced that the protection mechanisms are preserved .
Also the novella mechanism has been hacked out of one disk image so I wonder if all the data has been preserved or if this clever decryption protection mechanism has been circumvented somehow ?
I no longer have the hacked Exile version which worked with ! 65 host for the Acorn Archimedes but perhaps the person who posted this version to the newsgoups back in the mid-'90's ( ' Dan ' ) had modified the program extensively as ! 65 host was notorious for not being a comprehensive emulation of the BBC Micro !
Finally I 'd like to thank James for this information .
The novella
The ' immersive atmosphere ' of Exile was surely enhanced from the outset by the inclusion of a novella with the package .
Extracts will be added to the plot page but briefly this depicts the demise of a crew of a military starship from Earth which is sent to investigate the planet to which an Earth criminal , Triax , was exiled years before .
This demise is the work of none other than the evil Triax .
Suprisingly though , the idea for the inclusion of a short story was to discourage piracy of the game .
That is , before playing is possible the player is asked to type in an extract from the novella ( another feat of programming memory efficiency ! ) .
Peter explains the lengths , he and Jeremy went to in trying to combat the piracy issue :
The decision to have a novella came about because it was thought it would reduce piracy and add perceived value to the game .
Finding ways to prevent piracy was a big thing at that time for developers .
I remember seeing somebody demonstrate how to copy Starship Command ( an earlier game of mine ) on a national TV programme and was a bit miffed to say the least .
We even developed an anti piracy system where we could manually scratch a floppy disk with a needle and had a program that worked out what disk sectors were unreadable and based on this store an encrypted image of the game on the undamaged part of the disk .
Unfortunately this would have been a too expensive and perhaps unreliable for production duplication though .
Therefore the novella was written to accompany the developing game which one could argue is less restrictive than attempting to write a game according to an accompanying story .
Exile ˜ The Story was written by Mark Cullen in conjunction with Peter and Jeremy .
The story , at the time , reminded me of the science - fiction blockbuster film ' Aliens ' and I put this to Peter :
The novella also helped us finalise what had to be done to finish the game in terms of design features .
The Exile story came about with discussions with a school friend , Mark Cullen , who had done an English degree and written various things including some material for TV .
He fleshed out the story and patiently made changes necessary to match what was in the game .
Films like Alien did have an impact , I guess , since they were such powerful influences at the time .
I guess the plot is really more like " Forbidden Planet " , but then this was based on Shakespeare 's " The Tempest " - where does it really all start ?
Whatever the inspirations behind the story , it almost managed to give the player a sense of ' urgency ' about the job at hand !
To my knowledge , the only other game released with a story , was the other great BBC epic Elite in its 1984 release .
Technical limitations
Although Exile appeared to push the BBC to its limit , the authors indeed had more ideas which they were prevented from implementing .
Equally , any suggestions from some of the people credited in the back of the Exile manual were usually non-achievable .
I asked Peter if there was anything specific he could remember :
Well I suppose that if we had hires colour graphics and a faster processor and ten times as much memory the game " finish " would have been much better , but then all the other games would have been too .
The underlying game play would have remained though .
It is difficult to say what Exile would have become with more system resources on the original machine , the BBC mirco .
We would have felt obliged to push the machine to it 's limits whatever .
It has been mentioned more than once on the Acorn newsgroups that the ending was disappointing and people would liked to have been rewarded with more after such an immense accomplishment .
Certainly by looking at the solution , a huge amount of playing is required just in following the instructions of the fan 's who documented their methods .
However , the rewards surely come from the learning and overcoming the obstacles .
Peter has also mentioned that given more memory , the terrain variation seen on later 16 - bit versions could have been implemented on the BBC given more memory .
Still , this is perhaps a minor modification , although it makes one wonder the BBC Master with its greater memory capacity could have achieved this .
In summary , I 'll include a few words from 16 - bit co-author William Reeve regarding techincal achievements :
My take is that Exile was the pinnacle of what could be achieved with the BBC .
[ Actually Pipeline was right up there too but in different ways ] .
It was actually an inefficient process - because so much effort went into optimising the code and being clever .
The 6502 is , to this day , an incredibly efficient processor and Exile exploited it to the hilt .
The publication
Superior Software really was the best publisher on the BBC by then .
They were publishing all the best quality games and had a genuine professional enthusiasm for Exile and could see it 's potential .
They had back cover or double page adverts in most issues of the magazines for their games releases .
We found both Richard and Steve Hanson very supportive .

Hookah is not what a Soprano calls a prostitute .
Also known as nargila , ghelyun , sheesha , chillam , hubbly bubbly , or simply water - pipe , hookah is to the Muslim world what a pint or a lager or a Bud Light is to Americans :
At the end of a work day , it 's what you suck on when hanging out with your buddies .
In India and Pakistan , hookah is generally smoked among the older men in the bhaitak – or sitting area – of the house .
In the Arab world it is generally done at small shops on street - corners .
In the West , hookah is found at swanky bars located in the club districts and dingy holes in the wall in immigrant neighborhoods like Patterson , NJ , or Dearborn , Michigan .
Just to make things political , Israelis do it too — it was brought over by Mizrahi Jews — meaning that the hookah has humanist potential as one of the things Jews and Arabs might one day be able to do together in a social setting .
While the style of the hookah differs in each part of the world , generally every hookah has a base , filled with water ; a two - part stem ; a bowl , in which goes the tobacco and upon which goes the coal ; and the arm , from which you quaff the smoke .
Endless experimentation is possible .
Instead of water , you can fill your base with milk , orange juice , or wine ( my personal favorite is iced water ) .
Your tobacco , meanwhile , can be bitter , regular , or flavored ( my personal favorite is vanilla mint ) .
You can even have hookahs that have multiple arms , allowing for many people to enjoy at the same time .
I call that the gang - suck .
If you do engage in that , please video - tape it and send me a copy .
The physics of a hookah are pretty simple .
You inhale , the embers on the coal heat up , they burn the tobacco in the bowl , the smoke goes down the stem , passes through the water , goes up the other part of the stem and comes out of your nose and mouth leaving a sweet fruity or minty flavor on your lips .
Let ’s get the froo - froo metrosexual crap out of the way .
Hookahs do pose a significant health risk .
Some assemblage of dorks called " The Mayo Clinic " says that a typical one - hour session of hookah leads a person to ingest 100 to 200 times more smoke than one cigarette .
Also , just because the smoke passes through a filter – water in this case – does n’t mean that all the carcinowhateverthatwordis get filtered out .
Finally , the World Health Organization claims that you can get just as addicted to nicotine through a hookah as you would from cigs .
The upside is that unlike with cigs , you are n’t ingesting arsenic , tar , or crushed glass , which is always nice .
Also , though they might make you temporarily woozy , hookahs do not make you high , so when you grope your best friend ’s girl ( or your best friend for that matter ) , try and blame something beside the hookah .
Also , hookahs are significantly more expensive than cigs , which means you will go broke way before you really have a chance to get addicted – so it all works out in the end .
Finally , with hookahs , there is no advertising campaign paid for by Big Hookah * that will make you feel guilty about what you ’re doing .
There is a strain of experts who think that hookah is n’t as bad as it is being made out to be — that it could just be a case of medicinal orientalism ( imposing Western norms , i.e. cigs , upon Eastern mores , i.e. hookah ) .
Kamal Chaouachi , a French researcher , has severely criticized the World Health Organization ’s Report in the Journal of Negative Results in Biomedicine .
He criticizes the WHO on many levels , but the most damning , at least in my eyes , is the fact that hookah coals burn somewhere close to 100 centigrade and not close to 850- 900 centigrade , as does a cigarette .
His other major criticism of the report was that it assumed that a person smokes hookah for one hour , straight , without stopping .
This is retarded .
Most of the time the dude next to you hogs the hookah and you have to have a fatwa declared on him before he ’ll pass the nozzle to you .
In a group of four sharing two hookahs , the coals will probably last forty minutes , and you ’ll probably smoke no more than twenty minutes max , and even in that time you have to include talking and drinking time .
The other thing that French guy pointed out with respect to the nicotine addiction was that most of the hookah establishments today also serve herbal fruit - flavor tobacco light , which is very low on nicotine .
This non -tobacco is composed of 55 % sugar beet leaves , 25 % white beet leaves , 10 % sugar cane leaes and 10 % the inner white part of the grapefruit peel .
Anyway , enough about health — on the whole , the WHO report , which is what The Mayo Clinic based its conclusion upon , was factually and empirically bad , and a Muslim never relies on bad science ( except those guys who want to convert genies into chemical energy ) .
People like to believe that hookah is just about socialization , but such people are rookies who have n’t yet developed a discerning nostril .
Since I ’m a Punjabi and nasally well - endowed — which is part of the reason I am accepted at a Jewish website — I will state very emphatically that there is an art to smoking hookah every bit as complex ( and bullshit ) as the art of wine - tasting .
Hookah smoke should be milky , fluffy and white .
If it ’s thin or grey — or flaccid as I call it – then the water level is either too low or too high .
The smoke should make you feel a creeping tobacco buzz – what I described as wooziness earlier – but definitely should n’t give you a headache or make you stumble around like Michael Weiss at a Jewcy party .
If it ’s too harsh you may need to open up the nozzle a little , blow out a bit of smoke , or repack the bowl so that the coal is n’t burning the tobacco too fast .
The smoke should be dewy , ravishing , endowed , and give you a feeling of emancipatory , soft , cushiony , Nirvana ( Dalai , not Cobain ) .
Hookah feels like a Haiku ( I actually do n’t know what that statement means ) .
Finally , if you start to think that you can fly , you might want to ask the attendant if he put a bit of Afghan opium in your bowl .
Like all things , there is seduction in hookah .
With the people I generally hang out with , men smoke while women take a few hits and watch .
The man smokes for the woman .
She watches to see how refined he is , with what distinction he inhales , how he handles the nozzle , how he heats up the embers in the coal , what mastery he exerts and when he relinquishes control to the next person in the circle .
Still , nothing is more seductive than watching a woman , uh , put her , uh , lips …
In the seductive game of hookah , blowing O ’s has taken on an almost irrational importance .
Most people do n’t know this but blowing O ’s will lead to a spontaneous Islamic orgy in which you quickly marry up to four women and start producing children in order to win the civilizational battle for procreative potency .
( As for the women that are left out , just wave them away and remind them that in the Islamic Paradise when you have infinite virgins – each one endowed with Mystique ’s changeling powers – they will be blessed by having just one unchanging husband .
If they complain , invoke Allah ) .
Really though , blowing O ’s is pretty easy .
You have to make sure that the atmosphere is not breezy – a good hookah establishment has good ventilation but no breeze .
Take a big drag , drop open your mouth , pointing it a bit downwards , and then make punctuated coughs from the back of the throat , while gently pulling your head away from the smoke with each little cough .
For a little instructional video — or just someone to emulate — check out Smoke Rings With Sara with Nine Inch Nails in the background .
For smoke ring acrobatics , this girl is probably the biggest sensation .
You might think you look weird with your mouth hanging open like that , but you really do n’t , because the smoke conceals all .
When , after a few hours you finally manage to produce an O , it ’ll hang in the air and slowly ripple away from you ( like the seventy two dollars you will have spent refilling the hookah ) .
At this point , invoke my name in gratitude , and then order a round of mint tea on yourself .
By the way , according to hookah lore , if a person of the opposite sex next to you starts grabbing your O’s – whether poking or biting at them – start thinking about where you ’d like to go lose your virginity .
If , however , they slingshot a condom through the O , you might want to consider moving over a few spots .
Happy Hookahing !

In the last pygame tutorial we wrote a functional , but not very interesting worm game .
In this tutorial and the next I will making various small improvements to the game .
After that , I will finally leave the worm game and move on to other things .
There will still be improvements to make , but those will be left as an exercise for you .
Bigger food
One problem with the game that we developed last time was that the game is insanely difficult unless your eyesight happens to be really good ( which mine is not ) .
Let ’s start by sizing up the food a little .
I will use a method called pygame .
draw.rect which ( surprise , suprise ) draws a rectangle ( and squares if width and height are equal ) .
We modify the draw method of the Food class :
1 def draw ( self ) :
2 pygame.draw.rect(self.surface , self.color , ( self.x , self.y , 3 , 3 ) , 0 )
3
4
This draws a square at the point ( x , y ) .
The width and the height are both 3 pixels .
The final zero is the line width .
A line width of zero draws a filled rectangle , which is what we want here .
To check if the worm has eaten the food we add a new method to Food , called check :
1 def check ( self , x , y ) :
2 if x < self .x or x > self .x + 3 :
3 return False
4 elif y < self.y or y > self.y +
3 :
5 return False
6 else :
7 return True
8
This will check if the point ( x , y ) is a point within the food square .
The method will return
True if this is the case , or False if it is n’t .
Finally , in the game loop we need to change the test for if the worm has eaten the food .
Instead of using the location ( ) calls , we utilize the new check ( ) method :
1 elif food.check ( worm.x , worm.y ) :
2 score += 1
3 worm.eat ( )
4 print " Score : %d " % score
5 food = Food( screen )
6
Improving the keyboard handler
Another thing you will have noticed while playing is that it is far too easy to crash into yourself by “ reversing ” you direction .
For example , if the worm is moving upwards , pressing down will cause the worm to crash onto itself .
Let ’s prevent that from happening :
1 def event ( self , event ) :
2 " " " Handle keyboard events . " " "
3 if event.key == pygame .
K_UP :
4 if self .vy == 1 : return
5 self.vx = 0
6 self.vy = - 1
7 elif event.key == pygame .
K_DOWN :
8 if self .vy == - 1 : return
9 self.vx = 0
10 self.vy = 1
11 elif event.key == pygame .
K_LEFT :
12 if self.vx == 1 : return
13 self.vx = - 1
14 self.vy = 0
15 elif event.key == pygame .
K_RIGHT :
16 if self.vx == - 1 : return
17 self.vx = 1
18 self.vy = 0
19
For each key , there is one extra test here .
This should not be difficult to understand .
A little optimization
Our little game could do with some optimization .
The call to screen. fill ( ) each time we run the loop slows the game down quite a bit .
Also , since we are redrawing entire worm all the game should get just a little bit slower each time the worm ’s length increases .
But why do we draw the entire worm ?
If we skip clearing the screen all the time , there are only to points we should draw : the first one and the last one .
The last point of the worm should be plotted with the color of the background .
We can change the draw ( ) method in the worm class like this :
1 def draw ( self ) :
2 #for x , y in self .
body :
3 # self.surface.set_at((x , y ) , self.color )
4 x , y = self.body [ 0 ]
5 self.surface.set_at((x , y ) , self.color )
6 x , y = self . body [ - 1 ]
7 self.surface.set_at((x , y ) , ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) )
8
9
This requires us to comment out the screen. fill ( ) call in the game loop .
But we also need to be able to erase the food once it has been eaten .
We add an erase ( ) method to Food .
This looks similar to the draw ( ) method , but uses a different color :
1 def erase ( self ) :
2 pygame.draw.rect(self.surface , ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( self.x , self.y , 3 , 3 ) , 0 )
3
4
Of course , we have to remember to call the erase ( ) method each time the worm eats the food .
Adding sound
Let ’s make the worm make a chomping sound any time it eats the food .
To do this we first have to initialize the mixer and load a sample .
You can search on the ‘ Net for a sound file , or if you have a microphone , record your own , using software like sox .
I recorded myself saying “ GULP ! ” and saved the file as chomp.wav in the same directory as the worm game .
It ’s a good idea to make sure that the sound is short .
1 pygame.mixer.init( )
2 chomp = pygame.mixer.Sound ( " chomp.wav " )
Once we have done this , the variable chomp will hold a Sound object that we can play when we want to .
In our case that is any time the worm eats the food .
The improved game
Here is the full code for the game as it is now :

Exercises
1 . If you play the game for a while you will notice that from time to time the food gets placed in a location where you cannot reach it .
This happens when the food is placed at the right side or the bottom of the game screen .
Why is that ?
What modification do you have to make to the Food constructor to prevent this from happening ?
2. Modify the keyboard handler to only use the left and right keys .
Pressing right should change the mouse direction clock - wise .
Left will change the direction counter - clockwise .
3 . Give the game a different background than black .
4. Notice how Food.erase ( ) can result in the worm being “ cut ” .
Change the game so that any time the food is eaten , after the call to Food.erase ( ) the entire worm gets redrawn .
You may want to have add an optional flag argument to Worm.draw ( ) .
If the flag is true , the entire worm is redrawn .
Otherwise only the first and last pixels are drawn .
5 . Add a sound when the worm crashes .
6 . We increased the size of the food by drawing rectangles instead of pixels .
Could the same be applied to the worm ?
Experiment with this and see what the issues are , if any .
My six - year - old daughter loves oven roasted Jerusalem artichokes , and that ’s a good thing , since they have taken over our garden .
I call Jerusalem artichokes our survival food , as they grow so easily , spread like wildfire , and are ready for eating throughout the winter and early spring .
Sure , they are a pain to clean , but that is a small price to pay for a homegrown meal in the winter .
My family will never starve , as we always have Jerusalem artichokes .
Jerusalem artichokes are not artichokes , and they do not come from Jerusalem .
They are often called sunchokes , as the plant grows very tall in the summer and blooms a golden flower .
Sunchokes are native to the eastern US and were first cultivated by Native Americans , although they do n’t take much cultivation , in my experience .
According to Wikipedia , “ Jerusalem artichokes have 650 mg. potassium per 1 cup ( 150g ) serving .
They are also high in iron , and contain 10 - 12 % of the RDA of fiber , niacin , thiamine , phosphorus and copper . ”
Jerusalem artichokes offer an important source of potassium for those trying to follow the 100 Mile Diet and thus avoiding bananas .
Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes
Wash and cut the tubers into about 1/2 - 1 inch pieces , the more uniform , the better .
Place the cut sunchokes in a glass baking pan and drizzle with olive oil .
Salt and pepper to taste .
Add crushed garlic ( 2 - 3 cloves for a 9 ″ x 13 ″ pan ) .
Bake at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes , stirring occasionally .
The cooking time depends upon the size of your tubers and your taste .
Some people like their sunchokes a little crunchy , some like them soft .
I usually cook them for 60 minutes , but my friend , who gave me my original Jerusalem artichokes for planting , would balk at such “ over cooking ” .
Once , I forgot I had them in the oven and really overcooked them .
They actually turned out tasty this way , so you will need to experiment with your own preferences for cooking times .
Note :
If you do n’t want Jerusalem artichokes taking over your garden , be careful about putting the uncooked cut pieces in your compost … this is how they spread throughout my garden .
Also , chose a planting site wisely , as they will naturally spread .

A history of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) logo
One of the most widely known symbols in the world , in Britain it is recognised as standing for nuclear disarmament — and in particular as the logo of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) .
In the United States and much of the rest of the world it is known more broadly as the peace symbol .
It was designed in 1958 by Gerald Holtom , a professional designer and artist and a graduate of the Royal College of Arts .
He showed his preliminary sketches to a small group of people in the Peace News office in North London and to the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War , one of several smaller organisations that came together to set up CND .
The Direct Action Committee had already planned what was to be the first major anti-nuclear march , from London to Aldermaston , where British nuclear weapons were and still are manufactured .
It was on that march , over the 1958 Easter weekend that the symbol first appeared in public .
Five hundred cardboard lollipops on sticks were produced .
Half were black on white and half white on green .
Just as the churchs liturgical colours change over Easter , so the colours were to change , from Winter to Spring , from Death to Life . 
Black and white would be displayed on Good Friday and Saturday , green and white on Easter Sunday and Monday .
The first badges were made by Eric Austin of Kensington CND using white clay with the symbol painted black .
Again there was a conscious symbolism .
They were distributed with a note explaining that in the event of a nuclear war , these fired pottery badges would be among the few human artifacts to survive the nuclear inferno .
These early ceramic badges can still be found and one , lent by CND , was included in the Imperial War Museums 1999 / 2000 exhibition From the Bomb to the Beatles .
What does it mean ?
Gerald Holtom , a conscientious objector who had worked on a farm in Norfolk during the Second World War , explained that the symbol incorporated the semaphore letters N( uclear ) and D( isarmament ) .
He later wrote to Hugh Brock , editor of Peace News , explaining the genesis of his idea in greater , more personal depth : I was in despair .
Deep despair .
I drew myself : the representative of an individual in despair , with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goyas peasant before the firing squad .
I formalised the drawing into a line and put a circle round it .
Eric Austin added his own interpretation of the design : " the gesture of despair had long been associated with the death of Man and the circle with the unborn child . "
Gerald Holtom had originally considered using the Christian cross symbol within a circle as the motif for the march but various priests he had approached with the suggestion were not happy at the idea of using the cross on a protest march .
Later , ironically , Christian CND were to use the symbol with the central stroke extended upwards to form the upright of a cross .
This adaptation of the design was only one of many subsequently invented by various groups within CND and for specific occasions — with a cross below as a womens symbol , with a daffodil or a thistle incorporated by CND Cymru and Scottish CND , with little legs for a sponsored walk etc .
Whether Gerald Holtom would have approved of some of the more light - hearted versions is open to doubt .
The symbol almost at once crossed the Atlantic .
Bayard Rustin , a close associate of Martin Luther King had come over from the US in order to take part in that first Aldermaston March .
He took the symbol back to the United States where it was used on civil rights marches .
Later it appeared on anti-Vietnam War demonstrations and was even seen daubed in protest on their helmets by American GIs .
Simpler to draw than the Picasso peace dove , it became known , first in the US and then round the world as the peace symbol .
It appeared on the walls of Prague when the Soviet tanks invaded in 1968 , on the Berlin Wall , in Sarajevo and Belgrade , on the graves of the victims of military dictators from the Greek Colonels to the Argentinian junta , and most recently in East Timor .
There have been claims that the symbol has older , occult or anti-Christian associations .
In South Africa , under the apartheid regime , there was an official attempt to ban it .
Various far - right and fundamentalist American groups have also spread the idea of Satanic associations or condemned it as a Communist sign .
However the origins and the ideas behind the symbol have been clearly described , both in letters and in interviews , by Gerald Holtom and his original , first sketches are now on display as part of the Commonweal Collection in Bradford .
Although specifically designed for the anti-nuclear movement it has quite deliberately never been copyrighted .
No one has to pay or to seek permission before they use it .
A symbol of freedom , it is free for all .
This of course sometimes leads to its use , or misuse , in circumstances that CND and the peace movement find distasteful .
It is also often exploited for commercial , advertising or generally fashion purposes .
We cant stop this happening and have no intention of copyrighting it .
All we can do is to ask commercial users if they would like to make a donation .
Any money received is used for CNDs peace education and information work .

FOOTNOTES
1 In September , as part of an ongoing effort to revive American tennis , the United States Tennis Association plans to centralize its player development program at the Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton , Fla. , a new complex that will feature 23 courts ( 14 lighted ) , dormitories , a state - of - theart video lounge and a staff of 30 , including a mental - conditioning coach .
Tuition with room and board will cost as much as $ 42,000 a year .
By comparison , the Russian Tennis Federation 's total youth - development budget is estimated to be between $ 300,000 and $ 400,000 .
2 Timing is vital because neurons are binary : either they fire or they do n't — no gray areas .
Their firing depends solely on whether the incoming impulse is strong enough to exceed the neuron 's threshold of activation .
To explain the implications of this effect , Fields had me imagine a skill circuit in which two neurons need to combine their impulses to make a third , high - threshold neuron fire — for , say , a golf swing .
In order to combine properly , those two incoming impulses must arrive at nearly exactly the same time — sort of like two people running at a heavy door to push it open .
The time window turns out to be about four milliseconds , or roughly the time it takes a bee to flap its wings once .
If the first two signals arrive more than four milliseconds apart , the door stays shut , the crucial third neuron does n't fire and the golf ball soars into the rough ( or , as I was reflexively picturing , Zoe swings and misses the purple ball ) .
" Your brain has so many connections and possibilities that your genes can't code the neurons to time things so precisely , " Fields said .
" But you can build myelin to do it . "
3 These studies shine a new light on the neuro - anatomist Marian C. Diamond 's 1985 finding that the left , inferior parietal lobe of Albert Einstein 's brain , though it had a typical number of neurons , had significantly more glial cells than her other samples , a study that neurologists at the time considered so meaningless as to be nearly comical but that now seems to make sense , bandwidth - wise .
4 The list of myelin - related pathologies is long and , Bartzokis believes , includes multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer 's as well as a wider range of conditions , like schizophrenia , dyslexia , attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism , all of which can be understood as disorders of impulse timing .
5 Venezuela is a more recent example of this phenomenon .
In 1989 , the Houston Astros opened the first of what are now nine major - league academies there , and a few years later , the number of Venezuelans in the big leagues started to rise .
Since 1995 , 125 Venezuelans have broken into Major League Baseball , 51 more than had appeared in all the years up to that point .
6 In children , myelin arrives in a series of waves , some of them determined by biological code , some of them dependent on activity .
These waves last into young adulthood .
Until this time , the brain is extraordinarily receptive to learning new skills .
Though adults retain the ability to myelinate throughout life ( thankfully , 5 percent of our oligos remain immature , ready to answer the call ) , anyone who has tried to learn a language or musical instrument late in life can testify that it costs a lot more time and sweat to build the requisite circuitry .
The effortlessness is the first thing to go .
7 Replicating the Spartak system in the United States ( or , for that matter , installing Dominican - style baseball academies or forcing young golfers to practice only at driving ranges ) would likely not create a sudden wellspring of stars .
The reasons that the United States is losing ground on the talent map have less to do with training mechanisms and more to do with bigger factors : a highly distractive youth culture , a focus on the glamour of winning rather than on the brickwork of building technique and a sporting environment that is gentler than those found in many of the world 's harder corners .
" You can't keep breast - feeding them all the time , " Robert Lansdorp , a tennis coach in Los Angeles , told me .
" You 've got to make them an independent thinker . "
Lansdorp , who is in his 60s , has coached Sharapova , along with the former No. 1 - ranked players Pete Sampras , Tracy Austin and Lindsay Davenport , all three of whom grew up in the same area and played at the same run -of - the - mill tennis clubs near Los Angeles .
" You do n't need a fancy academy , " he said .
" You need fundamentals and discipline , and in this country nobody gives a damn about fundamentals and discipline . "
Lansdorp also mentioned that he 'd visited Spartak last year to teach a clinic .
" It was a pretty different place , " he said .
" But that Larisa , she sure knows her stuff . "
If a common heritage conferred peace , then perhaps the long history of conflict in the Middle East would have been resolved years ago .
For , according to a new scientific study , Jews are the genetic brothers of Palestinians , Syrians and Lebanese , and they all share a common genetic lineage that stretches back thousands of years .
" Jews and Arabs are all really children of Abraham , " says Harry Ostrer , M.D. , Director of the Human Genetics Program at New York University School of Medicine , an author of the new study by an international team of researchers in the United States , Europe , and Israel .
" And all have preserved their Middle Eastern genetic roots over 4,000 years , " he says .
The researchers analyzed the Y chromosome , which is usually passed unchanged from father to son , of more than 1,000 men worldwide .
Throughout human history , alterations have occurred in the sequence of chemical bases that make up the DNA in this so - called male chromosome , leaving variations that can be pinpointed with modern genetic techniques .
Related populations carry the same specific variations .
In this way , scientists can track descendants of large populations and determine their common ancestors .
Specific regions of the Y chromosome were analyzed in 1,371 men from 29 worldwide populations , including Jews and non-Jews from the Middle East , North Africa , sub -Saharan Africa , and Europe .
The study , published in the May 9 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found that Jewish men shared a common set of genetic signatures with non-Jews from the Middle East , including Palestinians , Syrians , and Lebanese , and these signatures diverged significantly from non-Jewish men outside of this region .
Consequently , Jews and Arabs share a common ancestor and are more closely related to one another than to non-Jews from other areas of the world .
The study also revealed that despite the complex history of Jewish migration in the Diaspora ( the time since 556 B.C. when Jews migrated out of Palestine ) , Jewish communities have generally not intermixed with non-Jewish populations .
If they had , then Jewish men from different regions of the world would not share the same genetic signatures in their Y chromosome .
" Because ancient Jewish law states that Jewish religious affiliation is assigned maternally , our study afforded the opportunity to assess the contribution of non-Jewish men to present - day Jewish genetic diversity , " says Michael Hammer , Ph.D. , from the University of Arizona , Tucson , who is the lead author of the new study .
" It was surprising to see how significant the Middle Eastern genetic signal was in Jewish men from different communities in the Diaspora , " he says .
The authors of this study are : Dr. Ostrer from NYU School of Medicine ; Michael F. Hammer , Alan J. Redd , Elizabeth T. Wood , M. Roxane Bonner , Hamdi Jarjanazil , and Tanya Karafet from the University of Arizona , Tucson ; Silvana Santachlara - Benerecetti , University of Pavia , Italy ; Ariella Oppenheim , Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel ; Mark A.

ABU DHABI ( Reuters ) - OPEC dismissed further calls to boost oil output from top consumer the United States , saying the global market is well supplied and the producer group has little control over oil prices near $ 90 a barrel .
U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman on Saturday urged top exporter Saudi Arabia and OPEC to raise supply on a visit to the kingdom .
His appeal came just days after President George W. Bush asked the group for more oil on a separate visit to Riyadh , and less than two weeks before OPEC ’s next meeting on February 1 .
“ I do n’t think there is a need to increase because the market is well supplied , ” Oil Minister Abdullah al - Attiyah told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Abu Dhabi on Sunday .
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) is keeping a close eye on the market and stood ready to pump more when needed , OPEC Secretary - General Abdullah al - Badri said .
“ If we reach the conclusion the fundamental data warrant an increase in production , then our oil ministers will not hesitate to decree this , ” Badri told German weekly magazine Der Spiegel in an interview published on Saturday .
“ But at present we see no need for this . ”
Bodman and Bush , concerned about the impact of high prices on the world ’s largest economy , have said more oil would help ease tight supplies .
“ It ’s important there ’s an increase in supply , ” Bodman said ahead of a meeting with Saudi Oil Minister Ali al - Naimi on Saturday .
“ The figures would indicate a call for increased supply . ”
A statement from the Saudi Press Agency after the meeting said the two had agreed on the importance of well - balanced and stable oil markets , but gave no further details .
Saudi Arabia is OPEC ’s most influential member and the only one among its 13 members able to boost supply significantly at short notice .
The group produces more than a third of the world ’s oil .
OPEC officials say that speculation has divorced the oil price from market fundamentals , leaving it with little power to tame high energy costs .
“ You have to segregate the physical market from the paper market , ” Attiyah said on Sunday .
“ We ’ve checked with our clients and they ’ve confirmed that they do n’t feel there is a need for more oil .
Oil inventories are comfortable . ”
Attiyah said he would meet with Bodman later this week .
Last week , he said the producer group needed to be cautious ahead of the seasonal drop in consumption in the second quarter and because of the possible effect on oil demand of a U.S. recession .
U.S. crude settled at $ 90.57 a barrel on Friday , having fallen from a record of over $ 100 earlier this month .
Qatar is one of OPEC ’s smallest oil producers , with output of around 800,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) .

On Friday , it got to be too much for Alegre , a diarist on the flagship liberal blog DailyKos , who frequently writes in support of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ I ’ve put up with the abuse and anger because I ’ve always believed in what our online community has tried to accomplish in this world , ” Alegre wrote Friday evening .
“ No more . ”
Objecting to the tone of attacks against Mrs. Clinton and her supporters on the blog , the diarist called for a “ writers strike . ”
“ This is a strike – a walkout over unfair writing conditions at DailyKos .
It does not mean that if conditions get better I wo n’t ‘ work ’’ at DailyKos again , ” Alegre wrote , promising to come back only “ if we ever get to the point where we ’re engaging each other in discussion rather than facing off in shouting matches . ”
The blogosphere has never been known for its polite , gentle discourse , and while fiercely partisan , being a Democrat does not make one immune from attacks from the lefty blogs ( see Lieberman , Joseph I. ) .
But now , the major internal divisions within the Democratic Party seem to be splitting liberal bloggers .
So what happens when the unity enforcement mechanism becomes disjointed ?
Alegre ’s post attracted a strong reaction , both negative and positive .
The comment board was shut down about 5.5 hours after it was posted , with 1258 comments .
One user , Sentient , called for a “ permanent succession ” :
“ Why should this site and Kos profit from the traffic we add to DailyKos , and the sense by outsiders that it represents the netroots as a whole ? ” the blogger asked , adding later , “ But I just do n’t see how people come back together on a daily basis after a falling out like this . ”
Another poster challenged Alegre ’s assertion that “ DailyKos is not the site it once was thanks to the abusive nature of certain members of our community . ”
From jdodsonvls :
The only difference is now we ’re attacking a candidate whom YOU feel strongly about .
Sorry .
It happens .
But if you do n’t understand why we dislike her , if you do n’t understand that she stood opposed to the blogroots for years , that this community grew into what it is today despite her , not because of her , then you ’re right , perhaps this is n’t the blog for you .
You see , decentralized though we are , I ’ve always felt that the vast majority of bloggers share a point of view .
Out with the old way of doing politics , and in with the new .
To many of us , Hillary Clinton , every bit as much as Joe Lieberman , typifies a wing of the Democratic party that is anathema , a wing that is responsible for the party ’s downfall , and complicit with the rise of radical conservatism .
Markos Moulitsas , the founder of DailyKos , spoke to Jake Tapper of ABC News about the so - called strike , which he said was really more like a “ boycott . ”
“ But whatever they call it , I think it ’s great , ” Mr. Moulitsas said .
“ It ’s a big Internet , so I hope they find what they ’re looking for . ”
Many feel that one of the other major liberal blogs , MyDD , tends to attract bloggers more favorable to Mrs. Clinton .
If the rift lingers after the primaries , the organizational value of the blogs could be compromised .
Joe Gandelman at The Moderate Voice blog writes : “ Where progressive and moderate bloggers and commenters used to get worked up arguing about George Bush , there now a real angry , scolding tone in many comments left by Clinton and Obama supporters . ”
He continues : “ In short , the strike / boycott is a symptom — and with so many months to go until the Democratic convention , the prognosis for true Democratic Party unity going into the election seems ‘ questionable . ’ ”
Human rights groups today accused Robert Mugabe 's government of harassing and intimidating opposition supporters before Saturday 's national elections .
Amnesty International cited a case on March 7 , when three members of the Morgan Tsvangirai - led faction of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) were ordered by intelligence officers to take down election posters .
According to Amnesty , the officials forced the opposition supporters to chew the posters and swallow them .
" We continue to receive reports of intimidation , harassment and violence against perceived supporters of opposition candidates - with many in rural regions fearful that there will be retribution after the elections , " said Amnesty 's Zimbabwe researcher , Simeon Mawanza , who has recently returned from the country .
The US has also voiced concerns about the fairness of Saturday 's election , in which Mugabe faces two serious challengers , Tsvangirai and Simba Makoni , who has broken with the president 's ruling Zanu - PF party , to run as an independent .
" We call on the government of Zimbabwe , including the Zimbabwe electoral commission , to take concrete actions to address these significant shortcomings , including respecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Zimbabwean people , " the US state department said .
The US , which imposed sanctions on Mugabe and his inner circle after he allegedly rigged his 2002 re-election , has been barred from sending election monitors to Zimbabwe .
EU observers have also not been invited , so the vote will be monitored by the African Union , as well as representatives from China , Iran and Russia .
Both the MDC and Makoni have accused Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party of trying to rig the ballot , using the security services to intimidate voters and depriving the opposition of media coverage .
" The conditions are definitely not conducive to free and fair elections .
Our supporters are still being harassed , and the police are being used as weapons for intimidation , " the MDC secretary - general , Tendai Biti , told Agence - France - Presse .
The opposition and human rights groups are particularly worried by the government 's decision to allow police into polling stations - ostensibly to assist illiterate and infirm voters .
The US state department said the move was one of several that could " preclude free and fair elections on March 29 " .
All of the pain caused by inheritance can be traced back to the fact that inheritance forces ‘ is - a ’ rather than ‘ has - a’ relationships .
If class R2 Unit extends Droid , then a R2 Unit is -a Droid .
If class Jedi contains an instance variable of type Lightsabre , then a Jedi has -a Lightsabre .
The difference between is - a and has - a relationships is well known and a fundamental part of OOAD , but what is less well known is that almost every is - a relationship would be better off re-articulated as a has - a relationship .
I ’m in the middle of dealing with some ActiveRecord , um , ‘ features , ’ so I do n’t have time to write an interesting , thoughtful essay .
Nor do I have time to write an overly long and meandering essay as Raganwald readers have come to expect .
So instead , let ’s pretend there ’re six or seven closely typewritten pages of self - indulgent bloggery leading up to …When classical OO languages ( including Ruby and Java ) implement inheritance , what actually happens is this :
First , the subclass acquires the interface of the superclass ( latently typed languages like Ruby do n’t do this explicitly , but it is still true ) .
Second , under the hood where you ca n’t see it , the compiler makes room for a reference to the superclass and arranges for methods that the subclass does not implement to be delegated to the superclass .
In other words , whenever you declare that Child IS - A Person , the compiler writes “ Child HAS - A Person ” and “ Child BEHAVES-LIKE - A Person ” and “ Child DELEGATES -TO Person ” for you .
The right way to look at single inheritance is therefore that it is a specialization of composition .
Like all specializations , it does less .
It is more specific .
And therefore , when it is exactly what you mean to accomplish , it is more useful : you need fewer lines of code to express it , the compiler optimizes the relationship for you , and since it is a very well - known idiom , it expresses your intent clearly to other programmers .
On the other hand , when single inheritance is not exactly what you mean to express , you have two choices : you can greenspun some more general feature out of it , adding accidental complexity to your code and making it less readable , or you can use the more general purpose , flexible tool : composition .
Like all Golden Hammers , seeing every OO problem as a single inheritance nail leads to trouble .
Single inheritance is probably Turing Equivalent : given enough determination , you can probably write any arbitrary program if you are prepared to twist your code into knots as it bows down and sacrifices readability to the inheritance demon .
However , breaking free of its grip is simple : you need only see inheritance as a tool like any other tool : it is not superior to the others at your disposal .
It is not the goal .
A nice pyramid of classes and subclasses is not your objective when you set out to design a program .
When you see it as just another chapter in the book , you see when to use it and when to set it aside .
And in fact , if you see it as a particularly thin chapter in the book , you may be surprised how much easier it is to work with OO programs .
And if you see it as a couple of pages in the chapter on composition and delegation … you will be on the road to understanding .
For those who just can't wait until the iPhone SDK and third - party apps arrive next month , an iPhone 1.1.3 " upgrade " jailbreak has been released .
It 's Windows - only for now , and it requires that users upgrade from a 1.1.1 or 1.1.2 iPhone that has already been jailbroken .
In other words : if you 've already upgraded to 1.1.3 for all those shiny new features , you have a little downgrading work ahead of you before you can step up to a jailbroken 1.1.3 iPhone .
The iBrickr Windows app ( great name , I know ) hails from Nate True at cre.ations.net , and it works by guiding you through a process of downloading a modified version of the official iPhone 1.1.3 firmware .
iBrickr then moves a packaged firmware installer onto the iPhone , after which you simply run the installer , wait around 15 minutes , and enjoy the shiny official features and all your extra third - party apps .
For those who do n't have access to a Windows machine to do this with , True says to expect a Mac app soon .
Of course , you can also just wait for Apple to officially launch an SDK and third - party app support .
Update :
There is now a quick & dirty Mac OS X jailbreak available .
AS a key pollster for Senator Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign , Joel Benenson has a job that would typically make him one of the most sought - after voices in the candidate ’s inner circle .
But that status depends on who the candidate is .
“ I ’ve worked for Barack for 12 months , and in 12 months , he ’s asked me twice about poll numbers , ” said Mr. Benenson , who has worked over the years for many politicians in the metropolitan region , including former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey .
“ I ’ve never worked for a candidate who asked less about polls . ”
It is not that his candidate is not interested in how he is perceived by the public , Mr. Benenson is quick to point out , but rather that Senator Obama is so confident about his message  that he offers a real change  that he does n’t use poll results to dictate his latest platform , as Mr. Benenson implied some other candidates do .
Still , Mr. Benenson and his polling data have played a critical role in helping crystallize the messages not only of Senator Obama , but of several other candidates that he or his company , Benenson Strategy Group , has handled over the years , including a New York City mayoral candidate , Representative Anthony D. Weiner of Queens ; former Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey ; and the Clinton - Gore team in 1996 .
Kurt Westergaard has been in hiding in Denmark since 2005 Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard , who depicted the Prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban , says he will sue the maker of an anti-Islam film .
Mr Westergaard says his cartoon , which sparked riots two years ago , was used in the film by Dutch politician Geert Wilders without permission .
Mr Westergaard told Danish TV that his cartoon was a protest against terrorism , not Islam as a whole .
The Danish journalists ' union is suing on his behalf for copyright violation .
" Wilders has the right to make his movie but he has not permission to use my drawing , " Mr Westergaard told Denmark 's TV2 .
" This has nothing to do with freedom of speech , " he said .
" I will not accept my cartoon being taken out of its original context and used in a completely different one . "
Mr Westergaard has lived in hiding in Denmark since his cartoon led to unrest in the Middle East and beyond following its publication in 2005 .
' Spiteful verses '
There were further protests when it was re-published by the Danish press earlier this year .
Mr Westergaard says he is once again in danger because the cartoon has been used in Mr Wilders ' film .
It may surprise some radical Muslims that the two men they have uniformly condemned as anti-Islamic do not seem to see eye - to - eye , says BBC religious affairs correspondent Frances Harrison .
Mr Wilders ' 15 - minute - long film , posted on the internet , uses the cartoon twice .
It also shows footage of attacks by extremist groups on Western targets , including those of 11 September 2001 , alongside verses from the Koran .
Pictures of a woman being stoned , scenes from a beheading and images of the Dutch director Theo van Gogh , who was murdered by a radical Islamist in 2004 , are included .
The film ends with someone turning pages of a Koran , followed by a tearing sound .
A text that appears on the screen says : " The sound you heard was from a page ( being torn from a ) phone book .
" It is not up to me , but up to the Muslims themselves to tear the spiteful verses from the Koran . "
' Heinous ' Mr Wilders has said he is happy at what he sees as a positive reaction to his film .
But the world 's most populous Muslim nation , Indonesia , strongly condemned it .
Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Kristiarto Legowo said the film was " misleading and full of racism " - an irresponsible act " done under the blanket of freedom of the press " .
The foreign ministry in Bangladesh issued a statement calling the film " unwarranted " and " mindless " and said it would " offend millions of Muslims " .
Iran said it was blasphemous , anti-Islamic and heinous - a sign it said of deep hatred felt by Westerners towards Muslims .

Hillary Clinton Lied About Her Bosnia Trip in 1996
Please do n’t let this ruin your faith in the Clinton ’s .
I know it is hard to believe but a Clinton was caught in a lie last week .
Last week Hillary recalled her trip to Bosnia in 1996 , she recalled it alright , the problem is she did n’t recall it correctly .
In a speech last week Hillary talked about how she landed in Bosnia under the fire of snipers and had to duck and cover upon landing .
This was n’t exactly the truth however , as the video below shows .
Hillary was using her Bosnia “ experience ” as proof that she has the experience to be commander in chief , this has now gone up in flames .
She is showing us that she has learned quite a bit from Bill , lie , lie , lie , deny , deny , deny .
Her campaign is now spinning her fabrication as a “ misremembering ” , but we know the truth .
A cornered Clinton is a dangerous Clinton , just ask Vincent Foster .
Mr Kambaksh said he had been attacked by fellow inmates in jail
Pervez Kambaksh , 23 , told the UK's Independent newspaper from his prison cell he was denied access to a lawyer and not allowed to defend himself .
Mr Kambaksh was convicted of distributing an article insulting to Islam , which he denies .
His appeal against the death sentence is pending .
Mr Kambaksh has been held in a small , overcrowded cell in the northern town of Mazar - e - Sharif since his arrest in October , the Independent said .
He shares his cell with 34 others , described by the Independent as terrorists , murderers and robbers .
He said he had been attacked by fellow inmates who believed him to be a heretic , but that this intimidation had eased off .
Arrest and charges
His ordeal began when he was questioned by some religious teachers at his university last October .
They said some other students claimed he had written a blasphemous article .
I wanted to say : ' This is wrong , please listen to me , ' but I was given no chance to explain
Pervez Kambaksh
Some days later he was told the Afghan intelligence services wanted to see him .
In the police station he was put under arrest , he said , and told it was for his own protection as otherwise he might be killed .
After a month in jail Mr Kambaksh was charged in court with blasphemy and other crimes against Islam .
In late January he expected the trial to start but instead was taken into the courtroom just before it was due to shut .
He says the judges and prosecutor repeated some details of the case and then declared him guilty and announced the sentence was death .
" The judges had made up their mind about the case without me , " he told the Independent .
" The way they talked to me , looked at me , was the way they look at a condemned man .
" I wanted to say : ' This is wrong , please listen to me , ' but I was given no chance to explain . "
' Kabul appeal '
At no point in the closed - door proceedings did Mr Kambaksh have a lawyer and he says he was not allowed to defend himself either .
The Afghan Senate confirmed the sentence on 30 January , but backed down a day later after an international outcry .
The jailed reporter 's appeal is expected to be heard in an open court in Kabul , the Independent said .
President Hamid Karzai would have to approve the death sentence for it to be carried out .
Ah , the saga of misinterpreted micro-benchmarks !
Developers advocating one technology over another have long used micro-benchmarks and trivial examples to illustrate their point .
This is most often seen in the area of language implementation , where performance is a critical ( and often emotional ) consideration .
The Computer Language Benchmarks
Game is a good example of this .
With the rise of the JVM as a platform for language development , we ’ve been seeing a lot of benchmarks directly comparing some of these languages with each other and with Java itself .
Actually , it seems that the popular trio ( as far as benchmarking goes ) are Scala , JRuby and Groovy .
It ’s been a bit of a favorite past - time of the blogosphere to create benchmarks for these languages and then spin up controversial posts about the results .
Back in September , Darek
Young wrote a post illustrating a ray tracer benchmark which really caught my eye :
Results ray.java
12.89s ray.scala
11.224s ray.groovy
2h 31 m 42 s I was expecting the Groovy code to run longer than the Scala code but was shocked at the actual difference .
All three versions of the code produce identical images : ( fullsize here )
Wow !
I ’ve seen these results dozens of times ( looking back at the post ) , but they never cease to startle me .
How could Groovy be that much slower than everything else ?
Granted it is very much a dynamic language , compared to Java and Scala which are peers in static - land .
But still , this is a ray tracer we ’re talking about !
There ’s no meta - programming involved to muddle the scene , so a halfway - decent optimizer should be able to at least squeeze that gradient down to maybe 5 x as slow , rather than a factor of 830 .
If this were an isolated incident , I would probably just blow it off as bad benchmarking , or perhaps an odd corner case that trips badness in the Groovy runtime .
Then a week later , I read this post by Pete Knego :
Test Groovy Java Java vs Groovy ( times faster ) Simple counter 8.450 150 56 x Binary tree building 19.500 2.580 7.6x Binary tree traversing 2.530 76 33 x Prime numbers 43.270 1.170 37 x
All [ non - decimal ] times are in milliseconds .
Well , this is really disappointing .
I expected Groovy to be slower but not by that much .
In order to understand where does such a performance hit come from we have to peek under the hood .
The culprit of all this is of course Groovy ’s dynamic nature , implemented as MOP .
MOP is a way for Groovy to know which class elements ( fields / properties , methods , interfaces , superclasses , etc.. ) are defined on an object and to have a way to alter that data or invoke it .
The core of MOP are two methods defined on GroovyObject : get/setProperty ( ) and invokeMethod ( ) .
This methods are called every time you access a field or call a method on a Groovy object and quite a lot of work is done behind the scenes .
The internals of the MOP are listed in MetaClass interface and implemented in six different classes .
All of this is old news , so the question is :
Why am I bringing this up now ?
Well , I recently saw a post on Groovy Zone by none - other - than Rick Ross , talking about this very subject .
Rick ’s post was in response to two posts ( here and here ) , discussing ways to improve Groovy code performance by obfuscating code .
Final result ?
This text is being written as I was changing and trying things , I gained 20s from
minor changes of which I lost track .
I am currently at 1m30s ( down from the
original 4 m and comparing with Java ’s 4s ) .
I ’m sorry , this is acceptable performance ?
This is someone who ’s spent time trying to optimize Groovy , and by his own admission , Groovy is 23 x slower than the equivalent Java code .
Certainly this is a far cry from the 830 x slower in the ray tracer benchmark , but in this case it ’s simple string manipulation , rather than a mathematically intensive test .
Coming back to Rick ’s entry , he looks at the conclusion and has this to say about it :
Language performance is highly overrated Much is often made of the theoretical “ performance ” of a language based on benchmarks and arcane tests .
There have even been cases where vendors have built cheats into their products specifically so they would score well on benchmarks .
In the end , runtime execution speed is not as important a factor as a lot of people would think it is if they only read about performance comparisons .
Other factors such as maintainability , interoperability , developer productivity and tool and library support are all very significant , too .
Wait a minute , that sounds a lot like something else I ’ve read recently !
Maybe something like this :
Is picking out the few performance weaknesses the right way to judge the
overall speed of Groovy ?
To me the Groovy performance is absolutely sufficient because of the
easy integration with Java .
If something ’s too slow , I do it in Java .
And Java compared to Python is in most cases much faster .
I appreciate the efforts of the Groovy team to improve the performance ,
but if they would n’t , this would be no real problem to me .
Groovy is the
grooviest language with a development team always having the simplicity
and elegance of the language usage in mind – and that counts to me .
This is almost a mantra for the Groovy proponents : performance is irrelevant .
What ’s worse , is that the few times where they ’ve been pinned down on a particular performance issue that ’s obviously a problem , the response seems to be along the lines of : this test does n’t really show anything , since micro-benchmarks are useless .
I ’m sorry , but that ’s a cop-out .
Face up to it , Groovy ’s performance is terrible .
Anyone who claims otherwise is simply not looking at the evidence .
Oh , and if you ’re going to claim that this is just a function of shoe - horning a dynamic language onto the JVM , check out a direct comparison between JRuby and and Groovy .
Groovy comes out ahead in only four of the tests .
What really bothers me about the Groovy performance debates is that most “ Groovyists ” seem to believe that performance is in the eye of the beholder .
The thought is that it ’s all just a subjective issue and so should be discounted almost completely from the language selection process .
People who say this have obviously forgotten what it means to try to write a scalable non-trivial application which performs decently under load .
When you start getting hundreds of thousands of hits an hour , you ’ll be willing to sell your soul for every last millisecond .
The fact is that this is simply not the case .
Performance is important and it must be considered when choosing a language for your next project .
Now I ’m not implying that it should be the sole consideration , after all , we do n’t use Assembly much anymore .
But we ca n’t just discard performance altogether as a means of evaluation .
Developer productivity is important , but it means nothing if the end result does n’t meet basic responsiveness standards .
It ’s like the first time I tried Mingle ( which is written using JRuby BTW ) back when it was still in pre-beta .
The application was amazing , but it took literally minutes to render the most basic of pages .
The problem was closely related to the state of the JRuby interpreter at the time and its poor memory management with respect to Rails .
In the end , the application was completely unusable .
ThoughtWorks had produced an amazing piece of software in a remarkably short time span , but the cost was the use of a language and framework which ( at the time ) led to unredeemable performance .
They spared the developers at the expense of the end -users .
Both Mingle and JRuby have come a long way since those first tests .
Charles and the gang have put an intense amount of effort into optimizing the JRuby runtime and JIT compiler .
They ’ve gone from an implementation which was 5 - 10 x slower than MRI 1.8.6 to a fully compatible implementation that is usually faster than the original .
Obviously performance is achievable in a dynamic language on the JVM , so why is Groovy still so horrible ?
The only answer I can think of is that the Groovy core team just does n’t value performance .
Why else would they consistently bury their heads in the sand , ignoring the issues even when the evidence is right in front of them ?
It ’s as if they have repeated their own “ performance is irrelevant ” mantra so many times that they are actually starting to believe it .
It ’s unfortunate , because Groovy really is an interesting effort .
I may not see any value for my needs , but I can understand how a lot of people would .
It fills a nice syntactic niche that other languages ( such as Ruby ) just miss .
But all of its benefits are for naught if it ca n’t deliver when it counts .
The Television Spectacular , in three parts -- Now available on DVD !
It is perhaps the most original science documentary ever made .
Dr Tatiana 's Sex Advice to All Creation is an all - singing , all - dancing musical .
No joke : there are 14 original songs , including the hermaphrodite song and the female promiscuity song ( which features the refrain , " I want to do it again , I want to do it again , my mother always said you can't have too many men " ) .
And that 's not all .
Dr Tatiana -- played by a white - leather - clad Olivia Judson -- interviews scientists , chases wild banana slugs and elephant seals , dispenses sex advice in her clinic , and conducts a Jerry - Springer - style TV show within the TV show .
But where Springer 's guests are troubled humans , Dr Tatiana 's are penis - fencing flatworms , sexless rotifers , and fruit flies that use drugs to keep their mates faithful .
Dr Tatiana 's Sex Advice to All Creation consists of three one - hour episodes .
Episode One : The Trouble with Sex
The female button beetle mates with her son and then eats him .
Some male mites copulate with their sisters inside their mother 's womb .
So when is incest acceptable ?
Sea hares engage in lengthy orgies - they are hermphrodites , so they can play the male role and the female role both at the same time .
When is it a good idea to be a hermaphrodite ?
Meanwhile , the bdelloid rotifer has not had sex for millions of generations .
Why not ?
And why do n't the rest of us follow her example ?
Find out ...
This episode features several interviews , including with Dan Fessler , an anthropologist at UCLA , and with Janet Leonard , a banana slug expert at UC Santa Cruz .
And it features songs such as The Trouble with Sex , and Strangely Familiar .
Episode Two : Good - time Girls Female field crickets trade food for sex .
Female ladybugs are wanton -- they do n't even need food to be persuaded to leap into bed .
Recent discoveries have destroyed the old notion that males are natural philanderers and females are naturally chaste -- it now turns out that , in most species , the more promiscuous females have more and healthier children .
But why ?
And what do females find attractive in a guy , anyway ?
That depends .
Female Australian seaweed flies , for example , wo n't have sex with a fellow unless he can physically overpower them .
And where do humans fit in ?
Find out ...
This episode includes interviews with Ned Place of the UC Berkeley Hyena Project , Mike Majerus , ladybug specialist and evolutionary biologist at Cambridge University , and Martie Haselton , an evolutionary psychologist at UCLA .
And it features songs such as the ladybug promiscuity song and the hyena song .
Episode Three : His Nature
Why do males of so many species -- such as the black - winged damselfly -- have such complicated penises , complete with bristles and nobbles and spikes ?
Because the penis is not just for sperm delivery : it can also have other purposes , like persuading a promiscuous female to dump the sperm of her previous lover .
And why do males fight all the time ?
Why do females of some species cannibalise their mates ?
Worse , what if you 're ugly ?
What if you 're poor ?
What if you 're a wimp ?
What if you 're a poor ugly wimp ?
All is not necessarily lost .
Find out why ...
This episode features interviews with penis specialist Alan Dixson of San Diego Zoo , cannibalism specialist Maydianne Andrade of the University of Toronto , and lizard king Barry Sinervo of UC Santa Cruz .
It includes the songs Pocket Rocket , about the evolution of penis shape , and the sexual cannibalism song ( Hungry for Love ) .
The dirt bikes and dune buggies swarm the sandy slopes by the thousands , turning these giant dunes at California ’s southeast border into anthills of frenetic activity .
Smugglers in nearby Mexico ca n’t resist trying to blend into the crowd .
They shoot across the border in souped - up vehicles loaded with illegal immigrants and drugs and elude U.S. Border Patrol agents by playing the part of dune enthusiasts : wearing helmets and decorating their bikes and all - terrain vehicles with decals and flags .
The cat - and - mouse game turned deadly recently when a suspected smuggler driving a Hummer ran over an agent and fled back across the border over the dunes .
The agent ’s death focused attention on the federal government ’s enforcement strategy in this remote corner of the border .
While the Department of Homeland Security expands fencing in other trouble spots on the Southwest frontier , officials say fortifying the border at the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area has been difficult because of shifting sands that render current barriers ineffective .
By the end of the year , they say , they will have erected a new type of fortification that they hope will cut down on incursions .
But many critics , including the Border Patrol union , former federal law enforcement officers and environmental groups , say the plan to erect better barriers ignores the most significant problem : the recreational dune riders whose presence poses safety risks for agents and hampers enforcement efforts .
The dunes area is one of the few places on the American Southwest frontier where a major highway runs up against open border .
Interstate 8 is generally less than three miles away and only 500 yards off in some spots , giving smugglers easy access to a major transportation corridor .
The public has been barred from other federally managed lands near the border , such as Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona , much of which remains closed six years after an employee there was killed by a suspected smuggler .
Critics say the dunes remain open because of the powerful off - road industry , which is seeking to expand access to public lands and has gained the support of the Bush administration .
The border dunes are part of the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area , which is managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management .
Officials there say they have no plans for any closures .
Senior Border Patrol officials say preserving public access to federal lands fits the agency ’s goal of improving the quality of life in border areas .
Chief Patrol Agent Paul Beeson , one of two chiefs responsible for the area , said the goal is to balance enforcement and public access .
“ I believe that the best way to control that area is through the use of tactical infrastructure , and through use of agents and through the use of technology , ” Beeson said .
“ I do n’t think at this point that depriving people from the use of those lands is the best solution . ”
The federal government ’s position on the dunes is different from its aggressive actions elsewhere on the border , where Homeland Security has moved to waive environmental laws and sue private landowners in the name of putting up barriers and tightening security .
Those advocating a dunes closure say it would need to cover a 7,842 - acre area between the border and Interstate 8 , which amounts to less than 10 % of the 80,000 acres open to off - roaders -- most of that area lying north of I - 8 .
“ It ’s mystifying that this out - of - control situation continues to exist , yet on other parts of the border the Department of Homeland Security seems willing to flex its muscles to get what it wants , ” said Daniel R. Patterson , southwest director for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and a former BLM ecologist .
“ Border security should certainly trump the off - road industry , ” he said .
“ But it ’s not clear that ’s the case with this administration . ”
The Imperial Sand Dunes , stretching 40 miles from the border to California ’s Chocolate Mountains , attract more than 1 million riders every year .
The wind - sculpted dunes , evoking lunar landscapes and the vastness of the Sahara Desert , have served as backdrops for Hollywood movies such as “ Star Wars : Return of the Jedi ” and “ Jarhead . ”
For smugglers , the dunes offer unique advantages .
The area shares an eight - mile frontier with Mexico and has great freeway access .
Crowd camouflage is easy when recreational enthusiasts visit the area in the winter months , especially on holiday weekends .
More than 190,000 people have flocked to the area south of the interstate since October .
Smugglers send teams of lookouts into the crowds .
Outfitted in full body suits and helmets , they look like everyone else .
They roam around , monitor agents ’ positions and radio the all - clear at times .
Drugs often are brought across in Hummers and other sport utility vehicles .
Sometimes teams of ATV riders wear marijuana - filled backpacks and file across the frontier in convoys of up to 10 vehicles .
They unload their packs into ordinary - looking vehicles sitting among hundreds in crowded campgrounds .
Last year in and around the dunes area , federal authorities seized more than 48,000 pounds of drugs -- mostly marijuana -- and arrested 2,100 suspected illegal immigrants .
Compounding enforcement difficulties is the fact that recreational riders for years crossed freely back and forth across the border , sometimes going several miles deep into Mexico in search of smooth sand .
Authorities in January instituted a zero- tolerance policy that threatens riders with arrest , but agents say the cross - border jaunts continue , making it hard to distinguish smugglers from off - roaders .
“ It ’s a honey hole ” for smugglers , said Border Patrol Agent Quinn Palmer , an agency spokesman , who said keeping track of the cross - border traffic is “ logistically impossible . ”
“ We have thousands of people out here on a busy weekend with no clearly defined border , ” he said .
Unlike other frontiers , the first line of physical border defenses is not at the international boundary .
It ’s along Interstate 8 , where rail - like metal vehicle barriers line the highway .
Authorities say they have been effective in funneling traffickers to choke points near highway onramps .
But critics say the strategy steers traffickers through campgrounds .
The suspected smuggler who killed Agent Luis Aguilar in January sped past the Buttercup campground at an estimated 55 mph .
Last year , gun-toting smugglers ordered campers to clear an area .
Vendors who sell helmets , flags and automotive parts to dune crowds frequently report thefts by border bandits .
Large smuggling organizations in Mexico specialize in trafficking through the area .
A January raid by Mexican police on a gang hide - out in Mexicali turned up 81 ATVs and dirt bikes .
By closing the area , many agents say , they would get a clear picture of cross - border activity .
Anyone heading north from the dunes area could be pinpointed .
And smugglers would n’t be able to offload their drugs easily .
One veteran agent called the dunes “ our nightmare ” and added that most agents support a no - drive zone .
Smugglers , he said , would lose their main advantage if they could n’t mix in with the crowds .
“ If we closed the sand dunes , anybody coming out of the area would be a suspect , ” said the agent , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Richard Pierce , executive vice president of the National Border Patrol Council , the union that represents agents , said the enforcement strategy makes no sense .
“ To say we ’re trying to secure the border and then leave that area populated . . . is a joke .
For the safety of the Border Patrol agents involved , those campers need to be moved north of the interstate , ” Pierce said .
But longtime dune lovers say a closure would n’t be fair to the thousands of enthusiasts who flock to the area .
James R. Broxholme , a vendor at the Buttercup Campground who sells flags that say “ Dune Bunny ” and “ Ride Hard or Park It , ” said the best way to improve security is to build strong barriers on the border .
“ The solution is simple .
You create a physical barrier -- a wall or a trench -- and they wo n’t drive over , ” he said of smugglers .
Off - roading groups certainly would oppose any closure plan .
For years they have lobbied to get more of the dunes reopened after closures to protect endangered species .
The Bush administration has favored the expansion of motorized recreation on federal lands in the West , including Yellowstone National Park and the Imperial Sand Dunes .
But its plan to reopen about 40,000 acres at the dunes has been blocked by federal courts .
Bob Mason , president of the American Sand Assn. , said closing the border dunes would be unacceptable , if not unpatriotic .
“ That ’s part of the United States of America , ” he said .
“ To forgo that area would be tantamount to handing it over to the Mexican government . ”
Environmental groups have long criticized the administration for placing commercial interests and recreational uses ahead of conservation and for giving off - roaders extraordinary access .
Now , they say , such access is trumping even national security .
Even some off - road enthusiasts question the current policy .
Many have had brushes with border bandits and smugglers , or have seen pursuits through the dunes .
Lee Dove , an attorney who visits about twice a month , once saw a smuggler flash a weapon and said he sympathized with the Border Patrol ’s mission .
“ If they were really serious about shutting down the traffic , they ’d have to do something , ” Dove said .
“ I do n’t see how you can really enforce the border unless they have a no - drive zone from the border inland . ”
Luis Sanchez , a plumber from Tucson who rides the dunes with his wife and daughters , thinks closing the dunes to improve national security is a reasonable trade - off .
“ There ’s plenty of other places to ride . . . with miles and miles of dunes , ” Sanchez said .

Ralf Herrmann straightens out some of the confusion that has resulted for design professionals regarding Helvetica and Mac OS X 10.5 .
In previous versions of Mac OS X , you could disable or delete the system ’s default Helvetica , and many design pros did so to use a PostScript version instead .
In Leopard , though , Helvetica is a system font , meaning it is n’t easily disabled or removed and must be present for the system to function properly .
I agree with Herrmann that the system ’s default Helvetica is beautiful and suited to any purpose , even high - end printing .

Speaking of Twitter , Prologue looks interesting : it ’s a WordPress theme that serves as a standalone Twitter - like server for a small team .
This sort of idea — more reliable and private — sounds perfect for distributed teams .
Let ’s see if Twitter ’s reliability changes .
Upon further examination , I ’m getting a much stronger vaporware vibe from this .
For something due by September , they ’re awfully short on details .
Their screenshot gallery is entirely comprised of mockups , not actual screenshots or photos from an actual prototype .
( Unless the Nüviphone is going to pack a 1400 × 795 display , which is pretty unlikely . )
When Apple pre-announced the iPhone six months in advance , they had real screenshots and actual prototype hardware .
No word at all on how you type , what OS the device is using , Mac / PC connectivity or synching , or what rendering engine the web browser users .
Whole things smells less - than - half - baked .
Update : Engadget has “ hands - on ” photos , but none with the prototype turned , you know , on .
Garmin also seems to be implicitly encouraging direct comparison to the iPhone and Apple : the hardware is obviously iPhone - esque ; the screenshot mockups are entirely set in Myriad ( the iPhone uses Helvetica , of course , but Myriad is Apple ’s branding font ) ; and even the name , “ Nüvifone ” , contains the substring “ ifone ” .
Even if you do n’t believe it , it ’s interesting in that even a few years ago , you ’d never have seen a prediction like this from Gartner .
And if they ’re right , the math is just spectacular for Apple : it ’s not like Apple is expanding into the low - end budget computer market , so if they do double their share , it ’ll take place entirely in the middle - to - high end of the market .
Update : Nice reminder from The Macalope regarding Gartner ’s Apple - savviness ( where by “ savviness ” , I mean “ jackassyness ” ) : a little over a year ago two of their analysts called on Apple to entirely quit the hardware business and license Mac OS X to Dell .
The best disk utility for the Mac , period — now fully compatible with Leopard .
If you do n’t have DiskWarrior , you should .
Works fine here in Philadelphia .
The latest member of The Deck advertising network : Dan Cederholm ’s SimpleBits .
Coincides with another swell redesign .
Seems like both a good match and a good deal for Amazon .
New release of Red Sweater ’s best - of - breed desktop weblog editor .
Adds top - notch support for tagging , improved live preview , local search for drafts and entries , and much - improved support for saving drafts on the server .
The last one ( drafts on server ) includes a very clever workaround for Movable Type ’s utter inability to handle this properly .
First new phone I ’ve seen since the iPhone that looks interesting .
The UI looks clean , and the hardware looks nice , too .
( Why do so many companies insist upon putting ad - like decals all over the front of their cases ? )
As phones gain GPS features , it makes sense for Garmin to start making phones — the days of dedicated handheld GPS units seem numbered .
Let ’s wait and see what the price is , and how the UI really works , though .
Jason Fried makes similar comments , and notes : Aside from Apple , Garmin is the only company I ’ve seen that understand UI design for small devices .
The Nuvi is dead simple to use .
If they can translate their GPS UI chops into a phone UI , they may be on to something big .
I have a several - year - old Garmin handheld GPS , and I agree : the UI is pretty good .
Drinks Show Your Personality
Before you order a drink in public , you should read this !
Seven New York City bartenders were asked if they could ‘ nail ’ a woman ’s personality based on what she drinks .
Though interviewed separately , they concurred on almost all counts .
THE RESULTS :
PART A : WOMEN AND DRINKS
… WHO THEY ARE !
Drink : Beer
Personality : Causal , low - maintenance ; down to earth .
Your Approach : Challenge her to a game of pool .
Drink : Blender Drinks
Personality : Flaky , whiny , annoying ; a pain in the ass .
Your Approach : Avoid her , unless you want to be her cabana boy .
Drink : Mixed Drinks
Personality : Older , more refined , high maintenance , has very picky taste ; knows EXACTLY what she wants .
Your Approach :
You wo n’t have to approach her .
If she ’s interested , she ’ll send YOU a drink … ……………
Drink :
Wine ( does not include White Zinfandel )
Personality : Conservative and classy ; sophisticated yet giggles .
Your Approach :
Tell her you love to travel and spend quiet evenings with friends .
Drink : White Zinfandel
Personality : Easy ; thinks she is classy and sophisticated , actually , she has NO clue .
Your Approach :
Make her feel smarter than she is … this should be an easy target .
Drink : Shots
Personality : Likes to hang with frat - boy pals and looking to get totally drunk … and naked .
Your Approach : Easiest hit in the joint .
You have been blessed .
Nothing to do but wait , however , be careful not to make her mad !
Drink :
Tequila
No explanations required – everyone just KNOWS what happens there .
PART B : MAN AND DRINKS … WHO THE MEN ARE !
THEN , there is the MALE addendum —
The deal with guys is , as always , very simple and clear cut :
Domestic Beer :
He ’s poor and wants to get laid .
Imported Beer :
He likes good beer and wants to get laid .
The recipe for a successful business meal seems deceptively easy .
“ Let ’s meet for lunch , ” you tell a client or associate .
You get together .
You talk business .
A business lunch is never about lunch , it ’s about business .
The self - made rich do n’t get there by accident .
They were n’t broke up until one day when they went to their mailbox they found that someone had left them a check for a few million dollars .
The self - made rich got rich because of what they know , how they think , what they do and how they do it .
Do you think that if you knew what they know thought like they thought , and did the things that they do , in the same way that they do them , that you too may become rich ?
I think that you would find that indeed you would become rich by following that formula .
But why take them to lunch ( or dinner ) ?
The self - made rich have learned that their time is very valuable .
You may be able to buy some of their consulting time but it wo n’t come cheap .
But even the rich have to eat sometime .
Also , when that rich person is having lunch he is probably more relaxed and open to conversation .
What do you think a self - made rich person likes to talk about ?
You will probably find that his two favorite topics of conversation are himself and the things that he is doing to make money .
The self - made rich get that way by following their passion and learning how to leverage that passion so that it provides them with a large amount of money .
Okay .
Why should you pay for lunch ?
After all , that rich person can afford to pay much more easily than you can .
Read
In order to become rich you have to develop rich thinking .
Expecting a person who has just given you a fortune ’s worth of free information to then pay for his own lunch is definitely poverty thinking .
With an attitude like that you will never become rich .
Rich people know how to give and how to receive , and above all they know how and when to show appreciation and gratitude .
By developing those same qualities in yourself you will open your mind to the style of thinking that will allow you to also become rich .
You may be thinking “ but what if I ca n’t afford to buy lunch ? ”
All the more reason why you need to develop rich thinking or you ’ll continually find that you ca n’t afford to buy lunch .
Poor people tend to have a hand out mentality .
They expect the government and the rich to pay the bills and they always have their hand out for something for nothing .
Something for nothing is 100 % poverty thinking .
The rich understand the law of reciprocity .
That law states that you reap what you sow .
You have to give in order to receive .
Most rich people are getting rich by giving valuable solutions or happiness to a large number of people .
The average person has helped virtually no - one and in fact expects others to help them whenever they need help .
As a result they are broke .
I suggest that you read this article a second time and think about what is being said .
Then , if the message is sinking in , think how you could take a self - made rich person to lunch or dinner and pickup the tab .

It 's a time of reflection on the past eight years and I wanted to share what I have personally learned from Republicans and specifically , The President of the United States , George W. Bush .
These are precious life lessons that I feel I wish to share .
1. Special people , depending , are above the Law , any law .
2 . If you do n't agree with a law that everyone else has to abide by , you can personally opt out .
This one lesson learned makes everything that you could ever wish to do ever so much more easy .
3 . The Bush Family , going back to Pre -WW2 has really made the American system work well for them .
4. Beautiful minds do n't have to think about the dead sons and daughters of average Americans the Bush family put in harms way for whatever reason .
If they hate our freedoms , you can throw as many American sons and daughters at them as you need to !
5 . One Family can be responsible for the deaths of 70,000 US Military personnel over a decade by direct or indirect means and over 1,200,000 lesser human beings on the planet as they count lesser human beings ... and evidently sleep very well .
6 . Poor people are thrilled to live by the thousands in a public building as , they were " underprivileged anyway , so this is working very well for them . "
7 . " Wait a minute .
What did you just say ?
You 're predicting $ 4 - a - gallon gas ? ...
That 's interesting .
I had n't heard that . "
-- George W. Bush , Washington , D.C .
Yep , I 've learned there is a lot you have n't heard about .
8 . " I can press when there needs to be pressed ; I can hold hands when there needs to be -- hold hands . "
-- George W. Bush
So I have learned , like the Apostle Paul , you have refined the art of being all things to all men in all your peace summits and negotiating with others .
9 . " If you 've got somebody in harm 's way , you want the president being -- making advice , not -- be given advice by the military , and not making decisions based upon the latest Gallup poll or focus group . "
-- George W. Bush
From this I have learned that The President really knows how to lead , and is an example to follow forever in the future .
10 . " The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September the 11th . "
-- George W. Bush
I have come to appreciate the painful honesty of our President .
11 . " I 'm honored to be here with the eternal general of the United States , mi amigo Alberto Gonzales . "
-- George W. Bush
I have learned that some things we consider eternal are merely temporary and that 's a good thing .
Thank you !
12 . " There are some similarities , of course ( between Iraq and Vietnam ) .
Death is terrible . "
-- George W. Bush
I 've learned that to discern the deepest and most meaningful lesson from past mistakes is not as easy as one might think .
13 . " I said to her , make sure the rug says ' optimistic person comes to work . ' "
-- George W. Bush
I have learned that , like the voice of God , a good rug can tell you a lot on how to get the job done .
14 . " One of my concerns is that the health care not be as good as it can possibly be . "
-- George W. Bush
Thank you !
From this I learn that out of the abundance of the mouth , the heart speaks just as you would see from your own daily Bible study
15 . " I 'm a strong proponent of the restoration of the wetlands , for a lot of reasons .
There 's a practical reason , though , when it comes to hurricanes :
The stronger the wetlands , the more likely the damage of the hurricane . "
-- George W. Bush
My understanding of good science and how the ecosystem works has been greatly enhanced by this Presidency .
16 . " I got a lot of Ph.D. - types and smart people around me who come into the Oval Office and say , ' Mr. President , here 's what 's on my mind . '
And I listen carefully to their advice .
But having gathered the device , I decide , you know , I say , ' This is what we 're going to do . ' "
-- George W. Bush
From this , I have learned that education is guud and asking " is our children learning ? " should always be a priority .
This President , as both Decider and Commander Guy , listens .
We should all learn from this .
I think it clearly explains why everything is running and going so well , at this time in history , for America .
17 . " I will not withdraw , even if Laura and Barney are the only ones supporting me . "

The Federal Reserve , while slow to see the credit crisis spilling into the broader economy last year , has acted much more decisively in recent weeks .
The Fed has twice cut short - term interest rates sharply , lowering its benchmark rate to 3 percent , reflecting both the central bank ’s anxiety and its determination to try to lift the economy despite serious concerns about the risk of higher inflation .
Ben S. Bernanke , the Fed chairman , is a former professor at Princeton University and a student of Japan ’s policy missteps .
And while a number of experts fault Mr. Bernanke for what they see as the Fed ’s poor communications with both Main Street and Wall Street , the central bank ’s recent moves suggest that he has taken those lessons to heart .
His past comments , however , indicate that Mr. Bernanke thinks that low interest rates alone are not enough to revive an ailing economy .
In a 2003 speech in Tokyo , for example , he offered a prescription for Japan ’s malaise : a more aggressive monetary policy and “ explicit , though temporary , cooperation between the monetary and fiscal authorities ” to stimulate the economy .
Washington understands that message .
Congress  America ’s fiscal authority  moved unexpectedly rapidly to approve a $ 168 billion stimulus plan that includes household tax rebates , temporary tax cuts and incentives for business investment .
“ The United States is moving faster than the Japanese did , ” said Charles Yuji Horioka , a professor of economics at Osaka University .
“ So far , so good .
But American policy makers have to be ready to take further steps as needed . ”
The American economy , many economists predict , will deteriorate further before things turn around .
The government ’s report last week that employment fell in January , the first decline in more than four years , was the latest sign of trouble .
The depth and duration of the downturn , economists say , will largely depend on how much more bad news is coming from banks and other financial institutions .
Nouriel Roubini , an economics professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University , warned that the roughly $ 100 billion in bad loans reported by banks to date could increase nearly tenfold , as the defaults spread beyond the subprime mortgage loans to consumer loans , credit cards and corporate lending .
The Clintons cash in : Wealth and American politics
By Joe Kay
8 April 2008
In tax filings released last week , Democratic Party presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , reported earnings of some $ 109 million in the years 2000 to 2007 .
These figures put the Clintons , who have become something of a political dynasty , among the top .01 percent of taxpayers in the US , according to the Wall Street Journal , or among the 14,500 richest families , according to Britain ’s Sunday Times .
By either calculation , they are firmly entrenched in the wealthiest portion of the population .
The total income translates to about $ 13.6 million a year .
Even after taxes , the Clintons pulled in $ 10 million a year , or about 200 times the median family income in the United States .
The Clinton duo ’s income has risen astronomically over the past eight years and its meteoric rise began immediately after the end of the president ’s term in office in 2001 .
Forbes magazine noted , “ In 2000 , Bill Clinton ’s final year in office , the First Couple ’s income was $ 350,000 ; the next year , it rose to $ 16 million .
Their most lucrative years were 2004 and 2007 , when they twice made $ 20 million . ”
In other words , in 2007 the Clintons made 57 times more than they did in 2000 .
These are remarkable figures .
Particularly significant is the utterly shameless manner in which Bill Clinton has leveraged his status as a former president and “ celebrity ” into a personal fortune .
A bit less than half of the couple ’s income , approximately $ 52 million , came from speeches given by Bill Clinton , primarily to corporations and business groups , generally at the rate of $ 100,000 to $ 450,000 an appearance .
These payments are rendered not so much for the content of the speeches themselves , which are negligible in every respect , but rather as something of a lubricant between the cogwheels of the corporate and political establishments .
The list of companies hosting the former president includes : Wall Street firms Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers ; corporate giants General Motors , IBM and Cisco Systems ; and business trade groups including the National Association of Realtors and the Mortgage Bankers Association .
Many of the companies are major donors to Hillary Clinton ’s current campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination .
In addition to speaking fees , the Clintons earned together about $ 40 million from royalties on their books , and another $ 15 million or so through investments , particularly in one investment fund run by a close Clinton supporter , supermarket magnate Ron Burkle .
With a net worth of $ 3.5 billion , Burkle ranks 307th on a recent Fortune list of the world ’s richest individuals .
For most of the period covered by the filings , Bill Clinton has served as a “ financial advisor ” for Burkle ’s fund , Yucaipa Global Opportunities Fund .
He has used his name and contacts to pull in investors for Burkle — he is a “ rainmaker ” in the lexicon of American business .
Clinton is set to leave the fund soon , to avoid conflict of interest charges if his wife receives the Democratic presidential nod .
A departure agreement is expected to net Clinton an additional $ 20 million .
Burkle is a major Democratic Party contributor and helped organize a $ 1 million fundraiser for Hillary Clinton last March at his Beverly Hills mansion .
He has developed close ties with members of the Democratic establishment in California , including the Speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , among others .
He has also established links with the trade union bureaucracy in the state .
Burkle ’s investment fund , Yucaipa , has come under criticism for some shady investment practices .
In one deal , Bill Clinton was brought on board to persuade the Teamsters union to accept a 15 percent wage cut at Allied Holdings , a transportation services and logistics company , to bring it out of bankruptcy after it was bought up by Yucaipa .
Yucaipa was also invested in a Brazilian company that has been accused of keeping workers in near - slavery conditions .
( See : “ Why the Clintons ’ profiting off near - slavery is not a campaign issue ” )
The Clinton campaign has pointed to the family ’s charitable contributions to distract attention from the enormous family income , but even here there are questions .
The Wall Street Journal editorial page , which of course has its own reasons for criticizing the Clintons , pointed out Monday , “ Intriguingly , nearly all the donations went to the Clinton Family Foundation , which has disbursed only half the money .
The Clintons can thus use the foundation for , er , strategic giving , such as the $ 100,000 it donated last year to a local South Carolina library — the day after Mrs. Clinton debated in that key primary state . ”
The Clinton Family Foundation began disbursing most of its funds only after Hillary Clinton announced her election campaign .
The Journal continues , “ Similar conflict - of - interest questions apply to the separate William Jefferson Clinton Foundation , for which the couple has so far refused to release a list of donors .
Such a list could contain more of the likes of Canadian mining tycoon Frank Giustra , who took Mr. Clinton along on a trip to Kazakhstan as a character reference , won a Kazakh mining concession , and gave more than $ 30 million to the foundation . ”
The Sunday Times , meanwhile , noted , “ In 2006 the couple acquired an interest through a blind trust in a private investment fund based in the Cayman Islands , which is connected to Haim Saban .
He is a billionaire Hollywood mogul and a big fundraiser for Hillary Clinton . ”
Such filthy connections abound .
Wealth in American politics is hardly something new , of course .
Several political dynasties in the 20th century have been associated with vast family fortunes — the Roosevelts , the Kennedys and the Rockefellers , for example .
What is remarkable now is the ubiquity of vast wealth in the political process and the brazen fashion in which politicians of both parties use their access to public office as a means for personal enrichment .
This has become an increasingly prominent aspect of American politics over the past several decades .
Without idealizing any US president in the modern era , trusted defenders of the existing social order to a man , the notion of “ cashing in ” on a term or two in the White House for personal gain was largely unknown until the Reagan - Bush - Clinton era .
According to an anecdote that may or may not be apocryphal , when President Harry Truman was preparing to leave office , he reportedly asked Secretary of State Dean Acheson how he ought to conduct himself after his term was completed .
Acheson , the story goes , responded , “ As the American people would have you conduct yourself . ”
What in an earlier period would have been recognized and characterized as corruption is now the norm , practiced openly and shamelessly .
If not during office , then immediately afterward , politicians feel perfectly free to stick their noses in the trough .
In their personal evolution , the Clintons embody a certain transformations of the Democratic Party itself .
They have become members of a social milieu that the policies of the Democrats helped create — a layer that became hugely wealthy during the 1990s , when inequality in the US soared to extraordinary levels , largely though stock market speculation .
The Clintons are hardly alone in their good fortune .
While the Democratic Party has always represented a section of the ruling class , increasingly its leading figures are themselves fabulously wealthy , either coming directly from the corporate world , marrying into wealth , or leveraging their political ties to big business to open up doors and prepare for careers on corporate boards of directors
The Obamas are not yet at the level of the Clintons , but they have aspirations .
In any case , Barack Obama and his wife are better off now than the Clintons were in 1992 , the year of Bill Clinton ’s first presidential run .
In 2005 and 2006 , the Obamas reported an average income of $ 1.3 million , five times more than they made before Obama was elected to the US Senate .
Election to the presidency would open doors for Obama to national and global corporations that , after a few years , would make this income seem like pocket change .
As the Illinois senator recently told Business Week magazine , “ I believe in entrepreneurship .
I believe in capitalism , and I want to do what works . ”
All three leading contenders for the Democratic nomination in 2008 were millionaires .
John Edwards , the former North Carolina senator and candidate for the Democratic nomination , was estimated in 2003 to be worth anywhere from $ 13 to $ 60 million .
About half of US Senators and nearly a third of US Representatives are millionaires , many of them Democrats .
Naturally , the Republican Party has no shortage of multi-millionaires .
In terms of personal wealth , Clinton trailed only former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney among major presidential candidates .
At the same time , access to personal wealth has become almost a prerequisite for achieving political office .
An individual with a large personal fortune can very easily become a major contender in a presidential race ; however , it is virtually impossible for parties or individuals without access to such funds to even obtain ballot status in the majority of American states .
The wealth of the leading Democrats makes a mockery of their occasional populist rhetoric .
These people do not and cannot stand for the “ little man ” or “ woman . ”
Last week , for example , Clinton met briefly with protesting independent truckers in Pennsylvania demanding that something be done about ruinous diesel fuel prices .
Signs called for “ fair fuel prices . ”
For the New York senator , this made for a useful photo opportunity .
However , Clinton ’s 2008 presidential bid has received almost $ 900,000 in donations from the energy and natural resources sector as a whole , according to OpenSecrets.org , more than Republican Sen.
John McCain of Arizona , and over $ 300,000 from oil and natural gas companies .
Having paid the piper , these corporations call the tune .
The arguments by various left liberal forces , like the Nation magazine , that “ progressives ” should “ exert pressure ” on Clinton and Obama in order to move them to the left are empty and absurd .
These figures in the Democratic Party are millionaire politicians , who have enriched themselves along with the rest of a crass , shortsighted nouveau riche .
They have no intention of hindering in any serious manner the private accumulation of fortunes by their fellow millionaires .
The direct rule by the wealthy exposes the degeneration of what is supposed to be the democratic process in the United States .
Intellectual property protection -- From Groucho Marx to the Internet
Protecting identity of a firm 's products is crucial in today 's fast - moving business climate
By Phil Zinkewicz
“ Your ability to defend yourself in patent , trademark or copyright infringement lawsuits may be the key to your company ’s survival . ”
— Bob Fletcher
IPISC
Louisville , Kentucky “ We have raised brand awareness to new levels .
Amazon.com , for example , has been able to achieve ‘ mindshare ’ on a global scale in a fraction of the time it took Coca - Cola to build its brand . ” — Ken Taylor
Marksmen
Glendale , California
While preparing to film a movie titled A Night In Casablanca , the Marx Brothers received a letter from Warner Bros .
threatening legal action if they did not change the film ’s title .
The studio claimed that the film ’s title was too similar to their own film , Casablanca , released almost five years earlier , with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman .
Groucho , surmising that this letter was probably written by some low - level wannabe in the studio ’s legal department , decided to answer it with his inimitable wit .
A portion of that letter follows .
Dear Warner Brothers ,
Apparently , there is more than one way of conquering a city and holding it as your own .
For example , up to the time that we contemplated making this picture , I had no idea that the city of Casablanca belonged exclusively to Warner Brothers .
However , it was only a few days after our announcement appeared that we received your long , ominous legal document warning us not to use the name Casablanca .
It seems that in 1471 , Ferdinand Balboa Warner , your great - great grandfather , while looking for a shortcut to the city of Burbank , had stumbled onto the shores of Africa and , raising his alpenstock ( which he later turned in for a hundred shares of common ) , named it Casablanca .
I do n’t understand your attitude .
Even if you plan on re-releasing your picture , I am sure that the average movie fan could learn in time to distinguish between Ingrid Bergman and Harpo .
I do n’t know whether I could , but I certainly would like to try .
You claim that you own Casablanca and that no one else can use that name without permission .
What about “ Warner Brothers ” ?
Do you own that too ?
You probably have the right to use the name Warner , but what about the name Brothers ?
Professionally , we were brothers long before you were .
We were touring the sticks as the Marx Brothers when Vitaphone was still a gleam in the inventor ’s eye , and even before there had been other brothers — the Smith Brothers , the Brothers Karamazov , Dan Brothers ( an outfielder with Detroit ) , and “ Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? ”
( This was originally “ Brothers , Can You Spare a Dime ? ” but this was spreading a dime pretty thin , so they threw out one brother , gave all the money to the other one and whittled it down to “ Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? ” )
There ’s much more to the letter , but basically this was Groucho ’s way of saying , “ Take a Walk . ” Warner Bros. responded with another letter , asking that Groucho at least outline the premise of the film .
Groucho wrote back with an utterly ridiculous storyline and , sure enough , received another stern letter requesting clarification .
He obliged and went on to describe a plot even more preposterous than the first , claiming that he , Groucho , would be playing “ Bordello , the sweetheart of Humphrey Bogart . ”
No doubt exasperated , Warner Bros. dropped the whole thing .
A Night in Casablanca was released in 1946 .
That exchange of missives between Groucho and Warner Bros. may seem whimsical for its time , but today the subject of ownership of intellectual property is a very serious one .
With the Internet and the millions of Web sites that it contains and the thousands more being designed , intellectual property has become a valuable asset ; and some insurance companies , seeing this as a burgeoning business , are offering coverages to protect that asset .
There have been court cases involving intellectual property — trademark infringement , patents or copyrights , etc. — where a defendant ’s general liability insurer was forced to assume the insured ’s legal costs , but only if the words “ advertising injury ” were specifically used in the description of coverage .
In most cases , however , general liability policies are worded in such a way as to exclude intellectual property coverages and , in those cases , specific insurance products related to intellectual property perhaps should be obtained .
Intellectual Property Insurance Services Corp. ( IPISC ) , based in Louisville , Kentucky , describes itself as a “ complete intellectual property service firm ” and has more than 10 years ’ experience underwriting intellectual property insurance .
Bob Fletcher of IPISC , says that there are several firms offering some form of intellectual property insurance , including AIG and Chubb .
“ One company may offer coverage only for litigation over Web sites , ” he says .
“ Another may cover all trademark , patent and copyright exposures .
We concentrate on trademark , patent and copyright , but not Web site risks . ”
Continues Fletcher : “ Your ability to defend yourself in patent , trademark or copyright infringement lawsuits may be the key to your company ’s survival .
Every lawsuit charging infringement must be taken very seriously and defended to the utmost , no matter how frivolous the suit may be . ”
IPISC offers two IP insurance products , covering everything from single properties to an insured ’s entire intangible asset portfolio .
One is Infringement Defense Cost Reimbursement Insurance , intended to offset the high costs of defending against an infringement claim .
Defense cost reimbursement reimburses an insured ’s legal costs when the insured asserts patent / trademark / copyright invalidity as a defense to a charge of infringement .
The policy will reimburse the cost of reexamination proceedings initiated by the insured as a defense strategy arising out of a lawsuit for patent / trademark / copyright infringement .
The second policy is called Infringement Enforcement ( Abatement ) Insurance , and it is intended to offset litigation expense when an insured elects to enforce his or her patents , trademarks or copyrights against an alleged wrongdoer .
This policy pays an insured ’s legal costs when his or her intellectual property is challenged by a countersuit for invalidity in an infringement suit .
The policy can be written to cover U.S. and foreign patents , copyrights and trademarks as well as patent or trademark applications including provisional patent applications .
Similar products are offered through the California - based insurance brokerage firm of Cooper & McCloskey , Inc. , as well as other insurance brokers .
But insurance against IP infringement allegations is only one way to go .
Many firms choose to protect themselves against trademark , patent and copyright exposures by hiring their own investigators , either in planning to establish a trademark , patent or copyright or to do an investigation when a dispute occurs .
One investigative firm is the Glendale , California - based Marksmen , self - described as a “ leader in intellectual property investigations , acquisitions and Internet monitoring . ”
“ We specialize in IP investigations and recovery and help companies clear or protect their brands by identifying conflicts , infringement , priority , channels of trade and / or abandonment , ” says Ken Taylor , co-founder , president and CEO of Marksmen .
The company was founded in a one - bedroom apartment in Pasadena , by Taylor , Mark Doerr and Jason Tirado .
It quickly attracted a team of IP experts and became a sort of “ Rockford Files ” detective agency for the Fortune 500 companies or the outside counsel of firms involved in infringement disputes .
“ Protection of one ’s intellectual property is essential in today ’s environment , where communication has become so rapid , ” says Taylor .
“ We have raised brand awareness to new levels .
Amazon.com , for example , has been able to achieve ‘ mindshare ’ on a global scale in a fraction of the time and expense that it took Coca - Cola to build its brand . ”
Taylor says that branding issues , especially on the Internet , must be dealt with quickly .
“ Mega - tags , hidden text , banner ads , deep - linking , framing , hidden browser doors , whacking Web sites are all viable daily concerns .
Identity spoofing , when someone else assumes everything that represents you or your company on the Internet , is already happening . ”
Taylor points to one of Marksmen ’s cases in which a reputable baby diaper manufacturer ’s brand was being used by someone who was actually selling diapers to adults who had a diaper fetish .
“ Prescription drug brands have become a problem , ” says Taylor .
“ The Internet has ads every day offering people prescription drugs with recognizable brand names from Canada cheaper than they can be bought in the U.S.
How many of these offers are reputable ?
How many are not ? ”
Taylor says that when a company decides to hire an investigator for problems related to trademarks , patents and / or copyrights , it should choose a firm that is well versed on the latest developments regarding the Internet .
“ They should be aware of Internet tracking , technology such as geographical trace route , reverse DNS look - up and have access to log analysis tools for Web servers and firewalls , ” he says .
“ They should be up on ICANN decisions , have a working relationship with the many domain name registrars and stay on top of the new gTLD policies that will or will not protect trademark owners .
These are just some of the things that a trained IP investigator should be aware of . ”
In addition to investigations , Marksmen also negotiates the purchase or sale of trademarks and domain names on behalf of companies .
“ We ’re also versed in the latest requirements of each registrar , allowing us to expedite registrations or transfers , thus keeping costs down , ” says Taylor .
But whether a company decides to use insurance or private investigators or a combination of both to protect intellectual property , it is certain that this is a concern that is becoming increasingly important in today ’s hi-tech environment . *
A decade after the release of their last album and 14 years after their debut provided the soundtrack to hundreds of dark and smoky mid-90s nights , Portishead are back with a new record and a string of UK tour dates .
The trip - hop band , who won the Mercury music prize in 1995 for Dummy , played the Manchester Apollo last night to showcase songs from their new album , Third , released on April 28 .
Together with Massive Attack and Tricky , Portishead brought the Bristol music scene into the mainstream by fusing hip - hop with house , dub and electronica .
But the members of Portishead - Beth Gibbons , Geoff Barrow and Adrian Utley - created their own distinct sound by interweaving Gibbons ' world - weary vocals with spy film samples and setting them to hypnotic beats .
Last month
Utley said that while the new album would be a departure from their two studio records , it would not be totally unfamiliar to fans .
" It sounds nothing like Dummy or Portishead , but it 's definitely its older brother or sister , " he told Billboard .
Dave Simpson , a Guardian music critic , said that their return with a dark and sometimes difficult album had come at an odd moment .
" Their influence over current music is a lot less than it was .
This year 's bands are the opposite of what Portishead was about ; slow beats , jazz , fairly depressing and mournful lyrics .
Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse are a million miles away from that , which is what makes Portishead 's return so interesting . "

It is the thinnest TV screen created - about the same width as a coin - and Sony believes it could signal a revival for the faltering manufacturer .
The simple beauty of its slim appearance has wowed the world 's techno - geeks given the evidence of the early reaction to images on gadget websites .
Scroll down for more ...
But it also boasts technological advances which mean the image is far superior to LCD and plasma screens .
The world first Organic Light - Emitting Diode( OLED ) TV has a contrast rating of 1,000,000 to 1 , which produces amazingly sharp images .
This is about ten times sharper than most LCD screens .
The first OLED 's to reach consumers has an 11 - inch screen , which is attached via a hinged arm to a stylish black TV tuner .
However , this is just the beginning for a new generation of ultra - thin TVs that Sony believes will set the standard for the next generation of home entertainment .
The OLED TV - called XEL - 1 - will go on sale in Japan for 200,000 yen ( about £ 850 ) before Christmas .
A roll - out to other nations will come over the next five years .
The XEL - 1 uses new display technology based on organic materials which emit light naturally , once an electric charge is passed through them , rather than being back - lit as in LCD and Plasma screens .
The reduced need to back - light the screen means the sets use up to 40 per cent less energy .
It can also relay video 1,000 times faster than liquid crystal displays , eliminating the blur which is common when watching sport , such as football .
Sony , which has movie and music as well as video - game businesses , fell behind rivals when there was an explosion in demand for flat screen TVs , rather than the old - style cathode ray .
Scroll down for more ...
As a result , it was forced to rely on a manufacturing partnership with rival rival Samsung , of South Korea , to provide Sony branded LCDs .
The company no longer makes plasma display TVs at all , having found it difficult to compete with Japanese rival Matsushita , which makes the Panasonic brand .
Sony President Ryoji Chubachi , in a rare appearance for a product launch , said the new TV answers criticism that Sony had failed to translate its technological prowess into attractive consumer products .
Speaking at the firm 's Tokyo headquarters , he said : " The world 's first OLED TV is a symbol of the rebirth of Sony with its superb technology . "
The new TV was unveiled showing video of skyscraper lights at night , the shimmery fish skin of sushi and sparkling drink being poured into a glass to highlight its vivid imagery .
While the screens are a great advance , OLED TVs wo n't replace LCD TVs until they become available in bigger sizes and cheaper .
One other drawback is that the screens have a limited lifespan .
Scroll down for more ...
The new OLED TV will last 30,000 hours , about 10 years for someone using the TV eight hours a day .
By contrast , an equivalent Sony LCD TV lasts twice that long .
The set is also relatively expensive when set against similar LCD screens .
However , the £ 850 price tag is not so large that it will not be able to capture a large number of buyers .
The set has received a positive reaction .
However , a number of technology experts questioned the fact that the screen is attached to the tuner .
This means it has to be placed on a table , rather than being hung on the wall like a work of art .
However , future versions of the screen will not have this drawback .
Hillary Clinton was in Detroit this week to push for a new primary
The Michigan state Senate adjourned on Thursday without taking up a proposal to hold a new primary on 3 June .
Hillary Clinton was pushing for a re-run as she competes with Barack Obama to become the Democratic Party nominee in the US presidential race .
Michigan and Florida broke party rules by staging early primaries and were stripped of their delegates .
Mrs Clinton narrowly trails Barack Obama in the race to secure delegates who will nominate the Democratic presidential candidate at the party 's convention in August .
Earlier this week , the Democratic Party decided not to stage a re-run of the Florida primary .
Fresh dispute
After the proposal for a Michigan primary re-run was dropped , Mr Obama 's campaign proposed splitting the state 's delegates equally between the two contenders , while Mrs Clinton 's camp was pushing for a postal vote .
Mr Obama has raised concerns about the security of a rapidly organised postal vote .
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATE RACE BARACK OBAMA : 1,620 Total states won : 26
HILLARY CLINTON : 1,499 Total states won : 16
Delegates needed to secure nomination : 2,024

Denver horse - trading ahead Delegate count overview Q&A : Delegates
In Michigan , the state legislature no longer has time to authorise a re-run with the required 60 days notice .
State deputies there had said they were worried that some 100,000 people would have been unable to participate in the re-run , while they also had concerns about logistical and legal difficulties .
State Senate leader Mike Bishop , a Republican , said Democrats remained divided over the re-run and that " without a valid and viable proposal , another primary in Michigan will soon not be an option " .
Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm , a supporter of Mrs Clinton , said she was deeply disappointed that the re-run could no longer be held .
" We will turn our attention to other options , " she said .
" There is no road to the White House that does not go through Michigan . "
Mrs Clinton has been keen to restage the votes in Florida , with its 210 delegates , and Michigan , with 128 , as she seeks to close the gap on Mr Obama .
Democrats in Florida had proposed a re-run using mainly postal votes , but Mr Obama opposed the plan .
The Democratic National Convention said they would only re-stage the vote there with the approval of both candidates .

Extra dimensions in spacetime could trigger blast .
The despite being too small to see , the little brother of conventional black holes such as this may be a source of cosmic explosions .
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
A group of radio astronomers has begun looking for signals from small , exploding black holes .
The search is a long shot , but if it finds anything , it could be the best evidence yet for extra dimensions beyond the paltry four that we live in .
The Universe as we see it is made up of three dimensions of space and one of time , but some theories predict that many more dimensions exist beyond the ones we experience .
In particular , string theory , which suggests that the Universe is composed of tiny , vibrating ' strings ' , suggests that several extra dimensions might exist beyond our own .
To date , observations have failed to turn up these dimensions , and most theorists suspect that if the dimensions do exist , they are ' curled up ' in tiny closed loops around a billionth of a nanometer ( 10 - 18 m ) in size .
Some theorists believe that the Large Hadron Collider , a giant particle accelerator now nearing completion at CERN , Europe 's particle - physics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland , might be able to spot them .
But now John Simonetti and colleagues at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg are investigating another way to look for these dimensions — in the explosions of ' primordial ' black holes .
The team outlines their plan in a paper preprinted at http://arxiv.org1.
Little holes
Forged in the earliest days of the Universe , primordial black holes are microscopic in size , despite having the same mass as a small mountain .
Because of their small size , the holes are all but impossible to spot directly .
Still , some experts believe that they can produce a unique radio signature .
Like all black holes , primordial black holes undergo ' evaporation ' , a process that causes them slowly to lose their mass .
As they shrink , they evaporate more quickly , and theorists predict that their ever - accelerating evaporation might lead to a sudden explosion .
To date , however , astronomers have yet to see signals from such a burst .
In a new twist , Simonetti and colleagues are betting that an extra spatial dimension might trigger a black hole to blow up .
A primordial black hole would initially be bigger than the curled - up extra dimension , Simonetti says .
But as it evaporates , it would get closer and closer to the scale of the dimension .
" Eventually , " he says , " it will find itself in a very peculiar state . "
The black hole will begin to be stretched around the dimension , something like a rubber band .
When it evaporated enough , the hole will suddenly ' snap ' into the tiny dimension , triggering an explosion .
5 - D explosions
The blast would be smaller than those predicted from normal evaporation , but Simonetti believes they still should be detectable as radio waves .
Using an 8 - metre antenna array in North Carolina and a second array under construction in Virginia , his group hopes to look for exploding primordial holes up to about 300 light years away .

The search is a long shot , says Martin Rees , an astronomer at Cambridge University , UK , who made some of the early predictions of primordial black holes .
The existence of the holes is n't assured , nor is the presence of extra dimensions .
Nevertheless ,
Rees says , the survey will have merit : " It 's worth looking for them . "
Roger Blandford , a physicist at Stanford University in California who has also worked extensively on primordial holes , adds that the search will have other merits .
Because it is sensitive to other short - lived sources , it might spot radiowaves from supernovae or colliding neutron stars .
" I would be very supportive of the investigation , independent of the theory , " he says .
" Who knows what we 're going to see , " Simonetti says .
The group hopes to run the search for five years or more .
Subtypes and polymorphism
[ Note :
You are cautioned that this article is in the oops section of my blog , and so you should understand it as a description of a mistake that I have made . ]
For more than a year now my day job has involved work on a large project written entirely in Java .
I warned my employers that I did n't have any professional experience in Java , but they hired me anyway .
So I had to learn Java .
Really learn it , I mean .
I had n't looked at it closely since version 1.2 or so .
Java 1.5 has parametrized types , which they call " generics " .
These looked pretty good to me at first , and a big improvement on the cruddy 1975 - style type system Java had had before .
But then I made a shocking discovery : If General is a subtype of Soldier , then List < General > is not a subtype of List < Soldier > .
In particular , you cannot : List < General > listOfGenerals = ... List < Soldier > listOfSoldiers = listOfGenerals ;
For a couple of weeks I went around muttering to myself about what idiots the Java people must be .
" Geez fuckin ' Louise , " I said .
" The Hindley - Milner languages have had this right for twenty years .
How hard would it have been for those Java idiots to pick up a damn book or something ? "
I was , of course , completely wrong in all respects .
The assignment above leads to problems that are obvious if you think about it a bit , and that should have been obvious to me , and would have been , except that I was so busy exulting in my superiority to the entire Java community that I did n't bother to think about it a bit .
You would like to be able to do this : Soldier someSoldier = ... ; listOfSoldiers.add(someSoldier ) ; But if you do , you are setting up a type failure : General someGeneral = listOfGenerals.getLast( ) ; someGeneral.orderAttack (... ) ;
Here listOfSoldiers and listOfGenerals refer to the same underlying object , so we put a common soldier into that object back on line 4 , and then took it out again on line 5 .
But line 5 is expecting it to be a General , and it is not .
So we either have a type failure right there , or else we have a General variable that holds a a Soldier object , and then on line 6 a mere private is allowed to order an attack , causing a run-time type failure .
If we 're lucky .
The language designers must forbid one of these operations , and the best choice appears to be to forbid the assignment of the List < General > object to the List < Soldier > variable on line 2 .
The other choices seem clearly much worse .
The canonical Java generics tutorial has an example just like this one , to explain precisely this feature of Java generics .
I would have known this , and I would have saved myself two weeks of grumbling , if I had picked up a damn book or something .
Furthermore , my premise was flawed .
The H-M languages ( SML , Haskell , Miranda , etc. ) have not had this right for twenty years .
It is easy to get right in the absence of references .
But once you add references the problem becomes notoriously difficult , and SML , for example , has gone through several different strategies for dealing with it , as the years passed and more was gradually learned about the problem .
The naive approach for SML is simple .
It says that if α is any type , then there is a type ref α , which is the type of a reference that refers to a storage cell that contains a value of type α .
So for example ref int is the type of a reference to an int value .
There are three functions for manipulating reference types : ref : α → ref α ! : ref α → α := : ( ref α * α ) → unit
The ref function takes a value and produces a reference to it , like & in C ; if the original value had type α then the result has type ref α .
The !
function takes a reference of type ref α and dereferences it , returning the value of type α that it refers to , like * in C .
And the := function , usually written infix , takes a reference and a value , stores the value into the place that the reference points to , replacing what was there before , and returns nothing .
So for example : val a = " Kitty cat " ; (* a : string *) val r = ref a ; (* r : ref string *) r := " Puppy dog " ; print !r ;
This prints Puppy dog .
But this next example fails , as you would hope and expect : val a = " Kitty cat " ; val r = ref a ; r := 37 ; ( * fails *) because r has type ref string , but 37 has type int , and := requires that the type of the value on the right match the type referred to by the reference on the left .
That is the obvious , naive approach .
What goes wrong , though ?
The canonical example is : fun id x = x (* id : α → α *) val a = ref id ; (* a : ref ( α → α ) *) fun not true = false | not false = true ; (* not : bool → bool *) a := not ; (!a ) 13
The key here is that a is a variable of type ref ( α → α ) , that is , a reference to a cell that can hold a function whose argument is any type α and whose return value is the same type .
Here it holds a reference to id , which is the identity function .
Then we define a logical negation function , not , which has type bool → bool , that is , it takes a boolean argument and returns a boolean result .
Since this is a subtype of α → α , we can store this function in the cell referenced by a .
Then we dereference a , recovering the value it points to , which , since the assignment , is the not function .
But since a has type ref ( α → α ) , ! a has type α → α , and so should be applicable to any value .
So the application of ! a to the int value 13 passes the type checker , and SML blithely applies the not function to 13 .
I 've already talked about SML way longer than I planned to , and I wo n't belabor you further with explanations of the various schemes that were hatched over the years to try to sort this out .
Suffice it to say that the problem is still an open research area .
Java , of course , is all references from top to bottom , so this issue obtrudes .
The Java people do not know the answer either .
The big error that I made here was to jump to the conclusion that the Java world must be populated with idiots who know nothing about type theory or Haskell or anything else that would have tipped them off to the error I thought they had committed .
Probably most of them know nothing about that stuff , but there are a lot of them , and presumably some of them have a clue , and perhaps some of them even know a thing or two that I do n't .
I said a while back that people who want to become smarter should get in the habit of assuming that everything is more complex than they imagine .
Here I assumed the opposite .
As P.J. Plauger once said in a similar circumstance , there is a name for people who are so stupid that they think everyone else is stupid instead .
Maybe I wo n't be that person next time .

Close to the 20th anniversary of the original release , German gamers can now celebrate in an original manner : they are able to play legally now an unedited version of the Half - Life game made by Valve .
According to Polygon , the game was been removed from the ‘ list of objectionable media ’ enforced in Germany , which is administered by the Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Young Persons .
Half - Life , on the black list
Though it was n’t banned per se , Half - Life has been long placed on this list , together with other titles , such as Doom and Red Faction .
This translates to the fact that the developers could not publicly advertise the games or sell them to anyone who was n’t 18 years of age .
However , people are grateful that the game was taken out of the list because Valve released an unedited version .
Moreover , it ’s free to download in this region .
Up until now , gamers in Germany could buy and play a particularly edited version of this shooter game .
Among the changes , we can see the fact that all humans have been replaced with robots .
As such , they spew oil and not blood , plus when you struck them you get to hear a mechanical clank .
At this point , we do n’t know why the developers decided to give green light to this project after all this time .
Even so , it seems that this move is part of a larger tendency .
Bethesda seems to have enrolled in this trend too , since last year they also released Doom without any edits .
If you remember , last year we could see that the THQ shooter called Red Faction would be a premiere on the German market .
In a similar way to Half - Life , Red Faction was initially placed on the list in 2003 because of its really graphical violence .
A new UC Davis study shows that a common antibacterial chemical added to bath soaps can alter hormonal activity in rats and in human cells in the laboratory — and does so by a previously unreported mechanism .
The findings come as an increasing number of studies – of both lab animals and humans – are revealing that some synthetic chemicals in household products can cause health problems by interfering with normal hormone action .
Called endocrine disruptors , or endocrine disrupting substances ( EDS ) , such chemicals have been linked in animal studies to a variety of problems , including cancer , reproductive failure and developmental anomalies .
This is the first endocrine study to investigate the hormone effects of the antibacterial compound triclocarban ( also known as TCC or 3,4,4 ' - trichlorocarbanilide ) , which is widely used in household and personal care products including bar soaps , body washes , cleansing lotions , wipes and detergents .
Triclocarban - containing products have been marketed broadly in the United States and Europe for more than 45 years ; an estimated 1 million pounds of triclocarban are imported annually for the U.S. market .
The researchers found two key effects :
In human cells in the laboratory , triclocarban increased gene expression that is normally regulated by testosterone .
And when male rats were fed triclocarban , testosterone - dependent organs such as the prostate gland grew abnormally large .
Also , the authors said their discovery that triclocarban increased hormone effects was new .
All previous studies of endocrine disruptors had found that they generally act by blocking or decreasing hormone effects .
“ This finding may eventually lead to an explanation for some rises in some previously described reproductive problems that have been difficult to understand , ” said one author , Bill Lasley , a UC Davis expert on reproductive toxicology and professor emeritus of veterinary medicine .
More analyses of antibacterials and endocrine effects are planned , he said .
Consumers should not take this study as guidance on whether to use triclocarban - containing products , Lasley said .
“ Our mothers taught us to wash our hands well before the advent of antimicrobial soaps , and that practice alone prevents the spread of disease . ”

According to a new survey conducted by the Forward , a disproportionately large share of the Democratic party ’s super - delegates are Jewish .
Many of them have declared their support for Hillary Clinton , accounting for more than 15 % of her current backers .
Like the general population of super - delegates , whose support remains fluid , several Jewish supporters of the New York senator said in interviews that their votes still remain up for grabs .
All told , more than 70 Jewish super - delegates will make the trip to Denver this summer for the Democrats ’ nominating convention .
They account for nearly one - tenth of the party ’s nearly 800 so - called super - delegates , the informal term for elected and party officials whose status as delegates to the convention does not depend on state primaries and caucuses .
If the Democratic presidential primary comes down to a photo finish , these Jewish insiders could play an outsized role in anointing a nominee at the party ’s August convention .
And it would be a history - making experience : Although Jews have long been considered a formidable voting bloc and have been overrepresented among the country ’s cadre of liberal activists and thinkers , they have only more recently become common as Democratic establishment insiders , with unprecedented numbers of both Jewish elected officials and party leaders .
“ Politics in America has become a Jewish profession , just like arts and the law , ” said Ira Forman , executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council and the author of a book about Jews and American politics .
“ We now are overrepresented in all these areas . ”
The relatively high number of Jews among super - delegates highlights a larger political shift that has occurred in recent decades , according to Forman .
Although Jews have always been well represented on the American left , he said , historically they have tended to gravitate toward causes , such as the labor and civil rights movements , rather than active participation in party politics .
In the years since World War II , however , the number of Jewish politicians has grown significantly , with 33 Jewish members elected to Congress in 2006 , up from 13 in 1950 .
In addition , over the past 15 years , the DNC has been led by three Jewish chairs — Americans for Peace Now head Debra DeLee ; Massachusetts - based party activist Steve Grossman , and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell , all now backing Clinton — while the current chairman , former Vermont governor Howard Dean , is married to a Jewish woman and has raised his children as Jews .
Of the DNC ’s nine national officers , three are currently Jewish .
Susan Turnbull , who became a vice chair of the DNC in 2005 , told the Forward that she has begun organizing get - togethers for Jewish DNC members at the party ’s national meetings in recent years , and occasionally communicates via e-mail on issues of mutual concern , as when , several years ago , she was helping to pass a DNC resolution against divestment from Israel .
To compile a list of Jewish super - delegates , the Forward included elected officials and DNC members known by the paper to be Jewish .
Turnbull identified additional Jewish DNC members , and the Forward ’s list was vetted by the Clinton and Obama campaigns .
This list may omit Jewish super - delegates whose religious affiliation is not widely known .
In the current presidential primary , the support of Jewish party insiders is particularly critical for Clinton , who won contests in New York , New Jersey and California and has pledged support from a preponderance of Jewish super - delegates in the Golden State and the Northeast — including nearly a dozen in her home state of New York .
In recent weeks , as Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has won more new super - delegates and snatched away some super - delegates who had previously committed to Clinton , Clinton ’s backers have worked to shore up her existing support and counter the growing perception by many in the party that if Obama maintains his current lead in the popular vote , as well as in total states and delegates won , the super - delegates should fall in line behind him .
The super - delegates “ were not selected by the national party to be either potted plants or rubber stamps , ” wrote Grossman , a top fundraiser for Clinton , in an open letter he sent out earlier this month to DNC members .
The letter urged those who are still uncommitted to suspend making a judgment in the race until all state contests are concluded in early June .
In an interview with the Forward , Grossman argued that if the result from the disputed Florida primary is counted , and Clinton performs strongly in upcoming primaries , the results of primary season would be inconclusive and it would be the responsibility of super - delegates to vote their conscience .
But despite the efforts to ensure their support in recent weeks , several Jewish super - delegates who are currently committed told the Forward that they were open to changing their vote .
“ I ’m on the horns of an emotional dilemma , ” said June Fisher , 76 , a member of the DNC from New Jersey who worked for several Democrats during a long career in politics and currently serves as a part - time special projects coordinator for Senator Bob Menendez .
While Fisher originally endorsed Clinton after her initial choice , Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware , dropped out of the race , she said she was open to revisiting the decision — despite two phone calls from former president Bill Clinton , one in the past two weeks .
Rachel Binah , a longtime Democratic activist from northern California , said she committed to the New York senator after some “ heavy arm - twisting , ” which included phone calls from both Chelsea and Hillary Clinton .
Binah explained her quandary a bit more bluntly .
“ Anybody who had any sense would n’t have declared , and if I were smart , I would n’t have , ” Binah told the Forward .
“ But how can you say no to the former first lady , and potentially the first woman president , who personally talks to you for 20 minutes on the phone ? ”

Work from researchers at IBMs Almaden Research Laboratory suggests that a new type of computer memory storage may be on the horizon .
Currently , computer memory comes in one of two flavors : solid state RAM or magnetic hard disk drives , both of which rely on what 's effectively two - dimensional storage .
The new method adds some useful features to memory storage by extending the physical storage into the third dimension .
Over the past few years , an IBM research team , led by Stuart S. P. Parkin , has been developing a new method for storing information .
Called racetrack memory ( RM ) , it relies on U - shaped nanowires that are arranged perpendicular to the surface of a chip and act as a shift register .
Bits can be read or written at the base of the wire .
Once on the wire , bits can then be moved around as if they 're on a memory stack thanks to nanosecond pulses of current applied to the ends of the U that shift all the bits to new locations on the wire .
A pair of articles from the Almaden group that describe RM appear in this week 's edition of Science , the first describing the technology in depth , and the second reporting the construction of a simplified working device .
The review article1 lays out the basics of racetrack memory .
The smallest unit of RM is a U - shaped nanowire , with data stored in magnetic domain walls ( DWs ) arrayed along its length .
A collection of these nanowires can be built onto a single chip , producing a memory density greater than anything solid state memory can currently handle .
According to the researchers , even a two - dimensional RM setup would have a memory density higher than nearly all current solid state offerings .

DW - based bits are accessed using current pulses that exploit the phenomenon of spin-momentum transfer .
The current shifts the entire set of bits along the wire , exposing a different DW to the reader and / or writer at the base .
The system has some very appealing properties .
The cost of storing a single bit is actually reduced as the number of DWs per racetrack increases .
The average time needed to read a given bit is also independent of the number of DWs per racetrack — essentially , there 's a " the more the merrier " situation when it comes to data density .
Thanks to the fact that there are no moving parts , there is also no obvious fatigue or wearout mechanism for RM .
If RM devices pan out , they could potentially offer the low cost of HDD technology with the performance and reliability of solid - state devices .
Because of these properties , interest in DW devices has fluctuated over the years .
They were first proposed in the 1970s , and there was a flurry of research in the late seventies and early eighties on " magnetic bubble materials . "
That work never panned out due to technological hurdles that could not be overcome at the time .
The accompanying research paper2 suggest those hurdles might be a thing of the past , as it describes the successful creation of a two - dimensional racetrack memory nanowire device .
The device is a single nanowire laid flat on a substrate , with read / write heads in the center of the wire and the current pulse generators that move the bits around on the ends of the wire .
The wire is made of permalloy ( Ni 81 Fe 19 ) , measured 200 nm in diameter , and extended six microns between the electrical contacts at each end .
Sending 1.6V pulses across the wire produced a current density of nearly 2x108 A/cm2 .
The setup functioned as a DW shift register memory device , the equivalent of a three - bit unidirectional serial - in , serial - out memory setup .
The researchers were able to encode a series of information one bit at a time , shifting the memory down and then reading the data back out .
The time needed to encode and shift one bit to was approximately 30ns and the authors suggest that the average access time for RM will be between 10 and 50ns .
This compares reasonably well to the 5ms typical of HDD - based technology , and around 10ns for advanced solid state devices .
The researchers conclude their article by stating , " the motion of a series of DWs at high speed using nanosecond current pulses not only proves the viability of a shift - register memory but also presages the possibility of current - controlled DW–based logic devices . "
There is still work to do before an entire three - dimensional memory chip will replace your current memory solutions .
The biggest problem may be heat ; moving DWs requires a high current , which may destroy the wire or mangle the data it contains .
Still , there are some ideas on how to deal with the heat , and this work represents a big step in the direction of a new dimension in memory storage .

Following a huge increase in complaints from the music , movie and software industries , the four major Japanese ISP organizations have agreed that they will work with copyright holders to track down copyright infringing file - sharers and disconnect them from the internet .
In 2006 , a Japanese ISP decided to plan measures to stop their subscribers using file - sharing software , by tracking their activities and disconnecting them from the Internet .
The plan did n’t come to fruition as the government stepped in and said that such monitoring might have privacy implications .
Now , under huge pressure from the movie , music and software industries , the four major ISP organizations in Japan are at it again , and have agreed to take drastic action against online pirates .
According to the report in Yomiuri Shimbun , the agreement would see copyright holders tracking down file - sharers on the Internet using “ special detection software ” and then notifying ISPs of alleged infringers .
ISPs would first send out emailed warnings to those traced , then interrupt the Internet connection if action to cease the activity is n’t taken .
For persistent breaches , the ISP would ultimately terminate the accounts of its subscribers .
These four major ISP organizations – which include Telecom Service Association and the Telecommunications Carriers Association – are made up of around 1,000 other ISPs , a large portion of the Japanese market .
In collaboration with the copyright holders , the ISPs will set up a panel in April to decide exactly how the system should operate .
Right now , there is a lot discussion surrounding the suggestion that persistent file - sharers could be banned from the internet .
So far there have been proposals in France , the UK and Australia .
During December last year we reported that the number of internet users file - sharing in Japan had increased by a 180 % in a single year .

Paul Joseph Watson , writing for prisonplanet.com , wrote on country icon Willy Nelson ’s interview with Alex Jones on his radio program .
Willie had some EXPLOSIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT 9/11 , and also about fears that “ something ” will happen that will enable Bush to stay in office for another 10 years .
Below is an excerpt : |
Agreeing with host Alex Jones that he questioned the official story , Nelson elaborated , " I saw those towers fall and I 've seen an implosion in Las Vegas - there 's too much similarities between the two , and I saw a building fall that did n't get hit by nothing , " added Nelson , referring to WTC Building 7 which collapsed in the late afternoon of September 11 .
" How naive are we - what do they think we 'll go for ? , " asked Nelson , pointing out that his doubts began on the very day of 9/11 .
" I saw one fall and it was just so symmetrical , I said wait a minute I just saw that last week at the casino in Las Vegas and you see these implosions all the time and the next one fell and I said hell there 's another one - and they 're trying to tell me that an airplane did it and I can't go along with that , " said Nelson .
Read the entire article at :
He also feared another false flag attack in America .
“ A crisis could come just before the elections and we could have George in office for another ten years , ” Willie added .
Willie went on to say he believes that an elite are causing wars for their own economic purposes that are subverting democracy , and that elections are being rigged .
He also feared another false flag attack in America .
“ A crisis could come just before the elections and we could have George in office for another ten years , ” Willie added .
So , the growing army of Americans who now know we ’ve been lied to about 9/11 , continues to expand .
How do we get the rest of America looking at the events of 9/11 , and thinking about the election fraud , and oil wars we ’re being manipulated with ?
There is a new movie out that everyone needs to get to theatres in their towns called “ Reflecting Pool . ”
You can view and share widely a trailer for this film at the below link .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2wqSf2AU9g
There is also a new action novel by a New York Times best selling author , Steve Alten , called “ The Shell Game . ”
This explosive novel is an edu-tainment action thriller that is woven with real media and also real 9/11 truth research quotes including David Ray Griffin ( The New Pearl Harbor , etc. ) and Michael Ruppert ( Crossing the Rubicon ) .
You can view a trailer of this explosive novel , that not only promotes the novel , but is educational in a cautionary tale of a possible “ event ” such as the type Willie Nelson fears which could enable a neo - con attack on Iran in yet another oil grab .
If each of us dedicates ourselves to posting this 9/11 Trailer , emailing it to everyone , blogging it , etc. etc. , getting it out in everyway possible , we can drive this important book to # 1 .
WHY SHOULD WE ?
In this interview he said we need to investigate whether “ 9/11 was an inside job , ” “ Cheney ordered an Air Force stand down , and the war games that confused the FAA and DOD , ” and that the “ 9/11 truth movement activists are heroes America should support . ”
Alten then referred listeners to
Steve Alten , the author of “ The Shell Game ” was recently on a mainstream talk AM radio program in the Philadelphia metro .
In this interview he said we need to investigate whether “ 9/11 was an inside job , ” “ Cheney ordered an Air Force stand down , and the war games that confused the FAA and DOD , ” and that the “ 9/11 truth movement activists are heroes America should support .
” Alten then referred listeners to www.TheShellGame.net for more information where they find links to most major 9/11 truth activist and research sites .
If we who hunger for 9/11 truth do all we can to spread the word on “ The Shell Game ” we can keep Alten on the airwaves across the nation saying these things , and telling Americans to support 9/11 truth activists .
What ’s Your Secret ?
Where Are They Hiding The Truth ?
I ’m not sure how I became like this .
And I ’m not alone .
Like you , I do n’t have all the answers .
I ’m so full of questions .
And when I ’m honest with myself , my questions burst forth , and haunt me .
And one question comes back , again and again , in many forms .
“ What ’s being hidden from me ? ”
“ What ’s really going on ? ”
We each carry our own secrets .
There are secrets that we hide from others , or even from ourselves .
But there are much larger secrets .
Do you ever feel , in your quiet moments , that our picture of the world , our understanding of it , and maybe even the way that we feel about it , is distorted , even two - dimensional ?
It ’s as though we ’ve been hypnotized to believe in , and accept a flat , colorless view of a richer , deeper reality .
We know that something is missing , but we do n’t know what that is .
And sometimes , even our questions are missing .
It seems as though we ’ve all agreed to stop asking about the aspects of living that do n’t make sense .
I ’m not claiming that there ’s some age - old conspiracy to keep us in the dark , and leave the world in the control of the few who know the truth .
But the truth is often uncomfortable , and we ’re frustrated by the difficult challenges that life presents us , challenges that we often have no idea how to face .
How many of us let our hearts focus on the daily suffering and death in places like Darfur ?
Do we let ourselves really think about the emotional and physical suffering that happens all around us due to crime , violence , or prejudice ?
The media , far too often , use that suffering for its shock value , for a sort of perverse entertainment which drives us to read , listen to , or view the story , and somehow support that publication , channel , or website .
It ’s rare to be presented with a story of suffering that asks us to think about and explore the many complex sides of an issue .
It ’s even more rare to be prompted to take thoughtful action , instead of being encouraged to find someone to criticize and blame , and be foolishly satisfied with the criticism alone .
It ’s perfectly natural to hide from suffering when we feel helpless to do anything about the problems that give rise to that suffering .
Confirming All Your Suspicions
Whenever some nasty secret is revealed about politicians , or the rich and famous , we all say “ Ah . I know that her life could n’t be as perfect as it seemed . ”
In Why Do You Hate Selling , we introduced Blair Warren ’s one sentence persuasion :
People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams , justify their failures , allay their fears , confirm their suspicions and help them throw rocks at their enemies .
There are five principles expressed in that sentence .
In other posts we ’ve discussed the first 3 principles in detail .
Here we ’re talking about confirming people ’s suspicions .
We ’re filled with questions , whether we acknowledge them consciously , or not .
We know that we ’re not getting the whole truth from others .
Hey , we know that we have our own secrets that we hide from others , and sometimes even from ourselves .
So , we ’re drawn to secrets like an irresistably sweet dessert .
And when someone offers us secrets which will solve our problems , relieve our own personal pain , and go after our dreams , we ca n’t help but listen .
We want to hear the secrets that others know and use to acquire wealth , love , and success — with the spoken or unspoken promise that these secrets will do the same for us .
Knowledge , Action , and Discovery
Knowledge alone is powerful .
Sometimes , a few key ideas are enough to start us along the path of health , achievement , success , or love .
But all of the secrets in the world can only help us get started .
We live in an instant gratification culture , and we all suffer from that mindset , to some degree .
We ’re waiting for secrets that will get us what we want without doing anything .
We expect results to appear without us first facing ourselves , and the everyday challenges that the world drops on us .
We want secrets and solutions that are like winning the lottery , perfection without effort .
Real challenges , and everyday life , require solutions that do n’t happen in a moment .
These solutions demand sustained effort .
You can buy products or courses that promise you the world ’s hidden secrets .
Many of them offer us useful , even potentially life - changing information .
I ’ve bought more than a few , myself .
But these secrets are nearly useless to us , without the actions we take to bring ideas to life , and face and transform our challenging world .
Someone who holds the world ’s secrets , but finds endless reasons why it ’s not yet time to take action , will accomplish little .
Someone who is determined and experienced at taking action , will make magic out of simple ideas , and go on to discover her own secrets .
It is a couch potato ’s dream – just imagining yourself exercising can increase the strength of even your large muscles .
The discovery could help patients too weak to exercise to start recuperating from stroke or other injury .
And if the technique works in older people , they might use it to help maintain their strength .
Muscles move in response to impulses from nearby motor neurons .
The firing of those neurons in turn depends on the strength of electrical impulses sent by the brain .
“ That suggests you can increase muscle strength solely by sending a larger signal to motor neurons from the brain , ” says Guang Yue , an exercise physiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio .
Yue and his colleagues have already found that mentally visualising exercise was enough to increase strength in a muscle in the little finger , which it uses to move sideways .
Now his team has turned its attention to a larger , more frequently used muscle , the bicep .

Thought experiment
They asked 10 volunteers aged 20 to 35 to imagine flexing one of their biceps as hard as possible in training sessions five times a week .
The researchers recorded the electrical brain activity during the sessions .
To ensure the volunteers were not unintentionally tensing , they also monitored electrical impulses at the motor neurons of their arm muscles .
Every two weeks , they measured the strength of the volunteers ’ muscles .
The volunteers who thought about exercise showed a 13.5 per cent increase in strength after a few weeks , and maintained that gain for three months after the training stopped .
Controls who missed out on the mental workout showed no improvement in strength .
The researchers are now repeating the experiment with people aged 65 to 80 to see if mental gymnastics also works for them .
The research was presented at the Society for Neuroscience conference in San Diego .
2月23日にバンダイが発売する「電脳超合金 タチコマ」は、「攻殻機動隊」シリーズの世界観を生かし、電脳化（PC連携）という新機軸を打ち出した超合金だ。と同時に、人気の高いタチコマを忠実に再現したリアル志向のフィギュアでもある。2月23日の発売を前に“ほぼ製品版”を借りることができたのでチェックしてみよう。
超合金といえば、1974年にポピー（現在はバンダイのボーイズトイ事業部に吸収）が「マジンガーZ」の玩具として発売したダイカスト製フィギュアが始まり。もちろんモチーフは劇中に登場する「超合金Z」で、作品の世界観をうまく生かした点は、今回のタチコマにも通じるところがあるだろう。
そんな豆知識はともかく、まず昨年の「全日本模型・ホビーショー」ではあまりチェックできなかった超合金本体から見ていこう。
タチコマは1/24スケールモデルで、全高9.5センチほどの手のりサイズ。搭乗ポッドのスリットなど各所のデザインから「攻殻機動隊
S.A.C 2nd GIG 」仕様であることが分かる。全体の60％が金属製ということもあり、その質感は非常に高い。
4本の脚と2本の腕は複数の関節機構を持ち、“ぐりぐり”と柔軟に動かすことができる。50mmグレネードランチャー（口の部分）も根本がボールジョイントのため、方向を変えることが可能だ。欲を言えば、両腕がもう少し上に上がるとかわいく挨拶できるのだが。
さらに細かいところでは、両腕のマニピュレーターや脚の先、左右のアイセンサー、液体ワイヤー射出装置なども可動箇所である。最近の超合金が精巧に出来ているのは承知していたが、子どもの頃に遊んだ「マジンガーZ」や「レッドバロン」との違いに時代を感じてしまう。
しかもタチコマは、設定に忠実に出来ている。例えば前述の50mmグレネードランチャー。普段は砲口がカバーと固定器具で封印されていており、人の手でこれを外さなければ使用できない設定なのだが、電脳超合金はこれも再現した。写真のように固定用のピンを横に抜き、砲口カバーを外すとグレネードランチャーの砲身が現れる。しかもカバーやピンまで金属製だ。

THE most telling indicator of the prospects of Silicon Valley 's technology firms is now clear .
It is the cooks .
The insightful few on Wall Street who understood this in 1999 are now rich .
That year , Google , which had just 40 employees at the time , held a cook - off to anoint its “ chief food officer ” .
Charlie Ayers , who had once fed the Grateful Dead , won .
Over the next six years , he led Google , which was also dabbling in web searches and online advertising , to dominance in its core competency : ample , free , organic and exotic food .
Mr Ayers eventually left to write a book , “ Food 2.0 ” .
But his replacements kept serving burgers made from grass - fed beef , clams sautéed with discs of handmade Chinese sausage , crispy tofu slaw and shots of emerald - green wheat grass .
Being not only Californian but Googley , which is to say world - saving , the firm claims to source the overwhelming majority of its ingredients from local farmers .
Genetically modified food , needless to say , is out the question .
Despite this nourishing regime , Google has recently experienced a few setbacks .
At a virile 23 , the founder of Facebook , Mark Zuckerberg , makes Google 's co-founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , both in their thirties , look almost decrepit .
The young and hip social network has trounced Google twice on the ultimate - frisbee pitch .
Google 's archenemy , Microsoft , has invested in Facebook , and Google 's executives have started defecting to it .
But by all measures gastronomic , Google was still the dominant firm — until now .
One of Google 's current chefs is Josef Desimone , who is admired chiefly for the kombucha tea that he ferments from scratch and that gets the employees ' creative juices flowing .
Now however , Mr Desimone is smelling the coffee .
He has given notice to Google , and will soon start work at Facebook .
On Wall Street , no doubt , the short sellers have taken note .
Finnish MPs will consider granting working adults annual " love leave " and introducing lessons to teach schoolchildren how to " be human " , in an effort to improve the nation 's emotional quality of life .
The Social Democrat MP Tommy Tabermann has submitted both ideas as formal proposals to parliament in the wake of a school shooting last year in which nine students , including the gunman , died .
He hopes to reduce the number of divorces and the high incidence of depression and to stop bullying in schools and at work .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Next week we are making history talking about love in the parliament , " Mr Tabermann added .
He said research had shown that Finns wanted more time with loved ones rather than higher wages .
" It is not humbug .
It is not a sex leave , but in a much wider sense gives people a chance to maintain their relationships , " he said .
The week - long " relationship leave " would be given to all employees each year , enabling Finns to spend time with loved ones , see relatives and visit the sick .
Mr Tabermann said his proposal for teaching children how to " be human " at school stemmed from a bullying problem and that a quarter of pupils suffered from depression .
Earthling , we do not understand why you do not shower with your mate more often .
H20 is a precious commodity .
Nothing can survive without it .
Some places on Earth do not have much water ; while some Earthlings take large baths , living it large .
Wasting water is foolish .
Please do not let us catch you doing this at night or we will abduct you .
If you must take shower , please arrange to do it with your mate .
You will kill two birds with one stone :
Save water and have sex .
The only danger to this idea is that must restrain yourself from taking too many showers just so that you have sex in water .
If you do not have a mate then please do not have sex with yourself because that wastes more water .
Make sure you take the shower quickly and efficiently .
No rubber duckies for play either .
Earthling , you could also make this as part of your green date by turning off the lights during your shower experience ( see UFO Recession Tip # 50 : Turn Off Light and Have Fun ) .
We have given you some great free ideas here without expectation of being paid as an energy auditor or sex therapist .
Save water , have sex , be romantic , and you will be green like us .
An exaggeratedly titled top ten list ?
On the Internet ?
Surely you jest !
[ This month , Destructoid turns 7 years old !
Here 's the top article of this weekend back in 2008 .
You can browse more of these in our Golden Archives .
Nostalgic yet ?
- Niero ]
Call me a weakling , but it 's been more or less forever since I last satiated my base , pathetic , utterly human desire to organize my favorite pastime into an authoritative - sounding and undoubtedly inaccurate countdown list .
This time around , I 'm looking at videogame quotes : well - written or not , intentionally enlightening or not , what are the ten most meaningful videogame quotes in gaming memory ?
Which quotes actually teach or represent something important about game design , or even life in general ?
Defining meaning is obviously a subjective exercise -- which is just another way of saying " you 're going to disagree with me " -- but you may still find the list quasi-interesting .
Hit the jump and gain total enlightenment , but be warned as there is a massive BioShock spoiler within .
10 . " John Romero 's about to make you his bitch "
Hubris .
It invariably arises manifests in the top personalities of any profession , and the games industry is certainly no exception .
Prior to the release of John Romero 's Daikatana , the long - haired developer -- still riding high from his Doom and Quake successes -- released a rather striking , minimalist , full - page ad in multiple gaming magazines .
It read : " John Romero 's about to make you his bitch . "
And nothing else .
Well , nothing else other than Ion Storm 's logo and an equally pompous urging that gamers " suck it down . "
From there , everyone knows the story : Daikatana was delayed , then sucked complete balls upon release , and Romero faded into relative gaming obscurity .
His fall , and the arrogant advertisement which started it all , nicely epitomize developer douchebaggery moreso than any other single sentence in the English language .
Whether we 're talking about Derek Smart touting Battlecruiser 3000 AD as " the last thing you 'll ever desire , " or George Broussard 's hilariously silly and underwhelming " trailer " for Duke Nukem Forever , or Julian Eggbrecht 's suggestion that those reviewers who hated Lair actually were n't playing it correctly , big egos , big gaming budgets , and big failures often go hand in hand .
9 . " You are in a maze of twisty passages , all alike . "
Simultaneously immersive and frustrating , beautifully worded but logically irritating , this one line epitomizes both the strengths and flaws of the classic text adventure .
" You are in a maze of twisty passages , all alike " is -- if you 'll permit me to be absurdly nerdy for a moment -- a very well - constructed sentence .
It is a statement of mystery and ultimate possibility .
It 's brief , yet descriptive enough that your mind can fill in all the blanks : the details of what the maze looks to are ultimately up to you , but you 're given enough information about the current location to make an informed gameplay decision .
Sort of .
Because , when you really get right down to it , " a maze of twisty passages , all alike " is a horrendously confusing thing to read when you 're trying to make your way out of a maze .
How many passages ?
Alike how ?
What the hell am I supposed to do ?
It is this mixture of attraction to the language , yet utter confusion in conquering it , that makes me give up every text adventure I can find after ten minutes of play .
8 . " You were almost a Jill sandwich ! "
Gamers are no strangers to horrible , horrible dialogue ; whether we 're getting haphazardly - translated Engrish from our friends in the Orient or simply suffering from lazy writers , awful dialogue and videogames tragically tend to go hand in hand .
I find it hard to pick just one example of horrendous writing to stand for literal decades ' worth , but , if only because I 'm loathe to give " All Your Base " any position on any top ten list , Barry Burton 's famous line from the original Resident Evil will do .
If you ever wonder why so many gamers have a hard time taking interactive storytelling seriously , " you were almost a Jill sandwich " is the reason why .
Far more irritating than those games which simply elect to have no story whatsoever are those which try to be entertaining , terrifying , or cleve but fail miserably in the attempt -- namely , games like the Resident Evil series .
Ben Croshaw partially covered this in a recent video , but consider the ridiculousness of a survival horror game which , despite containing insanely supenseful gameplay , has one of the most laughably convoluted and poorly written plots in gaming history ?
Where , after almost being squished to death , a character responds not with a relatable statement of surprise like " JESUS CHRIST ARE YOU OKAY WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE , " but by making a snarky joke about sandwiches ?
The adorably bad writing found in so many , many , many videogames serve as a constant reminder to better , more story - conscious game developers : this is what you need to be better than We 'll never be truly rid of horrendous dialogue and plot -- every storytelling medium has its share of lazy creators -- but it 's nice to have cringe - inducing lines like " Jill sandwich " to remind us that games could , and should , be much more than just decently entertaining gameplay wrapped around an irrelevant or stupid story .
7 . " That 's the second biggest monkey head I 've ever seen ! "
This is the single best quote in all of ( non text - based ) adventure gaming .
Period .
Spoken by Guybrush Threepwood upon seeing an absurdly large monkey head idol ( which , over the course of the series , he tends to do more than a few times ) , it epitomizes the brilliant writing found in some of the best games of the adventure genre 's heyday .
Leisure Suit Larry dealt with sex jokes , Sam and Max dabbled in anthropomorphic absurdity , and the Monkey Island series , with its insult swordfighting and fiendishly difficult puzzles , nimbly jumped back and forth between the high - and lowbrow .
In many of the most popular franchises during the late 80's and early 90's , adventure fans experienced a quality of humorous or dramatic writing which , to my mind , has rarely been matched in the years since .
When the player was n't scratching their head over how to get past one of any number of frustratingly difficult puzzles , they were rewarded with some of the sharpest , most clever writing in the history of videogame storytelling .
From a writing point of view , everything the Monkey Island series is -- and everything the best adventure games were -- can be found in this quote .
6 . “ Did n’t we have some fun though ?
Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said ‘ Goodbye ’ and you were like ‘ NO WAY !’ and then I was all ‘ We pretended we were going to murder you ’ ?
That was great . "
Remember how I was talking about adventure game writing of the late 80's and early 90's ?
Remember when I said that the level of hilarity achieved in those seemingly simplstic games had rarely been matched since ?
Portal is why I used the word " rarely . "
Portal fever swept the Internet literally overnight after its release .
Less than 12 hours after the Orange Box hit Steam , you could find gamers singing the praises of the Weighted Companion Cube , showing appreciation for the snarky - yet - scary characterization of GLadDOS , and chanting " the cake is a lie " as if it were scripture .
Apart from containing a technologically astounding gameplay mechanic , Portal helped remind gaming cynics like me that games can not only be fun , innovative , and challenging in today 's world of endless sequels and ripoffs , but friggin ' hilarious as well .
GLadDOS constantly drops darkly humorous hints considering the character 's past and future .
The player is forced to care for a cubic hunk of metal as if it were the love of his life .
The final showdown with the evil AI constantly jumps back and forth between the suspenseful ( as you attempt to defeat her before she floods the room with poison gas ) and the hysterical ( as one of her personality spheres recites a recipe for cake ) .
If we 're lucky , future game writers might take a few cues from Erik Wolpaw and learn that where humor is concerned , we gamers are much more likely to latch onto dark , witty irony than idiotic machismo .
Portal 's writing does n't quite match the level of a Monkey Island or a Sam and Max , but it gets close enough in a time of awful one - liners and obvious jokes that it is , in its own way , slightly more uplifting and meaningful .
5 . " Hey dudes , thanks for rescuing me !
Let 's go for a burger ... Ha !
Ha! Ha ! "
Ah , the mid - to - late 80's .
A time of relative innocence for the videogame .
Before the time of Mortal Kombat or Hot Coffee , when arcade games still came equipped with " Winners Don't Do Drugs " disclaimers , absurd fun was the name of the game .
Anyone over the age of twelve can nostalgically remember a time when videogames , despite being considered an exclusively " nerd " pastime , had a happy - go - lucky quality to them .
You could inextricably describe a game 's plot and story in a single sentence ( " you 're a chef and you have to make hamburgers by running over the different ingredients and avoiding bad guys " ) .
This was the time of the arcade ; the time where you had to actually go outside if you wanted to play something new and awesome .
The quote which defines this era will differ for each gamer according to which game he or she played most frequently .
For my money , though , the final lines of Bad Dudes will never be matched , in grandeur or hilarious tone , by any other game from the period .
Or ever .
4. " Prepare for unforeseen consequences . "
Half Life : Episode
Two taught me that videogames can be better than movies .
They can elicit a greater emotional response , and , given their extended running times , the player can get more of a chance to become attached to his or her NPC co-stars .
Originally spoken to Eli Vance just moments before first entering the test chamber at Black Mesa , the G - Man 's mysterious message to a then - unconscious Alyx Vance actually gave me the goddamned chills .
As the shady , sallow asshole with the weird vocal rhythm leaned down to manipulate a character who I had come to admire and feel empathy for , I almost yelled at the screen .
I wanted the G - Man to stay the f*ck away from Alyx .
Not because it would affect the gameplay in any way .
Not because I was worried about what it meant for the plot .
Not for any number of legitimate reasons , other than the fact that I simply cared about Alyx .
I knew what the G - Man represented , and I wanted him to stay the hell away from my friend .
Upon hearing the G - Man whisper those words to Alyx , I suddenly understood that I had been wholeheartedly enveloped by Half - Life : Episode Two 's story and characters .
I 'm sure most gamers did n't get the exact same reaction out of this scene that I did -- to the best of my knowledge , I may be the only person alive who considered Episode Two the single best part of the Orange Box -- but no one who has spent several hours with Dog , Alyx , Barney and Kleiner can deny their personal , emotional attachment to those characters .
Additionally , this quote speaks volumes concerning one of the Half - Life saga 's main themes -- namely , the constantly chaotic , unpredictable , seemingly contradictory nature of life .
Everything the player does after first exiting the tram in the first Half - Life ends up having terrifingly far - reaching and unforeseen consequences .
Gordon fights through Xen and destroys the Nihilianth , only to find that his initial actions in the test chamber may have summoned an even greater evil .
Later , while under the thumb of the G - Man , Gordon kills Wallace Breen and seemingly harms the Combine -- and is suddenly robbed of his victory by being put into stasis once again .
In Episode Two , Gordon is finally free from the G - Man 's control and heads to White Forest ... only to find that the G - Man actually wants him to go there .
Is Gordon free , or a slave ?
Is the G - Man good or evil ?
No game series has ever had me so interested in the answers to the questions it posed .
3. " War . War never changes . "
Even after most of the world has been turned into nuclear ash , even after the world governments have crumbled and the social infrastructure decays into anarchy , even when , after the greatest and most horrible war of all , the human race has every reason to band together in an effort to save one another from total annihilation -- they do n't .
War never changes .
Fallout may be one of the most cynical , nihilistic game franchises in existence , which also makes it one of my personal favorites .
Rather than half - assedly cultivating a world - weary tone through a sepia color scheme and needlessly gruff - sounding protagonists ( I 'm looking at you , Gears of War ) , the Fallout series tells the tale of some people who try to act with common decency in a world utterly lacking in it , and who are subsequently tortured and killed and exiled for their troubles .
Cormac McCarthy would be proud .
In the world of Fallout you can do varying amounts of good on your quest through the Wastelands but , more often than not , your efforts can be just as easily undone by bad luck or the corruption of others .
You can save the Ghouls of Necropolis from starvation , only to hear of their slaughter at the hands of Super Mutants .
You can help the Brotherhood of Steel find new technology , but they 'll use it to further their war - driven , quasi - fascist agenda .
And no matter how much good you do in the original Fallout -- no matter how quickly you save the denizens of Vault 13 from dehydration and destroy the Super Mutant base -- you will always be cast out by a hypocritical , bureaucratic Vault Overseer who claims that your heroism will make you a bad role model for the other Vault Dwellers .
Without getting into a current sociopolitical discussion , let me just say that the themes suggested in Fallout ( punishment of morality in an immoral world , the hypocrisy of authority , the petty and violent nature of humankind ) can be seen quite clearly even today .
Wars are driven by greed , necessity , stupidity , or fear -- and even after the cities have been burnt to cinders and the countryside irradiated , war will never change .
2. " ... But our princess is in another castle ! "
Videogames , according to Warren Spector , are work .
We enjoy playing them , yes , but they also take a great deal of effort and frustration to actually complete .
Before getting our ultimate reward , whatever it may be ( a cool ending , a beautiful cut scene , a clever bonus level ) , we actually have to work to reach it .
This quote , repeated lord knows how many times throughout the original Super Mario Bros , represents this fun / work dichotomy better than any other I can think of .
When working their way through a Bowser level in Super Mario Bros , a gamer 's thought process goes something like this :
" Crap crap crap crap crap JUMP wait wait wait JUMP run run crap crap crap run CRAP DODGE THE FIREBALL crap crap crap haha take that you stupid Koopa King woo this is awesome I get to meet the Princess HEY WHAT THE HELL . "
Perhaps it was my feeble , insipid , six - year - old mind getting ahead of itself , but I fully expected the Princess to be waiting for me at the end of every goddamned castle .
Sure , she was n't in the last one , but hey -- life is full of infinite possibilities , and a game this fun would n't dream of continually frustrating me over and over by dangling the carrot of possible victory in front of my nose , only to yank it away once I 've seemingly reached my goal , right ?
Right ?
Wrong .
It was fun getting to the not -Princess every time , do n't get me wrong , but after continually not - finding her over seven worlds of gameplay , the Nintendo Entertainment System began to feel a little bit like work .
The kind of work I 'd be absolutely ecstatic to go to everyday , granted , but work nonetheless .
1 . " Would you kindly ? "
Not only is this a moving , shocking , and all - around incredible quote about the consequences of blindly accepting authority , but it also represents one of the single most insightful statements ever made about videogaming in general .
Cut scenes are a form of gameplay slavery .
They rob the player of control , take him out of the moment , and force him to passively witness as the events of the game -- the events he is supposed to have some degree of local agency over .
Ken Levine knows this , and chose to exploit it in creating one of the most memorable story twists of all time .
When the player finds out that he has been subliminally controlled by Atlas throughout the entire game , he or she experiences a very sudden , shocking reassessment of values .
Having gone through the game thus far with the single - minded intent of beating Andrew Ryan to a bloody pulp , the player is suddenly forced to ask a question most other games would never dream of proposing to the player : " Why am I doing this ? "
Why , upon first entering Rapture , do you inject a Plasmid into his veins for seemingly no reason ?
Why do you follow Atlas 's every instruction ?
Why do you kill the innocent , nonviolent - unless - provoked Big Daddies ?
Why do you want to kill Ryan ?
The answer is depressingly simple : you did these things because you were told to .
Not because you necessarily had any personal investment in the action , but because someone asked you nicely .
Even after realizing this , the player remains completely powerless to stop himself .
In an older article I wrote ( " Exploring BioShock 's storytelling flaws " ) , I had this to say about the final " would you kindly " cut scene :
Noninteractivity is used brilliantly within the context of the scene : for perhaps the first time in the entire game , the player does n’t want to kill Andrew Ryan , but Jack ’s violent nature and refusal to question his orders are too much and the player is forced to watch , horrified , as he mercilessly and uncontrollably batters Ryan to death .
It stands as the single greatest noninteractive cut scene in gaming history .
Ever .
As a storytelling device , noninteractivity is used as a weapon against the player : you do n’t want to question why you ’re doing what you ’re doing ?
Fine -- you ’re nothing better than a mindless , robotic slave , and you have essentially given up the human gift of choice .
Having control taken away is , within the context of the story , a tangible punishment for accepting things on face value and blindly following orders .
BioShock wants us to question authority and instruction not just for the big stuff -- politics , work , education and so on -- but for videogaming , as well .
When Cortana asks you to pistol - whip a bunch of aliens in Halo , why not stop for a moment and really think about why you 're doing it ?
One might suggest that questioning authority in a videogame , where structure is more or less mandatory and even the most nonlinear games still have an inescapably linear storyline , would be an ultimately meaningless gesture .
But if you 're willing to take everything a videogame presents you with at face value , how much more are you capable of accepting without question ?
If the player is asked to mow down armies of faceless baddies simply because they are " evil , " what does that even mean ?
For these reasons , " would you kindly " is , quite simply , the most meaningful videogame quote of all time .
It deeply affects the player on both emotional and intellectual levels ; not only that , but the intensity of the former inspires the latter .
As the player feels hatred and betrayal from his amiably - worded induction into slavery , he becomes much more likely to take Andrew Ryan 's dying words to heart :
A man chooses ; a slave obeys .

UNACCEPTABLE : Marks & Spencer will investigate this incident
Shopper Sally Friday felt publicly humiliated at a branch of Marks & Spencer when she tried to pay for First Bible Stories as a gift for her young grandson .
When she put the book on the check - out counter , the young assistant refused to touch it , declared it was unclean and summoned another member of staff to serve instead .
Mrs Friday said she was so upset that she has now complained to the store ’s management .
Last night politicians and religious leaders supported her in condemning the high street giant and reigniting the debate over religious beliefs in the workplace .
Conservative MP Philip Davies said the refusal to serve Mrs Friday , 69 , was “ unacceptable ” and “ damaging ” to community relations .
Inayat Bunglawala , assistant secretary - general of the Muslim Council of Britain , described the assistant ’s comments as “ offensive ” and called for Marks & Spencer to carry out a thorough investigation .
Mrs Friday said her trip to the sales in Reading , Berks , with her daughter had been ruined .
“ I went to the till and heard the girl say it was unclean and then she got someone else to serve me , ” said Mrs Friday .
“ At first I was n’t sure what was going on and then I realised she was wearing a headdress and I clicked that the title of the book had Bible in it .
I felt very humiliated and immediately left the store . ”
Mrs Friday , from Old Basing , Hants , added : “ I have given it careful thought and still feel humiliated that , because I am purchasing a children ’s Bible story book , a cashier is able to object and refuse to put it through the till .
“ Had this been a copy of the Koran I am confident any Christian person would be happy to do her job , and for this to happen in a Marks & Spencer of all places beggars belief .
“ I am not racist but I have vowed never to let a person wearing a headdress serve me again .
It will be a long , long time before I shop again at M&S. ” Mr Davies , Conservative MP for Shipley , west Yorkshire , said : “ I find it unbelievable .
We are a Christian country .
I ’m afraid it is no good for people to work in Marks & Spencer and not serve their products .
“ For M&S to put one of their customers in that position is totally unacceptable .
If a Christian lady had refused to serve a Muslim on religious grounds there would have been hell to pay .
“ In fact , I am sure someone would be sacked if it had been the other way round .
But that wo n’t happen this time , will it ?
These kind of things do not do anything for community cohesion .
In fact , they damage it . ”
Mr Bunglawala said : “ This appears to be a very regrettable incident and the ‘ unclean ’ remark was clearly very offensive and unacceptable .
Many Biblical stories complement the teachings of the Koran .
We hope that M&S will investigate this incident . ”
A spokesman for Marks & Spencer said an investigation was underway .
“ We would like to apologise to Mrs Friday for any offence this incident has caused , ” he said .
“ Reading is a very multicultural store and we are surprised and disappointed by this reported incident .
“ It does not reflect Marks & Spencer policy and simply should not have happened .
“ We will remind all staff at the Reading site of our policy and will contact Mrs Friday to apologise for her distress . ”
A source close to the shop assistant claimed there had been a misunderstanding .
“ I think there was some confusion over what the customer heard , ” she said .
But Mrs Friday ’s treatment is just the latest example of Muslim staff refusing to serve customers on religious grounds .
In October 2006 , Lloyds chemist was forced to apologise to mother Jo-Ann Thomas after a Muslim pharmacist refused her a morning - after contraceptive pill on religious grounds in Rotherham .

However , new state laws come down hard on employers who hire illegals , sending many undocumented workers elsewhere .
PHOENIX ( AP )  Illegal immigrants in Arizona , frustrated with a flagging economy and tough new legislation cracking down on their employers , are returning to their home countries or trying their luck in other states .
For months , immigrants have taken a wait - and - see attitude toward the state 's new employer - sanctions law , which takes effect Jan .
1 . The voter - approved legislation is an attempt to lessen the economic incentive for illegal immigrants in Arizona , the busiest crossing point along the U.S. - Mexico border .
And by all appearances , it 's starting to work .
" People are calling me telling me about their friend , their cousin , their neighbors — they 're moving back to Mexico , " said Magdalena Schwartz , an immigrant - rights activist and pastor at a Mesa church .
" They do n't want to live in fear , in terror . "
VOTING : Not on government database ?
Some in Florida can still register TO THE NORTH : Mustangs enlisted in U.S. - Canada border patrols Martin Herrera , a 40 - year - old illegal immigrant and masonry worker who lives in Camp Verde , 70 miles north of Phoenix , said he is planning to return to Mexico as soon as he ties up loose ends after living here for four years .
" I do n't want to live here because of the new law and the oppressive environment , " he said .
" I 'll be better in my country . "
He called the employer - sanctions law " absurd . "
" Everybody here , legally or illegally , we are part of a motor that makes this country run , " Herrera said .
" Once we leave , the motor is going to start to slow down . "
There 's no way to know how many illegal immigrants are leaving Arizona , especially now with many returning home for normal holidays visits .
But economists , immigration lawyers and people who work in the immigrant community agree it 's happening .
State Rep. Russell Pearce of Mesa , the author of the employer sanctions law , said his intent was to drive illegal immigrants out of Arizona .
" I 'm hoping they will self - deport , " Pearce said .
" They broke the law .
They 're criminals . "
Under the employer sanctions law , businesses found to have knowingly hired illegal workers will be subject to sanctions from probation to a 10 - day suspension of their business licenses .
A second violation would bring permanent revocation of the license .
Nancy - Jo Merritt , an immigration lawyer who primarily represents employers , said her clients already have started to fire workers who can't prove they are in the country legally .
" Workers are being fired , of course , " she said .
" Nobody wants to find out later on that they 've got somebody working for them who 's not here legally . "
When immigrants do n't have jobs , they do n't stick around , said Dawn McLaren , a research economist at Arizona State University who specializes in illegal immigration .
She said the flagging economy , particularly in the construction industry , also is contributing to an immigrant exodus .
" As the jobs dwindle and the environment becomes more unpleasant in more ways than one , you then decide what to do , and perhaps leaving looks like a good idea , " she said .
" And certainly that creates a problem , because as people leave , they take the jobs they created with them . "
Pearce disagreed that the Arizona economy will suffer after illegal immigrants leave , saying there will be less crime , lower taxes , less congestion , smaller classroom sizes and shorter lines in emergency rooms .
" We have a free market .
It 'll adjust , " he said .
" Americans will be much better off . "
He said he's not surprised illegal immigrants are leaving the state and predicts that more will go once the employer - sanctions law takes effect next month .
" It 's attrition by enforcement , " he said .
" As you make this an unfriendly state for lawbreakers , I 'm hoping they will pick up and leave . "

Olympic human rights activist Yang Chunlin was sentenced to five years imprisonment Tuesday for ‘ inciting subversion of state power ’ by championing his cause with the slogan , “ We do n’t want the Olympics , we want human rights . ”
While being taken from the courtroom , police shocked him with electric batons in front of his family .
The 20 - minute trial took place in the Jiamusi City Intermediate People ’s Court in Heilongjiang Province .
Rejecting that the Chinese authorities ’ judicial system is legitimate , Yang refused to sign the court document and insists he will not appeal his sentence .
Yang , a 53 - year - old unemployed factory worker , is also is a freelance writer under the pen-name , “ Wei Houren . ”
At the end of 2006 , Yang advocated for farmers who lost their farmlands in Fujin City , Heilongjiang .
He collected over 10,000 signatures on an open petition letter titled , “ We want human rights , not the Olympics . ”
On July 6 , Yang was arrested by the National Security Bureau in Jiamusi .
On August 13 , he was charged with ‘ inciting subversion of state power . ’
Yang ’s attorney Li Fangping stated that his client received a sentence that was unduly harsh .
He said Yang will now have ten days to decide whether to appeal .
Yang ’s sister , Yang Chunping , explained that the court hearing , beginning at 3 pm on the afternoon of March 24 , lasted about 20 minutes in total .
“ The court sentenced him to five years imprisonment and two years deprivation of political rights , on charges of ‘ inciting subversion of state power ’ because he posted articles online attacking the ruling regime , ” said Chunping .
“ When asked for his opinion of the verdict , [ my brother ] declared that the Chinese judicial system is n’t legal at all .
So what kind of opinion could he have over the sentence ?
Because his behavior is in complete compliance with the country ’s freedom of speech laws , his sentencing was not legal .
Therefore , he refused to sign on the written judgment .
He also expressed that he would not appeal , a decision he had already determined . ”
Police Beat Yang with Electric Batons on Site
After the hearing , Chunping said her brother was quickly taken away from court .
His family members wished to say a few words to him , urging him to reconsider an appeal .
But court police prevented any contact with his family by shocking Yang with electric batons .
“ Our family members only wanted to tell my brother to appeal , but the police did n’t allow him to speak .
They used electric batons to shock him several times , ” said Chunping .
“ My brother was hurt so terribly that he covered his abdomen with his hands .
Upon witnessing this tragic scene , my family members all cried loudly in protest and officers quickly threw my brother into a police vehicle . ”
“ Although my brother did n’t sign the sentence in writing after the hearing , the court forced my sister to sign a copy for relatives .
We do n’t know whether this will have any legal effect . ”
With no signature Yang ’s sentence was still valid , said Attorney Li Fangping , as the court had an open hearing .
If Yang did choose to appeal , Li said he would still continue to represent him .
But said the case is possibly over , as Yang had openly expressed that he would not appeal .
The court was contacted following the hearing , but no one answered the phone .

Carville : Richardson ' properly branded ' as Judas David Edwards and Muriel Kane

When former presidential candidate Bill Richardson threw his support behind Barack Obama last week , some in the Clinton camp were deeply affronted .
The New Mexico governor served in President Clinton 's cabinet in the 1990's and had been intensively wooed by the Clinton campaign .
Clinton advisor James Carville even called Richardson 's support of Obama " an act of betrayal " and told the New York Times , " Mr. Richardsons endorsement came right around the anniversary of the day when Judas sold out for 30 pieces of silver , so I think the timing is appropriate . "
On Monday , Carville refused to apologize for his words , telling CNN , " I wanted to use a very strong metaphor to make my point .
... I doubt if Governor Richardson and I will be particularly close in the future . "
Questions about his statements continued to follow Carville when he appeared the next day with ABC's Diane Sawyer , who wanted to know , " Is this morning the time to take that back ? "
" A cattle rancher in eastern New Mexico or an advertising executive on the East Side of Manhattan would agree that proper branding is important , " Carville replied harshly .
" I wanted to be sure that Richardson 's act was branded properly . "
" But Judas ? " asked Sawyer .
" What are you saying ? ...
Are you saying that he made a deal of some kind when you talk about 30 shekels ? "
" I thought this one was special and it needed to be properly branded , " Carville repeated , pointing out that he has n't condemned other friends of his who now support Obama .
" I do n't regret it , " Carville stated .
" I was quoted accurately .
... I think when people look at him they 'll remember the quote , and that 's what it was intended to do .
... I wanted his act to be remembered for what it was . "
Carville also shrugged off Clinton 's embarrassing misstatement of the danger involved in her trip to war - torn Bosnia in the 1990's .
" It happens in campaigns , " he explained , comparing Clinton 's exaggerations to John McCain 's stroll through an allegedly peaceful Baghdad market last year .
When Sawyer noted that a recent poll shows that Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by only 44 % of voters -- compared to Obama and McCain , who both score in the 60's -- Carville replied , " She 's been in public life for a long time .
She 's been subjected to some rather vicious attacks . "
This video is from ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast March 25 , 2008 .
Transcript via closed captions :: but first , the race for '08 and pressure fears for the democrats and constant back and forthor senators clinton and obama had hurt the party 's chances november .
and misstating her story of a 1996 trip to bosnia when she was first lady .
abc 's david wright is in washington .
good morning . :: reporter : good morning , robin .
this is embarrassing for senator clinton because she 's campaigned hard on her notion of strength and experience .
and she herself is pointing to the trip to bosa as an example of how she 's ready to answer that 3:00 a.m. crisis call from the white house .
well , the news video from that trip tells a different story .
on a day when barack obama was off vacationing with his family in the virgin islands , hillary clinton had hoped the focus would be on her major policy speech on the economy . :: to extend $ 30 billion to help bear stearns address their financial crisis , the federal government could provide at least that much emergency assistance to help families and communities address theirs . :: reporter : instead , her campaign was on the defensive .
fending off questions about the details of a trip she took to bosnia 12 years ago today . :: there 's a saying around the white house that if a place was too small , too poor or too dangerous , the president could n't go so send the first lady . :: reporter : just last week , clinton described her trip to tuzla like a scene from " private ryan . " :: there was no greeting ceremony and we basically were told to run to her cars that is what happened . :: reporter : actually , there was a greeting ceremony .
a bosnian girl read a poem and she posed for pictures and climbed up on a guard tower .
no signs of snipes are . :: the whole tuzla sector was under 9 control of the americans and it was a pretty safety sector .
we were driving around in soft - skin cars .
no reporters that i know of were wearing flap jackets tests .
it was a peaceful area . :: reporter : peaceful enough for a performance by sheryl crow and comedian sinbad . :: it was a moment of great pride for me . :: reporter : chelsea clinton was asked . :: yes , i was there as well .
i'm so honored that i was there with her and that i had the opportunity to travel with her . :: reporter : her mother was asked about it , too . by the two philadelphia newspapers . :: now , notice in the news pictures from the trip , neither clinton nor her daughter chelsea appear to be wearing flap jackets .
clinton said she did write about the tuzla trip in her book .
remember , diane , on two occasions she has embellished the story . :: thanks . :: joining us the author of " 40 more years " clinton supporter , democratic strategist james carville .
good morning , james . :: good morning , diane . :: how does somebody misspeak about sniper fire and ducking her cover ? :: first of all , it happens .
i remember with senator mccain , that embarrassing thing in baghdad when he said how safe it was .
circumstances were n't exactly like that .
you never like to see these things happen but they 're not unusual in politics . :: you 're stopping there . :: well , did you want me to continue ? :: well , i think it does go to some other issue .
now , gallup has been polling questions about trustworthiness in general .
just five days ago , take a look it says , on honest and trustworthy , senator mcchange , 67 % , senator obama , 65 % .
senator clinton , 44 % , what does she have to do about this ? :: well , she 's been in public life for a long time .
i think she 's probably been the subject of more attacks than any politician in recent political history .
some of it taking a toll .
i think she 's a very honorable person , i'm crazy about her .
with strength on the economy and things like that she does quite well . :: but this is a vulnerability , is n't it ? :: well , everybody in politics has a vulnerability .
as i'm saying , she 's been in public life for a long time .
she 's been subjected to some rather vicious attacks .
some of them have taken a toll .
i think during this gain , she 's shown herself to be a woman of remarkable strength and remarkable courage .
and i'm quite proud of her .
and i think she 'll continue down this road . :: let me turn to something else that you said over the easter weekend , as we know governor bill richardson endorsed senator barack obama .
and you said in light of the season , it was like judas .
it was like an act by judas with the 30 shackles and all .
is this morning the time to take that back ? :: you know , i think a cattle ranch in eastern new mexico , advertising executive on this side of manhattan would agree that proper branding is important . :: blanding ? :: i want to make sure richardson 's act was branded properly . :: but judas ?
what are y saying ?
because he said quite specifically , he made his decision on the fact that this is a once in a lifetime leader , he was talking about senator obama .
he respected senator clinton .
but he said obama represents something new that unifies people .
are you saying that he made a deal of some kind when you talk about 30 shekles ? :: what i'm saying here , me and my friends ' endorsement , obama have remained very close to him .
i have n't spoken out against him .
i thought this was just special and it needed to be properly branded and i did so . :: are you saying that anyone whoever had a job in the clinton administration should be for senator clinton or stay neutral ?
is that the rule ? :: well , there are a number of people that have jobs in the clinton administration i do n't think -- again , i think proper branding is important .
i do n't regret saying it .
i was quoted in context .
i was quoted accurately .
and i'm not -- i did -- i gave it a proper branding .
i put my opinion on it and i'm glad i did . :: you know how governor richardson responded .
let me play that clip . :: well , i'm not going to get into gutter like that .
and , you know , that 's typical of many of the people around senator clinton .
they think they have a sense of entitlement to the presidency . :: your reaction ? :: well , i do n't think a sense of entitlement to anything .
again , he 's been branded properly .
i think when people look at him , they 'll remember the quote and that 's what it was intended to do .
it 's one of those things in life you that do , it was the right thing to do .
i did it -- like i say , i wanted this act to be remembered for what it was and it will be ? :: no regrets ? :: no. :: are you going to speak to him again ?
he to you ? :: i doubt if he takes very kindly to it .
i do n't -- you know , i've said my peace .
and you know , if senator obama is the nominee , i said this is one corporal that i'll throw chevrons back on .
i have more dear friend whose respect obama .
i respect him dearly .
they remain close friends of mine .
i think this was a special case that required special attention and i gave it special attention . :: let me turn if i can to the wear and tear of the democratic party on this long , long race .
and senator obama has actually talked in support of an idea that it would be a superdelegate primary to resolve this whole issue of which way the superdelegates will weigh in , in june , to reach a past decision before the party convention .
are you in favor of this ?
is the clinton camp in favor of this ? :: i do n't know what the clinton camp position is on this .
just like the clinton camp had absolutely nothing to do with what i said about governor richardson .
i think what we need to do is let this process go through .
i think it 's very , very unfortunate that senator obama 's lawyers topped people in michigan from voting .
i think it 's a sign of weakness .
i think it 's unfortunate for the party .
i think it 's unfortunate probably writing florida off in the general election .
and in michigan , however that was a political decision that they made that they did n't want to face voters .
i think we have an important contest in , pa , north carolina , kentucky , oregon , indiana , south dakota , puerto rico .
a bunch of other places i think we should let democrats vote and be herd .
after that , a conclusion can be reached .
and one i'm fully prepared to support . :: quick final question to you , because you have said that the narrative will dictate what happens , whatever people are doing and adding up the numbers and saying it 's impossible for senator clinton .
you 're the pro here .
what do you predict for pennsylvia ?
let 's hear it . :: well , you know , well , i would say , what i said earlier , a long time ago that senator clinton had to win pennsylvania . :: but how much ?
50 % , 60 % ? :: i'm not going to go into numbers .
i said before , she had to win , ohio , texas and pennsylvania .
i'm sticking with that .
by the way , if the democrats in pennsylvania want to end this , they could end this by voting -- if senator obama wins that would pretty much end this process .
we 'll see , if they send a signal they want it to go on , then it will go on to north carolina . :: all right , james carville , great to you have here this morning .
chris has the other news . :: good morning , everyone .
let 's get right to a dramatic
Cable news networks do a terrible job covering science , giving it just a tiny fraction of the time devoted to celebrities , disaster and talking heads .
But could this actually be an ideal situation ?
I posted on cable news science coverage yesterday after the Project for Excellence in Journalism released its State of the News Media 2008 report .
Why the blind spot , I wondered , and dozens of readers gave thoughtful answers , ranging from the inability of science to compete with titillation and gore to the public 's general scientific illiteracy .
Adam Rogers – my editor and a correspondent on the Wired Science television show
\– pointed out that the Project 's findings were somewhat skewed , as they disregarded the science - related television produced by other cable networks , some of which are devoted entirely to science .
Adam 's point is a good one , and it raised some other questions .
Does the fare offered by the Discovery Channel and National Geographic make up for the absence of science on CNN , MSNBC and Fox News ?
How is it different than what those networks might offer – and as cable news networks are synonymous with sound bites and spin , might it be better for science to stay under their radar ?
Since cable news netwoks make up such a large part of the public sphere , I 'm not sure their blindness towards science is a good thing – but they 're so problematic in so many ways that I 'm hardly settled on the question .
What do you think , Wired Science readers ?

The remedy of choice many parents give to soothe coughing children has been found to be of little benefit , even potentially harmful , and will now require a prescription for infants .
The National Drugs and Poisons Scheduling Committee has announced that a group of cough and cold syrups , including Demazin and Dimetapp , will be available for children under two only when a doctor has provided a prescription .
The committee has found that although there had been few problems reported with the sedating antihistamine syrups in Australia , safety concerns outweighed the benefits of having them available over the counter .

Births to Eastern European - born mothers have risen by 15,000
Immigrant mothers
The NHS is spending £ 350 m a year to provide maternity services for foreign - born mothers , £ 200 m more than a decade ago , the BBC has found .
Immigration has raised the birth rate so fast that some units have closed , so that midwives could be moved to areas of urgent need .
A unit in Ascot , Berkshire , shut for two months in 2007 because staff had to be transferred to Slough .
The NHS says it is working to " build in " the extra capacity needed .
Other maternity units have turned expectant mothers away because they could not cope with unprecedented increases in the local birth rate .
When Labour came to power , the NHS spent around £ 1bn a year on maternity services , with one baby in eight delivered to a foreign - born mother .
Ten years on , spending has risen to £ 1.6bn , with almost one baby in four delivered to a mother born overseas .
While the number of babies born to British mothers has fallen by 44,000 since the mid-1990s , the figure for babies born to foreign mothers has risen by 64,000 - a 77 % increase which has pushed the overall birth - rate to its highest level for 26 years .
Professor Philip Steer , editor of the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , said : " The Department of Health has been taken by surprise .
The demographic change , the sheer numbers , has in some areas increased very substantially without there being any forward planning really to allow for that . "
According to figures from the Office for National Statistics , in 2006 there were 15,000 more Eastern European babies born here than a decade earlier .
' Unprecedented increase '
The statistics go on to show that 11,000 more babies were born to a mother from the Indian sub - continent , while 8,000 extra babies had mothers born in Africa .
Heatherwood Hospital in Ascot closed its maternity unit for two months in the summer of 2007 because of an " unprecedented increase " in the local birth rate .
Midwives were moved to Wexham Park Hospital , closer to the pressure - point of Slough where in the last year staff have witnessed an extra 150 babies delivered to foreign - born mothers .
Tharlie 's parents were told their local birthing unit was full
The knock - on effect was experienced in nearby Reading where the local maternity unit could not cope with the extra demand .
Tharlie Cooper was supposed to have been born in Reading , but when mother Lavina went into labour two weeks overdue she was told that , despite her being booked in , her local birthing unit was full .
Tharlie 's father Dean was furious .
" Basically we got turned away and the reply I got on the phone was wherever you ended up is where you end up " , he said .
He drove his wife to Basingstoke in neighbouring Hampshire where doctors conducted an emergency caesarean .
LIVE BIRTHS BY COUNTRY OF BIRTH OF MOTHER Births by British - born mothers down 44,000 Births by all foreign - born mothers up 64,000 Births by mothers born in Eastern Europe up 15,000 Births by mothers born in Indian subcontinent up 11,000 Births by mothers born in Africa up 8,000 Source : ONS / BBC
Send us your comments
Lavina , herself a migrant from South Africa , believes she and her baby could have died without prompt medical help .
The Royal Berkshire Hospital has apologised to the Cooper family .
In a statement the trust said : " It is a very difficult decision to close the unit and one which is not taken lightly .
" We are undertaking a strategic review to look at what sort of maternity services should be provided over the next 10 years , based on future population growth and birth rates . "
How to cope
Peterborough has seen a huge increase in births from Eastern Europeans .
There were just three such babies in 2000 , but almost 200 in 2006 .
At the Thistlemoor Medical Centre , births among patients have increased 33 % in just two years .
GP Nalini Modha fears the authorities have not planned for the new arrivals .
" Hopefully somebody who is in authority is actually looking at the figures to try and work out how they 're going to cope with the influx " she said .
" If you 're going to provide responsible care for all the population - the indigenous as well as the newcomers - then we will have to stop and think about what we can and can't afford . "
In parts of Greater London , seven out of 10 babies are now delivered to mothers born overseas .
The Strategic Health Authority argues that this partly explains why maternity services in the capital performed so poorly in last week 's Healthcare Commission report .
Births within migrant groups can often be more difficult , more dangerous and more expensive - with much higher rates of type 2 diabetes , tuberculosis and HIV among mothers who often turn up very late in their pregnancy .
London 's chief nurse , Trish Morris - Thompson , admitted that the NHS had not realised how immigration would affect maternity services .
" The timing of the impact is much quicker than we had anticipated " , she said .
" We 're working with our commissioners and our maternity providers now to ensure that we 're building in the capacity they need . "
Major Player in Military Contracts Seeks to Buy Diebold
For the last two years United Technologies has been seeking to purchase the Diebold Corporation .
Diebold ’s main business is ATM machines but , it is the manufacturer of election equipment under the name Premier Election Solutions .
Its software is responsible for counting votes throughout the United States .
Business
Week , in its report on the attempted purchase , wonders why United Technologies would want to acquire Diebold , writing “ Some analysts are wondering how United Technologies would benefit from acquiring Diebold , which generates more than two - thirds of its revenue from ATMs — a business that United Technologies is not in . ”
Perhaps it ’s not the ATM business that United Technolgies is interested in ; maybe it is the election business ?
Just what does United Technologies do and who is behind it ?
United Technologies , a major multinational conglomerate with a range of technology interests , receives approximately $ 5 billion in military contracts from the United States annually .
Among United Technologies products is the Black Hawk Helicopter , a tactical transport and assault helicopter which costs $ 5.9 million each of which 2,600 have been built .
Their businesses include Sikorsky Aircraft which makes helicopters , Hamilton Sunstrand which produces aircraft engines and rockets , UTC power which creates fuel cells for defense and aerospace systems as well as Otis Elevator and security systems .
United Technologies is also a major donor to political campaigns — the sixth largest defense industry donor in the 2004 election with two - thirds of their donations going to Republicans .
In 2008 , they are the fifth largest defense industry contractor and have given $ 485,000 , with 57 % going to Democrats .
They have had numerous government officials on their board , including a former secretary of defense and undersecretary of the air force .
The corporation they are trying to by is Diebold , infamous for producing electronic voting machines that have serious security and performance problems .
Their election division became so problematic that they created a veil of separation between their ATM business and their election products in August 2007 .
They renamed the division Premier Election Solutions and this February gave it a separate board of directors ( three out of five of the board were Diebold officials ) .
Diebold tried to sell the troubled election system in 2007 but was unable to find a buyer .
The former CEO of Diebold , Walden O’Dell raised distrust about Diebold as an honest vote counter by announcing before the 2004 election in a fundraising letter for President Bush that he would do all in his power to deliver Ohio for Bush .
He was forced to resign in 2005 as security fraud and insider trading charges loomed .
Diebold continues to have unresolved accounting problems with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
The company has been caught using federally uncertified software in elections .
Security reviews of the machines have found widespread flaws , and the machines have been known to break down in the midst of voting .
In 2004 , they entered into a $ 2.6 million settlement with California to resolve a lawsuit that alleged the Texas - based firm provided false information to obtain payments from the state and counties for its electronic voting equipment .
Black Box Voting found source code of Diebold ’s on the web and shared it with a top computer security expert , Avi Rubin of Johns Hopkins University , who published a report in 2003 that found widespread security problems .
Since then numerous reports conducted by various states have confirmed and expanded on those security holes .
What makes the Diebold machines even more problematic is that the software used to count the vote is secret ; it cannot be completely reviewed by computer experts .
Further , many of their machines do not produce a paper record , making it impossible to audit the result in order to verify that the count was accurate .
The machines that do have a paper record produce a flimsy ATM - like receipt with small print that is difficult for voters to read and challenging for election judges to count .
While many states are turning away from touch screen machines because of their expense , unreliability , and lack of transparency , many of the states do not require an audit of the optical scan count–op - scan machines are also computers that rely on software and can be insecure .
With no audit why bother having a paper record ?
In an editorial blog , the New York Times reminded its readers of the warning that President Eisenhower gave the American public in 1961 as he left office : “ In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist . ”
The Times noted “ we suspect that Eisenhower would be appalled to learn that a defense contractor could be counting the votes in the next presidential election . ”
Thus far , Diebold ’s board has rejected United Technologies ’ $ 2.6 billion offer .
However , the multinational is very likely not to give up and could take the offer to the shareholders of Diebold .
So , we may see the next election counted in large part by a defense contractor .
They already virtually determine the outcome of elections through their contributions and their control of the media , e.g. GE ’s ownership of NBC .
If this purchase goes through , they will be counting the vote in secret with no independent review .
The problem of a military contractor counting the votes is really a symptom of a bigger problem of corporate - government .
Across the country election administrators have outsourced vote counting to private corporations .
In fact , Diebold ’s central tabulator software counted most of the votes in the last presidential election and 80 % of the votes were counted by two corporations : Diebold and ES&S .
It is time to return voting to the responsibility of government by non-partisan elections administrators and to make voting transparent with an independent record that is verified by the voter .
Further , audits of initial results need to become a routine part of every election , i.e. comparing a hand count of paper ballots with an adequate random selection of precincts to ensure the accuracy of the vote count .
Finally , recounts need to be made not only easy for candidates to request , but also inexpensive .
The foundation of the legitimacy of government is democracy and the foundation of democracy is voting .
If we do not trust voting the government loses its legitimacy .
An ambitious project to create the most detailed picture of human genetic variation yet has been launched by British and American scientists .
The 1000 Genomes Project will map the tiny fraction of genetic material that differs between people , giving scientists unprecedented insight into why some are more susceptible to disease than others .
Scientists know that any two humans are more than 99 % identical on the genetic level .
The remaining fraction helps explain differences in people 's health .
The $ 50 m ( £ 26 m ) map , which is expected to take three years to complete , will be made freely available , allowing scientists to pinpoint the genetic causes of common disorders swiftly and help tailor medical treatments to individual patients .
Researchers will scan the genetic make - up of at least 1,000 people who either live in , or have ancestry tracing back to , Europe , Africa , Japan , China , India and Mexico .
From these scientists will create a catalogue of genetic variation found in as few as 1 % of the population .
" Such a project would have been unthinkable only two years ago , " said Dr Richard Durbin , a geneticist at the Welcome Trust 's Sanger Institute in Cambridge , who co-chairs the project .
" We are moving forward to building a tool that will greatly expand and further accelerate efforts to find more of the genetic factors involved in human health and disease . "
Since the 13 - year - long Human Genome Project was completed in 2003 , scientists have strived to look deeper into 3bn pairs of letters that form the human book of life .
One , the HapMap project , has revealed large - scale genetic variations between populations , which have helped scientists identify more than 100 regions linked to conditions such as obesity , diabetes , heart disease and cancer .
Scientists look for genetic causes of disease by comparing genome scans from healthy people with sick people .
But these studies usually only point to vague regions in the genetic code that may be hundreds of thousands of letters long .
" This project will give scientists a complete map of all the variation in that region , so they 'll be able to use it to tease apart what might cause the illness and that will lead to better diagnosis and better understanding of the disease , " said Durbin .
The project will begin this year with three pilot studies .
The first will involve an in - depth scan of two families ; the second will sequence the genomes of 180 people , while the third will examine 1,000 genes in 1,000 people .
The main project will begin next year .

Today Congress passed a resolution ( HR 951 ) condemning Palestinian rocket attacks that include a strident defense of recent Israeli tactics in the Gaza Strip .
The resolution also condemned Iran and Syria for “ sponsoring terror attacks , ” and demanded that Saudi Arabia publicly condemn Palestinian actions .
The resolution was originally introduced in January , but contains new language including a passage saying that that “ those responsible for launching rocket attacks against Israel routinely embed their production facilities and launch sites amongst the Palestinian civilian population , utilizing them as human shields ” and “ the inadvertent inflicting of civilian casualties as a result of defensive military operations aimed at military targets , while deeply regrettable , is not at all morally equivalent to the deliberate targeting of civilian populations as practiced by Hamas and other Gaza - based terrorist groups . ”
Although 23 Congressman abstained or voted “ present , ” only one bravely voted no : Rep. Ron Paul .
Consumers may not be able to avoid cloned food Labeling up in the air : U.S. says food from cloned animals is safe , but only a patchwork of voluntary agreements by stores and producers would tell consumers what they 're eating

Less than a dozen years after Dolly the sheep became the world 's first cloned mammal , grocers and restaurateurs are digesting the fact that milk and meat from cloned animals could soon filter into their supply chains .
The government took major steps toward easing cloned livestock and their offspring into the food supply in mid-January , when the Food and Drug Administration concluded they 're safe to eat .
The question is , will consumers swallow the new technology ?
And how will food businesses cope if their customers balk ?
Many food merchants are still framing their policies while they warily monitor public opinion .
The historic commercial debut of cloning comes in an era when a significant segment of consumers have rejected other foods the FDA deemed safe , such as milk from hormone - treated cows and genetically modified corn .
Cloning is an attempt to create a new animal using the DNA from an existing adult animal .
The FDA , while noting that livestock cloning produces many malformed or ill newborn animals , said cloned animals that survive for several months after birth can be healthy .
They can reproduce normally and produce healthy young , the FDA said .
The agency said it found no signs that food from healthy clones is harmful to humans , and predicted that sickly clones would be excluded from the food supply .
Consumer groups , however , have called FDA 's positive safety assessment hasty and ill - founded .
The Center for Food Safety said the FDA based many conclusions on small or limited studies , many of them financed by cloning companies .
Clones that appear healthy can have infections , or abnormalities that could affect food quality such as unusual proteins or imbalances between protein and fats , the group said .
Further studies should be done to evaluate clones and their offspring , the organization said .
Such groups are urging consumers to press their supermarkets and restaurants to refuse food from clones .
And those businesses are being peppered with inquiries like " Will my hamburger meat come from a cloned cow ? " and " Are clones kosher ? "
Independent grocer Sam Mogannam said he did n't need any calls from his customers to know if they 'd accept food from cloned lineages .
He 's sure they wo n't .
And he has no intention of stocking any at Bi-Rite Market , which he bills as a mecca for organic , sustainable and non-artificial foods in San Francisco 's Mission District .
" We believe in allowing nature to take its due course , " he said .
" I know our customers would n't support us if they knew we were knowingly accepting products from clones or their offspring . "
But food merchants , from small shop owners to national supermarket chains , could face formidable challenges if they want to guarantee customers the option of avoiding all products linked to cloning .
No public system is in place to alert food sellers when products from animal lines that include clones could reach their shelves - whether in the form of a rib - eye steak , a quart of low - fat milk , a can of beef minestrone or a wedge of sharp cheddar .
Consumer groups such as the Center for Food Safety and Consumers Union support mandatory labeling of all products linked to cloning , from raw meat to meatball sandwiches .
They 're backing bills proposed in Congress and by a few state legislators , including state Sen.
Carole Migden , D - San Francisco .
Without labeling , they argue , any food safety problems that did arise from cloning would never be linked to the technology .
Some retailers , after hearing from customers , are also calling for some form of government action .
Two supermarket chains with a significant presence in Northern California , Safeway and Whole Foods Market , say the government should oversee a system to track clones through the food supply .
It should also consider other means , such as food labeling , to ensure that consumers can make informed choices about products of cloning , the companies said .
" The lack of effective governmental oversight and tracking could mean consumers will lose the ability to choose clone - free products , " Whole Foods spokeswoman Margaret Wittenberg said .
The FDA maintains that no labeling or disclosure requirements are necessary to protect public health .
The agency , after years of study , issued a lengthy report Jan. 15 concluding that milk and meat from cloned cattle , pigs and goats are safe for consumption .
The FDA said it had too little information to assess cloned sheep , but it found no food safety problems connected with the progeny of clones .
The offspring of all cloned livestock were immediately cleared as food sources by the U.S. Department of Agriculture , based on the FDA 's findings .
Clones themselves - cattle , pigs and goats - will also enter the food supply .
But when , and under what regulatory scheme , if any , has not yet been decided .
The USDA is inviting industry input as it develops a plan to usher cloned animals into the market .
In the meantime , the agency is asking companies that have created or purchased clones to honor a voluntary ban on selling their meat or milk for food .
This means that Ditto , a cloned cow created by a UC Davis researcher , can't be a food source just yet because the university honors the temporary ban .
But UC
Davis is now free to sell milk or meat from Ditto 's daughter , an unnamed Holstein cow conceived by sexual reproduction .
Even before the FDA 's favorable report , a few clone owners admitted in various news reports that they had already sold milk or meat from the animals as food .
As the rules stand now , livestock breeders and milk or meat suppliers have no legal obligation to disclose to either food manufacturers or consumers that a product came from a cloned animal line .
Some vendors plan to keep their products clear of cloned lineages , but the FDA may not permit packages to bear a voluntary label such as " clone free . "
Safeway Inc. of Pleasanton , one of the nation 's largest food retailers , said its customers are demanding more information .
The company acknowledged that the government conducted important studies on food from clones .
But to help shoppers make informed choices about products tied to cloning , Safeway supports additional studies " that would help ensure changes to federal policy are done in a manner that maintains consumer confidence and informed decision making . "
The Pleasanton chain , which has 269 stores in Northern California , is asking its suppliers to deliver no products from cloned animals while the government mulls its options .
" Meanwhile , the federal government should exercise its authority and expertise to determine an appropriate regulatory framework , including traceability and labeling , " Safeway said in response to a Chronicle inquiry .
Safeway declined to say whether it will accept foods from the offspring of clones .
Trader Joe's , a Monrovia ( Los Angeles County ) grocery chain that carries many organic product lines , did not respond to The Chronicle 's query .
Bruce Knight , USDA undersecretary for marketing , said the agency is willing to help industry members create a tracking and certification program if they request it .
The USDA already administers standards and certification of organic products .
Knight said the USDA would work with companies that want to set up voluntary labeling of food from clones .
Few food businesses have actively sought to sell products from cloned animal lines , but all could be affected by the few U.S. cloning companies in business .
Their customers are farmers who want replicas of valuable breeding animals - clones of a prize bull , for example , whose semen fetches high prices for artificial insemination .
As breeders , cloned animals could quickly influence the gene pool of U.S. livestock .
The preserved semen of one bull can be sent throughout the country to produce thousands of descendants .
One healthy cloned calf can cost as much as $ 20,000 .
But these expensive animals may enter the meat supply when their reproductive lives wane .
Their milk will also be sold for dairy products .
At this point , retailers that want to avoid food from clones are relying on private agreements with their suppliers , who in turn have to trust their own sources .
Meat packers may be able to exclude some clones by consulting an industry database of cloned animals whose owners volunteer to register them .
The two major livestock cloning companies , ViaGen Inc. and Trans Ova Genetics , are developing the registry with the certification company AgInfoLink .
Meatpackers would be able to scan or read an animal 's ear tag to identify clones , said AgInfoLink executive Glenn Smith .
At this point , AgInfoLink does n't plan to track the milk , semen or offspring of clones .
But Smith said that could change if retailers request such services .
Most food outlets that have taken a stand on cloning have said they will exclude clones themselves , but not necessarily food from their progeny .
Natural foods retailer Whole Foods Market of Austin , Texas , which has 24 stores in Northern California , said its products will remain free of both clones and their descendants .
" We are working with our supplier community to develop a chain of custody records that trace product breeding stock through multiple generations , " said Edmund LaMacchia , vice president of purchasing for perishables .
It 's not clear , however , that all USDA - certified organic operations will be completely " clone free . "
Some organic producers say they 're not sure yet how they can guarantee that their animals have no ties to cloning .
That includes Albert Straus , president of Straus Family Creamery in Marin County , which supplies all the dairy products for Sam Mogannam 's Mission District market and nearby ice cream store .
Like most dairy operators , Straus relies on artificial insemination to reproduce his herd .
Straus wants the government to require semen suppliers to reveal whether their products come from a cloned bull or its young .
Without such certainty , Straus said , dairies might lose their organic certification from the USDA .
USDA 's organic standards do rule out clones , but the agency may permit the use of a clone 's descendants , Knight said .
Therefore , consumers who want to avoid food from both clones and their offspring may not be able to rely solely on the organic label .
Buying only kosher foods wo n't insulate consumers from products of cloning at all .
Rabbi Menachem Genack of the Orthodox Union , which certifies food items as kosher , said cloned animals would qualify as long as they belong to a single kosher species , such as cattle , sheep and goats .
At this point , consumer choice rests on a patchwork chain of voluntary agreements among suppliers and retailers .
The first time many Americans take a bite of food from a cloned animal or its offspring , they may never know it .
Cloning 's imperfections at center of debate
Twenty years from now , the eating public may blithely accept food from cloned animals .
But at this point , consumer groups are aghast at government actions to usher cloned livestock and their offspring into the U.S. food supply .
To a large extent , the resistance stems from the fact that livestock cloning is still an imperfect art .
The Food and Drug Administration found in January that food from healthy clones and their progeny is safe .
But in the same lengthy report , the FDA also detailed snags in the current art of animal cloning that reduce its rate of producing healthy clones to less than 10 percent .
Many cloned embryos die or develop into sickly newborns .
Among consumer groups , those technical snags have raised questions not only about food safety , but also about animal welfare and ethics .
They contend that further study may reveal health dangers the FDA did n't discover , as new testing methods emerge .
In the FDA 's view , future research will not only confirm the safety of food from clones , but will also improve methods of creating them .
Clones are made by coaxing a single adult cell from the original animal - call it a bull named George - to form an embryo that will become George2 .
The nucleus containing George 's DNA is swapped into an egg cell from a cow , after the egg 's nucleus is removed .
The hope is that the resulting embryo , implanted in a surrogate mother , will be an exact copy of George .
But about 90 percent of the time , that does n't happen .
Clones can be born grossly malformed , and many die within six months .
The fetuses can grow too large , causing difficult , extended pregnancies ending with delivery by cesarean section , the FDA found in a review of scientific studies .
But the FDA said clones that survive past six months are often healthy and fertile .
Their offspring have even fewer health problems , the agency said .
No significant differences appeared in milk or meat from cloned animal lines and their non-cloned counterparts , FDA reported .
The FDA acknowledged that newborn clones are often sick or dying , but said those animals would never pass inspection for entry into the food supply .
Consumer groups are n't convinced that cloning raises no safety concerns .
For example , they suspect that many young clones will survive only through treatment with antibiotics and other drugs .
Such animals could enter the food supply and affect human health , they contend .
An ethics board advising the European Food Safety Authority concluded in January that cloning for food production cannot be justified at this point because of the suffering of both deformed clones and their surrogate mothers , or dams , in animal breeding terms .
On the question of food safety , however , the European Food Safety Authority agreed with the FDA .
The FDA , whose purview is limited to food safety , did not evaluate the ethics of cloning .
Crime and Punishment for Reading
WASHINGTON --
If an author can't make the Oprah cut , the next best thing may be getting censured by a university .
Ever heard of Todd Tucker ?
Did n't think so .
Obviously , some have because he has books and readers .
But he 's not Michael Crichton or John Grisham .
Yet .
Tucker 's name recently surfaced beyond Amazon 's pages when one of his books sparked an investigation at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis ( IUPUI ) because a janitor was reading it .
So you 're thinking , this book must have been pretty bad .
Something like " Poached Puppies and Other Pet Recipes " or " What 's So Wrong With Necrophilia ? "
No , the book was a nonfiction account of a real incident in American history -- " Notre Dame vs. the Klan : How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan " ( Loyola Press ) .
The current controversy began last fall when Keith John Sampson , a student and university employee in his 50s , was reading Tucker 's book during a break from his janitorial duties .
Wrong place , wrong time , wrong book .
On the basis of the cover alone , a co-worker sitting across from Sampson complained that the book was offensive .
The cover shows the Notre Dame dome and two burning crosses amid a crowd of robed and hooded Klansmen .
The pages inside tell the story of a 1924 street fight between Notre Dame students and Klansmen , who had gathered in South Bend purposely to terrorize the university 's Catholic students .
The clash lasted two days , during which the fighting Irish prevailed , and is recognized as a turning point in Klan history .
But never mind .
The co-worker apparently was n't interested in the content .
The cover art was deemed traumatizing enough to prompt the shop steward to reprimand Sampson , saying that reading a book about the Klan was comparable to bringing pornography into the workplace .
A few weeks later , Sampson heard from the school 's affirmative action office that a racial harassment complaint had been filed against him .
In a November 2007 letter , affirmative action officer Lillian Charleston told Sampson that he demonstrated " disdain and insensitivity " to his co-workers .
" You used extremely poor judgment by insisting on openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your black co-workers . "
The letter also noted that by the " legal ' reasonable person standard , ' a majority of adults are aware of and understand how repugnant the KKK is to African - Americans . "
Sampson was ordered not to read the book in the presence of his co-workers .
Charleston is right that reasonable people know how repugnant the KKK is to African - Americans .
But reasonable people also know how repugnant the KKK is to people of all races .
Reasonable people also know that history is what it is .
Reading about it is n't an incitement to riot or an endorsement of the bad guys .
Following a few weeks of relatively quiet controversy , a smattering of media reports and chatter in the blogosphere , Sampson received another letter from the affirmative action office saying that no determination could be made as to whether his reading choice was intentionally hostile .
Therefore , no disciplinary action would be taken .
This time , Charleston insisted that the university does n't restrict reading materials and that she was merely addressing " the perception of your co-workers that you were engaging in conduct for the purpose of creating a hostile atmosphere of antagonism . "
" Of course , if the conduct was intended to cause disruption to the work environment , such behavior would be subject to action by the university , " she wrote .
Was Sampson being intentionally hostile and antagonistic ?
One might argue that he was inconsiderate to continue reading the book once he realized others found it distasteful .
Maybe Sampson has bad manners , but if bad manners are our new standard for disciplinary action , everybody 's under arrest .
You see , meanwhile , how vexing mind reading can be .
Yet , mind reading was the crux of this case and scores of others where the interpretation of speech codes hinges on unanswerable questions that require the power of divination :
What was he thinking ?
What was she feeling ?
And who decides what thoughts are acceptable and which feelings are sacrosanct ?
A reasonable person might like to flip the question Charleston posed about whether Sampson 's book choice was intentionally hostile as follows :
What could be more hostile in a university environment than investigating a student 's reading choices on the basis of a bystander 's perceptions ?
That 's not just hostile , but sinister .
To read is sublime ; but to read a mind is tricky .
Hillary Clinton has been telling America that she is the most qualified candidate for president based on her " record , " which she says includes her eight years in the White House as First Lady - or " co-president " - and her seven years in the Senate .
Here is a reminder of what that record includes : HILLARY , As First Lady , assumed authority over Health Care Reform , a process that cost the taxpayers over $ 13 million .
She told both Bill Bradley and Pat Moynahan , key votes were needed to pass her legislation , that she would " demonize " anyone who opposed it .
But it was opposed ; she could n't even get it to a vote in a Congress controlled by her own party .
( And in the next election , her party lost control of both the House and Senate . )
HILLARY assumed authority over selecting a female Attorney General .
Her first two recommendations ( Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood ) were forced to withdraw their names from consideration , and then she chose Janet Reno .
Janet Reno has since been described by Bill himself as " my worst mistake . "
HILLARY recommended Lani Guanier for head of the Civil Rights Commission .
When Guanier 's radical views became known , her name had to be withdrawn .
HILLARY recommended her former law partners , Web Hubbell , Vince Foster , and William Kennedy for positions in the Justice Department , White House staff , and the Treasury , respectively .
Hubbell was later imprisoned , Foster committed suicide , and Kennedy was forced to resign .
HILLARY also recommended a close friend of the Clintons , Craig Livingstone , for the position of director of White House security .
When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of up to 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies ( Filegate ) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff , both Hillary and her husband denied knowing him .
( FBI agent Dennis Sculimbrene confirmed in a Senate Judiciary Committee in 1996 both the drug use and Hillary 's involvement in hiring Livingstone .
After that , the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office , after serving seven presidents for over thirty years . )
HILLARY , in order to open " slots " in the White House for her friends the Harry Thomasons ( to whom millions of dollars in travel contracts could be awarded ) , had the entire staff of the White House Travel Office fired .
They were reported to the FBI for " gross mismanagement " and their reputations ruined .
After a thirty - month investigation , only one , Billy Dale , was charged with a crime - mixing personal money with White House funds when he cashed checks .
The jury acquitted him in less than two hours .
HILLARY also assumed the duty of directing the " bimbo eruption squad " and scandal defense : ... She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit .
... She refused to release the Whitewater documents , which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor .
After $ 80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent , Starr 's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky , which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs .
... Then they had to settle with Paula Jones after all .
... And Bill lost his law license for lying to the grand jury .
... And Bill was impeached by the House .
... And Hillary almost got herself indicted for perjury and obstruction of justice ( she avoided it mostly because she repeated , " I do not recall , " " I have no recollection , " and " I do n't know " 56 times under oath ) .
HILLARY accepted the traditional First Lady 's role of decorator of the White House at Christmas , but in a unique Hillary way .
In 1994 , for example , The First Lady 's Tree in the Blue Room ( the focal point each year ) was Decorated with drug paraphernalia , sex toys , and pornographic ornaments , all personally approved by Hillary as the invited artists ' depictions of the theme , " The Twelve Days of Christmas . "
HILLARY wrote " It Takes a Village , " demonstrating her socialist viewpoint .
HILLARY decided to seek election to the Senate in a state she had never lived in .
Her husband pardoned FALN terrorists in order to get Latino support and the New Square Hassidim to get Jewish support .
Hillary also had Bill pardon her brother 's clients , for a small fee , to get financial support .
HILLARY then left the White House , but later had to return $ 200,000 in White House furniture , china , and artwork she had stolen .
HILLARY played the " woman card " in the campaign for the Senate , by portraying her opponent ( Lazio ) as a bully picking on her .
HILLARY'S husband further protected her by asking the National Archives to withhold from the public until 2012 many records of their time in the White House , including much of Hillary 's correspondence and her calendars .
( There are ongoing lawsuits to force the release of those records . )
HILLARY , as the junior Senator from New York , passed no major legislation .
She has deferred to the senior Senator ( Schumer ) to tend to the needs of New Yorkers , even on the hot issue of medical problems of workers involved in the cleanup of Ground Zero after 9/11 .
Quite a resume , is n't it ?
Sounds more like an organized crime family .

BARN DEMOLITION ( Unconfirmed by Darwin )
January 2007 , West Virginia )
Three friends set out to dismantle a dilapidated barn one bracing winter afternoon .
Speaking of bracing ...
One industrious man fired up his chainsaw and ripped through a crucial support post .
Carrying the weight of a full barn roof , those wooden support beams were all that stood between the demolition worker and structural collapse .
It was all fun and games until the roof , sans support , succumbed to the pull of gravity and flattened the man with the chainsaw .
As a consolation prize , the deceased was indeed successful at demolishing the barn .
( Darwin notes , this story is unconfirmed , but no disputes have come to my attention , as usually happens with bogus stories . )

MOLE HUNT ( Confirmed True by Darwin )
January 2007 , East Germany |
One man 's extraordinary effort to eradicate a mole from his property resulted in a victory for the mole .

RUNNER UP # ONE :
FALLING IN LOVE ( Confirmed Double Darwin Award )
June 2007 , South Carolina |
A passing cabbie found a 21 year - old deceased couple laying naked in the road an hour before sunrise .
Authorities were baffled .
There were no witnesses , no trace of clothing , and no wrecked vehicles present .
But investigators eventually found a clue high on the roof of a nearby building : two sets of neatly folded clothes .
Safe sex takes on a whole new meaning when you are perched on the edge of a pyramid - shaped metal roof .
" It appears as if [ they ] accidentally fell off the roof , " Sgt. McCants said .

AND THE 2007 DARWIN AWARD WINNER IS ...
THE ENEMA WITHIN ( Confirmed True by Darwin )
May 2004 , Texas | Michael was an alcoholic .
And not an ordinary alcoholic , but an alcoholic who liked to take his liquor ... well , rectally .
His wife said he was " addicted to enemas " and often used alcohol in this manner .
The result was the same : inebriation .
And tonight , Michael was in for one hell of a party .
Two 1.5 litre bottles of sherry , more than 100 fluid ounces , right up the old address !
When the rest of us have had enough , we either stop drinking or pass out .
When Michael had had enough ( and subsequently passed out ) the alcohol remaining in his rectal cavity continued to be absorbed .
The next morning , Michael was dead .
The 58 - year - old did a pretty good job of embalming himself .
Toxicology reports measured his blood alcohol level as 0.47 % .
In order to qualify for a Darwin Award , a person must remove himself from the gene pool via an " astounding misapplication of judgment . "
Three litres of sherry up the butt can only be described as astounding .
Unsurprisingly , his neighbors said they were surprised to learn of the incident .

Wiretapping focus shifts to email , as firms move data overseas John Byrne
Published : Friday March 7 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Microsoft , Google do n't deny participation in NSA program Little - noticed comments by a senior Justice Department official suggest Congress ' fight over renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act surround interception of email and Internet data .
At a Monday breakfast sponsored by the American Bar Association , Assistant Attorney General for National Security Kenneth Wainstein remarked that the fight over the eavesdropping bill actually centers on US interception of email .
" In response to a question at the meeting by David Kris , a former federal prosecutor and a FISA expert , Wainstein said FISA 's current strictures did not cover strictly foreign wire and radio communications , even if acquired in the United States , " the Washington Post reported Tuesday .
" The real concern , he said , is primarily e-mail , because " essentially you do n't know where the recipient is going to be " and so you would not know in advance whether the communication is entirely outside the United States . "
Unlike phone calls , email messages are generally stored before being transmitted to the sender .
Most messages are stored on an email provider 's servers before they are accessed by the recipient .
Because they can be located anywhere , this means any portion of the law related to the Web could snare Americans ' data overseas .
Microsoft declined to comment when asked about their participation in any NSA program , saying only that they have 300 million active email accounts .
Google told CNET : " As our privacy policy states , we comply with law enforcement requests made with proper service .
We do not discuss specific law enforcement requests and generally do not share aggregate information about them .
There are also some legal restrictions on what information we can share about law enforcement requests . "
US companies moving data centers overseas
The admission comes amidst US email and Internet companies moving some of their servers overseas .
According to a piece in March 's edition of Harper 's Magazine , AT&T , Microsoft and Google all have or plan overseas data centers in an effort by the companies to cut costs .
" Microsoft has announced plans for a data center in Siberia , AT&T has built two in Shanghai , and Dublin has attracted Google and Microsoft , " Harper 's notes .
Americans ' personal data is n't just email .
More and more computer users are storing personal word processing , photographs and other files online through document sharing programs like Google Documents .
" As the functions long performed by personal computers come to be executed by these far - flung data centers , " the magazine writes , " the technology industry has rapturously rebranded the Internet as ' the cloud . ' "
Some say Wainstein 's admission that the debate over the eavesdropping act is centered not on " wire and radio " transmissions -- eg , phone calls -- suggests that most of the National Security Agency 's concern is about their ability to spy on Internet data .
Director of National Intelligence " Michael McConnell , the serial exaggerator who claims to be a non-political straight shooter , himself kept saying the NSA lost 70 percent of its capabilities after the ruling , " Wired blogger Ryan Singer writes .
" If that 's the case , that means that 70 percent of what the NSA does is collect emails inside United States telecom infrastructure and service providers . "
If Congress approves immunity for companies that participated in President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , these email carriers will get a pass .
Though most debate centers around those companies already identified as participants -- Verizon , AT&T and Sprint -- the Act provides immunity for all companies that complied with federal orders , provided they had a solid legal foundation .
CNET 's Chris Soghoian offers more .
He writes that yet more companies could have been involved , noting that there are numerous firms that make up the Internet backbone -- Tier 1 Internet service providers .
According to Wikipedia , Soghoian continues , these providers are : AOL Transit Data Network , AT&T , Global Crossing , Verizon Business , NTT Communications , Qwest , SAVVIS , and Sprint .
" That leaves AOL , Global Crossing , NTT Communications , and SAVVIS as other potential participants in any NSA effort to sniff email communications , " he adds .
Even as Tanya Andersen refilled her malicious prosecution lawsuit last week , the RIAA won a victories in two unrelated lawsuits .
One involved a case where the defendant never showed up in court ; the other a defendant who admitted to using KaZaA to download and distribute music .
James V. Lewis was sued by the labels in August 2007 after an IP address flagged by MediaSentry was traced to his ISP account .
Lewis never showed up in court , and the RIAA filed for a default judgment in October .
Initially , the judge declined to give the labels what they were looking for , instead scheduling a hearing to discuss the case .
After a hearing held last week , the judge gave the RIAA what it was looking for : a default judgment in the amount of $ 3,000 plus an additional $ 420 in court costs .
Lewis has also been barred from infringing on " any other sound recording , whether now in existence or later created , that is owned or controlled by the Plaintiffs . "
The other case , Atlantic v. Anderson , involves a Texas resident who was sued in November 2006 for copyright infringement .
Abner Anderson decided to fight the lawsuit , submitting a brief answer to the RIAA 's complaint in which he did little more than deny the labels ' accusations .
He also said that any infringement that did take place was due to the negligence on the part of the RIAA .
The RIAA moved for summary judgment in the case , arguing that Anderson 's making the songs in question available on KaZaA was the same as distributing them , and that the facts of the case were indisputable .
Anderson disagreed .
In his response to the RIAA 's motion , he argued that the problem of illegal downloading was the result of the recording industry 's own negligence .
" Without an official statement , the distribution of literature from Plaintiffs , or something to inform the public of actions that constitute copyright infringement , the public could not be expected to know that using this software network was improper , " argued Anderson .
He also noted that he planned to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory damages sought by the RIAA , as other defendants have done .
Judge Vanessa D. Gilmore was unconvinced .
In her decision , she pointed out that Anderson had admitted to downloading and using KaZaA during discovery .
Furthermore , his screen name matched the one flagged by MediaSentry , and he admitted to " actively distributing " music to other KaZaA users .
" Defendant concedes that he did place the subject Copyrighted Recordings in his shared folder for distribution to other users while being connected to KaZaA , " she wrote in her opinion .
Judge Gilmore also touched on the RIAA 's argument that making a file available over P2P constitutes infringement .
" Numerous courts have assessed whether availing music and / or media for downloaded by other users on a peer - to - peer network constitutes copyright infringement as a matter of law , " wrote the judge .
" Accordingly ... because it has been both proven and admitted to that the Defendant intentionally downloaded and / or distributed those Copyrighted Recordings , no genuine issue of material fact remains as to Plaintiffs ' claim for copyright infringement . "
The RIAA was awarded $ 23,250 , or $ 750 in statutory damages for each of the 31 songs named in the lawsuit , plus $ 420 in court costs .
Judge Gilmore took issue with Anderson 's argument that the damages sought by the RIAA were excessive .
" Yet , the true cost of Defendant 's harms in distributing Plaintiffs ' Copyrighted Recordings for download by other users on KaZaA is incalculable , " wrote the judge in her opinion .
" That is , there is no way to ascertain the precise amount of damages caused by the Defendant 's actions . "
The Anderson case may prove significant for the RIAA because of the ruling on the statutory damages question ; an RIAA spokesperson said that the group would be " citing it often " in other cases .
It 's important to note , however , that the defendant 's failed to raise the " making available = infringement " question in his defense .
Indeed , his admission that he knowingly set up and used KaZaA to download and share music on the P2P service may have precluded him from doing so .

Even as Yahoo tries to stay out of Microsoft ’s grip , the company is busy closing acquisitions of its own .
Yahoo said Tuesday that it had paid $ 160 million to acquire Maven Networks , an Internet company that sells a system for managing advertisements in online videos .
Traditional media outlets like Fox News , CBS Sports , Hearst , The Financial Times and Gannett use Maven ’s technology to show and distribute videos , as well as for other tasks , such as identifying the right moment during a video to show a particular ad .
Yahoo , which is trying to position itself as a seller and distributor of all types of online ads , said the acquisition would help it sell and deliver video ads not only on its own site but on other sites across the Web .
Yahoo plans to offer its ad - selling services to Maven ’s media clients .
Although President Bush opposes carbon caps , Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , and Republican front - runner John McCain all favor curbs .
Many analysts expect a law to be passed by 2010 and caps to start as early as 2012 .
The phone - booth - size machine humming away in a Tucson lab may look like a science - fair project on steroids .
Its inventors , however , say it 's a potent new weapon in the battle against global warming .
Its task is elegantly direct .
The 9 - foot - tall device , encased in see - through plastic , scrapes the chief global warming gas — carbon dioxide — right out of the atmosphere .
As air wafts through , CO 2 sticks to large chemically coated panels while oxygen and other innocuous gases breeze by .
The carbon inhaler 's developer , Global Research Technologies , is among hundreds of U.S. companies scouring for ways to reduce the world 's greenhouse gas emissions and cash in on federal requirements anticipated by 2010 to combat global warming .
CHART : How carbon offsets and allowances work " It 's a gold rush , " says Peter Fusaro , head of consulting firm Global Change Associates .
The CO 2 - busting industry is exploding as federal legislation to cap the emissions of utilities and other industries grows more likely , offering the prospect of huge profits .
Nearly 400 start - ups are operating 600 carbon- mitigation projects in the USA , with the number of companies set to triple the next two years , says consulting firm Point Carbon .
Their product ?
Carbon offsets .
One carbon offset , or credit , equals a ton of CO 2 removed from the air .
Hedge funds and investment banks are starting to trade offsets like stocks and bonds , betting they could soar in value if greenhouse gas caps are imposed .
JPMorgan ( JPM ) expects to buy and sell hundreds of millions of offsets this year , up from tens of millions last year .
For several years , entrepreneurs have had modest success selling credits to corporations and consumers who want to be good citizens and offset the carbon that 's produced when they drive cars or use electricity .
Many are deploying tried - and - true techniques such as burning the noxious emissions of landfills and cow manure and restoring forests .
Others are testing grander but more controversial strategies , such as growing carbon - absorbing plankton in the South Pacific .
The voluntary market for U.S. offsets is still meager , though it more than doubled last year to $ 150 million to $ 200 million , says research firm Ecosystem Marketplace .
In Europe , which has complied with mandatory carbon limits since 2005 under the Kyoto treaty , the offset market hit $ 10 billion last year .
Sales in the USA , the world 's biggest carbon emitter , could be as high as $ 175 billion by 2020 if a federal cap is approved , says research firm New Carbon Finance .
Such legislation has grown all but inevitable .
Although President Bush opposes carbon caps , Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , and Republican front - runner John McCain all favor curbs .
Many analysts expect a law to be passed by 2010 and caps to start as early as 2012 .
Under a bill that cleared a Senate committee in December , global - warming discharges by major polluting U.S. industries would be cut 71 % by 2050 .
A cap and trade system would be created to spur progress .
Utilities , oil companies and manufacturers that exceed their emissions caps would buy allowances — which do n't yet exist — from others in those industries that fall under their limits .
Unlike an offset , which is a ton of carbon extracted from the air , an allowance lets a company emit a ton of CO 2 .
The number of allowances would fall over the years , driving up prices , as the government lowers maximum emissions .
Costs come down on consumers
The two carbon currencies — allowances and offsets — will likely merge .
The leading proposal in Congress would let companies offset up to 30 % of their emissions by buying carbon credits .
In other words , instead of cutting its own pollution or purchasing allowances , a utility could buy offsets that fund carbon reduction elsewhere in the USA .
That would be a boon for offset suppliers , which could sell credits at much higher volumes and prices than they do now .
Today , offsets cost $ 3 to $ 8 , Evolution Markets says , but they 're expected to track the prices of allowances as those enter the market .
Allowances are expected to cost at least $ 25 by 2020 and $ 60 by 2040 .
Those costs largely would be passed on to consumers .
Electric rates in some areas could rise up to 45 % , and gasoline prices could go up 25 cents a gallon by 2020 under some forecasts .
If allowance prices get high enough , it will become economical for emitters to make permanent fixes , such as adding pollution - cutting equipment to a carbon - belching coal plant .
Yet some frown on offsets .
David Doniger , a policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council , fears excessive use of offsets early in a cap - and - trade program could encourage polluters to put off investments to slash their emissions .
Offset suppliers face other uncertainties that could torpedo their plans .
It 's unclear what types of projects would qualify for offsets and whether credits that predate a new law would be eligible .
Officials also would examine whether a project would have gone ahead even without offsets , likely disqualifying it for credits .
Despite the hazy outlook , emitters are starting to buy offsets in the hope they 'll be able to use them to meet federal mandates .
In the largest such deal , American Electric Power , ( AEP ) the nation 's biggest coal - fired power generator and greenhouse gas emitter , agreed last year to purchase 4.6 million carbon offsets from Environmental Credit from 2010 to 2017 .
Environmental Credit will generate the offsets by burning the methane produced by the manure of 400,000 cows at 200 farms .
Although burning methane produces CO 2 , methane is 21 times more harmful to the atmosphere .
Livestock manure accounts for 6.6 % of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions .
By purchasing the offsets in future years , when carbon caps are likely to be in place , AEP thinks the Environmental Protection Agency will be more likely to approve them .
And by inking a deal now , the utility seeks to lock in lower prices .
" We 're firmly of the mind there will be some kind of global - warming program in the not - too - distant future , " says AEP Chief Executive Michael Morris .
" To that end , we 're trying to build a bank of credit . "
Morris would not say what AEP will pay for the offsets .
But Environmental Credit executive Derek
Six says it 's more than today 's $ 5 price of an agricultural offset but less than the roughly $ 20 tab projected in the next decade under a federal program .
Environmental Credit is spending $ 25 million to buy equipment for the AEP project and will share offset revenue with farmers .
Lofty environmental goals
Others are eyeing bigger carbon bounties .
Blue Source plans to capture the carbon dioxide spewed by a Kansas fertilizer plant and sell it to petroleum fields to boost oil output .
It 's spending about $ 70 million on equipment to corral the carbon as well as on pipelines to send the gas about 100 miles to the oil fields .
Blue Source already has five similar setups in the USA .
It will snare about 650,000 tons of carbon a year from the Kansas plant , the equivalent of removing 113,000 cars from the road .
At today 's offset prices , Blue Source will recover its investment in about five years .
But projected prices in the next decade under a federal cap would halve the payback period , says CEO Bill Townsend .
More than half of the offsets Blue Source sells go for a premium because they 're for post - 2010 projects that emitters hope will meet federal caps , up from 10 % six months ago , he says .
" It was n't a bad business before , but it 's not the business ( a federal cap ) will bring us , " Townsend says .
Some start - ups are grounding their businesses in Mother Earth .
Equator Environmental plans to restore forests , at a cost of about $ 1,000 an acre .
Deforestation accounts for about 20 % of the world 's global warming gases .
With an acre of trees swallowing just 2 to 8 tons of CO 2 each year and offset prices under $ 10 , the business is barely profitable until a cap brings higher prices , says CEO Jeff Bortniker .
Meantime , Equator plans to harvest trees for extra revenue , planting new ones to keep the forest population in balance .
By David M. Sanders , for USA TODAY A full view of Global Resources Technologies ' phone - booth - sized carbon filter , with CEO Wright .
Still others are tinkering with technologies they say could offer breakthroughs under a federal system that pays top dollar for carbon reductions .
The carbon - absorbing machine being tested in Tucson was funded by Gary Comer , the founder of Lands ' End ( SHLD ) who was moved to combat climate change in 2001 , when he was able to sail the Arctic Ocean without the aid of an icebreaker .
Comer died in 2006 .
If deployed in large numbers , the carbon - filtering machines could slash new emissions and vacuum decades - old gases out of the air , says Allen Wright , president of Global Research Technologies .
Wright envisions machines the size of 40 - foot - long shipping containers that could be trucked to vast isolated stretches where carbon would be buried when technology to do so is available .
With each device able to remove a ton of carbon a day , about 30 million units could scoop up 10 billion tons a year , or about a third of the world 's emissions , he says .
Costs to capture carbon initially would be about $ 250 a ton , far more than the projected $ 100 per ton price of U.S. allowances in 2050 .
But Columbia University geophysicist Klaus Lackner , who teamed with Wright to invent the machine , says mass production could drive prices to $ 30 a ton .
There are skeptics .
Electrodialysis , which separates the carbon from the panels , uses so much electricity that it produces nearly as much carbon as it removes .
Capturing and storing CO 2 from the biggest single source — coal plants — as researchers are working to do , would be far more efficient , says Gary Rochelle , professor of chemical engineering at the University of Texas .
" These kinds of projects are a terrible distraction , " he says .
Lackner says the CO 2 separation instead could be driven by an electricity - free thermal process .
Another carbon - buster with big ideas is turning toward the open seas .
Climos wants to dump up to 1,000 tons of pulverized iron over a patch of ocean as large as 15,000 square miles in a bid to germinate plankton .
Iron ore has been shown to promote the growth of the microscopic ocean algae , which inhale as much CO 2 in six months as a forest consumes in decades .
Yet critics , such as Rutgers University biophysics professor Paul Falkowski , say the plankton also releases some carbon as it decomposes before it sinks to the ocean bed .
As it decays , it produces nitrous oxide , which is far more damaging to the atmosphere than carbon , Falkowski says .
Climos CEO
Dan
Whaley , co-founder of travel site GetThere.com , agrees such risks must be studied but says early research suggests the carbon absorbed exceeds toxic emissions enough to make the project viable .
If such seedings are repeated annually for 25 years , they could suck in 1 billion tons of CO 2 , he says .
With each seeding costing several million dollars , Whaley says a large - scale program would be feasible only under government regimes in the USA or Europe that provide for high offset prices .
Yet neither the European system nor proposals in Congress permit ocean - based offset projects .
Whaley believes such constraints could be lifted after demonstration projects prove the technology .
" If it works , then it 's a large solution , " Whaley says .
" We need all the horsepower we can get because the problem is way bigger than we imagined . "
CLEARING A FINANCIAL PATH TO CLEANER AIR | CLEARING A FINANCIAL PATH TO CLEANER AIR | Story Carbon offsets today are largely bought by utilities and corporations such as PepsiCo that want to offset the carbon dioxide they produce from trucks and cars or generating electricity .
If the federal government caps carbon emissions , certain industries would have to buy carbon allowances and offsets to continue to pollute , which would give them an incentive to cut emissions .
Examples of how offsets and allowances work : Offsets Allowances Each offset is a ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere or prevented from entering the atmosphere .
An allowance is a right to emit a ton of carbon dioxide .
Carbon allowances do n't exist now .
1 Carbon offset supplier works with a farmer to generate 300,000 offsets when methane produced by cow manure at farms is burned .
Methane is 21 times more damaging to the atmosphere than carbon .
1 U.S. government each year would distribute allowances to major industries that emit carbon dioxide , auctioning some and giving away some free .
2
Investment bank buys offsets for $ 5 each , or $ 1.5 million , betting they 'll rise in value .
Offset supplier and farm owners split revenue .
2
A utility that relies heavily on coal - fired power plants might have to buy up to half its allowances in the early years , getting the other half free .
Allowance costs would be passed on to consumers .
3
Utility buys offsets from investment bank for $ 7 each , or $ 2.1 million , hoping they can be used to meet future federal greenhouse gas limits .
3
The cost of allowances would rise over the years , increasing the utility 's incentive to invest in cleaner energy , such as a nuclear reactor or a wind farm , to reduce emissions .
4
Offset prices are expected to soar when they can be used to supplement allowances to meet federal caps .

Chris Matthews is well known for his creepiness , unintelligible ranting , mancrushes and general hackery , but he 's really gone off the deep end during this primary season .
On Thursday 's Hardball , he talks with MSNBC's Pat Buchanan , Dana Milbank and Maria Teresa Petersen of Voto Latino about the upcoming Pennsylvania primary -- see if you can follow the bouncing ball .

Matthews says that Obama has an advantage , but asks if the " drama " surrounding Clinton 's victories earlier this week will be the deciding factor .
He has more medals , but she has more gold medals .
He then says that as the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is n't a risk , but Obama is a " roll of the dice " -- then goes on to say that the primary in PA is all about the south east part of the state with lots of educated people from the suburbs which bodes well for Obama -- his breakdown of PA and all the different ethnic , religious and educational demographics is incoherent at best and toward the end he leans in to Pat Buchanan and tells him he ought to grow his beard out and go in and talk tough to the people of Philadelphia because they 're old school and he'd fit right in .
WTF ?
MSNBC needs to give Matthews some time off , and I mean that sincerely .
I realize that job is n't the easiest in the world and he 's been keeping a hectic schedule during the primary season , but Chris is , even by his own mind numbing standards , starting to lose it and he wo n't always have Keith Olbermann there to save him from himself .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson revealed sweeping plans on Monday for streamlining a hodgepodge of financial regulations that are blamed for allowing the U.S. mortgage crisis to balloon into a full - blown economic threat .
The proposals , in the form of a 218 - page “ blueprint ” that was started before markets unraveled in August , offer no quick fix for the credit contraction that threatens to tip the U.S. economy into recession .
The plan was already meeting some resistance from Capitol Hill and competing corners of the government bureaucracy as a potentially protracted debate took shape .
Under the proposals , the current patchwork of as many as seven federal regulators would be consolidated under three agencies : the U.S. Federal Reserve , a newly created financial regulator , and a third agency for consumer protection and business practices .
Stocks ended the day up modestly as investors expressed cautious optimism that the government stood ready to help stabilize volatile financial markets .
Treasury debt prices also rose .
The dollar ticked higher against a basket of currencies .
Paulson acknowledged that most of the proposals would not be enacted until after the current troubles have passed , perhaps long after President George W. Bush leaves office in January .
The regulatory blueprint proposes eventually vesting new powers in the Federal Reserve as a “ market stability regulator ” -- effectively formalizing a role the central bank adopted recently by expanding the list of financial firms that can borrow directly .
It would give the Fed authority to demand that all financial system participants supply it with full information on their activities and grant the Fed a right to collaborate with other regulators in setting rules for their behavior .
The Bush administration has faced political pressure from critics who blame lax regulatory oversight for the mortgage mess .
Paulson , a 30 - year Wall Street veteran , stressed that regulation must be light enough to keep markets innovative , and said those who tried to label the blueprint as advocating more or less regulation were “ oversimplifying . ”
“ I am not suggesting that more regulation is the answer , or even that more effective regulation can prevent the periods of financial market stress that seem to occur every five to 10 years , ” he said .
“ I am suggesting that we should and can have a structure that is ... more flexible , one that can better adapt to change , one that will allow us to more effectively deal with inevitable market disruptions , one that will better protect investors and consumers , and one that will enable U.S. capital markets to remain the most competitive in the world , ” he said .
DEBATE BEGINS
In a nod to the likely turf battles to come , a Treasury official said the department was “ trying not to let the political challenges shape how we see things . ”
Walt Lukken , acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which under Treasury ’s plan would be merged with the Securities and Exchange Commission , said the CFTC had specialized expertise that could be “ jeopardized ” in a larger regulatory agency .

Sen . Christopher Dodd , the Connecticut Democrat and chairman of the influential Senate Banking Committee , said the plan did not address the root problems of the financial turmoil -- namely souring subprime mortgages and rising foreclosures ..
“ To talk about overhauling the regulatory system is a wonderful idea .
But frankly it does n’t relate to the issues we ’re grappling with , ” Dodd told reporters on a conference call .
“ It ’s not even close to the strike zone . ”
On Wall Street , investors concluded that it would be some time before any substantive changes were made .

“ Since most of what ’s in the Treasury plan will take new law , its fate will be determined by another Congress with a new president in a different financial market two years from now , ” said Karen Shaw Petrou , managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics in Washington .
Since problems surfaced in August with rising failure rates on subprime mortgage loans to less credit - worthy borrowers , credit markets have come near seizure several times .
Public anger has mounted at what was perceived as slack enforcement of existing rules .
Many mortgage loans were made without basic fact - checking .
Some lenders did not verify whether borrowers actually earned the incomes they claimed or whether they were steered into inappropriate loans with low initial “ teaser ” rates that soon reset higher , requiring much larger monthly payments .
Treasury also recommends getting rid of a Depression - era charter for thrifts , which was intended to make it easier to obtain mortgage loans , saying it is no longer necessary .
That would mean closing the Office of Thrift Supervision and transferring its duties to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , which oversees national banks .
In one important change to try to clamp down on mortgage brokers , the Treasury is urging the establishment of a “ mortgage origination commission ” made up of regulatory agency representatives that would be able to set licensing standards for mortgage brokers .
That would boost consumer protection by increasing scrutiny of the personal conduct , disciplinary history and educational qualifications of the brokers , who are frequently the first contact for borrowers .
The openness of the Internet is what made Google -- and Yahoo ! -- possible .
A good idea that users find useful spreads quickly .
Businesses can be created around the idea .
Users benefit from constant innovation .
It 's what makes the Internet such an exciting place .
So Microsoft 's hostile bid for Yahoo ! raises troubling questions .
This is about more than simply a financial transaction , one company taking over another .
It 's about preserving the underlying principles of the Internet : openness and innovation .
Could Microsoft now attempt to exert the same sort of inappropriate and illegal influence over the Internet that it did with the PC ?
While the Internet rewards competitive innovation , Microsoft has frequently sought to establish proprietary monopolies -- and then leverage its dominance into new , adjacent markets .
Could the acquisition of Yahoo ! allow Microsoft -- despite its legacy of serious legal and regulatory offenses -- to extend unfair practices from browsers and operating systems to the Internet ?
In addition , Microsoft plus Yahoo !
equals an overwhelming share of instant messaging and web email accounts .
And between them , the two companies operate the two most heavily trafficked portals on the Internet .
Could a combination of the two take advantage of a PC software monopoly to unfairly limit the ability of consumers to freely access competitors ' email , IM , and web - based services ?
Policymakers around the world need to ask these questions -- and consumers deserve satisfying answers .
This hostile bid was announced on Friday , so there is plenty of time for these questions to be thoroughly addressed .
We take Internet openness , choice and innovation seriously .
They are the core of our culture .
We believe that the interests of Internet users come first -- and should come first -- as the merits of this proposed acquisition are examined and alternatives explored .
Silencers are more properly called sound moderators or suppressors ( since nothing " silences " a weapon completely ) and are widely used to reduce noise levels from the discharge of firearms .
A sound moderator is essentially no more than a series of baffles coupled to an expansion chamber , contained within a tubular attachment which screws on to the end of the firearm 's barrel .
The noise of the discharge of most firearms is made up of two components .
The first comes from the rapid expansion of propellant gases as they leave the muzzle .
The second is the supersonic crack of the bullet .
It is not possible to reduce the sound level of a supersonic bullet , but a sound moderator fitted to such a rifle will have some significant effect in reducing the noise signature because it controls the rate of expansion of the propelling gases .
For a sound moderator to be really effective , it must be used with ammunition whose projectiles travel at less than the speed of sound .
In such cases , the noise of the discharge is greatly reduced and may not even be recognizable as a gun .
The first successful silencers were patented in 1910 by the American inventor Hiram P. Maxim ( son of Hiram S. Maxim of Maxim machine - gun fame ) .
His devices were of the baffle type , which is still in common use today .
A baffle silencer typically consists of a metal cylinder , usually divided into two sections , which is fixed to the muzzle of the firearm .
The first section , which is typically about a third of the silencer 's length , contains an " expansion chamber " into which the hot gases that follow the bullet out of the muzzle can expand to dissipate some of their energy .
The expansion chamber may contain a wire mesh cylinder , whose function is to break up the column of gas and to cool it by acting as a heat sink .
The second section consists of a series of metal baffles , with a central hole to allow the passage of the bullet .
The function of the baffles is to progressively deflect and slow the flow of gas emerging from the expansion chamber , so that by the time the gases emerge from the silencer , their flow is cooler , at low velocity and silenced .
A motorbike silencer works on exactly the same principle .
There are also variations on this theme : some designs consist entirely of baffles , while others are based entirely on one large expansion chamber .
In fact , the movie industry has offered some alternatives for a " home - made " silencer , some more plausible than others .
A plastic soft drinks bottle can be made into a fairly efficient silencer that will work for a limited number of shots before it breaks up .
Potatoes at the end of the barrel definitely do n't work .
The pillow does n't really help , either , though it does have the benefit of minimizing or negating blood splatter during the shooting .
A less common , type of silencer is the " wire mesh " design .
These usually have the same expansion chamber as the baffle type , but the baffles are replaced by a column of knitted wire mesh with a central hole for the bullet .
Here , the wire mesh acts to disrupt the column of gas as in the baffle design , while at the same time acting as a heat sink to cool the hot gas and hence quieten it .
Criminals have been known to improvise this type of silencer , using wire wool or steel pan scourers to form the mesh .
The very latest innovation in muzzle - mounted silencers is the so - called " wet " silencer ( or " wet can " in the US ) .
These designs allow the use of water or a lubricating oil .
On firing , the hot expanding gases are cooled , and therefore quieted , by the exchange of heat into the liquid .
Wet silencers allow the designer to produce much smaller or quieter designs .
So , it is fair to say that Hollywood takes great artistic liberties with silencers .
Most real designs are much larger than the cigar - tube sized ones typically shown on film and usually much less simple to fit and remove and more likely to produce a muffled crack , or to sound like a car door being slammed , instead of the " fart " seen and heard in movies .
And by the way , " silencers " do n't work and the best suppressors do only half the job , so being a hitman must be more difficult than you thought .
9/11 Truth is Not a PRIVATE CLUB . . .
Or Is It ?
I was reading a 9/11 truth blog for an organization up north , and saw something that kind of shocked me , but on the other hand sadly did n’t .
The poster was talking about the new 9/11 truth telling novel , “ The Shell Game ” from NY Times best selling author , Steve Alten .
The poster ’s post , paraphrased was along the lines of , “ Gee , this guy is n’t anyone I ’ve heard of in the 9/11 movement . . . should we help promote his book ? ”
View this 9/11 Truth Trailer for " The Shell Game " - Share it Widely !!
Hit me in the head with a sledgehammer if I ’m wrong . . . but were n’t we all out in the streets for 6 years , sweating and freezing our tails off leafleting and holding signs while passers by insulted us and flipped us off . . .
SO THAT WE COULD GET NEW PEOPLE TO WAKE UP AND JOIN OUR EFFORTS ???
I do n’t know about you all , but I never got into this because I wanted to be part of the exclusive and elite “ smart people ’s club who figured out 9/11 a long time ago . ”
I ’ve only sweated , and froze , and sacrificed because I realized 9/11 was an inside job , and was terrified that because it worked so well putting Americans and others to sleep , that they might do it again , and “ seal the deal in ending Western democracy , and creating a militarist police state ” using the fear another 9/11 would generate .
I worked 10 , 12 , sometimes 36 hour stretches blasting out 9/11 info to anyone and everyone I could .
I collected email addresses for engineering and physics professors , grad students , etc. for most major Western university departments . . . to give them David Ray Griffin , Steven Jones , Kevin Ryan , and Richard Gage ( Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth ) ’s breaking research .
My efforts helped NEW ENGINEERS become aware of this work , and to themselves become 9/11 truth activists .
I DO NOT want to be sitting in some quaint coffee shop 20 years from now with a small group of bitter cloistered fellow 9/11 truthers like some sad little JFK assassination conspiracy reading group at the local library , all talking about how damn smart and elite we are , because only we could figure out this stuff .
NO , I WANT SO MANY PEOPLE TO WAKE UP AND KNOW THAT 9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JOB , THAT NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW OR CARE WHO I WAS OR WHAT I DID .
I WANT TO BE A GRAIN IN AN OCEAN OF WHEAT WHO KNOWS THE TRUTH ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE .
WHY ?
Because by bursting the 9/11 lie , we can stop these illegal immoral oil wars , and end the permanent wars we ’ve been promised .
We can pull our military back from the Middle East and stop supporting corrupt leaders there who are whores to the oil companies , and save trillions in saved military spending , not to mention stop our soldiers from coming back forever damaged by being placed in a sad lie of a war .
I want my constitution back , and I want to stop the FBI and CIA from spying on my people .
Outting 9/11 truth CAN STOP THIS INSANITY .
So , has Steve Alten been out sweating and freezing on corners with me ?
No .
He ’s been writing novels , and getting connected with English teachers in high schools across America , and making connections through reading programs with our active troops in Afghanistan and Iraq .
He was busy , so it took him longer to wake up to the lies of 9/11 than I did .

Earlier this year , California Secretary of State Debra Bowen established strict new standards for electronic voting machines , requiring independent code audits , Red Team security testing , and support for paper records .
The Red Team testing process primarily involves subjecting the machines to review by security experts who attempt to hack the software and bypass the physical security mechanisms .
Recent Red Team tests of ES&S voting machines have uncovered serious security flaws .
Previous Red Team tests commissioned by the state of California revealed significant vulnerabilities in devices sold by Diebold and Sequoia .
At the time , ES&S declined to participate in the testing , citing lack of preparedness .
The tests on the ES&S machines were finally conducted in October , and the results , which were recently published ( PDF ) , show that products from ES&S are as insecure as the rest .
The first round of tests focused on the physical security of the Polling Ballot Counter ( PBC ) , which the Red Team researchers were able to circumvent with little effort .
" In the physical security testing , the wire - and tamper - proof paper seals were easily removed without damage to the seals using simple household chemicals and tools and could be replaced without detection , " the report says .
" Once the seals are bypassed , simple tools or easy modifications to simple tools could be used to access the computer and its components .
The key lock for the Transfer Device was unlocked using a common office item without the special ' key ' and the seal removed . "
After bypassing the physical security of the voting machines , the Red Team researchers were able to gain direct access to all of the files on the systems , including password files .
" Making a change to the BIOS to reconfigure the boot sequence allows the system to be booted up using external memory devices containing a bootable Linux copy , " according to the researchers .
" Once done , all the files can be accessed and potentially modified , including sensitive files such as the password file which can be cracked by openly available cracker programs .
New users may be added with known passwords and used by the same attacker or other attackers later . "
The Election Management System workstations were also found to be vulnerable , with critical security codes stored in files as plain text .
The Red Team also discovered that the Election Loader System used unencrypted protocols to transmit election initialization data to the PBC units , which implies vulnerability to a man - in - the - middle attack .
The Election Loader System is populated with data from an Election Distribution CD , which is generated by a special Election Converter Application .
The researchers were able to break the encryption used on the generated CD to " breakdown the CD , revise the election definition , and replace the CD with a new encrypted CD with an alternate election definition . "
The researchers note that this tactic could be used to alter vote tallies .
ES&S is already in serious trouble in California for selling uncertified voting machines to several counties in violation of state law .
The results of the Red Team test , which demonstrate beyond doubt that the security of ES&S voting machines is utterly inadequate for use in elections , make it seem unlikely that ES&S will be able to continue peddling their defective products in the state .

For all the talk of protests leading up to the Olympic torch relay , we did n't hear much from the supporters of China .
We learned why early on Wednesday morning .
They planned to take over the event .
By 10 a.m. at AT&T Park , where the torch run was supposed to begin , it was obvious that the fix was in .
Thousands of supporters were already there , unloaded from dozens of buses parked across from the ball park .
( One torch relay insider told me some in the crowd had been bused from as far away as Los Angeles . )
During the day Chronicle reporters were told by some supporters that they had been bused into San Francisco from the South Bay , the East Bay and Sacramento by the Chinese Consulate and Chinese American groups .
They were waving thousands of huge , red Chinese flags or holding up identical , professional - looking placards that read " Beijing , 2008 , torch relay . "
The official word is that the torch route was drastically changed because of " public safety , " but the crowd at AT&T Park was no threat to the runners .
In fact , they broke into wild cheers when someone in a torchbearer 's track suit walked down the street .
But mayoral spokesman Nathan Ballard might have been closer to the truth when he said that the new route let people " enjoy the torch rather than political kabuki theater . "
By 1 p.m. , the appointed time for the torch runners to begin the relay , the crowd had grown even bigger .
China supporters far outnumbered any human rights protesters , and anyone from the small pockets of " Free Tibet " protesters was quickly surrounded by the crowd and shouted down .
When a Tibet supporter held up a sign , a Chinese supporter would sidle up , the wind would catch his flag , and it would obliterate the sign from the view of the cameras .
" We suspected that the Chinese government would want a public relations spectacle , " said Kate Woznow , campaign coordinator for Students for a Free Tibet .
" Something that they could broadcast back home . "
Those inside the command center say city officials and Mayor Gavin Newsom watched the spectacle with growing concern .
Although there was a brief scuffle with " Team Tibet " supporters around a bus early in the morning , the vast majority of the crowd was flag - waving China supporters .
Sending the torch down those streets would have been like providing the Chinese government with a made - for - television commercial to show that hardly anyone in San Francisco - or North America - had any qualms about human rights abuses in China .
Newsom wo n't come out and say that , but he did concede that he took the decision right down to the final minutes .
" Literally , at 1 o'clock , we had two choices , " he said in a phone conversation en route to the closing ceremony at the airport .
" We could cancel the event or move forward in a different manner .
We went to the torchbearers themselves , and overwhelmingly they said they supported the change . "
Taking the torch to the other side of town and skirting the whole enormous pro-China crowd at the ballpark might have improved the chances for public safety , but it also gave the torch back to San Francisco .
Suddenly , it was back to the original idea , a run through the streets with a symbol of the upcoming Olympic Games , not a carefully planned political charade .
Because this , apparently , is the Chinese government 's idea of free speech .
They speak freely , and everyone else gets shouted down .
Frankly , there is no denying that they were well organized .
I took a minute to talk to a Tibetan protester , Kal Sang , but I was quickly joined by two young men who listened to the interview and began to interject derogatory comments .
" I hope America hears the voice of these people , " said one of the interrupters , Jun Liu , from San Mateo .
" The media pretended they would be fair , but they are not just biased , they are extremely biased . "
Sang , a Tibetan from Minnesota , who had done nothing more than stand with a friend wearing a " Free Tibet " shirt , was surrounded by critics .
A woman shouted at her , " You know nothing ! " and " Go to Tibet to see for yourself . "
" They put pressure on us , " said Sang , who looked like a soccer mom .
" They try to get us to push them , but we are nonviolent .
We are not against the Olympics .
They should hold the Olympics .
But we are speaking for people who do not have a voice . "
At that moment , the China supporters seemed to think that they 'd carried the day .
The " Free Tibet " crowd had been harassed to the point that they packed up and walked toward the Ferry Building .
It appeared that the torch would be coming down the street any minute , and the news photos and video would feature thousands and thousands of cheering China supporters waving red flags .
A cocky young man walked past me and read his sign out loud , " Welcome to Beijing , " he said .
It was about then that it was announced that the torch was unexpectedly up in the Marina district , running through tree - lined neighborhoods past a small crowd of ordinary people without a political point to make .
Just for future reference , China - or for that matter , anyone else :
You can try to take over , but good luck .
This is San Francisco .
Scotland 's defeat of England in the Six Nations rugby union championship was relayed to a London cinema audience .
The project was carried out with production group , the 3D Firm .
BBC News website video journalists Andrew Webb ( Edinburgh ) and John Galliver ( London ) were at both ends of the transmission .
1. PREPARATION : WATER CARRIERS WILL 'KILL US '
It was a doom - laden prediction : " The water carriers are gonna kill us . "
Director Rhys Edwards made the dire warning moments after meeting the cameramen who were to film the historic event .
His fear was that people would walk too close to pitch - level cameras .
He had only three camera rigs at his disposal - a far cry from the 10 or more he is used to flicking between .
But this was an attempt to give 200 industry insiders the experience of sitting at Murrayfield - not a chance to come face to face with Jonny Wilkinson or Chris Paterson .
2. BROADCAST : RAIN ALMOST SPOILS THE FUN
Scotland , as we all know , gets its fair share of rain .
So it was of little surprise that torrential downpours led to a rapid rethink of the best - laid plans .
Two of the three camera rigs had been positioned in the open .
But if any raindrops hit the lenses , the 3D effect would disintegrate .
Evasive action was called for .
3. VIEWERS : 'RESIST THE URGE '
The makeshift cinema was packed with tech - heads and journalists and there were certainly a few sceptics in the crowd .
Up until this point , for me , 3D has meant just one thing - an exploding shark at the end of Jaws 3D .
Would my mind be changed ?
Glasses on , the broadcast started and it was immediately apparent that this was going to be good .
One of the first shots of the crowd showed a fan waving a large flag back and forth .
It seemed to come right into the room and I had to resist the urge to reach out and touch it .
Once the action kicked off , the experience was totally immersive .
Scrums appeared to be just feet away , while the sense of depth within the crowds in the background took you right into the stadium .
However , the 3 cameras covering the match felt limiting after a while .
Sports fans might also have missed the instant replays and on - screen match statistics we are used to in TV sports coverage .
These are minor grumbles .
As one of my fellow audience members put it , this was n't like watching TV , it was like being at the match .
And you know what , it really was .
Apple supports forums are starting to collectreports of wee bubbles appearing underneath the glass layer of the iPhone screen , ruining its aura of perfection .
Defects seem to be clustered in handsets from early production batches , and Apple is reportedly being quite decent about dealing with the bubbles as a warranty - covered defect .
Says " levbian "
i had the same issue .
waited in line for 17 hours to get an iphone and had 2 little tiny bubbles under the screen .
after 8 months i decided i was sick of the bubbles ... so i went to the apple store and no questions asked got it replaced .
i could n't get an explanation for the bubbles , but i got a brand new phone ( straight from the packaging with 1.1.3 pre-installed ) .

I am surprised at how many people complain about IO responsiveness while multitasking , but have never heard of ionice ( 1 ) .
Most intermediate - level Linux users have heard of , or know how to use , the nice command .
Well , ionice is like nice for the disk ( nice on most Linux kernels only affects the CPU scheduler .
So , a large copy operation with the maximum niceness can still ruin disk response times to a process on highest priority . )
The best usecase for using ionice to improve performance is when you need to do two classes of tasks at once :
The ones that do n’t use much disk IO but demand fast response , and the ones that do a LOT of disk IO but do n’t need it done urgently .
For example , think of some of the time - consuming things you want to do in the background , like :
Downloading a torrent on a fast internet link that creates a great deal of disk seeking .
Copy a huge file between two locations
Perform a system backup
Install your latest set up system updates
Most of the time , you really do n’t care how fast ( within reason ) these tasks take , as long as your desktop applications do n’t lag like hell !
This is where ionice comes to the rescue .
You can , in effect , tell Linux to only give disk access to these programs when nothing else wants it .
The command for doing this is sudo ionice - c3 - ppid , where pid is the numeric Process ID of the task you want to reschedule .
You can find this number by looking at your GNOME or KDE process list viewer ( also called System Monitor ) , or via top , ps - aux , and other command line tools .
The - c3 part places the process in the idle scheduling class .
You can read the ionice ( 1 ) man page for more cool things you can do with ionice .
Now , one trick you might find handy is rescheduling an entire parent shell to idle class , so that all commands executed from that shell are idle priority .
You can get this from the $ $ shell variable in bash and sh .
For example :
jdong@severance :~$ echo $ $
29033
This output means that my current bash shell is process id 29033 .
If I want to switch the whole shell to idle disk priority , I would run :
jdong@severance :~$ sudo ionice - c3 - p $ $
And there we go !
Everything I do in this shell is now idle priority .
Let ’s apply this trick to other case .
Ubuntu and other distributions like to run disk - intensive scripts like updatedb every night at midnight .
If you ’re a night owl like me and use your computer at these hours , this can be terribly irritating .
Well , ionice to the rescue !
Open up /etc / cron.daily / slocate , and add the following bolded line :
—
#! /bin/sh
ionice - c3 - p $ $
if [ -x /usr / bin/ slocate ]
—
And now , updatedb will no longer lag your productive midnight computing activities !
Now of course , there are a couple gotchas with ionice :
It only works on kernels 2.6.13 and later using the CFQ IO scheduler .
Kernels 2.6.17 ( Ubuntu Edgy ) and later , plus most versions of Redhat / Fedora - based distributions , will use the CFQ IO scheduler by default .
You can check what scheduler is running by running cat / sys / block / [ sh ] d [ a - z ] * / queue / scheduler .
The word outlined in [ brackets ] is currently selected .
Use the boot parameter elevator=cfq in grub / menu.lst to set cfq as default .
Idle priority is VERY cautious about marking block devices idle .
If your foreground tasks are using disk , then your background tasks will become noticeably slower , as they get blocked from touching the disks until Linux knows for sure your foreground tasks have all had a chance at the disk .
Most of the times , you do n’t care about this anyway , but do n’t run a torrent in non-idle class and expect a 20 GB copy to finish till the torrent ’s done !
Please be careful fooling around with other ionice options , particularly the realtime class .
You can easily set a process to receive the disk ’s full attention and freeze your system .
I ’m not responsible for any hard reboots you have due to this .
Some filesystems , particularly reiserfs and XFS , are very unfriendly at hogging the disk while performing metadata operations ( such as creating or deleting files ) .
Even ionice may not save you from noticeable disk IO lag during heavy metadata activities .

Adm Fallon became head of US Central Command in March 2007
Admiral Fallon
He cited the " embarrassing situation and public perception of differences between my views and administration policy " as the reason for retiring .
An article by Esquire magazine said he was opposed to the use of force against Iran over its nuclear activities .
Adm Fallon said he did not believe there were differences over policy objectives .
The 63 - year - old admiral became head of the US Central Command - which covers an area from the Horn of Africa into central Asia and includes responsibility for US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan - a year ago .
' No policy differences '
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said the decision to take early retirement was entirely Adm Fallon 's , adding that he agreed it was the right thing to do .
" I have approved Admiral Fallon 's request to retire with reluctance and regret , " he told reporters at the Pentagon .
He said the admiral would be sorely missed .
I do n't believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the Central Command
Adm William Fallon
Demise of an outspoken man Profile : William Fallon
President George W Bush said Adm Fallon deserved " considerable credit for progress that has been made ... in Iraq and Afghanistan " .
The Esquire article suggested Adm Fallon was standing up to a president supposedly contemplating war with Iran .
He is described in the article as " the strongest man standing between the Bush Administration and a war with Iran " .
Mr Gates said the idea , suggested in the article , that Adm Fallon 's departure indicated that the US was planning to go to war with Iran was " ridiculous " .
He said " there is a misperception " that the admiral disagreed with the Bush administration 's policies towards Iran .
" I do n't think there were differences at all , " Mr Gates said .
A statement released by Adm Fallon through Central Command 's Florida headquarters seemed to reflect those sentiments .
" I do n't believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the Central Command , " he said .
" The simple perception that there is makes it difficult for me to effectively serve America 's interests there . "
' No war '
But Adm Fallon 's resignation is richly suggestive of discord at the top between the military and the White House , says the BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington .
Adm Fallon oversaw US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan
Adm Fallon 's comments , such as those to al Jazeera TV last year that " I expect there will be no war " , incurred the wrath of the Bush administration , says our correspondent .
Correspondents say the resignation comes at a time when the US administration seems to be struggling on a number of fronts to maintain the international pressure on Iran , not least with the recent US National Intelligence Estimate that suggested Iran had had a nuclear weapons programme but halted it in 2003 .
The Bush administration 's official policy towards Iran is to use diplomatic and economic pressures to resolve differences while retaining the possibility of military options .
The US and other Western nations suspect Iran is using its nuclear programme to develop atomic weapons - a charge Tehran denies .
Credit Crunch Fallout Germans Fear Meltdown of Financial System
Germany and other industrialized nations are desperately trying to brace themselves against the threat of a collapse of the global financial system .
The crisis has now taken its toll on the German economy , where the weak dollar is putting jobs in jeopardy and the credit crunch is paralyzing many businesses .

For a while now , PBS 's Robert X. Cringely has been grappling with net neutrality issues in a series of articles at PBS .
His latest article , which a number of readers have emailed me about , proposes a novel idea for solving the net neutrality issue altogether : co-operatively owned last - mile fiber .
The basic suggestion is that neighborhoods and homeowner associations could take out a loan to cover the costs of laying fiber to every home in the neighborhood .
The numbers work out to be much cheaper than the current going rate for either cable or DSL .
Futhermore , not only would you get access to a huge pipe , but nobody could tell you what to do with the bits that were moving over it .
If you want to run a server , run a server .
If you want to use Bittorrent , use Bittorrent .
I think the idea is fantastic , mainly because it approximates what the South Korean government is already doing for its citizens .
Of course , in America you could never do on a national scale what the South Koreans have done .
It would be politically impossible .
Not only would the telcos pull out all the stops to oppose a nationwide , publicly funded broadband rollout , but Big Content would fight it tooth and nail , as well .
( I 'm sure the *AA would be appalled at the thought of all those fat , fat fiber pipes , with all that digital media just streaming over them from house to house .
Static IPs might make lawsuits easier , though . )
At any rate , there are a few problems with this idea that should be pointed out .
The most obvious one is maintenance .
When your Internet connection goes out , there 's no Comcast guy that can drop by and maybe nap on your couch for a bit .
This is n't that big of a deal , though , because I 'm sure that an industry of private contractors would emerge to handle this sort of thing .
The bigger limitation of Cringley 's plan is that it does n't offer much to transient populations , like renters in urban areas .
Furthermore , African Americans , who as a population have a significantly lower rate of home ownership than whites , would see the emergence of a " bandwidth gap " to go with the home ownership and the wage gaps .
None of the problems pointed out above should put anyone off the idea of co-operatively owned last mile infrastructure , though .
Cringely 's idea ( or rather , Bob Frankston 's idea , which Cringely relates ) should be viewed not as a silver bullet but as one solution to the last mile problem among many .
I think it 's likely that some form of wireless , like ultrawideband ( UWB ) mesh networks , will turn out to be the ideal last mile solution for urban areas — especially for renter populations .
UWB 's combination of high bandwidth , low power , non-interference , and ability to pass through walls easily makes it perfectly suited to densely populated urban areas .
And unlike fiber , the renter 's UWB hardware can move with him .
Nate moves to L.A. to track down Cristabel , the woman he 's been in love with since childhood , only to discover that his plan to woo her only has one hurdle to overcome : what to do with June , Cristabel 's ever - present , not - so - hot best friend ?
What 's even more complicating is Nate 's growing feelings for June , whose true beauty starts to emerge .

Chicago
David 's story begins in Chicago , in more ways than one .
Chicago used to have a considerable meatpacking industry , but the meatpacking industry wised up and moved their operation to rural areas .
The move essentially symbolized that industry 's version of what McDonald 's did to restaurants .
No longer requiring skilled , union labor , now the plants can bring the poor into the tiny towns where they operate and quietly exploit them .
Columbus Junction , IA ( population 1845 ) is one such town .
Before his brief career in meatpacking , David lived in Chicago .
He told me the best job he could find was $ 7.50 / hr and the work was not available daily .
Each day a temp agency would tell him there was lots of work available tomorrow , so he would wake up for work at 4 am .
So would everyone else who needed a job .
David realized he was getting screwed .
Then David met a recruiter for the Tyson hog plant he eventually went to work for .
" They sell you a nice dream , " he said .
For example , you do n't have to work on your birthday and you 'll be paid anyway .
Or you can work that day for double pay .
This and other benefits start once you are " qualified , " i.e. pass a 90 - day probationary period .
David was fired on day 92 .
Compared to his $ 7.50 / hr unreliable jobs in Chicago , the $ 11/ hr ( and up ) job with Tyson sounded fantastic .
David took the job , and the company transported him to Columbus Junction to report to work .
Working at Tyson
David told me the plant slaughtered 2000 hogs per shift , or 2 million per year .
The stink of the plant was unbearable .
David told me it gets into your pores .
The floors were slick with blood , grease , and fat , and the plant was full of sharp knives .
For work , each employee had to buy quite a bit of safety equipment .
The only item provided by Tyson was a " froc " - a white coat .
David 's job was working with ham - cutting it , removing the bone , packaging it up , and weighing it .
A slow line required workers to handle one ham every 15 seconds ; a fast line one every 11 seconds .
" By the time you touch a ham , you need to let it go , " David said , " but you should 've done everything required first . "
David told me the plant throws nothing away .
Blood , meat that falls on the floor , everything goes somewhere to make a profit .
If you drop something on the floor , they tell you to wash it off and put it back on the line .
David was fascinated with the fact that they sell hog rectums .
Believe it or not , the Chinese will eat them .
David also observed that many of the hogs slaughtered are pregnant with piglets .
He does n't know what happens to the piglets , but he knows that nothing goes to waste in the plant .
During each shift , workers received 15 minute breaks , which were timed with stopwatches .
Unfortunately , their safety equipment took about 5 minutes to take off or put on .
Despite the slick floors and abundance of knives , workers ran at break time , knowing if they did n't that they would n't have any break at all .
Bathroom Breaks
Since Tyson obviously is n't too big on allowing employees any break time , they do n't take pleasure in allowing them to use the restroom either .
David suffers from a urinary tract problem so ( as he put it ) when he has to go , he has to go .
The first two times David requested to use the restroom , his supervisors told him to hold it .
David tried to comply but his bladder was unwilling .
While working on his line , he urinated on himself - twice .
Each time , 4 or 5 supervisors surrounded him , looking for evidence of alcohol or drug use .
They found neither .
He had told his supervisors about his urinary tract problem , they did n't believe him .
You'd think they would have figured out he was telling the truth after he proved it once , but they did n't .
After the second time , they let him go when he needed to .
Race , Sex , Favoritism , and Money
The plant included some blacks , but the workers were mostly Mexican .
David estimated there were about 3 % whites , typically in the senior administrative positions .
He felt his demeanor as an inner city black played some role in his firing , as the rural whites were n't used to people like him , but he saw much more injustice on the basis of sex .
At the Tyson plant , women were assigned easier work than men .
David 's work was extremely difficult as it involved lifting heavy boxes .
After he was injured and assigned to light detail , even then the women got easier work .
He was told to pair gloves together for employees who needed them .
He told me of a girl nearby just standing around doing nothing who could n't be bothered to help .
One 's salary was determined by hard hat color .
Each person began with a light blue hat and $ 11/ hr .
The next color up was white - and $ 11.60 / hr .
David earned his white hat but continued to receive $ 11 / hr because he had not worked for 90 days yet .
All around him , other people did easier work for $ 11.60 / hr or even $ 12.35 / hr .
David told me that he learned about favoritism as he worked there .
Employees who lose their equipment must pay for new ones .
$.25 per hairnet , $.25 per scrubber .
The people who distribute this equipment provide it to their friends for free .
Injuries
Most employees were injured in one way or another , David told me .
As they stood around repeating the same motions all day , they developed neck pain , tendinitis , and other injuries .
The medical supplies provided for such problems were meager - tape , alcohol , muscle rub , and Tylenol .
Many employees should be on light detail but they are not .
David suffered from tendinitis in his right hand during his time there .
He told me it lasted for 3 or 4 weeks , during which time he was not able to make a fist .
The supervisors encourage workers to work with both hands , but David told me many can only use one hand because the other one is injured .
Injuries can also come from knives .
David described knives sharper than any I have ever experienced .
" They cut through ham like butter , better than butter , " he said .
One worker noticed that his mom's kitchen knife was dull so he brought home in sharpener from the plant and sharpened it for her .
That was a mistake : she cut herself while trying to wash it .
Another anecdote he heard was that a knife fell and hit a guy 's foot .
It went right through the shoe and the foot .
David's Injury
On December 3 , David broke his ankle while riding his bike to work .
He crossed onto company property and noticed that the ground was icy .
The company had neither shoveled the snow or salted the roads .
David fell and heard a snap .
He hobbled into the medical office , where he waited for over FOUR HOURS to receive medical attention .
During that time , he took ( and passed ) a Breathalyzer and a drug test .
Then a supervisor asked him for a written statement of how he was injured .
No sooner than he had provided it , a second supervisor asked him for the same thing .
He said he did it already but the supervisor insisted .
He wrote the same statement , word for word .
Another person came in , asking if he was really , actually on company property when he fell .
The person was about to review security tapes , to see if David was telling the truth .
David , who was in pain this whole time , figures it would have been far more efficient to just give him a polygraph test in the first place .
He 's an honest man and he was telling the truth .
Why should he suffer four hours of intimidation before anyone gives him medical care ?
Obviously Tyson did not want to pay worker 's comp .
As it happens , even though David WAS telling the truth , they did NOT pay worker 's comp .
Now David has a lawyer who is trying to help him with that .
After the injury , Tyson put him on light detail .
Then they fired him .
The injury was December 3 and I spoke to David on February 16 .
His ankle still hurts .
He figures it should have healed by now , but he 's talked to people who had similar injuries years ago and they told him their ankles still hurt at times .
He 's got a follow - up doctor 's appointment on February 27 and he 's hoping that his injury does not cause pain for the rest of his life .
I 'm impressed by David and grateful to him for his courage in telling his story .
He wants people to know how he was mistreated .
He wants them to know what goes on .
Tyson relies on workers being ignorant and helpless but David is obviously neither .
He put two and two together and he knows darn well that a company as profitable and large as Tyson could afford to treat its workers humanely .
You Call This America ?
This is the part of the diary where I go on an angry rant .
What the hell does Tyson think its doing , and what the hell is wrong with the supervisors who comply with practices that force a grown man to urinate on himself ?
Why do we let them get away with it ?
And they do n't just get away with it - they profit !
The injustices David described to me make me furious .
They make me furious , and they also make me frustrated .
Why ?
Well , let me tell you .
I grew up maybe 50 miles from where David lived in Chicago .
I was lucky .
I was born to upper middle class parents in an upper middle class suburb .
My upper middle class suburb had excellent public schools , which enabled me to get a scholarship to a private university .
At the end of my four years of college , a software company recruited me , then trained me as a software analyst .
It 's true I had a rough year in there - I suffered abuse at work and severe health problems - but I picked myself up and moved on .
With my software skills , I 'm set for life .
Even in this economy , jobs are numerous and easy to come by .
Health care is included .
How the hell is that fair to David ?
That I won some cosmic lottery and he lost .
While talking to him , I wanted to help .
I wished I had some good advice to give .
I remembered that Loyola 's medical center in Chicago has an outstanding urology department .
They could probably help him !
But that takes health insurance .
What about a job at Whole Foods ?
I worked there when I had nothing else .
The minimum pay is $ 10 / hour , an 8 hour shift comes with 2 15 - minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch , and all of your safety equipment ( including non-slip shoes ) are provided .
The shoes are yours to keep .
Free shoes !
But how the hell do you get a job at Whole Foods if you are stuck in Columbus Junction , Iowa ?
Or inner city Chicago ?
This is supposed to be the land of opportunity , in which any person , regardless of their status at birth , can work their way up in society .
Without health care for all , that idea seems little more than a sick joke .
And do n't even get me started on the way we fund public schools .
The very fact that Tyson has gotten away with this behavior up until now ( and will most likely continue to get away with it ) shows even more flaws in our system .
Where was OSHA ?
Why should Tyson be allowed to run their lines so fast and allowed to maintain conditions in which most workers are injured from their jobs ?
Why can they keep a man in pain for four hours before he receives medical care ?
Why ?
David 's story is NOT unique to Tyson .
The sad , simple truth is if you are eating meat and you do not specifically know exactly where it came from , chances are that many human beings were exploited to produce it .
I would never advocate vegetarianism as a one - size - fits - all solution to this problem .
If you can afford it , you 'll find that humane , sustainable options are out there .
Try http://www.eatwellguide.org to find some near you .
If this is n't feasible for you , consider giving up meat for one meal a day or one day a week .
Any reduction in the profits these criminals receive on our behalf is a good start .
2 UDATES :
First , a comment by Oke :
Marshalltown , Iowa is another meatpacking hell .
I had to work there in desperation to keep a roof over my daughters heads some years ago .
The working conditions he describes are true .
They do take money out of your checks for any bit of equipment that is required .
These factories also get a good chunk of your check if you can't survive long shifts without eating or drinking .
If you request a stand in to use the bathroom it is tracked how many times you ask , how long you take , etc .
I am thrilled that this whitewashed form of indentured servitude is being brought to light in some form .
Rest assured the states that are home to these corps .
are n't going to step on their toes and enforce enforce Labor Laws .
These companies politically blackmail with the threat of pulling out and steering other corps away from that state on their way out .
Second , I received an email from One Brave Kossack ( who is now friends with David ) :
Thanks for the doing the interview and diary with David .
It looks like he is getting a part time job through Goodwill as a supervisor - $ 10.88 to $ 12.35 an hour and they 'll work around his ankle .
I 'm leaving town and that kind of cuts him off phone wise - I 'd say the next big thing to getting him back to independence would be if we can scare up $ 100 or so among those reading this diary and get him a TracFone so he can call wife & kids , work , etc .
I 'm leaving Iowa City in an hour or two so this would have to happen pretty quickly ...
If you 'd like to help out on that front , I think we can probably use the Recipe for America paypal account for this .
It 's here ( scroll down a bit ) .
Flash storage is one of the main components that makes low power electronics so flexible .
Unlike common DRAM , which needs constant refreshing in order to retain its contents , flash memory will stay written for about 10 years without power .
However , flash pays for that longevity in access times , which are much slower than those for DRAM .
The perfect memory would be nonvolatile like flash yet provide access faster than the current generation of DRAM .
Quantum dots , with their nicely tunable electronic properties , look like they may fit the bill .
Researchers in Germany have been exploring the suitability of self - assembled arrays of quantum dots for nonvolatile storage .
A quantum dot is a small clump of atoms that is confined in a way that restricts the motion of the electrons , making the whole thing act like a single atom .
The properties of the dot can be modified by changing the size of the clump or the constituent atoms .
In the quantum dot - based storage array , the researchers have been looking at the constituent atoms , trying out silicon and germanium , and more complicated mixtures of gallium , indium , arsenide , aluminum , and antimony ( for those of you keeping count , these are III - V materials ) .
Experimentally , they have found that quantum dots can have access times of around 10ns , faster than the current generation of RAM , and they require a refresh rate as low as 0.7 Hz .
Further calculations show that more suitable combinations would result in a storage time of one million years while maintaining the same access time .
Quantum dots can do this because there is more design freedom in setting them up .
Normal flash memory relies on the huge potential barrier created by a silicon oxide layer .
The probability of an electron tunneling across the barrier is so low that the data will stay there for 10 years .
However , to get electrons across that barrier when writing data to a flash cell requires a lot of energy , energy that destroys the silicon oxide layer .
This is why flash memory has a limited number of write cycles in it .
Quantum dots , in contrast , have tunable properties , so the barrier can be kept low .
In the current work , the barrier was four times lower than that of silicon dioxide .
Additionally , the data can be stored as an absence of electrons , called holes .
These holes behave exactly like positively charged electrons , except that they are heavier .
The confinement of the quantum dot makes them even heavier than normal , which reduces the chances of them tunneling out of the quantum dot .
The result is a very low refresh rate .
Based on the known properties of the materials used and the behavior of quantum dots , the researchers predict that they will be able to make quantum dots that can store data for one million years with an access time of 10ns .
If they can make these in volume and at the same data density as standard flash modules , you can say goodbye to hard drives , flash , and RAM .
Personally , I wo n't miss any of them .

When a schizophrenic woman arrived at the
University of Tennessee Health Science Center , she was nauseous , terribly weak , and confused .
Several doctors tended to her and performed lab tests .
Their patient was severely anemic and suffering from kidney failure .
One of her family members said that she had swallowed some coins .
The physicians examined an X - ray image of the frail woman 's abdomen and found a clump of pennies in her intestine .
To help it come out , they gave her some laxatives .
Later , it became clear that the bunch of coins was still stuck , so the doctors used an endoscope to peer into her digestive tract .
The corroded cluster of coins was stuck in her stomach – not her colon .
It was heavy enough to make the digestive organ sag deep into her abdomen , which made it look like the money was in her intestine .
They had to operate .
When the surgery was over , the medical team had found five hundred and eighty - five pennies , seventeen nickels , twelve dimes , eight quarters , one Deutsche mark , three screws , and a rock .
In a report to the Journal of Emergency Medicine , which is already available online , Saurabh Dhawan , Katherine Ryder , and Elizabeth Pritchard explained that the unfortunate woman had suffered from zinc poisoning .
Pennies are coated in copper , but their insides are made from the toxic heavy metal .
Stomach acid had dissolved the shiny surfaces and exposed their cores .
Once the metal was free to react with the gastric juice , it became zinc chloride , which passed through the lining of her intestine and played havoc with her liver , kidneys , pancreas , red blood cells , and bone marrow .
The Securities and Exchange Commission sent out a Letter On Fair Value Measurements , ( Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 ) that is tantamount to being an open invitation to lie .
Let 's take a look at what some are saying about that letter .
Floyd Norris at the New York Times writes If Market Prices Are Too Low , Ignore Them .
The Securities and Exchange Commission is out today with a letter to companies that own a lot of financial instruments whose current market value must be reported to shareholders .
For more than a few companies , disclosing market values is neither easy nor convenient .
The issue is the application of SFAS 157 , which governs the way companies compute fair value of assets .
The rule sets out three categories of assets , with different ways to value them .
Category 1 includes assets with easily observable market values .
I.B.M. stock closed today at $ 114.57 , and it is not easy to justify a different value if your quarter ended today .
Category 2 is a little fuzzier , where there are observable markets that provide a good guide to prices of your asset , even though there is no direct market .
And then there is Category 3 , which is essentially mark to model .
But one part of the letter stood out to me , providing an excuse for companies to ignore a market value if they do n’t like it ( italics added ) :
“ Under SFAS 157 , it is appropriate for you to consider actual market prices , or observable inputs , even when the market is less liquid than historical market volumes , unless those prices are the result of a forced liquidation or distress sale .
Only when actual market prices , or relevant observable inputs , are not available is it appropriate for you to use unobservable inputs which reflect your assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability . ”
That sounds to me like an invitation to fudge .
Some people on Wall Street think that nearly every sale today is a forced sale .
There are entire categories of collateralized debt obligations where most , if not all , of the trades , occur because a holder has received , or expects , a margin call .
In the last couple of months , there has been increased worry that mark - to - market accounting leads to the operation of a destructive " financial accelerator . "
As prevailing values go down , banks have to lower the value of their holdings .
This leads to a direct hit to their net worth , which will lead them to contract their balance sheets , either by withholding credit or selling assets .
More sales in a weak market lead to further declines in the prices of financial instruments , leading to more writedowns and sales of inventory .
Funny how no one had a problem with mark - to - market when asset prices were rising .
But now the SEC has given banks and brokers a huge out .
No matter how small or easily absorbed by the market a forced sale might be ( think of a hedge fund hit by a margin call ) , a financial institution can ignore the price realized .
In fact , they get to determine what trades constitute a forced sale .
Moreover , we 've seen plenty of unintended consequences , or worse , backfires , as regulators intervene trying to alleviate the credit crisis .
Banks have been reluctant to extend credit to each other precisely because they do n't trust their creditworthiness .
That 's tantamount to saying they already do n't trust their public financial statements , since according to their public filings , virtually all major financial institutions have more than the required statutory capital .
So this move , to stem the balance - sheet - shrinking impact of mark - to - market accounting in a falling price environment , may further undermine liquidity .
Companies will less able to judge whether their published financials are telling the whole story , And where the numbers are in doubt , rumors are taken more seriously .
To paraphrase Winston Churchill , it has been said that mark to market accounting is the worst form of financial accounting except for all the others that have been tried .
But it looks like we are going to try them anyhow .

Howto boot Quantian without a cdrom via grub or lilo
This HOWTO was contributed by Marco Caliari , who also created the miniroot files described here .
Thanks , Marco !
The following procedure is useful for testing .iso images , as well as for installations where use of a cdrom ( or dvd ) may not be practical , possible or efficient .
This procedire also provides a clever way to add the rich set of application Quantian provides in a small space as it requires only slightly more diskspace that the compressed .iso image itself .
It can be extended easily to allow a menu - driven selection between several iso files , which could even come from different Knoppix variants .

President Bush has been doing his best to remind the American people that he 's still around , and what better way to do that than to throw a few hissy fits ?
As Keith Olbermann says on today 's Countdown , from the tone of Bush 's voice , it sounds like he 's just given up .
The president is once again chiding House Democrats for drafting new FISA legislation that does not include amnesty for telecommunications companies who illegally spied on Americans , calling those companies - " patriotic . "
Right .
Rachel Maddow joined Keith and as always , her analysis is spot on .
She points out that President Bush was willing to veto the safety of the American people all in the name of protecting corporations and himself from prosecution .
They also touch on the " resignation " of Admiral Fallon and how it was obviously a shot across the bow of anyone in the Pentagon who wants to be a real patriot and save the country from launching another unprovoked war against a sovereign nation .
Credit Card or Bank Transaction : Somebody Watches
Think twice before you swipe that card , because everything is being tracked .
March 14 , 2008  --
Every time you swipe your credit card , take cash out of an ATM or transfer money into your bank account , a sophisticated network of computers is keeping track .
The fraud detection systems — which security experts say vary widely — want to know :
Are you trying to launder money or has somebody stolen your credit card or ATM card and making purchases ?
Some data is kept by the banks and credit card companies and other information is passed on to the federal government .
" People are n't really aware of the fact that transactions that they make with financial institutions are being monitored , " said Paul Stephens , director of policy and advocacy form the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse .
" Hundreds of thousands of innocent people are having their everyday banking transactions forwarded to the federal government . "
Eliot Spitzer , who will step down as New York 's governor on Monday , learned that lesson the hard way .
The former prosecutor was allegedly making wire transactions to a shell corporation that was a front for a high - end call girl service .
His bank apparently found the transactions suspicious and notified federal authorities , starting the investigation .
Since April 1996 , banks , casino and other institutions that handle large amounts of cash have been requested to file reports to the government any time they notice a transaction that does n't seem right .
These Suspicious Activity Reports , or SARs , go to a unit of the Treasury Department , known as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network .
In 2006 , 1.08 million such reports were filed , up from 920,000 the year before and 690,000 in 2004 , according to a report from the Treasury Department .
Stephens is concerned because banks can essentially report whatever they want to the federal government .
" The banks are given a great amount of leeway in making a determination as to what constitutes ' suspicious , ' " Stephens said .
But these reports are just one small part of the mountain of financial data collected on Americans each day .
Avivah Litan , a fraud detection analyst with Gartner , which is a technology consulting and services firm , noted that the reports are just what is required by law .
" Some banks go well beyond that because they are worried about fraud , " Litan said .
" Not all of them do .
But some of them do .
It really ranges . "
She noted that there was a large spike in these reports after 9/11 and that subsequent legislation required more reporting .
There is also an additional level of scrutiny given to so - called politically exposed persons , who are defined as current or former foreign political figures , their family and associates .
" Those are usually foreign dictators , " Litan said , " not New York Democrats "
But sometimes banks choose to give extra scrutiny to American political figures .
Some banks have better systems because they have been hurt by fraud .
For instance , Litan said , Bank of America has a sophisticated fraud prevention system just because of its size and therefore likelihood to be a target .
Citibank , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have also all spent a lot of time on money laundering and fraud , she said .
But what about other transactions , say that $ 30 meal placed on your credit card or the $ 200 taken out of the local ATM ?
Those are tracked more than any other kind of transaction .
The reason ?
The banks have the most to lose .
" They have poured a lot of money into credit card fraud detection because fraud was so rampant back in the 80s , " Litan said .
" It was 10 to 15 times higher than it is now .
The banks ate that fraud .
So the only way they could afford to push out new cards was if they had better credit card detection systems . "
It 's a different story from the banking world where most of the systems there are set up to go after money laundering .
The banks do n't have their assets directly on the line .
With credit cards , Litan said , the systems set up a profile of each customer 's spending habits .
If you divert from that , an alert is then sent out .
If thieves steal a group of credit card numbers off a database somewhere and make fake copies , one of the first places they test them is at a gas station , Litan said .
Once the card works , they will immediately go and make a big purchase elsewhere .
So the computers automatically raise a question if a $ 10 gas station purchase is immediately followed by $ 20,000 at a jewelry store .
Other common alerts include somebody who has only used a credit card in Iowa for 15 years and now is using it in Ukraine , or somebody who has transactions in California and New York seconds apart .
" The technology is never the issue , " Litan said .
" There are lots of technologies to track every single thing everyone 's doing .
But most banks have n't spent the money on it . "

Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani discussed his philosophy of what freedom means in a democracy yesterday at a forum on urban crime , and his remarks left a civil libertarian puzzled and worried .
The Mayor , a former United States Attorney in Manhattan , said New Yorkers were inclined to " see only the oppressive side of authority . "
" What we do n't see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want , be anything they can be , " he said at the forum , sponsored by The New York Post .
" Freedom is about authority .
Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do . "
Asked later about his remarks , Mr. Giuliani said governmental authorities in American society had fallen into disrepute in the last 30 years .
He said anarchy would result if everyone were allowed to behave exactly as he wanted and cited Oliver Wendell Holmes 's adage that freedom of expression does not include shouting ' Fire ! ' in a crowded theater .
When Max Gogarty , a 19 - year - old gap - year student , landed a coveted blogging spot on which to chronicle his two - month backpacking adventure around India and Thailand , he could have never predicted how his moment of triumph would backfire so spectacularly .
But within 24 hours of his first posting on the theguardian.com travel pages , the teenager was swamped by a tidal wave of internet hate mail as he became a victim of the phenomenon of ' going viral ' .
As the north London teenager was touching down in Mumbai , hundreds of comments - many vitriolic - were appearing not only on his blog , but on scores of message boards and social networking forums , including Facebook and high - profile gossip sites such as Holy Moly .
The astonishing reaction was provoked when surfers spotted that he had the same surname as Paul Gogarty , a travel writer who occasionally contributes to the Guardian .
Readers presumed he was a privileged public school boy whose father had secured him the blog spot and whose gap - year travels were being funded by the newspaper .
The resulting ' cyber - bullying ' has now forced Max , an occasional scriptwriter for the E4 teenage drama series Skins , to ditch his weekly blog while he and his family cope with the consequences of global internet exposure .
Max , who introduced himself as living ' on top of a hill in north London ... spending any sort of money I earn on food and skinny jeans ' , was last night alone in India at the beginning of his trip , while his father accused his detractors of class hatred and envy .
' It 's the conformity of the comments , the cruelty , the smug self - righteousness and envy .
It 's all so bitter and full of bile .
The exposure is terrifying , ' said Gogarty Snr . ' He 's out in India on his own .
We were all feeling upset at him going away anyway .
But this ... this tsunami of hate .
We just can not believe it .
Max is a talented and hard - working boy .
He is what he is - a middle - class kid who goes to a comprehensive and managed to get four As and is supporting himself by working in a cafe . '
He said his son was invited on to a young writers ' group at London 's Royal Court Theatre , and from there he began writing for Skins before being offered the travel blog .
' There is no nepotism .
I hardly ever write for the Guardian , ' said Gogarty .
' He is not an attention seeker .
He is just bright and 19 and middle - class - and that 's a crime in Britain . '
Max 's debut blog on Thursday , an innocuous , possibly gauche , account of his preparations for his trip , attracted so many comments that other websites soon seized on the debate .
He now appears on Wikipedia under the section on ' nepotism ' , alongside Kim Jong-il of North Korea and George W Bush .
Eventually Gogarty felt compelled to weigh in himself , posting : ' Max wo n't be writing any more blogs , I thought I 'd bring all those heroic internet warriors the good news .
Max 's trip ( which he paid for himself I 'm afraid - sorry ) has got off to the worst possible start and he 's feeling pretty grim
You may like or dislike the blog , but the cruelty is shocking , if quintessentially British . '
The blog attracted almost 500 comments on theguardian.com before it was closed .
The director of digital content , Emily Bell , said the mood had changed after the intervention of Max 's father and the comments had become more critical of the website and its editors ' decision to commission and publish the blog : ' They were much happier to give us a kicking instead of him . '
She added that ' going viral ' happened reasonably regularly , but was unpredictable .
Other recent examples included the DJ Mike Read 's blog supporting Boris Johnson for mayor of London , which had a record 1,132 comments .
An intimate email , allegedly sent by Claire Swire to her boyfriend Bradley Chait in which she is said to have referred to a sex act , also went round the world .
Of the comments on Max 's blog , Bell said : ' A lot of this is quite funny , but not for Max .
As publisher , we have a duty of care to him . '
In her own online blog , Bell wrote : ' We 're used to it , but it is still an absurdly awful experience for the individual on the end of the monstering , particularly if you are a relative novice . '
She added : ' Perhaps an open blog post was not the best place to publish it . '
Some contributors were uneasy over the tone of many comments .
One wrote : ' The amount of hate , envy and hypocrisy that 's been on display here is shocking . '
But others compared Max to Nathan Barley , a loathsome fictional twentysomething London media type in the Channel 4 sitcom of the same name .
One asked , ' Whose son is Max then ? ' , while another predicted , ' Oh , Christ .
This guy 's going to get an absolute hammering . '
Yet another added : ' Do n't show Derek Conway this - he 'll be most upset . '
Still others urged him to continue the blog and answer the critics , but his father said : ' We just want him to be left alone .
It 's scary and the exposure is so horrible .
He 's a strong kid and I think he is moving on .
Max himself made the decision to pull it and I think it is a mature decision .
' People have said " stay and fight " .
But there is no way - whatever he writes next week , it would be pilloried .
It 's a no -win situation .
He has seen some of the blog .
He has said to me that he does n't like the media world now .
He does n't want to go into it any more . '
Reasonable or snake oil remedy ?
Supreme Court seems to think former for Indiana Voter ID law David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday January 9 , 2008

Print This Email This Court seems to back Indiana voter ID law A suit challenging an Indiana law that requires voters to present a photo ID at the polls was heard today by the Supreme Court .
The law , which was passed by Indiana Republicans in 2005 on a party - line vote , has been criticized by Democrats as likely to disenfranchise elderly , poor , and minority voters , who are most likely to have trouble obtaining the necessary documentation .
Attorney Paul Smith , who represents the challengers , told the Associated Press that if this sort of fraud were actually occurring to any significant degree , we would be hearing stories about it .
The fact that there are no reports of hundreds of dead people voting every year suggests it is n't a problem .
" It 's a totally inefficient way to actually affect an election , " Smith said , explaining that if you 're serious about committing election fraud , " you want to be on the inside , or you want to have access to the voting machines . "
Indiana Solicitor General Thomas
Fisher told AP that there have , in fact , been several prosecutions for voter fraud in one Indiana county , and that " when citizens see that kind of fraud , they assume it happens all over . "
He called the use of ID cards " a reasonable security measure ... to protect the right to vote . "
However , Talking Points Memo reports that , when interviewed on television , Indiana 's Secretary of State was unable to come up with even one case of a prosecution in the state for voter impersonation .
Court seems to back Indiana voter ID law The Supreme Court appeared ready Wednesday to uphold the nation 's strictest requirement that voters show photo identification before casting a ballot .
The justices are faced with a partisan dispute that echoes the bitterly divided decision that sealed the 2000 presidential election for George W. Bush .
Now , as then , the court seemed divided along ideological lines .
Wednesday 's arguments were over a challenge to an Indiana law , passed in 2005 , that is backed by Republicans as a prudent way to deter voter fraud .
Democrats and civil rights groups oppose the law as unconstitutional and call it a thinly veiled effort to discourage elderly , poor and minority voters  those most likely to lack proper ID and who tend to vote for Democrats .
But Justice Anthony Kennedy , often a key vote on the court , did not sound persuaded that the challengers had made their case .
" You want us to invalidate a statute on the ground that it 's a minor inconvenience to a small percentage of voters ? "
Kennedy said near the end of the lively session .
Kennedy did , however , voice concern over some aspects of obtaining an ID , including the difficulty the poor have in getting the birth certificates that are needed to get photo ID .
More than 20 states require some form of identification at the polls .
Courts have upheld voter ID laws in Arizona , Georgia and Michigan , but struck down Missouri's .
The Indiana case should be decided by late June , in time for the November elections .
The justices could use the case to instruct courts on how to weigh claims of voter fraud versus those of disenfranchisement .
Paul Smith , representing the challengers , told the justices that there is no evidence of in - person voter fraud in Indiana .
He said the law is a subtle way " to skew the outcome on election days . "
Indiana Solicitor General Thomas
Fisher said the vast majority of Indiana voters easily comply with the law .
" You 're talking about an infinitesimal portion of the electorate that could be burdened , " Fisher said under sharp questioning from Justice David Souter .
Justice Samuel Alito , who appeared more sympathetic to Indiana 's case , posed the question that troubled several justices .
With little evidence of fraud or of voters who have been kept from voting , Alito said , " The problem I have is , where do you draw the line ?
There is nothing to quantify the extent of the problem or the extent of the burden . "
Chief Justice John Roberts , who grew up in Indiana , and Justice Antonin Scalia indicated strong support for the state law .
Justice Clarence Thomas said nothing , but most often votes with his conservative colleagues .
When Smith said poor voters lacking ID have to visit the county courthouse within 10 days of an election and sign a sworn statement there to have their ballot counted , Roberts asked , " How far away is the furthest county seat ? ...
County seats are n't very far for people in Indiana . "
The court 's four liberal justices were more critical of the state .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg focused her questions on the difficulties for indigent voters who lack IDs .
Why , she asked , ca n't the state allow those voters to sign a sworn statement on Election Day , which would eliminate the second trip to the county courthouse ?
Told Indiana wants to avoid congestion at the polls , Ginsburg said the state wants to have it both ways because it argues relatively few people are affected by the law .
" If there are so few of them , I do n't understand why they should be put to the burden , " Ginsburg said .
Souter and Justice John Paul Stevens both pressed Fisher on the state 's problems with voter registration rolls , which Fisher acknowledged are among the nation 's worst in terms of retaining the names of the dead and those who have moved .
Indianans are not required to show photo ID to register .
" Is it the policy to have it tougher to vote than to register ? "
Stevens said .
" That does n't make sense to me . "
Justice Stephen Breyer wondered why the state does n't just give photo IDs to newly registered voters who otherwise lack them .
" That ... would satisfy your anti-fraud interest much better than the way you have chosen , " Breyer told Fisher .
The consolidated cases are Crawford v. Marion County Election Board , 07 - 21 , and Indiana Democratic Party v. Rokita , 07 - 25 .
According to Justin Levitt , a counsel in the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law , " requiring voter ID at the polls is a snake - oil remedy . "
" Snake oil is back , and gumming up our elections , " Levitt writes in an op - ed for the Daily Press .
" Like the old - timey liniments of dubious provenance , the new policies sound promising but do n't solve the problems advertised , and sometimes cause real harm . "
Excerpts from Levitt 's editorial : # For those without the right ID , it can be a burden to obtain :
It takes ID to get ID .
You have to spend time and money digging up or sending away for a birth or naturalization certificate , with an additional bureaucratic detour if you have changed your name .
Then you have to leave work and trek  without a driver 's license  to a particular office during government hours .
The older or poorer you are , the harder this may become .
As a result , eligible citizens are left out in the cold .
In one brief filed with the Supreme Court , defendant Marion County admitted that dozens of real voters , including many who had voted for years , were turned away from municipal elections held just a few weeks before , votes uncounted .
Snake - oil salesmen use familiar dodges to counter the hard data .
They recycle the canard that government - issued photo ID must be ubiquitous because it is so often required .
They claim that you must have the ID to fly , cash a check , buy cigarettes , rent a video .
Though oft - repeated , this is not true .
It is also beside the point .
Nobody ever died for the right to rent a video .
Men and women have given their lives to secure every eligible American citien 's inalienable right to vote .
Restrictive ID rules endanger that sacred trust , but for precious little reward .
The laws are advertised as common - sense cures for voter fraud .
Like Dr. Sibley 's Reanimating Solar Tincture , they do n't live up to their advertising .

( with wire reports )
Now I ’ve given the briefest of possible introduction to topology , I can get back to the issue of investigating the functions from ( ) to ( ) .
I introduced the idea of open sets as being the sets that can be observed by an idealised type of machine .
So how about turning this notion onto itself .
There are two possible outcomes from using one of our machines .
It can respond “ yes ” or fail to respond at all .
We can give these states the names ⊤ and ⊥ respectively .
So the space of possible states is the set S = {⊤ , ⊥} , with the former meaning " yes " .
Now suppose we have a machine to watch machines .
What are the possible observable subsets of S ?
Well we can easily build a machine that always responds ⊤ and we can also easily build a machine that always responds ⊥.
So {} and {⊤ , ⊥} are observable .
We can also build a machine that simply relays the state of the observed machine .
That gives us the observable set {⊤} .
But what about {⊥} ?.
Well there ’s no way we can build a machine that responds with ⊤ when it sees ⊥ and with ⊥ when it sees ⊤ .
In order to respond ⊤ when it sees ⊥ it needs no know how long to wait before giving up .
But the original definition of machine that I give says that we have no guarantee of how long a machine might take to respond .
So no such machine is possible .
In other words , the observable sets are {} , {⊤} and {{} , ⊤} , and this makes a topology on S. ( Trivial exercise : check the axioms for this topology .
) S , equipped with this topology , is known as the Sierpinski space .
There ’s an interesting way to think about this .
In Set Theory we have the notion of set membership , and membership is a binary valued thing .
So the two element set { 0,1} has a special role in that it gives a way to label the answers to the question “ is x in the set y ? : ” .
( In fact , this can be formalised nicely in category theory through the notion of a subobject classifier . )
The Sierpinski space plays a similar role for sets when you only have a one - sided membership test .
We can make this analogy precise : Given a set X then any subset , U , of X , can be written as f( { 1} ) where f is a function f:X->{0,1} .
Conversely , any such function gives rise to a subset .
Given a topological space X , then any open subset U , of X , can be written as f( {⊤} ) where f is a continuous function f:X->S. Conversely , any such function gives rise to an open subset .
Now consider the continuous functions from S to S .
As S has only two elements , there are only four possibilities to consider .
( Almost trivial exercise : find the continuous functions .
Remember , f is continuous if and only if f( U ) is open for all open U. )
It turns out there are precisely three functions .
They are essentially the same functions that I listed here for the purely lazy Haskell case .
So at least for this simple case , the computable functions are precisely the continuous ones .
And that is now my second answer to the question a month or two ago .
By assigning the correct topology to your types you can arrange that the computable functions are precisely the continuous functions .
At this point you can turn the tools of topology to computer science and you find that terms like discrete , Hausdorff and compact , which are all standard terms from topology defined inn terms of open sets , all have computational content .
And of course this machinery generalises from the simple example S to any other type .
( There is a proviso due to the fact that in topology , arbitrary unions of open sets must be open , but this does n’t carry over directly without a little bit of tweaking . )
One researcher making use of such ideas is Martin Escardo .
When I started writing these posts I was looking at a bunch of papers by Escardo that I found hard to decipher .
Since starting , however , I discovered that this document is actually a fairly easy read .
So it ’s not worth me saying much more except to tell you to read that .
And also check out the work of Paul Taylor I can now give a summary of what the last three posts have all been about :
It ’s tempting to think of functions in a programming language like Haskell as being like ordinary mathematical functions and try to embed types and Haskell functions directly into Set Theory as sets and functions .
After all , Haskell functions do n’t have side - effects and so seem to behave much like mathematical functions .
But not all functions terminate in a finite time , so they are n’t quite like ordinary functions after all .
We could think of them in terms of partial functions , but partial functions do n’t have a very rich structure and certainly do n’t automatically rule out examples like the non-continuous function from ( ) to ( ) .
But topology * does * provide a good framework .
This idea goes back a few years , to the work of people like Smyth , Plotkin and Scott .
But I ’ve been programming ( at least as a hobby ) for 30 years , and I got my PhD in Mathematics about 16 years ago , and yet I never knew that these topics were so connected .
So this work is n’t getting as much publicity as it should , even among people who know a little topology and computer science .
And I ’ll finish by mentioning an application .
An important property that topological spaces can have is known as compactness .
I can give a rough idea of what this means quite easily : consider a finite row of pigeonholes and an infinite number of letters .
There is no way of placing all of the letters in the pigeon holes without one of the pigeonholes ending up with an infinite number of letters .
This is n’t the case if you have an infinite row of pigeonholes .
On the other hand , consider the task of placing an infinite sequence of zero sized dots on a closed interval on the real line .
You wo n’t be forced to put two dots on the same point , but there will be at least one point in the interval where the dots are infinitely bunched together .
For example , if you place dots at 1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16 , ... inside the interval [ - 1,1 ] then in any small interval around zero there will be infinitely many dots .
There 'll be such a point whatever scheme you try .
So even though [ - 1,1 ] is n’t finite , it ’s the ‘ next best thing ’ .
One important thing about compact sets is that there are often strategies to exhaustively search them .
And that is precisely what my earlier post about exhaustive searches was discussing .
So topological ideas give a nice way to get a handle on these non-obvious search algorithms , and characterise those types for which such searches are possible .
PS
In my previous post I introduced the idea of ' observability ' as an intuition pump for topology .
I think that idea goes back to the work of Stephen Vickers .
Brits might recognise that name .
Check out the wikipedia page on him if you do n't .
( Check out our complete collection of 100 + Works of Creative and Geeky Art and Graffiti . )
What qualifies something as unusually geeky street graffiti ?
In some cases it is the content but in many instances it is the methods employed in its creation .
Here are seven more geek graffiti projects that comment on and employ tools of the digital age to reinterpret traditional street art approaches or convey contemporary messages via new media .
The GraffitiWriter is a remote - control robot that can write any programmed or instructed text message on the ground as it travels at speeds of up to 8 miles per hour .
This dot matrix printer - on - wheels circumvents the potential problems graffiti writers might encounter with the authorities .
It can also be equipped with non-permanent rain washable paints and deploy these rather than normal graffiti sprays as it traverses the urban environment .
The PixelRoller is an intentional cross between conventional and manual printing methods , combining the ease of computer - age printing with the creativity of manual printing .
This graffiti creation tool can be programmed to print any number of patterns with uniqueness and variability contingent upon the way these patterns are then ‘ rolled ’ on to a surface .
A few magnets , cheap cardboard , a laser cutter and a few other odds and ends were used to create the so - called CCTV Reminder .
The basic idea is to leave non-operational reminders of the closed circuit television surveillance one might find oneself in when in various public contexts .
In addition to the silhouette of a camera a simply battery - operated red light adds a final jarring touch of realism .
The Graffiti Research Lab , known for architectural light projection graffiti and other projects , developed the ElectroGraff method for embedding movable LED display electronics .
Using conductive spray - paint and magnetic paint they are able to attach the display elements and power them without recourse to traditional and more - visible methods .
This simple Hello Nametag device replicates a common mode of self - labeling found in stranger - filled situations like business conferences and reapplies them to objects in the public realm .
Programmed to speak the name of any desired urban furniture these can be stuck to virtually any surface and invite interaction by passers by .
Ascii Graffiti is perhaps some of the earliest computer geek - oriented graffiti around .
While it rarely leaves the digital realm it does appropriate compositional and stylistic conventions from traditional spray - painted graffiti and reinterprets them for computer display .
Perhaps the ultimate in digital - age geek graffiti , Tagging in Motion ( shown above ) is a kind of three - dimensional street graffiti using a virtual reality interface coupled with digital rendering .
The graffiti artist is taped by multiple cameras throughout his spraying motions in 3D space , generating street art that requires no physical surface and leaves no trace in physical reality like other creative urban light art
A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton said her campaign " will be reviewing " the I.P.A. contributions .
The story of I.P.A. underscores the perils politicians face when they accept money from companies they have not closely vetted for problems .
It also exemplifies the ways some companies attempt to use relationships with prominent politicians — or the appearance of relationships — to promote themselves and burnish their images .
In one of the many lawsuits I.P.A. has been involved in , for example , the company filed papers saying it " holds honors " from former Presidents Clinton , Bush and Gerald Ford , Mrs. Clinton and former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas .
On its Web site , the firm posts images of Mr. Burgess , wearing a tuxedo , standing with political celebrities like Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton .
Former clients said I.P.A. sales representatives would sometimes pull out those photos to impress them .
Just last week , in response to questions by The New York Times , Mr. Burgess invoked a presidential visit to the company .
" Lots of people have very good things to say about us , " he said , " including former President George Bush . "
In one instance , Mr. Burgess seems to have garnered positive attention from his investment in politicians .
Mr. Clinton 's foundation publicized a pledge by I.P.A. last year to provide $ 10 million worth of free services to businesses damaged by natural disasters , including Hurricane Katrina .
The commitment raised the company 's profile .
Now , however , I.P.A. says that the pledge was " premature and unrealistic " because the storm damage drove away so many businesses that providing much consultation was impossible .
Jay Carson , a spokesman for Mr. Clinton , said that I.P.A. was one of many companies the foundation called on to answer the thousands of requests for help it received after the hurricane .
Like " many other dignitaries , " Mr. Carson said , " President Clinton spoke to this company once more than four years ago . "
Mr. Bush 's chief of staff , Jean Becker , said that former President Bush had no personal relationship with I.P.A. , and she expressed displeasure that Mr. Burgess would try to use his appearance at the company banquet as a character reference .
Warrantless wiretaps .
The Patriot Act. Presidential secrecy .
For seven years , civil libertarians and open - government advocates have felt they 've been wandering in the wilderness , with few allies in Congress and a White House that only gets bolder in its contempt .
But now , with " change " the watchword in both Democratic presidential bids , and top committee heads in Congress flexing forgotten oversight muscles , activists are daring to look to 2009 as the Promised Land , where a new president joins with a fed - up Congress to lead America into a new era .
" A lot are talking about the post - Watergate Congress of 1974 , " said Marc Rotenberg , who heads the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
" There is a real feeling we may have proposals for the kind of sweeping government reform that Congress pushed through after the Nixon impeachment in July 1974 . "
Those reforms amounted to some of the most sweeping restraints on U.S. executive power in a century .
But some advocates think Rotenberg and other optimists are setting themselves up for a grave disappointment .
They point to the lackluster civil liberties records of previous Democratic leaders , Bill Clinton in particular , and to the complex system of fear , secrecy and political self - interest assembled during the Bush presidency – a machine , they say , that 's not easily dismantled .
" There is so much money in the terrorism trough , " says Steven Aftergood , who runs the Federation of American Scientists ' Secrecy Project .
" There are constituencies within agencies who are going to be advocating for retention of those practices .
It will take a lot of work to roll back practices that have been entrenched for the last seven years . "
The current dark days started before 9/11 , when then - Attorney General John Ashcroft directed government agencies to start finding excuses to withhold documents from Freedom of Information Act requests .
After 9/11 came an obsession with secrecy and loyalty , the Patriot Act , an intense classification scheme and a top - secret warrantless - wiretapping program targeting Americans , among other things .
With the Bush administration entering its final throes , it 's tempting to think a new day is dawning , Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Lee Tien says – particularly with self - described change candidate Barack Obama ahead in the Democratic primary and polling well among the electorate .
But Tien advises against excessive hope , given the pressure that any president will feel to stop another terrorist attack , and the White House 's traditional need to keep the intelligence community happy .
" People in power do what people in power do , " Tien says .
" One hopes that Obama would be different , but I do n't know .
You can't count on it . "
Indeed , civil libertarians have been let down before by politicians in both parties .
As a U.S. senator , Republican John Ashcroft battled efforts to regulate the use of cryptography in the United States , and spoke often about privacy .
Then he was named Attorney General , and his views seemingly changed overnight .
And in 1993 , the Democratic Clinton administration proposed and championed the doomed Clipper Chip , an encryption scheme designed with a back door for the federal government ; Clinton hoped to make all other strong encryption illegal for use by U.S. civilians .
" Bill Clinton was n't anything special on this issue , " Tien says .
" I do n't think anyone ever is . "
Clinton 's Justice Department also won passage of the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , which required phone companies – and now broadband internet providers – to make their systems more easily wiretapped .
And his was also the first Justice Department to use secret wiretap evidence in deportation proceedings , something the ACLU fought hard against .
" Those were all disappointments to the civil liberties community , " says Kate Martin , director of the Center for National Security Studies .
But Rotenberg has hope , and he 's already begun referring to President Bush in the past tense .
" He was so fanatical about secrecy , " he says .
" You have to believe the pendulum will swing back . "
Rotenberg and others are dreaming of a 35th anniversary return of 1974 .
That 's the year Congress reacted to Watergate by passing a slew of laws opening up the government and limiting its powers – measures like the Privacy Act , which mostly forbids secret databases about American citizens , and a measure that strengthened the formerly anemic Freedom of Information Act .
That same Congress set in motion the Church Committee , led by moderate Idaho Democrat Frank Church , that investigated and exposed rampant domestic spying and ill - fated foreign meddling by the CIA and FBI .
One outcome of that commission was 1978 's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA – the law that , decades later , President Bush was destined to break .
Like Rotenberg , Conrad Martin , executive director of the Fund for Constitutional Government , sees a constellation in the political skies that looks much like 1974 : an unpopular war built on delusions and false information , oil prices on the rise , public dissatisfaction with Congress and the president .
But even he admits that there are differences today .
" In 1974 with the reform Congress , the one big difference was the outrage , " Conrad Martin said .
For example , when the country learned about the FBI 's Counter Intelligence Program ( COINTELPRO ) spying on American dissidents , the question the nation asked was , " What are you doing wiretapping Martin Luther King and members of Congress ? "
Martin adds : " The same with Pentagon Papers – the question was , ' What are you doing bombing Cambodia in secret ? ' "
" We do need to ask , ' Where is the outrage ? ' "
Martin says .
" We are not doing our job of putting this in context – the reason you have FISA is that they were wiretapping the dissidents . "
Moreover , a new round of reform would almost certainly be predicated on hearings probing the activities of the Bush administration .
Americans are not widely clamoring for such investigations , and even liberal - leaning Congressional watchdogs may not " have the balls to do it , " Martin says .
" I do n't give great odds on that , " Tien agrees .
Kate Martin says that at this point , she'd be satisfied with a return to the days of Bill Clinton .
" There was open consultation between the administration and Congress , and there was sensitivity and concern on part of the Department of Justice , " Martin says .
" It was much more of a transparent and open discussion of what the policies should be , and none of these were true about this administration when it decided to change the rules on investigations and surveillance .
" And there was n't the rhetoric of , ' And if you do n't do this , there will be blood on your hands , ' which I think is an abuse of the political process , " Martin adds .
Gary Bass , executive director of OMBWatch , says that in retrospect , the Clinton years were good ones for transparency .
But when he ruminates on what he thought back then , he considers it a mixed bag .
" The negative things were things like the secrecy of Hillary Clinton 's health - care task force , " Bass says .
On the other hand , former Vice President Al Gore pushed the government to get on the information superhighway , according to Bass , which led to " really huge strides " in transparency , such as online access to government documents .
Bass ' group is nonpartisan , but on transparency issues , he has a clear favorite .
" I think Obama is looking great , " Bass said .
" Clinton is a mixed bag , just like her husband , and McCain has been supportive when it serves his needs . "
Greg Nojeim , a lawyer at the Center of Democracy and Technology , thinks whoever takes over the presidency in 2009 will find themselves caught in a world where laws , technology and the drive to prevent terrorism and crimes are colliding at every turn .
" Technology is changing rapidly , making more and more personal information available to the government , " Nojeim says .
" The law has n't kept up , and the privacy aspects have not kept up , and terrorism remains a threat .
" In a sense it 's the perfect storm , and the new president will walk into middle of it and he or she will either be consumed by it or become the master of that storm by taking the initiative . "

Interesting case from Pennsylvania concerning the right of a private sperm donor to contract away his right to make child support payments .
From the Associated Press ,
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that a woman who promised a sperm donor he would not have to pay child support cannot renege on the deal .
The 3 - 2 decision overturns lower court rulings under which Joel L. McKiernan had been paying up to $ 1,500 a month to support twin boys born in August 1994 to Ivonne V. Ferguson , his former girlfriend and co-worker .
“ Where a would - be donor cannot trust that he is safe from a future support action , he will be considerably less likely to provide his sperm to a friend or acquaintance who asks , significantly limiting a would - be mother ’s reproductive prerogatives , ” Justice Max Baer wrote in the majority opinion issued last week .
Arthur Caplan , chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania , said the decision runs counter to the pattern established by similar cases , where the interests of the progeny have generally been given great weight .
“ It sounds like the Pennsylvania court is trying to push a little harder into the brave new world of sperm , egg and embryo donation as it ’s evolving , ” Caplan said .
McKiernan ’s lawyer , John W. Purcell Jr. , said Wednesday an adverse decision against his client would have jeopardized the entire system of sperm donation .
“ That would n’t just include Pennsylvania , because we found out in the course of this trial that many doctors order their sperm for their artificial inseminations out of state , ” he said .
. . . .
Courts found that the two agreed McKiernan would not have to pay child support and would not have visitation rights , but Ferguson later changed her mind and sued .
A county judge said it was in the twins ’ best interests that McKiernan be required to support them .
In addition to monthly payments , McKiernan also was ordered to come up with $ 66,000 in back support .
The appeal reverses that order . . .
Justice J. Michael Eakin , in a dissent , said a parent cannot bargain away a child ’s right to support .
“ The children point and say , ’ That is our father .
He should support us , ” ’ Eakin wrote .
“ What are we to reply ?
’ No !
He made a contract to conceive you through a clinic , so your father need not support you . ’
I find this unreasonable at best . ”
The case is : IVONNE V. FERGUSON v. JOEL L. MCKIERNAN , [ J - 60-2005 ] , which is available on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court website .

Leon Greenman devoted his life to telling the story of the Holocaust
Leon Greenman was living in Holland with his Dutch wife Esther , and their son , when they were rounded up in 1943 and sent to the death camp in Poland .
His wife and three - year - old son Barney died there but London - born Mr Greenman survived six different death camps .
Mr Greenman was freed when Buchenwald was liberated by the Americans in 1945 .
Mr Greenman later said he had promised God if he lived , he would let the world know what happened during the war .
Services against racism
His first public speech took place in 1946 and in 1995 a permanent gallery telling his story was established at the Jewish Museum in north London .
Three years later , he received an OBE for services against racism .
Mr Greenman never remarried and spent his final years in Ilford , east London .
BBC Jerusalem correspondent Tim Franks , who interviewed Mr Greenman in 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz , said he literally lived behind bars there - with bars on the windows and his letterbox sealed - as he had been targeted by neo -Nazis .
But this did not stop him from doing his work or dim his determination , our correspondent said .
Dan Leo takes an in - depth look at US Soccer , the problems it faces and what the future holds for soccer in America .
Soccer is n’t big in the US .
It ’s not a major sport .
It ’s not even a second tier sport .
It ’s below that .
The top American soccer league MLS draws the attendance numbers similar to small European nations , which makes it an insignificant presence on the American sports scene .
.
Generous FIFA and Elo Ratings
FIFA has the US ranked at 28 , while Elo has them at 29 .
Both are probably tad too generous , as the US national team plays far too many matches at home and against weak CONCACAF opposition .
It rarely meets a quality international squad under a duress of sanctioned competition .
The last time the US sent a squad – albeit of a B/ C level – to an international event , it lost three straight games at Copa America with a 2 - 8 goal difference .
Major League Soccer is no great shakes either .
In a recently completed Pan-Pacific tournament , the MLS champion Houston Dynamo was trounced 6:1 in the final by the Japanese Gamba Osaka club that was missing its top six Japanese players due to their national team commitment .
.
Demand for Yanks Abroad
The worldwide demand for the American born and MLS bred players is lukewarm at best .
Marginal USNT performers like Pat Noonan ( Aalesund ) and Clarence Goodson ( IF Start ) could only find employment with the smaller Norwegian clubs .
A once promising starlet Eddie Johnson was sold for relatively low ( reported as $ 2 M ) fee to the relegation battling Fulham .
Other players left on a free and signed with third tier European teams .
Americans already in Europe do n’t fare much better .
Outside of a few exemplary performances by the US goalkeepers ( Blackburn ’s Brad Friedel and Everton ’s Tim Howard ) , most Americans are employed by the dregs of the Premiership – Derby County , Fulham and Reading .
Not a single American field player can be found with clubs that survived the New Year in the two major UEFA competitions – the Champions League and UEFA Cup .
And yet , the overall hopes and reams of the US soccer can be qualified as optimistic .
.
World Cup 1994 Opened the Gates
All one has to do is to look back to the year 1990 .
While the soccer ( aka football ) world was preoccupied with Maradona vs. Romario , Völler vs. Rijkjaard and Beckenbauer vs. Beenhakker duels in its quadrennial event , the US sent a team of amateurs , college students and part - timers to Italy .
The US youngsters were clearly “ just happy to be there ” and promptly went out after losing three games in a row .
But the big change took place between that World Cup and the one held four years later in the US .
For the 1994 competition , the US Soccer Federation hired an experienced Serbian coach Bora Milutinovic .
Playing not to lose but hoping to win , Bora played an exceedingly cautious football and waited to capitalize on a lucky bounce .
He was aided in his strategy by a motley crew of naturalized foreigners ( Fernando Clavijo , Roy Wegerle ) , the newly discovered Yanks - by - blood ( Earnie Stewart and Tom Dooley ) , a sprinkling of the European based professionals ( John Harkes , Eric Wynalda , Tab Ramos ) and a few recent US college graduates ( Marcelo Balboa , Tony Meola , Cobi Jones , Alexi Lalas , Mike Sorber ) to form a united , if not always coherent , group .
The bounces also went Yanks ’ way , especially when the late Colombian defender Andres Escobar deflected an innocent looking John Harkes ’ cross into his own net for the only US victory of the Cup .
It may have been ugly but the US qualified for the knock - out round where it ended up losing to a 10 - man Brazil on a late goal by Bebeto .
Ugliness or not , the US was afflicted – albeit temporarily – by soccer fever .
It went away soon , as the US performances dropped off its 1994 high and its new home league showed a remarkably poor brand of soccer that brought few to the stadiums and too few to a nearby TV screen .
It took eight more years for the US soccer to begin feeling good about itself .
In 2002 , this time under an American born coach Bruce Arena , the US made it all the way to the Quarter - Finals .
While it again needed prodigious quantities of luck – in the last group stage game , the already qualified South Korea defeated a much more talented Portuguese squad – it also benefited from a much improved roster of pros .
Brad Friedel by then was ably performing in the nets for Blackburn while Kasey Keller did likewise for Real Vallecano .
Tony Sanneh , Claudio Reyna , John O’Brien , Earnie Stewart , Frankie Hejduk , Gregg Berhalter , Eddie Lewis , David Regis , Joe -Max Moore had various degrees of success along the European battlefront .
Even some MLS based players ( Landon Donovan , Brian McBride ) had a cup of coffee in Europe and were n’t intimidated by the big stage .
Since then , Arena ’s tactical shortcomings led to a poor US showing at the 2006 WC and the less can be said about Arena ’s successor Bob Bradley , the better .
.
Subtle Yet Positive Improvement
However , the general state of the US soccer has shown subtle improvement in many areas .
More and more Yanks depart for Europe and establish a bridgehead for other Americans .
At this point , over 20 American players are found in top ten European leagues with many youngsters recruited for the pros straight out of high school .
The MLS quality , while uneven , has slowly improved over the years and allowed it to be very competitive visavis its nearest and biggest rival , Mexico .
The recent infusion of foreign talent , on the pitch and on the bench alike , can only bode well for the league ’s future .
The national team managed to eke out a win in the 2007 Gold Cup , and will head to South Africa in 2009 as the CONCACAF representative .
The team may lack the tactical nuance of the top world nations but it ’s athletic and hard working .
Give it another Bora and another knock - out round World Cup appearance ca n’t be ruled out .
Now where does one go to find another Bora ?
There surely has to be one available .
P.S. Below is my list of American players based in Europe that have been either capped in the recent past or stand a good chance to get capped in the near future .
Just note that any of these lists are by nature incomplete and presumptive .
.
Goalkeepers :
Tim Howard ( Everton )
Kasey Keller ( Fulham )
Marcus Hahnemann ( Reading )
Two recent arrivals – QPR ’s Matt Pickens and Valerenga ’s Troy Perkins – may be candidates for the job as well .
The reigning MLS GK of the Year Brad Guzan ‘s transfer to Aston Villa was canceled in late January due to his inability to obtain the work permit but he looks to be headed back to Villa in the summer anyway .
.
Defenders :
Steve Cherundolo ( Hannover 96 )
Oguchi Onyewu ( Standard Liege )
Carlos Bocanegra ( Fulham )
Heath Pearce ( Hansa Rostock )
Jay Demerit ( Watford )
Cory Gibbs ( Charlton )
Jon Spector ( West Ham )
Danny Califf ( Aalborg )
Clarence Goodson ( IF Start )
Frank Simek ( Sheffield Wednesday )
Eddie Lewis ( Derby County )
The great unknown here is Neven Subotic , a rising star of Mainz 05 in Germany ’s second Bundesliga .
The 19 year old had played for the US U - 17 team but is also eligible for Bosnia and Serbia due to his birth in the former Yugoslavia .
.
Midfielders :
Michael Bradley ( Heerenveen )
Benny Feilhaber ( Derby County )
DaMarcus Beasley ( Rangers )
Bobby Convey ( Reading )
Sal Zizzo ( Hannover 96 )
Lee Nguyen ( Randers )
Josh Wolff ( TSV 1860 )
Jeremiah White ( Aarhus )
Freddy Adu ( Benfica ) ,
Clint Dempsey ( Fulham )
Danny Szetela ( Brescia )
Bryan Arquez ( Hertha Berlin ) .
Eddie Lewis has also played in left midfield for the US .
.
Forwards :
Eddie Johnson ( Fulham )
Pat Noonan ( Aalesund )
Charlie Davies ( Hammarby )
Nate Jaqua ( Altach )
Josmer “ Jozy ” Altidore , the 18 year old star striker of the New York Red Bull , was rumored to be almost sold to Reading during the January transfer window but the deal hit the snag at the last moment .
Jozy , as he is called in the US , will likely go in 2008 or 2009 at the latest .
It ’s not difficult to see where the US is most bereft and where it ’s most affluent .
The stakes in the decision on whether and when to confirm President Trump ’s nominee to the Supreme Court are nothing less than the presidency of the United States .

The Democratic Convention opened the door for the Trump campaign to run on a central theme : belief in America .
The dour pessimism which oozed from every orifice at the convention sets up a beautiful contrast between the two candidates and their parties : optimism v. pessimism ; belief in America v. doubt about America .

We watched the first day of the NCAA tournament at the Hilton in a 1500 person theater with five giant projection TVs , one of which in HD .
Sixteen basketball games ( most notably a WVU win ) , six beers , and four hot dogs all add up to a good time .
We even made a buddy : Gene .
Gene was probably in his 40’s , had a pretty solid gut , and an all - around dopey look , nicely accented by the gap in his teeth .
After Gene lumbered into his seat and talked to Anand for a couple minutes , I was convinced ( wrongly ) that he was hammered .
He talked loudly , overly enthusiastically , in a very drunken , not - quite - there manner , and repeated himself .
He told Anand all about his two bets , in detail , twice .
The first was a 121 $ straight bet on Kansas , to win by 23 , which is normal enough .
The second was a bet for all of his money , over 5000 $ , on the Kansas money line , where the sports book balances the odds with varying payouts instead of the point spreads .
Since Kansas was so heavily favored , for every 80 $ of Gene ’s bet , he would win 1 $ .
Seems like a lot of money to risk to win 60 $ , but no # 16 seed seed has ever beaten a # 1 seed and Kansas won easily .
Gene got his payout for the big bet , and when he came back to his seat he told us that he immediately put every cent of it on the Duke money line against Belmont .
This was a game that Anand , who picked Belmont in his bracket , had been calling a potential upset all week .
# 15 seeds have beaten # 2 ’s before , and Duke was considered a weak # 2 .
Gene has $ 5,409 , every bit of his money , on a bet that could very possibly lose and will only pay out 1.6 cents to the dollar .
Oh well , it would only be money …
Then Anand asked Gene what he did :
“ I was in construction , but now I ’m on mental disability . ”
Makes sense .
“ I have bipolar disorder , manic depression , and problems with suicide . ”
Uh oh .
“ I ’m not able to find anything that makes me happy anymore .
The only thing is winning sports bets , and you cant do that every time ”
Oh god .
If you can ever watch a basketball game while sitting beside a bipolar , suicidal man who has his life savings wagered on it , I highly recommend it .
Adds quite the dynamic .
Despite spending two years at Duke and usually pulling for them , I had wanted a Belmont win to clear the path for WVU ’s Sweet 16 run .
Not anymore !
Not with a man ’s life at stake !
Our dopey , talkative friend got really quiet as Belmont came back and took the lead .
He could only have felt worse when the radio station host of the event got on the loudspeaker and led all the Duke - Haters ( there were many ) in a Belmont chant .
There were a mere 20 seconds left until disaster , but Duke had the ball and Gerald Henderson ’s shot pulled his school and our buddy Gene out of the fire .
Gene won 90 $ .
Congrats .

What Mr. Smithson might have thought about the drilling plan is among the issues in dispute .
State officials and some art historians , pointing to Mr. Smithson ’s own writing about the “ Spiral Jetty , ” and the film he made about its construction , said he reveled in the juxtaposition of industrialism and beauty , decay and rebirth , rot and permanence .
Image Credit ...
The New York Times
“ The sense of ruined and abandoned hopes interested him , ” said Lynne Cooke , the curator at Dia .
“ He did n’t look for beautiful places , but rather despoiled landscapes where industry and the wild overlap . ”
State officials say that Rozel Point has always offered a fine tableau of the despoiled and the natural .
A natural seep of oil sludge is right down the beach from the “ Jetty , ” harvested since pioneer days .
And oil drilling was also under way , they say , in view of the “ Jetty ” in 1970 , though it proved economically unviable .
The new drill rigs , they say , are much farther away than the ones Mr. Smithson knew , and that can be glimpsed briefly in his movie .
“ One of the things we ’re having a hard time figuring is what the impacts will be , ” said Dick Buehler , the director of the Utah Division of Forestry , Fire and State Lands .
The deputy director at Dia , Laura Raicovich , agreed that Mr. Smithson had chosen his site carefully and loved some things that others might call ugly .
But Ms. Raicovich said he had also been ambivalent about the context of the “ Jetty . ”
He wrote about the rotting pier and the shacks that lined the shore , but in his photographs , she said , he kept the focus on the wild backdrop of the lake .
And the proposed drilling plan is different , Ms. Raicovich added , “ because it ’s a new addition and it ’s pretty fair to say that it ’s not desirable  on an aesthetic level it alters the physical experience . ”
The executive director of Friends of Great Salt Lake , Lynn de Freitas , said an alliance of artists and environmentalists was also something of a new pattern on the lake .
In 2005 , when the state first proposed issuing offshore drilling leases , Ms. de Freitas ’s group protested and raised the issue of “ Spiral Jetty . ”
Few artists seemed to take notice then , she said .
But when she learned in January that new applications for drilling had been filed , she alerted Mr. Smithson ’s widow , the artist Nancy Holt , and an expert on the “ Jetty , ” Hikmet Sidney Loe .
This time , the global arts community took the ball and ran with it .

Did you wear your hair in a bun ?
When borrowers default on their mortgages , lenders foreclose and sell the homes to recoup their money .
But when homes sell for less than the value of their mortgages and home equity loans  a situation known as a short sale  lenders with first liens must be compensated fully before holders of second or third liens get a dime .
In places like California , Nevada , Arizona and Florida , where home prices have fallen significantly , second - lien holders can be left with little or nothing once first mortgages are paid .
In December , 5.7 percent of home equity lines of credit were delinquent or in default , up from 4.5 percent in 2006 , according to Moody ’s Economy.com .
Lenders and investors who hold home equity loans are not giving up easily , however .
Instead , they are opposing short sales .
And some banks holding second liens are also opposing refinancings for first mortgages , a little - used power they have under the law , in an effort to force borrowers to pay down their loans .
“ Acknowledging a loss is the most difficult thing to do , ” said Micheal Thompson , the executive director of the Iowa Mediation Service , which has been working with delinquent borrowers and lenders .
“ You have to deal with the reality of what you are facing today . ”
While he has been able to strike some deals , Mr. Thompson said that many mortgage companies he talks with refuse to compromise .
Holders of second mortgages often agree to short sales and other changes only if first - lien holders pay them a small sum , say $ 10,000 , or 10 percent , on a $ 100,000 debt .
Disagreements arise when the first and second liens are held by different banks or investors .
If one lender holds both debts , it is in their interest to find a solution .

You can read the machine translated English article here .
The Halifax bank is enrolling unsuspecting customers in trials of a new generation of RFID - enabled bank cards , and trying to keep them in the program even if they have mis-givings about the wave and pay technology .
PayWave allows punters to debit their account without having to enter a PIN or sign for goods valued at less than £ 10 .
The RFID - based technology , backed by Visa , is being rolled out by UK banks Barclays and Halifax , as well as others on the continent .
Mastercard is backing a similar technology called PayPass .
Halifax is introducing the technology in London to a number of punters , including Reg reader Pete .
Pete , a current account holder at Halifax , was among those issued with a new card .
He did n't want to use the unsolicited technology and his attempts to receive an alternative card , though ultimately successful , proved frustrating .
" I have to input my PIN the very first time I use this ' Paywave ' card , but after that it is automatically authorised to work for all transactions under £ 10 , " Pete explained .
" I put the new card straight in the bin - in fact , I shredded it and put it in several different bins .
I do n't want this highly insecure - sounding facility , and I never use a debit card for retail transactions anyway . "
Pete thought no more of the card assuming his old plastic , which had months left to run , would continue to be useable .
But when he went to his local bank in early December to get some cash the ATM refused the transaction and retained his card .
Bank staff , having verified Pete 's identity , were not immediately able to work out why the card had been retained .
They gave him back his card but , after other attempts to use his card failed , he was faced with the chore of getting his card replaced .
After calling Halifax 's helpline , Pete was told that the ( unsolicited ) issue of the contactless card had automatically cancelled his original card , something not mentioned in the paperwork that came with the old card , according to Pete .
" Halifax are cancelling peoples ' bank cards without permission and without even telling them , and forcing them to use these new cards , which as far as I know nobody has asked for , " Pete told El Reg
" Who wants these things ?
Not me .
And is there no limit to the level of insecurity they want to introduce to their cards ?
I guess not , so long as the cardholder can be stuck with the liability , " he added .
A replacement card also came with the unwanted contactless card technology .
Curiously , Pete 's wife did n't get a contactless card even though she is joint holder of the same Halifax account .
Ultimately , after complaining long and loud , Pete has now received a non-Paywave bank card from Halifax .
The incident has left him far from satisfied .
Halifax turned down Pete 's request for compensation .
Halifax declined to speak about individual cases , but confirmed it was conducting a trial of the technology across London , prior to a nationwide rollout .
A spokesman for banking association APACS said whether customers had the ability to refuse new technologies was " card issuer dependent " .
Barclays is also introducing the technology in the UK .
A developer familiar with Barclays plans said it , like Halifax , is rolling out the technology in London in advance of the rest of the country , both as a test - bed for the technology and because Londoners are more used to using RFID - enabled technology in the form of Oyster travel cards .
Barclays has created a triple - function card ( called OnePulse ) that combines a traditional credit card with PayWave and also with Oyster on - board as a separate application .
" Barclays and a couple of other banks were bidding to effectively take over Oyster and subsume it into a larger payment scheme using the less - proprietary Visa and Mastercard technology , but these negotiations fell apart , " he added .
Our source noted that the maximum transaction value for contactless purchases is typically £ 10 , which mitigates the increased risk of using the cards .
" Major customer education issues still need to be overcome before everyone is happy to use this as a cash - replacement technology , which is what the banks and retailers want , " he said .
" It 's certainly a very interesting privacy issue if banks are including the contactless chips in ' standard ' credit cards without asking , especially since the transactions are effectively unsecured because no PIN is needed .
" On the privacy issue , there is likely to be a growing number of stories and attempts at hacking and skimming contactless cards , once they are out in the wild , and whether or not the risks to consumers are real , they need to understand the issues and risks . "
Our source added that the situation created a market for niche security firms to develop products that protect contactless - enabled cards from " uninvited attempts to communicate with them " , in response to security concerns about the possible misuse of the technology to perpetrate fraud .
Whether the likes of Pete will be reassured by extra security controls on a type of card they have had forced on them in the fist place remains to be seen . ®
Carla Del Ponte , the ex-chief prosecutor for war crimes in former Yugoslavia , has unleashed a storm of recrimination with allegations of a trade in human body parts in Kosovo and Albania after Nato bombed Serbia in 1999 .
Del Ponte claims , based on what she describes as credible reports and witnesses , that Kosovan Albanian guerrillas transported hundreds of Serbian prisoners into northern Albania where they were killed , and their organs " harvested " and trafficked out of Tirana airport .
The Kosovan government , now headed by the former guerrilla leader Hashim Thaci , dismisses the claims as untrue , while Serbia and Russia are demanding a war crimes investigation into the allegations .
Del Ponte , now a Swiss ambassador , has been ordered to keep silent by the Swiss government .
The allegations are aired in Del Ponte 's just published memoirs of her eight years as chief prosecutor for the international war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia , based in The Hague .
The Hunt : Me and War Criminals , which is published in Italian and was launched last week , has triggered controversy and added to the tensions between Kosovo and Serbia two months after the Albanian - majority province declared independence from Serbia .
In the book , Del Ponte writes that her investigators visited a house in the remote mountainous region outside Burrel , Albania , which was allegedly being used as an impromptu clinic for the butchering of 300 young Serbs captured by the Kosovo Liberation Army and transported in lorries across the border from Kosovo to Albania .
According to witnesses - including one who said he had driven some of the organs to Tirana airport , and a team of unnamed journalists who investigated the allegations - the victims had their kidneys removed before being killed later and having other organs taken .
" Prisoners were aware of the fate that awaited them , and according to the source pleaded , terrified , to be killed immediately , " Del Ponte writes .
The " house - clinic " was visited by UN officials from Kosovo and tribunal investigators .
" The team was shocked by what they saw , " said Chuck Sudetic , a former tribunal official who is joint author of the book .
" They found gauze and vials of medicines , including a muscle relaxer used during surgery . "
Witness accounts , indirectly provided to Del Ponte , indicated that some of the victims were buried near the house and at a nearby cemetery .
Forensic tests in the house revealed traces of blood , but investigators were unable to establish whether it was human blood .
The victims were said to include Albanians and trafficked women from Russia and eastern Europe forced to work as prostitutes .
Del Ponte has long complained that the UN authorities in Kosovo blocked her attempts to investigate war crimes by Kosovan Albanians and she says that the authorities in Albania were also unhelpful .
The most senior Kosovan Albanian to be tried for war crimes in The Hague , Ramush Haradinaj , a former prime minister of Kosovo and ex-guerrilla commander , was acquitted last week , sparking bitter protests in Serbia .
According to Del Ponte , a local Albanian prosecutor , who visited the house with the UN team , told her : " No Serbs are buried here .
But if they did bring Serbs over the border from Kosovo and killed them , they did a good thing . "
The alleged organ harvesting is said to have been uncovered by journalists who called in the UN in Kosovo and provided information to the tribunal .
" There were credible accounts of abductions and an organ harvesting operation provided to reputable journalists who have had many years of experience in the region , " said Sudetic .
The journalists refused to identify their witnesses .
Other sources claim the body parts were flown to Istanbul where they were transplanted into wealthy Arab patients .
Del Ponte 's account is the first time such allegations have come from such an authoritative source .
But officials and analysts are surprised that she should choose to air them now , five years after her investigators went to the alleged scene of the crime .
Del Ponte writes that it proved impossible at the time to pursue a full investigation of the claims .
" I am surprised at the extraordinary serious allegations , " said one senior tribunal official .
" These allegations have formed no part of any investigation by the prosecution at the tribunal . "
Mirko Klarin , an authority on the tribunal and Balkan war crimes at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting , described Del Ponte 's allegations as " irresponsible and appalling ...
This is more journalistic than prosecutorial .
She should n't put rumours in her book . "
The Swiss foreign ministry barred Del Ponte , now its ambassador to Argentina , from attending her book launch and ordered her to keep quiet .
Senior Swiss figures are calling for her resignation .
" All I know is that she was eager to talk about the book after its publication , " said Sudetic .
According to the International Committee of the Red Cross , which mediates confidential talks between Serbia and Kosovo to try to locate and identify those who vanished in the 1998 - 99 war , there are still 1,967 people missing .
The majority are believed to be Kosovan Albanians .
The 300 Serbs said to have been transported to Burrel would constitute a large part of the missing Serbs .
While there is widespread scepticism about the veracity of the claims , Human Rights Watch said Del Ponte had supplied " sufficiently grave evidence " to warrant an investigation by the Kosovo and Albanian authorities .
" Perhaps by bringing this story out now , the witnesses will step forward , " said Sudetic .
" Perhaps the persons who are responsible for the abductions will worry about the law catching up with them .
Any persons who may have taken part in the alleged organ harvesting will sleep a little less soundly . "
Profile
The least diplomatic of the four people who have served as chief prosecutor at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague , Carla Del Ponte has specialised in going for the big villains .
During her eight years there , she put Slobodan Milosevic in the dock , but was cheated of triumph by his death before a verdict .
She was unable to get the other two genocide suspects , Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic , before the court .
As a Swiss prosecutor , before moving to The Hague , she concentrated on transnational crime , investigating the Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky and joining the Italian magistrate Giovanni Falcone in tackling the Sicilian mafia .
Falcone was killed by the mafia in 1992 .

RICHMOND , Va. ( AP )  Virginia has put all executions on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether lethal injections are constitutional .
Gov. Timothy Kaine ordered the moratorium on Tuesday in delaying the scheduled April 8 execution of Edward Nathaniel Bell until July 24 .
It is the 30th such stay of execution nationally since September , when the Supreme Court agreed to hear a Kentucky case that challenged the constitutionality of lethal injections .
Other executions are not being scheduled pending the ruling , expected in late June .
" That 's the pattern all over the country — dates are not being set , " Richard Dieter , executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center , said Wednesday .
Virginia is among 35 states that use lethal injection .
Bell , 43 , was convicted in 2001 and sentenced to die for the October 1999 shooting of Winchester police Sgt. Ricky Timbrook .
Earlier , the planned October execution of Virginia death row inmate Christopher Scott Emmett also was stayed pending the court review .
Since the Supreme Court allowed states to reinstate capital punishment in 1976 , 1,099 executions have been carried out in the United States , including 98 in Virginia , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .
Only Texas has carried out more executions , at 405 .
Lethal injection , devised as a humane alternative to electrocution and the gas chamber , has come under attack because of reports that a series of three drugs administered in the process does n't always work as quickly as intended and that inmates might die in excruciating pain .
The U.S. Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishment .

Sometimes it is hard to not think about something …
Two days ago I have written a little bit about the film adaptation of Stephen Kings short novella THE MIST .
Yet I simply could n’t get the ending of this movie out of my head .
The reason is not its drastic or shocking nature .
In fact , as I witnessed the chain of events I was happy that finally someone found the guts to pull off something like that .
Yet , during the time afterwards , I became more and more skeptical for the feeling that this ending did n’t fit completely .
The first one to blame for this problem would normally be Stephen King himself , but this time it is n’t his fault as the ending was created for this movie alone .
And the difference could n’t be more drastic .
( massive spoilers ahead )
The two endings of THE MIST
In the novella the protagonists escape from the super market store and make it to the car .
They all ( which means the survivors of the run ) jump in and our hero drives with them away into an unsure future filled with this mist .
Quite an open end King selected here .
In the movie they also escape from the super market store and make it to the car .
Like in the novella the survivors of the run drive away .
Yet this time we follow them for a while and when the gas runs out our main character makes a decision … and shoots everyone in the car including his young son .
This almost breaks him completely but when the military makes its way to him he completely looses it .
As you can see the movie ending is drastic and really good .
Yet , when I think about it I always get the feeling that the movie and this ending are n’t truly connected .
The missing connection
As I understand from a McKee point of view , a movie ending with its final turn of values from good to bad or vice versa is the core of the movie in terms of morale , feelings and so on .
It defines the controlling idea / the premise .
And therefore everything else in a movie .
If you have a comedy and at the end everyone dies you have to rewrite everything else or get rid of this ending .
Take THE MATRIX as an example of a strongly designed story that goes to the final turn without halt .
Now , in THE MIST our main protagonist kills everyone besides himself .
This makes the ending bad on every level and forms an interesting controlling idea like “ only cornered strong enough , man does everything ” or something similar in that matter .
Yet the whole time in the movie it is never hinted in the hero himself .
He always acts in the right sense and almost never loses senses .
You can also say that the situation in general gets worse , yet our hero does n’t change .
He does n’t start to act desperate or truly feel desperate .
And therefore his last act feel like out of the blue .
Moreover , there is the religious element of THE MIST .
As you have read to this point and hence almost surely seen the film you know the religious talk all the time and how everyone starts to act like a religious fanatic .
If we again take McKee into account with his assumptions that an ending defines a movie we can also assume that a movie defines its ending .
If the movie is a comedy , the ending is funny .
By applying this logic onto THE MIST it becomes clear that the ending should have been about the situation in the store .
It would have even been possible to create a really bad ending out of this : our heroes get killed by the bunch .
This ending would have been bad and shocking yet more fitting with the rest of the story .
On the other hand , not as seemingly that shocking as the one we have .
In review I can truly understand why they chose this ending .
It is shocking and shows that even normal people can act like they never would .
It is a final big turn of events .
Yet , by changing the original ending it opened a can of worms resulting in a movie that does n’t fit to its ending and an ending that does n’t fit to its movie .
Former Reagan aide says Congress must start impeachment inquiry Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 3 , 2007

This A constitutional lawyer who served in Ronald Reagan 's administration says President Bush 's " apparently criminal " authorization of a warrantless wiretapping program is grounds for the House to begin an impeachment inquiry .
By not beginning such an investigation , impeachment will become a " virtual dead letter , " Bruce Fein , former deputy attorney general under Regan , said in a essay published in Slate .
Fein has emerged as a fierce critic of Bush 's administration and has previously called for the president and Vice President Dick Cheney to be impeached .
" The House does not require , nor should it await , proof beyond a reasonable doubt of misconduct , " Fein wrote in the essay published Friday .
" To wait for such proof subverts the whole purpose of an impeachment inquiry . "
Ample grounds for an impeachment inquiry lie in the president 's shady justifications for his " Terrorist Surveillance Program , " which Fein says subverted the check 's on law enforcement powers inherent in the Constitution and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
" The president 's apparently criminal spying continued until at least January 2007 -- or for more than five years [ after 9/11 ] -- when Attorney General Alberto Gonzales declared that FISA warrants , whose nature remains classified , would replace the TSP , " Fein writes .
" ( The attorney general maintained , however , that Bush continued to be crowned with Article II powers to ignore the warrant requirement and to do so secretly whenever he wished . ) "
An impeachment inquiry should demand the president 's legal justifications of the program , Fein writes , although he maintains that such an inquiry would not necessarily end with the president 's ouster from office .
He noted Abraham Lincoln 's suspension of Habeas Corpus protections during the Civil War as an instance in which the national interest justified suspension of civil liberties .
Lincoln " rhetorically asked whether a republic must inescapably be too strong for the liberties of its people or too weak to maintain its existence , " Fein writes .
" The [ House Judiciary ] committee should similarly explore whether in the aftermath of 9/11 , Bush was confronting such a dilemma . "
Fein previously urged the Senate to censure Bush over the spy program .
In his latest essay , Fein says impeachment hearings are necessary for Congress to prevent its oversight muscles from atrophying : " If what Bush has said and done falls short of warranting an impeachment inquiry , then impeachment of the president has become a virtual dead letter . "
The record year was 2000 , when 399,670 applications were denied , one - third of those presented , according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute , a nonpartisan research organization .
More recent denial rates remain high , but have fallen from the peak because more immigrants have prepared with civics classes and immigrant advocates before applying to become citizens , researchers said .
In three recent cases in Florida , aspiring citizens thought their green cards entitled them to vote or register to vote before they were sworn in as Americans .
When the immigrants reported their elections activities on their applications , not only were their naturalizations rejected , but they were also ordered to leave the country , according to their lawyer , Jeffrey Brauwerman .
In a current Florida case , a British - born businessman saw his naturalization derailed and was detained for deportation because he forgot to update his home address with the immigration agency , Mr. Brauwerman said .
He was charged with ignoring a notice in which immigration examiners mistakenly accused him of a felony he had never committed .
In a case that drew Congressional attention this year in Illinois , Marin Turcinovic , an immigrant from Croatia , was twice denied citizenship because he did not show up at the immigration office to be fingerprinted .
As his lawyer explained to no avail , Mr. Turcinovic was a quadriplegic , dependent on a ventilator and unable to leave his home .
Mr. Turcinovic died in April 2004 without becoming a citizen , creating an immigration crisis for his French widow , Corina , who had taken care of him .
In January Representative Daniel Lipinski , Democrat of Illinois , presented a bill that halted her deportation .
Immigration officials say denials have increased in the last decade because naturalization applications are increasing .
They note that approvals are rising as well .
In 1996 naturalizations soared for the first time to more than one million , and they remained above 450,000 each year through 2007 .
“ Whenever we see a period when large numbers decide to apply , there tend to be larger numbers of people who are not ready or might not meet the requirements , ” said Chris Rhatigan , a spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Services .
Mozilla has hired several developers from Humanized , a small software company that is known for its considerable usability expertise and innovative user interface design .
The Humanized developers will be working at Mozilla Labs on Firefox and innovative new projects .
We talked to Mozilla CEO John Lilly , who provided some additional details .
" Mozilla has hired three of the principals from Humanized .
They will be joining the Mozilla Labs team on January 16 , 2008 .
We expect a lot of innovation work from them , some Firefox - related , some broader , just like everything else in Mozilla Labs , " Lilly told us .
" The work done by the Humanized principals speaks for itself — there are lots of great , web - relevant ideas in their work , and we 're excited to have them join Mozilla . "
It should be noted that this is not an acquisition , as some have erroneously reported elsewhere in the blogosphere .
Lilly clarifies that : " This was not an acquisition .
No premium was paid and no intellectual property was acquired by Mozilla . "
I met Humanized president Aza Raskin ( son of Macintosh luminary Jef Raskin ) at the Ubuntu Developer Summit last year .
At the summit , Aza gave a very informative presentation about user interface design and discussed usability issues in several applications .
His design philosophy extends from the belief that the best kind of interface is no interface at all .
He advocates creating software that conforms to the Taoist notion of Wu Wei , which is to " act without doing . "
Mozilla 's recruitment of interface experts from Humanized is a very nice move .
We have seen some really intriguing technologies coming out of Mozilla labs lately and the addition of a few usability gurus will surely help Mozilla provide a better user experience .
The UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur remains understrength
In the latest incident , seven trucks were stolen and their drivers abducted last week as they drove to Fasher , the World Food Programme says .
WFP says 37 trucks and 23 drivers are still missing and other drivers are unwilling to risk going to Darfur .
Some two million people rely on food aid as a result of the conflict .
The WFP also warns it could halt its Humanitarian Air Service which transports aid workers around the vast country at the end of this month because of a lack of funding .
" This is an unprecedented situation , " said WFP representative in Sudan Kenro Oshidari .
" Our humanitarian air operation for aid workers could be forced to stop flying because we have no money , at a time when our helicopters and aircraft are needed more than ever because of high insecurity on the roads . "
Inaccessible
WFP does not say who is behind the attacks in Darfur - there are numerous rebel groups and pro-government militia in the region .
Some 8,000 people a month use WFP flights in Darfur - 3,000 in helicopters to reach parts of the country which are otherwise inaccessible , the UN agency says .
Aid agency Oxfam has warned that its operation in Darfur would be at " serious risk " if the WFP flights stopped or were reduced .
WFP also operates flights around South Sudan , which is slowly recovering from its own long conflict and where infrastructure is even worse than in Darfur .
Here too , a massive aid operation to help millions of people affected by the war would be badly affected if flights were stopped .
The UN 's special rapporteur for Sudan Sima Samar accuses says civilians were used as human shields in recent clashes in West Darfur .
Fighting has increased recently there , leading to a new stream of refugees .
The joint UN - African Union peacekeeping force is making little progress - it still has just 9,000 troops out of the 26,000 planned .
Why would sane people willingly go to one of the numerous FEMA camps that exist across the U.S. ?
Answer :
Because they are starving , have lost their homes , have no employment prospects , and literally have nowhere else to go .
The emphasis in the news of late on the Police State that is coming our way outlines the brutality that the “ authorities ” are using and are about to use on we the people , who are not of the “ elite ” class .
Rounding people up to take them to FEMA camps is one scenario , and one that I believe is not unreasonable .
However , I would like to step out of the box for a minute and take a look at the situation from another perspective .
Let ’s look at New Orleans .
One of the main disasters in New Orleans was the water .
Another was the herding of people who had literally no place to go into detention facilities ; excuse me , places of refuge .
When they got there , these people were treated like rabble , then dispersed .
People are still looking for dispersed family members that are who knows where .
The poorer people literally gave up their freedom because they did not know what else to do .
They had no homes , they were on the verge of drowning , starvation was looming , and the water was not fit to drink .
Prime candidates for a FEMA camp ; excuse me , place of refuge , experiment .
Now , let ’s expand this picture to the coming depression .
It is not over - the - top to look a bit into the future by looking into the past .
It is 1929 , and people are jumping out of windows .
It is now 2008 , or thereabouts , and people who have lost everything and do not know how to survive are running to the FEMA camps ; excuse me , places of refuge , for food , shelter , and security .
The “ authorities ” do not even have to deploy force to a population that goes where it is supposed to willingly .
With so many of us , which is the best method of operation ?
Yup , getting them to go willingly .
By creating a situation that leads them to the right conclusions , you have your ready and waiting FEMA camps ; excuse me , places of refuge , filled to the gills .
The only thing required to start the process is a big enough catastrophe .
Is a financial meltdown big enough ?
Just ask the poor people in New Orleans who were left with nothing when the water poured through town .
They ’ll tell you .
Bush : Before and After
Before we enjoyed his cheeky grin , his straight - forwardness , his comical abuse of the queen 's English .
7 years later , with energy prices at an all time high , liking the President is hard .
The US President 's approval rating has sunk to an all time low of 24 % .
Voters are responding to escalating living costs , extreme indebtedness , and a drop in purchasing power not seen since ... oh well , suffice to say , the answer is depressing .
So , let 's talk about the good news - inflation .
We 're constantly told that this is holding steady at around 2 % a year .
This is good in theory , because it should mean that , provided our pay is rising by the same small amount , we can still afford the same basket of goods .
Trouble is - nobody believes it .
It has become a useless gauge for the health of the nation .
For one thing , it does n't prepare us for the scale of those costs that have been put off , but must still be repaid .
If your mortgage is resetting now , you 'll know what I mean .
I 'd love to know for whom 2 % inflation is a reality .
Did annual house price inflation remain steady at 2 % over the last 7 years ?
Did energy prices increase by 2 % a year ?
Are rent - rises now holding steady at 2 % ?
Let 's compare commodity prices around 1999| 2000 ( before Bush came into power ) and in 2007 , after 7 years of Bush .
What this exercise shows us is that energy prices and commodity prices , far from standing still , have actually rocketed .
Wholesale Natural Gas is up by a factor of 3 , Oil x 9 , Gold x 3 , Uranium x 11 and Wheat x 4 .
With the exception of gold , these commodities are the kind of things which put heat and light in our homes , fuel in our cars , even bread on the table .
When they surge in price , the effect on consumers is sure to be one of two things - either higher bills or reduced service .
Should we blame the government for high energy prices ?
I mean ...
Bush , Cheney , Rice and Co all declared their vested oil interests did n't they ?
I repeat .
Oil is up by a factor of nine , from a low of $ 10 dollars ( in Feb 1999 ) to $ 93 a barrel .
We 've just witnessed the sharpest rise in the price of oil since OPEC cut supplies to Western Nations in 1973 .
A $ 10 barrel of oil which went up in price by a steady 2 % a year over 7 years would cost $ 11.50 , not $ 93 !
So what has pushed up energy prices ?
1 ) Catastrophic Events9/11 , the invasion of Iraq , a rash of oil fires and explosions , hurricane Katrina , the threat of US aggression against Iran .
These are the kind of events which threaten to interrupt the supply of energy .
Arguably , only one of these was not avoidable .
2 ) Rampant SpeculationSome 500 hedge funds now specialise in energy trading .
The scale of the bets can be enormous .
One hedge fund trader from Amaranth Advisors famously lost $ 6bn on a bet that the price of gas would go up in April 2007 .
3 ) Increased Demand Rapid industrial development in China and India means increased competition for oil .
Meanwhile , light oil is n't flowing any easier .
So what went wrong ?
Or , conversely , for whom did it go right ?
Exxon Mobil posted record profits of $ 39.5 billion in 2006 .
Financial wheeler dealers also enjoyed bumper bonuses .
And boy , did n't we all party when interest rates were low .
But something fundamentally less celebratory was going on at the same time .
The dollar has fallen by 30 % against the euro since Bush arrived in the White House .
In practical terms , this means the buying power of American wage earners , compared to Europeans , has been dropping by the equivalent of 5 % a year .
In 2000 , 1 dollar bought you 1 euro .
Today it only buys you 0.69 .
So we might as well ignore the 2 % inflation mantra .
The real picture is that the basic cost of living is rising in the US , whilst the exchangeable value of American wages is dropping year on year .
I do n't see many US presidential candidates talking candidly about this , with the exception perhaps of Ron Paul .
The repercussions for the UK only recently started to become obvious .
Easy cheap loans have been like lullabies to us .
Too much money , too readily created and too loosely lent , led us to this place .
This is the place where vultures and loan sharks start to circle round struggling businesses and households .
It 's where pyramid schemes resurface and wealth further concentrates as the asset fire sales begin .
In 1971 , The Who wrote us an anthem to ensure we never got fooled again .
What happened on Bush 's watch ?
Another bunch of 18 year olds got waved off to war .
Meanwhile , the non-combatant binged on credit , set the bath running , then promptly fell asleep in front of the latest ' reality ' TV show .
God Bless America .

The content of the film is unknown but it has already sparked protests A website that a Dutch right - wing politician was planning to use to release a film expected to be fiercely critical of Islam has been suspended .
The US hosting service , Network Solutions , said it was investigating complaints that it may have breached guidelines on hate language .
Dutch politician Geert Wilders says the 15 - minute film describes Islam as " the enemy of freedom " .
The planned release has sparked angry protests in many Muslim countries .
The Dutch government has disassociated itself from Mr Wilders ' views , but there are fears the film will spark protests similar to those that followed the publication in Denmark two years ago of cartoons seen as offensive to Muslims .
The film has already been condemned by several Muslim countries , including Iran and Pakistan .
Hate messages Mr Wilders ' film is entitled Fitna , an Arabic word used to describe strife or discord , usually religious .
Mr Wilders wrote a commentary in a Dutch newspaper on Saturday .
" The film is not so much about Muslims as about the Koran and Islam .
The Islamic ideology has as its utmost goal the destruction of what is most dear to us , our freedom , " he wrote in De Volkskrant .
Geert Wilders has ignored pleas to shelve his project " Fitna is the last warning for the West .
The fight for freedom has only just begun , " he said .
He had been using Network Solutions to promote the film .
But on Sunday , Network Solutions said it had received a number of complaints that were under investigation .
It said the site was suspended until it was established whether the content of the site violated Network Solutions ' terms of acceptable use .
They include " material that is obscene , defamatory , libellous , unlawful , harassing , abusive ... hate propaganda " and " profane , indecent or otherwise objectionable material of any kind or nature " .
Mr Wilders has had police protection since Dutch director
Theo van Gogh was killed by a radical Islamist in 2004 .

What are these ?
Smalltalk、特に Squeak Smalltalk は、言語処理系や IDE というより、あたか も “ ゲス トOS ” のように振る舞うので、ちょっと試してみたいと思い立ってインストール＆起動まではできたものの、そこから先には、独自の
GUI や操作スタイルに阻まれて進めなかった…という経験をお持ちの方も多いと思います。
そこで 、Smalltalk 環境独自の GUI ツール群の使い方はあとで覚える（あるいはそもそもそれほど興味がない←しょぼーん…( ^_^ ;)）として、今のところは、試してみたいコードを動かしたり、どんな動作になるのか確認ができればいい…といった忙しい人向けにざっくり、Smalltalk 式を評価するための方法のようなものを書いてみました。
とりあえず、マシンが Mac 以外（といっても 、Mac の場合の違いは、ctrl + d とかが cmd + d になるだけ…）で 、Squeak Smalltalk 環境は umejava さんの日本語 版 Squeak3.9 のインストールおよび起動済みという前提で、オーソドックスな「カウンタ」オブジェクトを作ります。
なお、以下には、しょぼいながらも Smalltalk で 「カウンタ」を記述するコードが出てくるので、まずは自分で考えてみたい場合はそれを終えてから読み進めたほうがよいと思います（当初「ネタバレ」と書いたワケはこれです）。
■ ブロック（無名関数）版カウンタ ツールはいっさい使わないようなことを書きましたが、コードを入力する場所くらいは用意しないといけないので、とりあえず、デスクトップクリック → 開く… → ワークスペース、 で 「
ワークスペース」を起動します。ワークスペースというのは、Smalltalk-80 時代からある書き捨て用のメモソフトです。加えて最近のワークスペースには、宣言無しに出現した変数を半永続的な「ワークスペース変数」というある種のグローバル変数と見なしてくれる便利な（かつ、場合によってはやっかいな
←たとえば変数名のスペルミスを警告＆修正する機能が用をなさなくなる！）機能も付いています。
ワークスペースを立ち上げたら、そこに、次のコードをタイプして入力するか、ここからコピペして貼り付け（ctrl + v）ます。 counterMaker := [ :n | [ n := n + 1 ] fixTemps ] .
c1 := counterMaker value : 0 . c2 := counterMaker value : 100 ctrl + a ですべてを選択し 、do it ( ctrl + d。右クリック の 「 式を評価」と同じ ) します。ctrl の代わりに alt も使えます。これでワークスペース変数である c1、c2 にカウンタが代入されました。あとは、
c1 value もしくは、 c2 value をタイプして入力し、print it ( ctrl + p。右クリック の 「 式を表示」も同じ )
で各カウンタのインクリメントおよび内容の確認ができます。両方同時に確認したいときは、 {c1 value .
c2 value} を print it ( ctrl + p ) するとよいでしょう 。
付録その２ ： 似たようなことを Dolphin Smalltalk で くどいようですが、あくまで Smalltalk 独自のツール群の勉強をしている暇がないときに、最低限の操作とワークスペースのみでとりあえず…という特殊な想定ですのであしからず。勉強会などでは、事前にクラスブラウザの使い方を覚えてからそれを使ってください(^_^ ; ) 。
ブロックについては GNU Smalltalk と同じ注意（#fixTemps が不要、ブロック引数は代入不可、#initialize が自動的に呼ばれない）に加えて 、 Squeak Smalltalk（と、その影響を受けた処理系）独自の { ... } という配列リテラルが使えないことを除けば Squeak Smalltalk と同じ式が使えるみたいです。 ただし式の評価は Squeak Smalltalk での do it ( ctrl + d ) や print it ( ctrl + p ) ではなく Evaluate
It ( ctrl + e ) および Display
It ( ctrl + d) な点に注意。ワークスペースは、起動時に現れるウインドウの
Workspace アイコンのダブルクリックにより呼び出せます。
counterMaker := [ :n | | m | m := n. [ m := m + 1 ] ] .
c1 := counterMaker value : 0 . c2 := counterMaker value : 100 .

Counter compile : ' pushButton ^counterValue := counterValue + 1 ' .
Counter class compile : ' new ^super new initialize ; yourself ' . c3 :=
Counter new .

Dolphin Smalltalk はほとんど使ったことがなかったのですが 、Squeak Smalltalk のしょぼさにくらべると、補完機能の出来がすばらしいですね（ちなみに
Squeak Smalltalk では alt + q の連打で補完される）。総じて 、Smalltalk - 80 直系の子孫である Squeak Smalltalk や Cincom Smalltalk より、過去のしがらみがないのがよいのか、今風の
IDE っぽさが板に付いている感じがします。舞波さんお薦めなのもうなずけます。
その昔、jgawkを使ってSGMLによる入力をパースしてDB上の情報を参照しながらTeXのソースに変換するプログラムを書いていた。行き詰まってjperlに移行した。DOSエクステンダを使っていた頃の話だ。
perlに慣れてみると、もうawkを使うことがまったくなくなった。DOSを離れてUNIXを使うようになるとますますその傾向が高まった。awkは複数のファイルを扱うことが得意ではない。1個の入力を1個の出力に加工するフィルタプログラムを書くのが本分だからである。しかし、プログラムを拡張しているうちに複数のファイルを参照したくなることなんかいくらもあることである。
awkを使っていると、複数のファイルを参照したくなったときに「袋小路」にはまりこむ。最初からperlで書いておけば「袋小路」にはまることがない。では、perlが自由に使える場合、あえてawkを使う理由って何だろう？
Nifty Serveのsed/awk/perlの掲示板で質問してみると「絶対に複数の入出力が必要にならない処理ならawk」とか「メモリの消費量が少ないのはawkだから、無闇にperlにはしない」みたいな返答が返ってきた。
Shiroさん のLisp :よくある正解に、僕の体験したものよりずいぶんレベルの高い話ではあるが、意味的には同じような「袋小路を避ける」話が出ている。この文章はもう何度も読んでいるのだけれど、自分の体験と結び付いて「ああ、そうか。だから自分はLispに惹かれるのか」と納得したのは今日のことだった。
Paul Graham もOn Lispの中で 「どんなプログラムを書くのかまだ確かでないなら、Lispで書いておくのが安全な賭けだ。それがどんな種類のプログラムになったとしても、それを書いている間に、Lispはその種類のプログラムを書くためのプログラミング言語に進化していることだろう」と述べている。
多くの場合、非力な言語で開発をしていると、機能拡張を続けているうちに理解不能なプログラムになっていく。プログラムは利用され続けている限り、機能拡張の要求から逃れられないものだ。そして、どのような機能拡張が要求されるかは前もっては予想できないものである。
デザインパターンのいくつかはオブジェクト指向プログラミング言語においてどのような工夫をしておくと将来の拡張性に備えることができるかを示唆している。だが、これは延命措置に過ぎないし、現実には適切にデザインパターンを使いこなせるレベルにいる設計者/プログラマーはそう多くない。
SIerの立場からすると、ある程度の機能拡張の末にリプレース需要が生まれる方が予算規模が大きくなるから美味しいように思える。だから、徹底的に「袋小路」を避けるより、あえて「袋小路」にハマるのも悪くないと思うからも知れない。だが、そうではない。機能拡張困難になったプログラムに手を入れなければならなくなり、開発者たちが悲鳴をあげる日々なくしてリプレース需要は生まれないからだ。その悲鳴の日々において、多くのものが失われているはずだ。
まずは袋小路を恐れる気持ちを持つことから始めてはどうだろうか？
A certain reverence is required just to approach the book 's title : " The Three Trillion Dollar War : The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict " by noted economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes .
I can see why they understated it .
The pulse of outrage beats behind the cold calculations in this concise volume , newly published by Norton .
We 're not just " losing " this tragic , arrogantly unplanned war in the conventional sense of failing to subdue our enemies - we 're committing slow socioeconomic suicide with its open - ended pursuit , losing , as we plunge recklessly into debt over it , our options , our ability to choose .
We 're losing the future .
" Because of the war , the national deficit is $ 2 trillion higher , " Stiglitz , who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2001 , told me .
" At 5 percent interest , that 's $ 100 billion a year , year after year after year - forever ! "
Such numbers are beyond the scope of the human imagination .
To begin putting the war into financial perspective , Stiglitz suggested that we need a new unit of account : " Think of what things would cost in terms of hours , days , weeks of fighting . "
For instance , he said , " Three years ago we had a financial crisis with the Social Security system .
For one - sixth of an Iraq war , you could have fixed Social Security for the next 50 to 75 years . "
Or how about health insurance for children ?
Remember when President Bush vetoed a bill to expand it ?
" We 're talking about days of fighting in Iraq , " Stiglitz said .
Or , hmm , what about the fact that suddenly one of every 150 children is being diagnosed with autism ?
The cost of serious research on this issue ?
" Four hours of an Iraq war ! "
( Note : The American Friends Service Committee has a Web page devoted to the Iraq war as a unit of account , at afsc.org/cost/banners.htm . )
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .
Get our best delivered to your inbox .
Before we begin a serious waltz with the current war numbers that Stiglitz and Bilmes force us to confront in their book , let 's ponder some far easier stats .
Remember Gulf War I ?
We drove Saddam out of Kuwait , racking up huge kills in the process and sustaining a mere 148 of our own dead and another 467 injured .
Combat operations lasted a month .
What 's more , Saudi Arabia and Kuwait paid for most of it - it was practically a free war .
Except , as Stiglitz and Bilmes point out , in the aftermath of this quickie , yellow - ribbon - festooned war , vets started getting sick - started dying - of mysterious maladies that came to be called Gulf War Syndrome .
Some 17 years later , " the United States still spends over $ 4.3 billion each year paying compensation , pension and disability benefits to more than 200,000 veterans of the Gulf War , " they write .
" We have already spent over $ 50 billion in Gulf War I disability benefits . "
Almost two decades later , our tax dollars are still disappearing down the gaping maw of this monthlong war .
Now , consider that the current Iraq war is five years old this month and counting ( John McCain is ready to go at it for another hundred ) , and we 've been in Afghanistan so far for six and a half years .
The secret and terrible costs of these wars are growing , growing , growing ; and they are exponentially greater than the still enormously expensive , and forgotten , Gulf War I .
Just the cost of care for physically and emotionally injured vets for these two protracted wars - in which our GIs are being forced to return for two , three and even more tours of duty - will run , the authors estimate , to more than $ 700 billion .
And , they note , the care the government refuses to pay for does n't simply disappear as a cost .
It falls on the families themselves .
Someone pays it , so it 's part of the total .
Stiglitz and Bilmes do more than ferret out the operational , medical and other war costs hidden in various parts of the national budget .
When they also factor in reasonable estimates of the macroeconomic costs ( including interest on our staggering debt , the war - triggered increases in the price of oil ) , they are forced to add another $ 2 trillion to the cost of the war .
When they press on with their analysis and begin calculating the global costs as well - including such arcane and disconcerting calculations as the value of an Iraqi life figured , in terms of lost income generation , at 7 percent of an American life - suddenly there 's another $ 6 trillion .
Add it up , if you dare , and you wind up in the neighborhood of $ 11 trillion .
Helluva neighborhood .
But there 's more to the book than numbers .
The authors are clearly aware that to a certain extent they are calculating the incalculable : the value of our lost national credibility ( " We have become toxic " ) ; the value of human life ; the value of shattered hopes .
For instance , " The majority of Iraqi children are not attending school , " they note at one point .
The authors move on , but this is where I 'll stop .
If we truly face up to what we 've done , we 'll never go to war again .
Researchers have discovered that people who are incompetent generally lack the knowledge that they are incompetent .
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/01/18/MN73840.DTL
This lack of self - awareness is the glue that holds democracy together .
As long as people feel capable of evaluating complex economic and geopolitical policies , they will keep voting .
And as long as people vote , they will feel vested in the system and support it .
As regular readers know , voting is one of the few areas where I recognize my incompetence .
That ’s why I stay home on election day .
In my case , voting would be irrational .
One of the ways I recognize my own political incompetence is by observing how my opinions keep changing .
That should n’t be happening .
For example , a month ago I would have said Obama was the best choice for president because he is an inspirational leader , less divisive than Clinton , and he would bring our troops home from Iraq sooner than McCain .
Plus McCain is too old for the job .
It all seemed so simple .
Then I read an article that explained how much Obama would tax the people in my bracket compared to McCain ’s plan .
Ouch .
And I started thinking that over time , our all - volunteer army results in fighters who know they will end up in Iraq when they volunteer .
That was n’t the case when the war began , but it becomes that way if we stay indefinitely .
Who am I to tell another citizen that he or she should not take that risk for some benefit to the country that he or she perceives ?
The war is expensive , but at least McCain would take that money from the middle class majority , and being the majority , they are the ones who would need to elect McCain in the first place .
Why would I want to deny the majority the option of voting to pay more taxes than they need to so that I can pay less ?
They should have that freedom .
If I believed that Obama would pull 100 % of our troops out of Iraq , and that Al - Qaeda would surrender because of it , then McCain ’s plan of perpetual occupation would look foolish .
But as long as Al - Qaeda wants to kill me , no matter what my country does , I ’m willing to let volunteers try to shoot them first , as long as other people are paying for the bullets .
The war is bad for Iraqi civilians , but no one knows for sure if they would be worse off without the occupation , given the likelihood of greater civil war .
As important as that question is , you have to leave it out of the calculation because it is unknowable .
So I ask myself , is n’t the world better off if I just vote for McCain , buy stock in companies that profit from war , and let everyone else exercise their freedom of choice even if makes them poorer and / or dead ?
See why I do n’t vote ?
OKAY , OBAMA .
LET'S TALK ISSUES
PART 2 of 3

ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com
Energy & Environment :
In keeping with his Marxist ideology ( just like Hillary Clinton ) , Obama 's solutions are the same worn out rhetoric that comes out of the mouths of incumbents and candidates election after election .
As I have said in past columns , the environmental greenies and outright wackos are responsible for a great deal of what 's going on , but in the end , it 's YOUR member of Congress that casts the votes for all legislation and that includes forbidding drilling up in ANWR .
Not Greenpeace , Hollywood celebs , The Nature Conservancy or any other group , but the House of Representatives and the counterfeit Senate .
Barack Obama , another clone of proven liar , Al Gore and his inconvenient lies , is simply putting forth the agenda of the Communist Party .
March 3 , 2008 :
" Senator Obama will invest a 150 billion over ten years into creating over 5 million green jobs , many of which will be the wind and ethanol energy . "
Shapiro says . "
Hooray for Barack Obama !
HE'S going to invest $ 150 billion dollars of his own money because as president ( God forbid ) he would have NO authority to invest a single penny from the people 's purse .
Obama conveniently forgets there is NO money in the U.S. Treasury ; today it is $ 9.4 TRILLION dollars in the hole .
He and his colleagues in Congress , both parties , continue to write hot checks .
While Obama's on the campaign trail ( same as Marxist Clinton ) , Obama continues to promise HE will spend even more BORROWED money from a bankrupt treasury , constitutional or not and still the people cheer him on .
Obama and Clinton have served in office unlawfully for years .
The Democrats have controlled both houses for a year and a half and have done nothing .
What makes you think putting one of these Marxists in the White House will change anything ?
It wo n't because of the agenda being carried out by Democrats ; the environmental movement is just part of the new world order agenda :
Origin of the Totalitarian New World Order
" At the Sixth Party Congress held in Moscow in 1928 , Communists wrote and approved “ The Program ” to bring in the New World Order .
What most Americans do n't know is the real nature of this diabolical criminal scheme .
The Program of the Third International called for a global environmental program and for the transformation of all human beings on earth to accept the New World Order .
These and other facts are brought to light by General Benton Partin in his videotape , Globalism : The Program .
The Communists planned to use the global environmental program as a means of eradicating national sovereignty and creating a world dictatorship .
" All nations , nationalities , and national boundaries were to be replaced by an omnipotent , one - world government and regional governances .
The Communists did not want the American approach to liberty , with individual God - given rights protected by a government with limited powers .
The Communists did not want the American concept of rule of law .
They wanted unrestrained despotic government , power without limit , a world without laws — a brutal , terror - inspiring global totalitarian police state which could smash all laws of justice , launch campaigns of enslavement and mass murder , and eliminate opponents of the New World Order .
Twenty delegates from the U.S. voted for the 1928 Program of the Third International . "
Political Affairs Magazine , Marxist Thought On-line , has a new piece of propaganda , March 31 , 2008 , praising Obama and Clinton as the standard bearers for the Communist Party USA .
John Kerry was endorsed by the CPUSA because these America haters working to destroy our constitutional republic believed Kerry would advance the goals of the Communist Party .
Equally , this is their goal with promoting Obama or Clinton because their political ideology is Marxism .
As a matter of fact , the commies are giddy and expect to have landslide victories in November , not just the White House , but Congress as well .
Touting ' change ' as providing momentum , I would say reading between the lines of this toxic propaganda , the Communist Party USA really wants Obama in the White House : " Obama 's candidacy is unique in all of this excitement .
It is transformational and new .
It has brought new forces into the process and built new organizational forms . "
I highly recommend you watch this free Internet video from an event I put on in Santa Clara , California , in June 1998 .
This is my dear friend , Brigadier General Ben K Partin , ( Ret. ) .
It 's his speech on OKC and communist world domination .
It will drive the point home and hopefully awaken people to the true agenda being carried out by corrupt individuals in Washington , DC .
The solutions to lowering American 's energy dependence on foreign countries should have been undertaken thirty years ago .
Open more refineries , drill Gull Island and ANWR - two locations rich with oil reserves that can be developed in a safe , environmentally friendly manner .
Auto manufacturers need to mainstream hybrids .
My daughter drives a hybrid SUV in LA .
While she 's driving around , she 's not burning gas from Iraq or Saudi Arabia , she 's on a power cell .
If I have to replace one of my Jeeps , I will get a hybrid next .
I am a lover of our environment , animals and the beauty of our land , but Congress has allowed themselves to be bought like the cheap hookers they are by special interest environmental groups and the states have allowed themselves to be stomped in the process .
The big oil corporations who also purchase the favors of Congress have also played and manipulated the American people for profits .
I hope you can take the time to read this important column on Gull Island by one of the most intelligent and astute activists for decades , Dr. Stan Monteith .

And , speaking of the oil companies , execs are being grilled by the do - nothings in Congress .
Some are demanding the oil companies be punished with all kinds of taxes or government controls , Fascism in its purest form .
I am not sticking up for the oil companies because there is plenty of blame to go around .
However , these are private organizations , not government agencies .
Will Congress go after beer companies or manufacturers of aspirin because they raise their cost to the consumer ?
Yes , the oil company profits are obscene , but in a free market , it 's competition that keeps prices competitive and that means keeping the government out as well as getting rid of the million regulations crushing so many sectors of private enterprise .
It also means opening up available drilling within in the U.S. in a responsible way which can work for everyone .
Continuing to tax private corporations for the failures of Congress will not solve the problem because Congress created the problem decades ago , right along with corrupt scoundrels serving in YOUR state legislature and signed off by special interest driven governors .
Immigration .
" Where we can bring in more foreign - born workers with the skills our economy needs , we should . ” — Barack Obama , Statement on U.S. Senate Floor , May 23 , 2007
That 's right , Obama .
One in ten Americans in just the State of Ohio alone are on food stamps , but you want to bring in more foreign workers .
It says so right on your web site .
Of course to fool voters , you also claim to support enforcing the borders , but in the next breath : Let 's reunite all these illegals , let them pay a fine and continue working in jobs they stole from an American .
Let natural born Americans and naturalized Americans who did it the right way stand in the bread lines .
Following such warped logic , we should allow embezzlers and bank robbers to just pay a fine because after all , they only wanted to take what was n't theirs .
Why put them in jail ?
Why deport these criminals who break our immigration laws ?
Make no mistake about it : Barack Obama supports lawlessness .
Like Hillary Clinton , Ted Kennedy , John McCain and the smarmy , putrid , Sen. Lindsay Graham , Obama supports giving those who have thumbed their nose at our laws a free ride .
Obama is so intelligent he can't even understand what the word illegal means .
The blood of these innocents is on their hands .
Damn it , watch this free 2:18 second video ( with sound ) and then tell me you can vote for Obama , Clinton or McCain - ALL supporters of amnesty .
All murdered because of votes by Obama , McCain and Clinton , who have worked hard to protect these killers who smuggle themselves across our borders like thieves in the night .
The people you see in that video are n't just statistics .
They are our fellow Americans .
48,000 Americans have been slaughtered by illegal aliens since 911 .
SHAME on any American who casts a vote for Clinton , Obama or McCain .
Pray to God your loved one is n't the next statistic .
Foreign policy - judgment you can trust .
Whoopie !
Obama has a plan to end the war in Iraq .
So said all the Democrat candidates or incumbents up for reelection during the 2006 elections .
Well , here we are a year and half down the road and here 's something from another disappointed Democrat , Michael Moore , March 24 , 2008 :
" And where is Darth Vader in all this ?
A reporter from ABC News this week told Dick Cheney , in regards to Iraq , " Two - thirds of Americans say it 's not worth fighting . "
Cheney cut her off with a one word answer : " So ? " " So ? " As in , " So what ? "
As in , " F **k you .
I could care less . "
The Democrats have had the power to literally pull the plug on this war for the past 15 months -- and they have refused to do so . "
I 've never seen any of Moore 's movies , but he is right on this one :
His beloved Democrats have given Bush everything he wants since they took control of Congress for the immoral , unconstitutional invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan .
All those campaign promises in 2006 .
Empty words blowing in the wind .
Five years since this mad man in the White House declared " mission accomplished " in Iraq .
Too bad Congress has ignored Art. 1 , Section 8 , Clause 12 of the U.S. Constitution : " To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ; "
Obama states on his web site under the war section :
" Humanitarian Initiative : Obama believes that America has a moral and security responsibility to confront Iraq 's humanitarian crisis – two million Iraqis are refugees ; two million more are displaced inside their own country .
Obama will form an international working group to address this crisis .
He will provide at least $ 2 billion to expand services to Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries , and ensure that Iraqis inside their own country can find a safe - haven . "
Who made them refugees , Obama ?
The cowardice of the U.S. Congress .
The U.S. Constitution does NOT authorize Congress to steal one penny from the people 's treasury to give foreign aid or humanitarian aid to any country - even ones we have destroyed for no valid reason .
Obama is promising to provide $ 2 BILLION dollars from an empty treasury to further fleece the American people for more grotesque , unconstitutional looting .
" He will provide at least $ 2 billion .... "
Obama has zero authority to steal one penny from the treasury .
Comrade Obama also wants to further enslave you , your children and grand children with another goal of the communists in the form of a global poverty tax - a whopping $ 845 BILLION dollars from a treasury already overdrawn by $ 9.4 TRILLION dollars .
By the time the interest is paid on this unconstitutional tax , it will be double that amount .
Hello ?
Is anyone out there listening ?
All bills of expenditure must originate in the House of Representatives ; Art. 1 , Section 7 , not from the desk of a sitting president .
How can anyone vote for a candidate who has ZERO understanding of the U.S. Constitution ?

Sixteen days of email missing from Cheney ’s office
A White House chart shown to Congress indicates no e-mail was archived on 473 days for various units of the Executive Office of the President , a House committee chairman says .
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , says a White House spokesman ’s comments suggesting no e-mail had disappeared conflicted with what congressional staffers were told in September .
He also said the White House has refused to make the chart public .
On Thursday night , Waxman said he was scheduling a hearing for Feb. 15 and challenged the White House to explain spokesman Tony Fratto ’s remark that “ we have absolutely no reason to believe that any e-mails are missing . ”
Fratto based his comment on the contents of a White House declaration filed in federal court casting doubt on the accuracy of a chart created by a former White House employee that points to a large volume of e-mail gone from White House servers .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices surged to record levels Wednesday , topping $ 112 a barrel , after a government report showed an unexpected decline in crude supplies .
U.S. crude for May delivery climbed $ 2.37 to settle at $ 110.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , a new closing record .
Oil also set a new intraday high of $ 112.21 earlier in the session .
The previous intraday high of $ 111.80 was set March 17 , while the previous closing high of $ 110.33 was set March 13 .
In its weekly inventory report , the Energy Information Administration said crude stocks fell by 3.2 million barrels in the week ended April 4 .
Analysts had been expecting an increase of 2.4 million barrels , according to a Dow Jones poll .
The EIA said gasoline supplies fell by 3.4 million barrels .
Analysts had only expected a drop of 2.3 million barrels .
Distillates , used to make heating oil and diesel fuel , fell by 3.7 million barrels , more than the expected drop of 1.2 million barrels .
Record gas prices .
The supply report comes on a day when average gasoline prices hit a new record high of $ 3.343 at the pump , according to AAA .
Prices are up nearly 20 % from what they were last year .
This was despite the fact that demand for gasoline was up just 0.3 % compared to the same period last year , according to the EIA report .
Gasoline demand usually grows at about 1.5 % per year , but the slowing economy and rising prices have led consumers to cut back on driving .
Analysts said refiners are making less gas , and that 's contributing to the pump price surge , especially as the warm weather driving season approaches .
Refineries are running at 83.1 % capacity , according to the EIA .
They should be running at 89 % to 90 % this time of year , said Mark Waggoner , president of Excel Futures , a California - based commodities trading firm .
" Oil companies need to ramp up ... fast , " he said .
Weak dollar .
Before the EIA issued its report , oil prices were already higher due to the dollar 's slide against the euro Wednesday .
Many investors see commodities such as oil as an effective hedge against a falling dollar and inflation .
Also , a weaker greenback makes oil cheaper to investors overseas .
Analysts attribute much of oil 's rise this year to speculative buying tied to the falling dollar .
With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates several more times this year , which will likely further weaken the dollar , oil prices may continue rising despite tepid demand .

Tell us about the story ?
It 's a pretty funny story about internet spammers from an alien planet .
They pretty much spam the earth of their belongings and Bender helps the aliens along .
The series was axed by Fox in 2003 and throughout the movie there are lots of references to the fact that the writers were obviously quite bitter that it got cancelled ?
Oh yeah .
Well the opening five minutes is all about just a slap in the face to Fox which is pretty funny because every big corporation deserves a slap in the face every once in a while .
But they had it coming ( laughs ) .
It 's pretty funny .
Am I going to get fired for this ?
Anybody looking ?
Anybody ?
Do you know the story of all four movies then ?
Yes but I 'm not allowed to say the other plots .
But Bender does get a little pirate-y .
And there are various things that are gross .
I do n't know if anyone remembers the episode with the Slurm Queen when she sucks her own tail ?
It 's along them lines .
My father got disgusted by that .
So there 's really gross stuff and it 's really funny .
Are you feeling any pressure to make sure this film is a fantastic movie ?
I think people will get a real kick out of this and they 'll like it .
It 's a really , really funny movie .
There 's some really great jokes in it .
They 're really witty , deep and really strange , really out there .
Have you got a favourite episode ?
My favourite episode is the one about Fry 's dog .
It 's got the most depressing ending in animated series ' history .
It makes you want to cry at the end .
I was really blown away by that .
A lot of people would expect me to say a Bender 's episode is my favourite but that 's not the case .
Have you got a favourite Bender joke or catchphrase ?
One of my favourite lines is when Bender is walking up the side of the building with Fry and Leela .
They walk past this room and Bender shouts , ' Aargh get a room ' .
And they say , ' We 're in a room ' .
And he says , ' Well lose some weight ' .
That is Newsbeat 's questions out of the way .
Now it 's the turn of the fans to put Bender on the spot .
Why is Bender so selfish ?
( Ashley )
Bender is selfish because he can be .
What does his shiny metal ass taste like ?
( Seb )
Its got a little zincy kind of taste to it .
Did you ever lick a pole ?
I 'm not specifying which kind of pole you 're licking , but if you lick a poll it tastes like that .
Have you ever used your Bender voice for a prank phone call ?
( Cartey )
Some people will come up to me and go , ' Are you Bender ?
Oh my God .
My friend is the biggest fan ' .
I 'd be like , ' Dude give me your phone , call your friend up and I 'll leave a message saying , ' Yeah this is Bender , your favourite robot .
I 'm here with your friend but you are n't because you suck ' ' .
So yeah , I 've left messages .
Will Fry ever win Leela 's heart ?
How is The Crushinator ?
( Michael )
I do n't know if he 'll ever win Leela 's heart or if Leela will ever let him win it .
Basically that means I have no idea .
But keep the faith because you never know .
As for the Crushinator , she 's a little pain .
She keeps calling and I can't get her to get off the phone .
It 's very difficult because she 's a bigger robot than I am .
Does Leela have nice boobs ?
Leela has bigger boobs than she does eyes .
That 's as far as I can go ( laughs ) .
Bender 's Big Score is out on DVD on April 7 .
Alexis was nice enough to send me a bobble - head reddit alien to smash .

Adobe launched the Adobe Media Player 1.0 today .
Adobe 's Media Player is a standalone Video Jukebox application that runs under their AIR platform .
The Media Player is compatible with both PCs and Macs .
In many ways , the Adobe Media Player mimics iTunes Video and Podcast functionality by providing users with an all - enclosed application that provides access to network shows and podcasts .
Content is sparse at the moment , but Adobe has partnered with a number of content providers such as CBS , PBS , MTV and more .
Unlike iTunes , however , Adobe 's Media Player is not presently a " store " and offers free and ad- supported content .
Adobe , however , has said that it plans on adding payment systems later to offer purchase and rental options .
The player supports playback for FLV and h.264 encoded content at up to HD quality ( 1080 p , 720 p ) .
Content may be available for streaming or download with and without DRM depending on the rights granted by the content providers .
Predictably , there will be many iTunes users who do n't see the point of transitioning to a different player , but what this represents more than just another media player is the first effective cross-platform Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) video platform alternative .
As much as end users dislike DRM , the lack of an additional cross- platform video DRM has hindered some features on Mac .
Notably , Netflix stated that the lack of a publicly - available Mac DRM solution was what prevented them from offering their streaming service to the Mac .
It 's not clear if Netflix will necessarily adopt Adobe 's DRM , but this may open up additional alternatives to Apple 's iTunes for content delivery on the Mac .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil surged nearly 5 percent on Tuesday to hit a record over $ 100 a barrel on expectations OPEC will not hike output to ease high prices next month despite the economic woes of top consumer the United States .
An oil rig in a file photo .
Oil rose on Tuesday to the highest level in a month , above $ 98 a barrel , driven by expectations that supplies will be tight .
REUTERS / File
U.S. crude settled up $ 4.51 at $ 100.01 a barrel after hitting $ 100.10 a barrel , a penny higher than the previous high struck on January 3 .
London Brent crude settled up $ 3.65 at $ 98.56 a barrel .
News Nigerian oil delta rebel leader Henry Okah had died raised worries about supplies from the OPEC country , but a spokesman for the government later said he was alive and in custody .
“ Certainly OPEC is one of the supportive factors in the market as it has said it will not boost output at its meeting next month , ” said Eric Wittenauer , analyst at AG Edwards .
“ News that Nigerian rebels said their leader Henry Okah was shot dead helped give traders a reason for bidding the market up in the afternoon . ”
Worries about the economic health of the United States pushed oil off its record peak , but signs that OPEC will hold or even cut output when it meets on March 5 sent prices back to triple digits .
“ OPEC should maintain production or cut production , ” said Venezuela Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez , echoing comments made by OPEC President Chakib Khelil on Monday .
Other cartel officials said it would be hard to justify a reduction in supplies at current price levels , despite expectations demand will dip seasonally as the Northern Hemisphere winter comes to an end .
A rush of speculative investment in oil and other commodities helped push up prices in the asset class , traders said .
Further price support came from U.S. refinery problems and tensions between U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil XOM.N and Venezuela over the takeover of an oil project last year .
A fire on Monday shut Alon USA Energy ’s 67,000 barrel per day refinery in Big Spring , Texas , and officials said they were expecting to partially restart the plant in about two months .
The outage , as well as seasonal refinery maintenance , helped send U.S. RBOB gasoline and heating oil futures to record highs as well .
Crude prices began to rally last week when Venezuela cut exports to Exxon Mobil after the U.S. company won court rulings to freeze $ 12 billion of the OPEC nation ’s assets as part of an arbitration battle .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday the state could sue Exxon for unpaid oil taxes and repeated threats to cut oil sales to the United States .
A move by LUKOIL to cut supplies to German refineries over a pricing dispute also put markets on edge .
A Reuters poll of analysts forecast U.S. government data due out on Thursday would show a 2.3 million barrel build in U.S. crude stocks , a 2 million barrel draw in distillate inventories , and a 600,000 barrel rise in gasoline stocks .
How do you fancy tucking into a bowl of ice cream that has no more fat than a carrot ?
Or eating a burger that will lower your cholesterol ?
If you are allergic to peanuts , perhaps you 'd like to fix your food so that any nut traces pass harmlessly through your body .
Welcome to the world of nanofoods , where almost anything is possible : where food can be manipulated at an atomic or molecular level to taste as delicious as you want , do you as much good as you want , and stay fresh for ... well , who knows ?
A world where smart pesticides are harmless until they reach the stomachs of destructive insects ; where food manufacturers promise an end to starvation ; where smart packaging sniffs out and destroys the micro-organisms that make good food go bad .
In short , a food heaven to those who see it spelling the end of obesity and poor diet .
Food hell to those who believe the case for nanofood safety is still far from proven .
One thing is certain : after the controversy that surrounded genetically modified foods , nano is set to become the next kitchen battleground .
Nanotechnology has its roots in a talk delivered in 1959 by physicist Richard Feynman to the American Physical Society .
He predicted a time when individual atoms and molecules might be used as the building blocks for a set of tools that could then make a smaller set , and so on .
The scale he was talking about strains the imagination .
A nanometer - nm - ( from the Greek word nanos , dwarf ) is one - billionth of a metre .
To help you visualise how small that is , a red blood cell is about 7,000nm across , a human hair 80,000nm wide and a water molecule slightly less than 0.3nm in diameter .
The science of nanotechnology generally inhabits the region of 0.1 nm to 100nm .
The science behind the theory became a reality in the 1980s with the invention of specialist microscopes which allowed scientists to see how atoms and molecules behaved in different conditions .
By manipulating those conditions - say , with other chemicals , heat , moisture , electromagnetism and so on - they could encourage atoms and molecules to form useful shapes .
This resulted in the creation of new nanomaterials built at the atomic level that promise to revolutionise everything from chemistry to aeronautics .
Some nanotechnology products are already on the market - sunscreens , for example , make use of titanium oxide , TiO2 .
At larger scales TiO2 is white , opaque and good for blocking ultraviolet light .
However , at the nanoscale it becomes transparent while retaining its UV - blocking properties , making it perfect for protection against the sun 's harmful rays .
Others look set to follow .
Carbon nanotubes , for example , could revolutionise the construction industry .
Seamless tubes of graphite one atom thick and 10,000 long ( to the naked eye , large quantities would look like soot ) , carbon nanotubes are up to 100 times stronger than steel but around eight times lighter .
They can be teased into a twine that can be woven into sheets and , potentially , mixed with composites to eventually overhaul the way - and the height to which - we build .
And those buildings could be covered with solar cells made from nanomaterials that could supply all their energy needs .
In medicine , " nanocapsules " containing pharmaceuticals that can be programmed to release their cargoes only on contact with , say , cancer cells , are promising new and improved treatments .
Not surprising , then , that the proponents of nanotechnology predict that it will lead to a new industrial revolution .
In food , however , the excitement is being matched by health and environmental concerns at all three stages of production : farming , processing and packaging .
In its report , Down on the Farm , the ETC Group , an independent Canadian technology watchdog , predicts : " From soil to supper , nanotechnology will not only change how every step of the food chain operates , but it will also change who is involved .
At stake is the world 's $ 3 trillion food retail market , agricultural export markets valued at $ 544bn , the livelihoods of 2.6 billion farming people , and the wellbeing of the rest of us who depend upon farmers for our daily bread . "
Nano - futurists do n't dispute that , one day , nanofoods will be everywhere .
They envisage a day when tiny sensors called motes or smart dust will radio information to the farmer detailing what is going on in his field , inside his crops and in the bodies of his animals so that he can optimise his yields .
While such " precision farming " is some way off , nanotechnology is already here in the form of smart pesticides , or nanocides .
Syngenta , Monsanto and BASF are among companies that have either developed or are researching pesticides on the nano - scale that they claim will be more stable , longer - lasting and deadlier to pests .
Several of these have already passed safety tests and are licensed for use in Britain and the US .
Their active ingredients have been around for years without causing problems ; only the delivery method has changed .
This involves controlled - release systems that use small polymer capsules which can be more evenly diluted in liquid , be programmed to " stick " to the parts of plants where they are needed , and even remain inert until activated by the alkaline content of a certain insect 's stomach ; only then do they burst open and kill the pest .
Agrochemical companies argue that this means the pesticides are smarter , need lower concentrations of active ingredients , can be programmed not to harm " friendly " insects , and are more easily and safely broken down in the environment .
Packaging , too , may change .
Coatings made from smart nanoparticles that can sniff out the telltale gases given off by deteriorating food will trigger colour changes on labels .
The label will also tell you when something is ripe .
It 's called intelligent packaging .
But there is a problem .
There are signs that consumers will recoil from any food to which this new technology is applied .
Several years ago , the big food companies were happy to talk about products that might be in the pipeline .
Famously , Kraft Foods described a tasteless , odourless drink that might contain dozens of flavours , colours and nutrients in billions of microcapsules that could be activated - possibly by microwave - at home .
You might turn it into a strawberry - flavoured drink , while I might opt for lemon and lime .
Then came the consumer opposition to GM .
Nowadays it is difficult to get food companies even to admit they are conducting researching into nano .
However , one firm of German technology analysts , the Helmut Kaiser Consultancy , estimates that hundreds of food companies are conducting research into nanotechnology .
Its latest report says : " The nanofood market [ soared ] from $ 2.6bn in 2003 to $ 5.3bn in 2005 and is expected to reach $ 20.4bn in 2010 .
The nano - featured food - packaging market will grow from $ 1.1 bn in 2005 to $ 3.7bn in 2010 .
More than 400 companies around the world are active in research , development and production .
The US is the leader , followed by Japan and China .
By 2010 , Asia , with more than 50 % of the world population , will become the biggest market for nanofood , with China in the leading position . "
I approached five of the world 's largest food companies , Kraft , Cadbury Schweppes , Unilever , Nestlé and HJ Heinz .
Cadbury Schweppes said it was " keeping a watching brief " but was not actively researching nanofood ;
Heinz had no plans to use nanotechnology ; and Kraft and Nestlé made no comment .
Unilever , however , was willing to provide a food manufacturer 's perspective .
Charles - François Gaudefroy , whose job title - head of consumer confidence and sustainability for research and development - is indicative of the task ahead of him , says there is much hype about nanofood .
" There are some people who say nanotechnology is everywhere , " he says .
" Well , I 'd like to see it first .
We do not have it in food at the moment , but the potential is manifold , particularly in stabilising foods and enhancing their nutritional properties .
For example , if you squeeze an orange and drink it now , you will get vitamin C from it , but if you leave it a while , all the vitamin C will vanish .
Putting the vitamin C in nanocapsules can allow it to be released only when it is drunk .
" And [ it could be useful in ] stabilising nutrients in food .
For example , iron and essential fats such as omega - 3 do not remain stable in liquids ; they oxidise and that changes the colour , odour , the taste of the product ...
You could use nanotechnology to stabilise the nutritional properties of products and that would be of benefit to people with deficiencies - anaemia , for example . "
Food companies , he says , are also excited by the prospect of intelligent packaging and the ability to give foods a longer shelf life .
" In Africa , there is food , but part of the issue is bringing it to the table and increasing its nutrition profile to give children a better start .
Stabilisation of nutrients and enabling longer shelf life are areas of development that can reduce suffering . "
In Europe , any nanofoods would have to gain approval under a European Commission directive on new foods and ingredients that was introduced in 1997 to regulate genetically modified products or those manipulated at a molecular level .
The directive requires such products to be assessed by member states before a licence can be granted .
In Britain , the EU and the US , moves have been made to introduce voluntary codes of practice for research and manufacturing in nanotechnology , but hard legislation is lagging behind .
So what about safety ?
A report by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2004 expressed concern that little was known about the behaviour of nanoparticles in the environment and recommended that waste containing them should be treated as hazardous until proven otherwise .
Since then , the Royal Society and the Council for Science and Technology ( CST ) , the government 's main advisory body on science issues , has criticised ministers for failing to put measures in place for assessing the environmental risks .
" There is a pressing need for a programme of central government spending [ on research ] into the toxicology , health and environmental effects of nanotechnologies , " the chairman of the CST 's nanotechnologies sub -group , Professor John Beringer , said in March last year .
" Without a substantial home research endeavour , the UK risks being left out in the cold in future international collaboration .
To put it bluntly , the safe development of a new technology should not depend on whether an academic wins a highly competitive research grant . "
The US's Environmental Protection Agency has set up a committee to develop a framework for safety legislation , but the tendency so far has been to accept nano - manipulated materials as being no different from their larger relatives .
But any chemist will tell you that materials behave differently at different sizes .
Aluminium , for example , is stable in everyday concentrations , but becomes explosive at micro- fine levels .
" I think the authorities know this and they are concerned , but they 've been caught flat - footed , " says Pat Mooney , the executive director of ETC .
" I met a guy who said his company was shipping carbon nanotubes but they 'd started limiting the shipment to a couple of kilos at a time because in concentrations of more than that they tended to become explosive .
His company did n't know why .
That inevitably raises questions about nanotechnology in pesticides and food . "
Lynn Frewer , professor of food safety and consumer behaviour at Wageningen University in the Netherlands , acknowledges the potential benefits nanotechnology could bring , but when I ask her about the risks , she says : " The problem with the digestion of nanoparticles is that we do n't know where in the body they would end up .
If they are small enough to travel through the wall of the gut , which some nanoparticles would be designed to do , they could end up anywhere .
And how will they accumulate and travel through the food chain ?
We simply do n't know . "
Dr Mike Bushell , Syngenta 's research head , disagrees , arguing that nano - sized particles are more easily and safely degraded in the environment .
There is , then , much disagreement in an industry still in its infancy , an industry that has n't yet got international standards of safety .
There is n't even an internationally accepted lexicon of nanotechnology .
Last year , the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington , an independent Washington - based research institute , published a report entitled Nanotechnology in Agriculture and Food .
It expressed concern at the lack of research , concluding : " Neither industry nor government appears to be doing its homework .
Products could end up in the market without a proper assessment of risk or end up indefinitely halted at the threshold of commercialisation . "
Whether nano - engineered foodstuffs land on our tables will , to a large extent , depend on consumers .
If it proves as controversial as GM to many food buyers and environmentalists , then marketing it could be difficult - something of which the industry is well aware .
Unilever 's Gaudefroy says : " There are areas where debate is vital and it is only just beginning .
Much of this is driven by what happened with GM .
We have to explain to consumers the good side of nanotechnology and what benefits it can bring them .
" Food regulations , in particular the EU 's novel - foods directive , prescribe stringent environmental and safety evaluation before anything is introduced to the market .
I can see areas where people could be afraid of nanotechnology - in weaponry , for example .
But in food ?
No .
I really do n't see mad scientists doing mad things . "
· This article was amended on Thursday April 3 2008 .
In the article above we originally said that any nanofood product would have to be approved and licensed under a European directorate .
We meant directive , not directorate .
This has been corrected .
How much would you pay to have a small memory chip implanted in your brain if that chip would double the capacity of your short - term memory ?
Or guarantee that you would never again forget a face or a name ?
There ’s good reason to consider such offers .
Although our memories are sometimes spectacular  we are very good at recognizing photos , for example  our memory capacities are often disappointing .
Faulty memories have been known to lead to erroneous eyewitness testimony ( and false imprisonment ) , to marital friction ( in the form of overlooked anniversaries ) and even death ( sky divers have been known to forget to pull their ripcords  accounting , by one estimate , for approximately 6 percent of sky - diving fatalities ) .
The dubious dynamics of memory leave us vulnerable to the predations of spin doctors ( because a phrase like “ death tax ” automatically brings to mind a different set of associations than “ estate tax ” ) , the pitfalls of stereotyping ( in which easily accessible memories wash out less common counterexamples ) and what the psychologist Timothy Wilson calls “ mental contamination . ”
To the extent that we frequently can’t separate relevant information from irrelevant information , memory is often the culprit .
All this becomes even more poignant when you compare our memories to those of the average laptop .
Whereas it takes the average human child weeks or even months or years to memorize something as simple as a multiplication table , any modern computer can memorize any table in an instant  and never forget it .
Why ca n’t we do the same ?
Much of the difference lies in the basic organization of memory .
Computers organize everything they store according to physical or logical locations , with each bit stored in a specific place according to some sort of master map , but we have no idea where anything in our brains is stored .
We retrieve information not by knowing where it is but by using cues or clues that hint at what we are looking for .

 Last updated : April 3 , 2008 Until recently , most Comcast systems passed all HD as is from the content provider , without any added compression or quality reduction .
In response to competitive pressures from DirecTV and Verizon FiOS , Comcast recently decided to sacrifice some quality to improve quantity .
By early April , most Comcast systems will recompress and degrade their HD , much like DirecTV and Dish Network do on their MPEG - 2 channels .
This creates room for new HD channels without the need to eliminate a significant number of analog channels .
Previously , Comcast allocated a maximum of two HD channels per 38.8 Mbps QAM , so each channel had the full 19.4 M bps available if needed .
Now , with the addition of new channels , Comcast is squeezing three HD channels into each 38.8 Mbps QAM .
Furthermore , some existing QAMs with two HD channels are being recompressed in preparation for new channel additions .
But what does that mean ?
How much difference is there , really ?
To find out , I decided to compare the quality of the same programs on Comcast and Verizon FiOS .
I recorded thefrom the , at the , on both Comcast and Verizon FiOS in N. VA .
I compared the size and bitrate of each MPEG - 2 recording , as well as the subjective quality with video .
Note when I tested channels late last year , there were no differences between the two providers on HD .
Any differences are new .
BackgroundComcast is recompressing local HD channels in some areas and not others .
Quality issues with local HD channels could be the fault of your area Comcast or the local affiliate ; to determine that , you would need to compare the cable and off - air feed from an antenna .
As of March 18 , Comcast is not recompressing ESPN - HD or ESPN2 - HD .
The Comcast cable channels with added compression are listed as follows , grouped by QAM .
Discovery Channel HDSciFi HDUSA HDAnimal Planet HDDiscovery HD TheaterThe History Channel HDFood Network HDNational Geographic Channel HDUniversal HDA&E HDHGTV HDStarz HDExtra compression is also applied to other channels in many markets , including CNN - HD , MHD , TLC-HD , HBO -HD , and Cinemax - HD.
All of the channel groups above are re-compressed at the Comcast Media Center ( CMC ) in Denver and uplinked to the AMC18 satellite for distribution to Comcast systems around the country .
If your Comcast system has all ( or most ) of the channels listed above , then the added compression is likely in effect on your system .
Former Adelphia systems appear to be one exception to that rule ; a number of former Adelphia systems are passing the original source feeds as is , and have not yet switched to the recompressed feeds from the CMC .
Bitrates Average bitrates were obtained by comparing the size of each recording , in total bytes , and dividing by the total number of seconds reported by VideoRedo .
Multiplied by 8 to convert MBps to Mbps .

Comments
It is obvious that the quality of the source signal plays a significant role in amount of degradation seen with Comcast 's newly added compression .
Sources like Discovery Channel ( not Discovery Theater ) and Universal HD areto start with , and adding extra compression on top of that causes the picture to deteriorate rapidly with excessive noise and detail loss .
In contrast , higher - quality sources like Discovery Theater still look very good , with the only obvious differences being some added noise and some minor loss of fine detail during motion .
For the most part , fine detail remains very good on static ( non-moving ) images with Comcast 's added compression , but you do see reduced contrast , with more dithering artifacts ( banding ) between colors and objects .
With some channels , it looks a bit like Comcast is taking a 24 - bit image and reducing it to 18 - 20 bit .
This tends to reduce the ' pop ' effect in some images .
The greatest differences are seen with movement .
With slow movement on Comcast , the first thing you notice is added noise and a softer image , as fine detail is filtered from the picture signal .
The greater the rate of movement , the more detail you lose and the more noise you see .
With intense movement , you see more blocking and skipped frames .
In VideoRedo , I noticed that a number of frames in the FiOS signal simply did not exist in the Comcast signal during motion intensive scenes .
This may be responsible for the stutter and excessive motion blur seen with some video sequences on Comcast .
To Comcast 's credit , I saw little to no difference on movie channels such as HBO , Cinemax , and Starz .
I did see some blurring and reduced detail during fast movement on Starz , but the recordings from Cinemax and HBO were virtually identical , even on action movies such as 300 and Gladiator .
When there was blocking on the Comcast feed of Cinemax , that blocking was also on the FiOS feed .
I removed the comment on Food HD because I did not see that issue in my 3/30 recording of Paula 's Home Cooking .
NGCHD on Comcast looks just as good as NGC - HD on FiOS , save for some blurring during fast motion , such as animals running across the screen .
The HGTVD source feed is clearly overcompressed .
Blocking and blurring is common on this channel with both Comcast and FiOS .
It is not specific to Comcast .
Comcast is responsible for some added noise on both static and moving images , but the differences really pale in comparison to the problems with the original source feed .

Ubuntu 8.04 alpha 4 was officially released today and is now available for testing .
This alpha offers an early look at some of the features that will be included in the final 8.04 release , which is scheduled for April .
Codenamed Hardy Heron , Ubuntu 8.04 will be the second long - term support ( LTS ) release , which means that it will be supported on the desktop for three years and on the server for five years .
We tested alpha 4 ourselves , and we are very impressed with some of the hot new features .
Ubuntu 8.04 is the first version to include PulseAudio , an open - source sound server that offers sophisticated mixing capabilities and network transparency .
PulseAudio offers several potential improvements to the desktop user experience , including support for independently controlling the volume of individual applications , transferring audio streams between devices , and outputting a stream on multiple devices at the same time .
PulseAudio is installed by default in alpha 4 but has n't been fully integrated into the system yet .
During this stage of the transition , volume controls are inaccessible , so there is n't much testing that one can do with it right now .
Another very significant architectural change in Ubuntu 8.04 is the inclusion of GIO and GVFS , a new I/O abstraction layer and virtual file system mechanism .
GVFS replaces the antiquated GnomeVFS library and uses the D - Bus interprocess communication protocol to coordinate between various daemons that handle mounting and file operations .
These components have been integrated into Nautilus , the GNOME file manager .
There are still some bugs that need to be resolved and not all of the previously supported network protocols are working with it yet , but it already provides a few new features that are visible to the user .
In particular , Nautilus will now queue up long file transfer operations and display them in a single window rather than spawning a separate window for each file transfer operation .
File transfer queue in Nautilus using GVFS
Ubuntu 8.04 also adds PolicyKit , a new framework for secure privilege escalation .
The Ubuntu developers aim to completely eliminate the anachronistic gksudo component by bringing pervasive Policy Kit integration to every corner of the system .
Unlike gksudo , which grants elevated root privileges to an entire program , Policy Kit makes it possible to isolate privileged actions and make them accessible to programs through a D - Bus interface .
This approach provides a much higher level of security and also gives administrators more flexible control over what operations are accessible to individual users .
Policy Kit still uses password prompts like gksudo , so the difference to end users will be minimal .
In some system configuration utilities , like the network settings tool , there are now Unlock buttons which , when clicked , will present the user with a password prompt before making privileged elements of the user interface accessible .
PolicyKit also includes an authorization management tool that provides an overview of all the privileged operations exposed through PolicyKit and allows administrators to configure permissions for each individual operation .
The PolicyKit authorization manager tool
There are a handful of other subtle improvements in Ubuntu 8.04 that are already present in this alpha release .
The panel clock applet , for instance , has been improved to include support for displaying weather information and times for multiple locations in its expanded view .
Ubuntu 8.04 also replaces the unmaintained GNOME BitTorrent client with Transmission , a cross- platform BitTorrent client that offers a nice GTK interface for Linux .
Also new is the Brasero CD burning program and a much - improved System Monitor utility with a rich Cairo - based visual display .
The new GNOME System Monitor tool
The new world clock feature
Although many of the significant architectural features like PulseAudio and GIO are still in transitional stages and are n't fully functional yet , Ubuntu 8.04 alpha 4 is still very impressive .
I 'm a big fan of D - Bus , and I 'm very pleased to see it being adopted throughout the entire desktop stack in core components .
I 'm also very impressed with the relative completeness of Policy Kit integration , and I 'm looking forward to the promised performance improvements and support for pausing file transfers that we should get when GIO is more mature .
Many of the major pieces are falling into their proper places for Hardy Heron , but there are still some things that have n't landed yet .
One of the significant features planned for 8.04 , for instance , is a complete visual refresh , with totally new artwork and new GTK theme .
The new artwork has n't begun showing up yet .
It should be noted that this is a prerelease and is n't intended for use in production environments .
Some parts are particularly fragile , and the Ubuntu developers are encouraging users to refrain from using Nautilus to operate on valuable files until GVFS stabilizes a bit .
Users who want to test Ubuntu 8.04 alpha 4 can download an installation ISO and give it a try .
ISOs are also available for Kubuntu , Edubuntu , Ubuntu JeOS , Xubuntu , and Gobuntu .
As the RIAA 's legal battle against suspected file - sharers has unfolded , one of the arguments put forth by some defendants is that the statutory damages sought by the RIAA are unconstitutionally excessive .
That 's one of the defenses articulated by Ray Beckerman , attorney for the defendant in UMG v. Lindor .
In a ruling issued yesterday , Judge Robert M. Levy ordered the record labels to provide Marie Lindor with the expenses incurred for each of the 38 songs at issue in the case , writing that Lindor 's request may " lead to the discovery of admissible evidence . "
The request by Lindor seems innocuous enough .
" (A ) Set forth all expenses incurred by plaintiffs , per authorized song file download , in connection with the thirty eight ( 38 ) songs ... , and ( B ) annex copies of all documents kept in the ordinary course of business of plaintiffs sufficient to support said statement of expenses . "
In a court filing last month , the RIAA argued that Lindor 's request was unclear and that she already had information sufficient to make a defense that the statutory damages sought by the labels ( $ 750 - 150,000 ) are unconstitutional .
Most tellingly , the RIAA also says that " they do not have the analysis requested " and could not perform it without " enormous expense " requiring " lengthy and complex analysis . "
In Capitol v. Thomas , the only file - sharing case to go to trial so far , Sony BMG head of litigation Jennifer Pariser testified that she had no idea about the extent of the actual damages suffered by the recording industry .
" We have n't stopped to calculate the amount of damages we 've suffered due to downloading , but that 's not what 's at issue here , " she told Jammie Thomas ' attorney during cross-examination .
The jury found that Thomas willfully infringed on the labels ' copyrights , awarding them $ 9,250 in statutory damages for each song .
Thomas quickly announced her intention to appeal , and her first step was to ask the judge to slash the damages award .
In her notice of remittur , Thomas made the same argument as Lindor , saying that the jury 's award was unconstitutionally excessive .
Beckerman has argued that the RIAA 's actual damages are in the neighborhood of 70 ¢ per song , less than 0.1 percent of the minimum statutory damages provided for by the Copyright Act .
The RIAA initially fought to keep its wholesale pricing secret , but its lead counsel has since admitted that the 70¢ figure is in the right neighborhood .
Beckerman would like to see any damages capped at no more than 10 times the amount of actual damages should infringement be proven .
The RIAA 's position is that statutory damages need not be tied to actual damages , and that it 's fine with whatever a jury is willing to mete out .
The group might also argue that capping damages at 70 ¢ per song is not appropriate , given that the songs may have been downloaded countless times from the defendant over a P2P network .
One potential problem with that argument is that the labels are unable to show any evidence that the songs have been downloaded by anyone other than SafeNet , the company retained by the RIAA to investigate illicit downloading .
Okay , we can divide this down right away into two categories : Pickup lines that just plain suck , and solid communication that comes across like a pickup line that sucks if not delivered properly .
We ’ll address them both .
Pickup lines that just plain suck , period :
These are listed as “ Most Popular Pickup Lines ” .
We ’re taking them to task and trashing them , without permission , under the “ Fair Use ” doctrine .
Lame - pickup - line - users worldwide may revolt .
Let them .
So here ’s the collection of lameness :
Is that the sun coming up ... or is that just you lighting up my world ?
Let 's make like a fabric softener and snuggle .
Is your last name Gillete cause your the best a man can get .
Do you want to make millions ?
millions of babies !
Hi , have you got a boyfriend ?
( if no , ) Are you taking applications ?
My love for you is like the universe ... neverending !!
Your senses must be messed up ' cuz your eyes are talkin ' to me .
I tripped on a kiss and fell in love with you .
These do n’t work .
Normally I ’m gracious , and I rarely make dogmatic statements .
If something just “ mostly sucks ” , usually you ’ll hear me saying , “ Okay , xyz does n’t usually work , however with the right delivery … ”
With these “ pickup lines ” ?
Nope .
No chance .
They suck , and do n’t work .
At all .
Ever. Period .
Why do n’t they work ?
Because they ’re written to shield you from putting your ego on the line .
When you deliver one of these , it ’s not YOU , it ’s some lame pickup line writer somewhere who is probably a virgin .
Most guys are afraid of “ putting themselves on the line ” , so they hide behind “ joking ” that they ’re interested in the girl .
And girls do n’t dig that .
So what ’s better ?
Try communicating what you DO like – A favorite of mine is to say , “ I saw you standing over here , and I had to say that [ UNIQUE QUALITY ABOUT HER ] is really [ NON - CLICHÉ COMPLIMENT ] . ”
I saw you standing over here , and I had to say your hair is really shimmering , just absolutely beautiful .
I saw you walking by , and I had to say that you ’ve got the most deadly walk I ’ve ever seen .
I saw you sitting here , and I had to say your fashion is just totally fantastic .
Mean it !
Do n’t make stuff up , or use generic garbage like “ You look pretty ! ”
When this fails –
If it comes across like it ’s canned , like a regular trash “ pickup line ” , it wo n’t work .
In fact , you already know regular pickup lines do n’t work if you ’ve tried using them .
So instead try making more unique comments , while working on –
Getting the delivery right !
Delivery is EVERYTHING with the words you speak to a girl .
You ’re going to want to speak smoothly and slowly , employ long pauses for emphasis , and add emotion to how you speak .
One of the problems is many guys have never heard good delivery of an unpickup line so to speak .
The idea of how to compliment a girl correctly is so totally alien to them that they just “ blurt out ” what they ’re saying , which inevitably messes up the delivery , and the girl gives you the cold shoulder .
Suck .
Ouch .
That ’s why I worked with Seduction Tuition to put up some unique audio samples for you to check out and learn from .

In your corner ,
Sebastian Drake
1966 : A U.S. Air Force B - 52 bomber collides with its refueling tanker jet in mid-air over the Spanish coast .
Its four hydrogen bombs fall to earth near the fishing village of Palomares .
The bomber collided with the KC - 135 tanker at 31,000 feet .
Exploding fuel completely destroyed the tanker , killing all four crew members .
The B - 52 broke apart , spilling its payload – four Type B28RI hydrogen bombs equipped with 1.45 - megaton warheads .
Three hit the ground near Palomares while the fourth fell into the Mediterranean Sea .
Three members of the bomber 's seven - man crew were killed in what became known as the Palomares hydrogen bombs incident .
Although the conventional explosives contained in two of the four bombs detonated , there was no nuclear holocaust .
But there was radioactive contamination around the crash site , with plutonium scattered over 2 square kilometers .
Around 1,750 tons of earth was excavated and shipped to the United States for disposal .
The bomb that landed in the sea went missing for 80 days and became the object of an intensive search by the United States , which was afraid the Soviets might try to recover it .
A local fisherman , Francisco Simo Orts , had seen it hit the water and was enlisted to help the U.S.
Navy establish the basis for its search operation .
When the bomb was finally found , Simo Orts turned up in New York with an attorney , demanding the salvage award he claimed was due him in accordance with maritime law .
The U.S. secretary of defense said the bomb was worth $ 2 billion .
Simo
Orts asked for $ 20 million , or 1 percent of the bomb 's value , again in accordance with the custom of maritime law .
The Air Force eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum .

On Tuesday during the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about the progress of the Iraq war Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama suggested once again that we should implement a diplomatic surge that would include talking to Iran about the situation in Iraq .
Putting aside Iraq for a minute , because Iran ’s meddling in Iraq stems from the same reason why they are developing a nuclear program , I think that it is fair to ask whether Obama is right to want to talk to Iran ?
In my opinion there really is n’t a choice here , it is not a matter of wanting to talk to Iran , but having to talk to Iran .
The Iranians learned from N. Korea that the fastest way to get the U.S. to sit down and talk is to work on developing nuclear weapons .
Thanks to the blunder that is the Iraq war , the fragile geo-political balance of the Middle East has been shattered .
Iran is now the dominant power in the region .
Once the U.S. leaves Iraq , there will be no one there to keep Iran in check , if you would describe what we are doing right now as keeping anything in check in Iraq .
However , the American presence in Iraq does provide one advantage .
While U.S. troops are there , the Iranians are always going to fear an invasion .
This fear is also what is fueling their nuclear ambitions .
The next U.S. president will have a window of about 18 months before the troops are fully out of Iraq where both sides can sit down and talk .
Iran does support terrorism , but this would n’t be the first time that the U.S. government has sat down with a nation that engages in this activity .
In fact , most of our so called “ friends ” in the region have done many of the same things as Iran , so let ’s please put the self - righteous bellowing away .
Advertisements
What the next president has to weigh is whether it worse to sit down and talk to Iran , or do nothing and let them go nuclear ?
Notice that I did n’t mention military action because to all except the ill educated , and conspiracy theorists that option is off the table , America currently does not , and will not for several years , have the capacity to attack Iran .
What people who want to attack Iran seem to forget is that this is a nation that has 15.6 million men who are fit for military service .
The 140,000 U.S. troops in the region would not be even close to enough .
Nothing short of a military draft would be required for the U.S. to invade Iran .
Iran is not Iraq .
It would take more than some bombing and a skeleton staff to get the job done .
As we learned from the resounding failure of the Bush administration ’s hard line stance with N. Korea , a democracy ca n’t out hard line an authoritarian government .
Conservatives , who like to talk tough about Iran , do n’t want to face the reality that negotiation is the best way out of this situation for everyone .
What the Iranians want more than anything are assurances that the United States wo n’t invade them .
What the U.S. wants is for Iran to open their nuclear program to inspectors .
If the inspectors determine that weapons are being built , then the program must be halted .
Other politicians are worried about looking strong or weak on the issue , but it appears that Obama sees the situation for what it is .
America ’s options are limited here .
For the United States , a nuclear Iran is the worst possible outcome .
I do n’t think that any president should roll out the red carpet for Iran , nor should they want to form a close diplomatic relationship , but on this one issue , discussion and diplomacy are the best options .
We tried to win in the Middle East with bluster and bullets , and now it is time for a different approach .
There is too much at stake for America not to try .
Printing invitations , photos , shipping labels , and other paper items from a home computer is one do - it - yourself activity many people erroneously adopt in an effort to save money .
While printing from home rather than buying in a store can save money in some cases , it may actually cost more in others .
Those who believe they are always saving by printing from home may minimize or overlook the cost of ink and paper in their calculations .
A search for ink - jet printer cartridges and all - purpose paper on Walmart.com ( which , for better or worse , is a store where a typical bargain shopper will be likely to buy these items ) yielded a broad range of prices .
The most expensive and least expensive brand - name cartridges both cost about 2.5 cents per page to print ( based on the estimated page yield stated in the product descriptions ) .
Spot - checked prices for other cartridges had per-page prices of more than 3 cents .
( If your printer requires more than one cartridge – say , black and color – you have to add those prices together . )
One off brand had a much lower price , just over half a cent per page .
Another reputable online retailer , 247inktoner.com , has compatible ink and toner cartridges at a fraction of the cost of the name brand cartridges .
All - purpose paper bought by the ream , also on Walmart.com , cost an additional penny per page .
The lowest price for photo paper ( fifty 4×6 sheets ) was sixteen cents per page .
At Staples.com , the bestseller list includes Avery shipping labels .
They cost $ 11.99 for a 25 sheets of 30 labels each – 48 cents per sheet .
Specialty papers , such as those used for resumes and invitations , also add to print - at - home costs .
So how can you keep printing costs as low as possible ?
The most obvious answer is to print less .
You can accomplish this goal several ways :
Ask yourself if you really need to print .
If you need a hard copy to carry with you , give to a client , or keep as a historical record , print .
If an electronic copy of a document is equally practical and effective , skip the hard copy .
Get it right the first time .
Before you print anything , proofread it carefully .
Check the page margins , font , and other relevant details .
By catching errors before you print , you can avoid printing documents multiple times before getting a perfect copy .
Send away for photos .
Even buying the lowest - priced photo paper and ink from Walmart.com will cost you more than 16 cents per 4 x 6 photo .
Several online photo sites — Snapfish , York Photo , even Wal - Mart — offer better quality prints at lower per-photo prices .
Even after shipping costs ( which you can avoid or decrease by taking advantage of special offers ) , it pays to send away .
Plus you do n’t have to deal with the frustration of photos not printing correctly or printers breaking down .
Copy and paste .
Put the relevant information from a web page or email into a word processing document before you print so that you do n’t waste ink on header information , ads , and other details you do n’t need .
Practice your handwriting .
Rather than print out driving directions , confirmation numbers , or other short bits of information , go low - tech and write down the details you need on a piece of scrap paper .
Once you ’re printing as little as possible , you can look for ways to reduce the cost of materials .
Do n’t buy address labels .
Instead , print addresses on plain paper and stick them to envelopes with shipping tape .
Some frequent shippers recommend taping over the top of labels , anyway , to keep them from falling off en route , so why bother paying for that extra adhesive on the back of the paper ?
Print addresses directly on envelopes to completely eliminate the need for extra paper .
Many printers take at least # 10 envelopes ( larger envelopes may be a bit difficult to run through properly ) .
It may take a few tries to figure out the right way to insert them .
When possible , print on both sides of the paper .
Consider buying refillable ink cartridges or refilling regular cartridges .
Refilling can save you a good deal of money , but some customers say that refills cartridge are hard to use , messy , less effective than new cartridges , and prone to clog printers .
Look for good deals & stock up .
As with most products , the prices of ink and paper are not fixed .
Clearance sales , closeout stores , and even yard sales may have these products at significantly lower prices .
When you find a great price , buy as much as you know you will use and have room to store .
A few pennies per page may not sound like much , but they add up to more than what you might realize , especially when you habitually print a lot from your computer .
By decreasing both the number of pages you print and the cost of printing materials , you should be able to notice a difference in your home office expenses .

Think that chatting to your friends over a Bluetooth signal will keep your discussions perfectly safe and confidential ?
If you do , than think again !
The following video tutorial will teach you how to easily eavesdrop on almost any mobile phone conversation made through a Bluetooth headset .
All it takes to get started is a laptop running any distribution of Linux , the carwhisperer utility , a Bluetooth wireless dongle , a directional antenna , and any kind of PDA that will allow you to connect to your laptop remotely ( optional , but recommended if you want to stay “ inconspicuous ” . )
The reason this trick is working is that most Bluetooth headsets use a default code ( usually “ 0000 ” or “ 1234 ” ) that can be used to spoof a laptop as a phone .
This will allow you to connect to to a remote Bluetooth device and record any audio that goes through it .
You could even use the connection to send some external audio footage on top of the victim ’s conversation .
By the way , eavesdropping on people ’s conversations is perfectly illegal , so please restrain yourself from the temptation .
The reason we ’re posting this is to show you why confidential information should never be exchanged using a blutooth headset .
In fact , confidential information should never be discussed over ANY mobile device .
JERUSALEM , Dec. 10  Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , made an unusual visit to Israel and got a polite earful on Monday about Israel ’s gloomy assessment of Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Israel thinks that an American intelligence assessment of Iran ’s nuclear weapons program , published in an unclassified version last week , is unduly optimistic and focuses too narrowly on the last stage of weapons development  fashioning a bomb from highly enriched uranium .
The National Intelligence Estimate , a consensus of 16 American spy agencies , says with “ high confidence ” that Iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and with “ moderate confidence ” that the program had not resumed .
Israeli intelligence estimates say Iran stopped all its nuclear weapons activities for a time in 2003 , nervous after the American invasion of Iraq , but then resumed those activities in 2005 , accelerating enrichment and ballistic missile development and constructing a 40 - megawatt heavy - water reactor in Arak that could produce plutonium .

If you type “ happy at work ” into Google , you ’ll get roughly 32 million results .
Why ?
Because over half of all Americans are unhappy at their jobs .
Alexander Kjerulf , CHO ( Chief Happiness Officer ) has made finding happiness at work his life ’s mission .
He lives in Denmark but spends lots of his time traveling through the U.S. and Europe which gives him an interesting perspective on why Americans are so unhappy at work .
In a recent editorial , Kjerulf says this about workers in America :
“ You get paid to do your job , not to like it , ” seems to be the attitude of most US managers and workplaces .
What ’s worse , American employees seem to be willing participants in this arrangement .
When I ask Americans what makes them happy at work , they rarely talk about the work itself – many tend to see it as a means to an end , rather than as something to enjoy .
The result is that US workplaces are dominated by status - seeking career climbers , where the paycheck is the only motivator , where employee turnover is shockingly high , where bad management is never challenged , where burnout and cynicism are the order of the day , and only Dilbert comic strips provide relief . ”
I ’ve worked in the environment described above .
It left me depressed , drained and 10 lbs heavier .
It also motivated me to search for answers .
Why do people hate their jobs ?
And why do they continue to stay ?
I knew that there had to be something better out there , a place where employers are good to their workers and everyone is happy and productive all the time .
The name of that place is Denmark .
According to Kjerulf ,
“ In Denmark , employees fully expect to like their jobs .
Few Danes put up with bad management , stress , overwork , bullying , or anything else that makes us unhappy at work .
What ’s more , in Scandinavia in general , companies have a genuine commitment to their employees ’ well - being .
This is why Scandinavians have the world ’s highest job satisfaction ratings – and one of the reasons why the Scandinavian nations regularly top the lists of the world ’s happiest countries , both in life and at work …
The equation is n’t complicated : Workers who love their jobs = more efficiency and innovation = more money . ”
What is it exactly about Scandinavian countries that allow them to be so much happier at work ?
Are they born with the courage to stand up to bad bosses ?
Is there something in the water that makes them have a more positive attitude than Americans ?
The answer may lie in the differences in government and social policy between the U.S. and Scandinavia .
Healthy People Make Happy Employees
According to the Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health , 85 % of a Danish citizen ’s health care costs are paid by taxes .
In contrast , the majority of American health care costs , for those lucky enough to have health insurance in the first place , are paid for by the individual ’s employer .
The link between employment and health insurance put Americans in a tough position .
Stay in a job they hate and have access to affordable and quality medical care for themselves and their family , or pursue a more fulfilling job and risk becoming bankrupt when serious illness strikes .
Over 50 % of bankruptcies in the United States are at least partly a result of medical expenses .
By making the decision to separate health from business , the Danish government effectively allows their citizens more opportunities to change jobs without fear , discover their true talents and reach their full potential .
The country sees benefits in increased productivity and economic prosperity .
Is it no wonder then that the unemployment rate in Scandinavia is less than 1 % ?
A Ray of Hope
Until the United States reforms its health care system and other social policies such as parental leave , most American workers fight an uphill battle to discover happiness at work .
But it can be done .
Corporations such as Google or Best Buy are re-imaging the way Americans do business .
Flexible hours , generous benefits , putting workers first — these are all characteristics of the new American workplace .
Happiness is slowly finding its way back into American offices , you might just have to look a little harder , negotiate a little better and spend some time defining your own “ happy at work ” place in order to find it .

An investigation has been launched after a video of a topless French air stewardess performing a sexy striptease for the captain while the plane was flying was leaked on to the internet .
Despite the plane being in the air - and with several hundred passengers presumably blissfully unaware of what is going on - the sexy cabin attendant removes her bra and lets the captain and co-pilot get hands on .
The video was leaked onto the internet by members of the French crew and has sparked a major probe at several European airlines to discover the crew members responsible .
Scroll down for more ...
In the video , which lasts a little over two minutes , the stewardess , who even appears to be wearing a wedding ring , first performs a sexy striptease for the captain .
She then removes her bra and the captain fondles and gropes the stewardess as he grins at the camera .
Casting ' come - hither ' looks at the camera , the pretty crew member at one stage even lifts her skirt to show her underwear to the crew .
The plane was allegedly on a short - haul trip to London .
Let ’s refresh our memory , in order to underscore the motives for the latest news of the plan to spray an entire 200 + mile urban area , from the air , with poisonous pesticides never before tested on people .
Who would have this advanced technology to breed a deadly germ to this refined a degree ?
Who would target Democrats in public office , namely Daschle and Leahy , both of whom were voicing concerns about the Patriot Act ?
" Anthrax is a naturally occurring bacteria and only rarely infects humans .
However , the anthrax used in the attacks had been finely milled to make it more easily inhaled , thus increasing its lethality and suggesting a high degree of scientific competence by the perpetrator . "
With as many interviews as above , and with the anthrax being highly developed by refined scientific techniques , would n't one think that the leads to the perpetrator would be narrowed ?
Talk about literally beating around the Bush !
And yet in the same article , it is stated that the FBI considers the matter a " high priority " and that together with the US Postal Service , together they " have conducted 9,142 interviews , issued over 6,000 subpoenas and executed 67 search warrants in the investigation " .
Still no real leads .
In fact , one scientist who was targeted has claimed his innocence and is suing the government for the false investigation .
" No matter what anybody says , if it is five years out and we are not even seeing any smoke from the investigation , then I would say definitely that this case is cold right now , " said Christopher Hamilton , a former FBI counterterrorism official who worked on the anthrax investigation and is now a counterterrorism expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , a nonpartisan think tank .
Well , jumping from one roller coaster ride to the next --- dysfunctional people really keep you in an uproar , do n‘t they ?---- first we have the 9 - 11 attacks by * four * hijacked planes without * one * single fighter jet being deployed .
“ Interesting ” .
Then , according to the ACLU 's website fact sheets about the Patriot Act , we get the Anthrax scares at the very moment that the Patriot Act was being pushed down Congress 's throats .
This happened within less than two weeks of the fatal 9 - 11 attacks , as if anthrax was needed to scare Congress into submission after being shell - shocked by so heinous an emergency “ coincidentally ” staged on the date of 9 - 11 , the emergency phone number .
Next thing we hear about bird flu .
Yikes Mikes !
And now , drum roll , sound the trumpets aloud , the town crier calleth !…. it ’s that deadly moth in California .
Apparently , this new - found " emergency " is enough to merit the * aerial * spraying of the entire 200 + mile San Francisco Bay Area over a five - year period , repeatedly every one to three months , using a pesticide which has never been tested on people and which also has resulted in hundreds of reports of severe illness and even the near - death of one child .
“ On January 24th , 2008 , United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Secretary Chuck Conner announced the availability of $ 74.5 million in emergency funding to combat the light brown apple moth ( LBAM ) infestation in California ( 1 ) .
President Bush 's recent budget proposal sent to Congress sets aside $ 330 Million to eradicate plant pests , like the Light Brown Apple Moth … .
" This application is not a one time event , but will continue every 1 - 3 months for as long as five years .
The pesticide to be sprayed is not designed to harm the light brown apple moth 's who it is designed for , but merely to confuse its mating habits .
While harmless to moths , the pesticide has been documented to harm humans ...
In late 2007 , there were 643 documented health complaints from the aerial spray program conducted in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties .
Keep in mind that this documentation is a mere fraction of the real health effects , as no legitimate effort was made to inform even doctors on how to recognize pesticide poisoning .
" Many doctors also refused to report suspected pesticide poisoning as required by law , and in order for a report to get officially filed , many times the patient had to insist upon it .
These health injuries are not being honored in any way , because if they are honored , this sick chemical spray will be seen for what it is .
It is a poison to many humans and likely to many other animals as well ….
Side effects range from vomiting and flu like systems , to male and female reproductive cycle disruption .
One child nearly died from the exposure , and some people have developed asthma from being exposed to this chemical concoction . ”
Is this one more manufactured " emergency " by the Bush Administration ?
The report continues :
" To see this insanity clearly , let 's examine the moth population .
In San Francisco County , 3,501 moths total have been trapped and killed over an eight month period .
The entire city of San Francisco , whose population is 744,041 , is in the proposed spray boundaries ...
In Alameda County , 431 months have been found in the past 8 months out of 2,327 traps .
The moth population in Alameda County is thus sparse at best .
Just look out your window .
Imagine how many insects are in the tree , the yard , or the local park .
I have seen more than 431 ants crawl into my kitchen on a rainy day .
So in a giant area of 141 square miles , and the tens or hundreds of millions of insects in that zone , to try to eradicate a few hundred moths by just spraying chemicals everywhere is both ludicrous and unsafe . "
" I must inform you that through a freedom of information request , a local newspaper has learned that the CDFA has hired media spin doctor extraordinaire Porter Novelli at the tune of almost $ 500,000 tax payer dollars to convince the public that it is okay for the state to dump chemicals all over them , their gardens , their pets , and their neighbors . "
Quite rightfully , the author points out that if studied , the chemicals would be falsely proven to be safe .
The fact is that :
" Once sprayed , these microscopic balls can easily enter deep into the mouth , eyes , skin and lungs .
Even after 90 days and several rains , some people in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties are still experiencing symptoms of spray poisoning .
When they leave the counties , their symptoms many times abate . "
Two years ago , the Mohammed cartoon conflagration consumed the world and the blogosphere helped lead the way in fighting back .
Longtime readers will remember that this site hammered the issue in support of Denmark .
“ Sammenhold , ” you may recall , is the Danish word for solidarity .
With the arrests this week of five jihadists accused of plotting to murder one of the Danish cartoonists , it ’s time to demonstrate sammenhold again .
The reported target of the alleged plot was Kurt Westergaard , one of 12 cartoonists commissioned by the Jyllands - Posten newspaper to produce caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed two years ago .
Westergaard ’s cartoon , which was reprinted by Jyllands - Posten today , was seen at the time as the most controversial , as it depicted the prophet with a bomb in his turban .
“ The security service has not wanted to run any risks and chose to act at a very early stage , ” Jacob Scharf , Denmark ’s police intelligence service chief , said .
“ Tonight ’s operation has been a preventive measure . ”
Police raided several addresses at 5 am this morning , detaining five men – three Danish nationals and two foreigners .
It is not clear whether the five have been charged , or whether they were being detained under counter - terrorism legislation .
Early reports suggested that the two foreigners were likely to be deported from Denmark .
Carsten Juste , the editor - in - chief of Jyllands - Posten , said : “ We are happy that the security services have acted . ”
He added that the newspaper had been aware of an alleged plot for some time and that Westergaard was in good spirits “ under the circumstances ” .
In a statement on the newspaper ’s website , Westergaard said : “ Of course I fear for my life after the Danish security and intelligence service informed me of the plans of certain people to kill me .
“ However , I have turned fear into anger and indignation .
It has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which I used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness .
“ I have attended to my work and I still do .
I could not possibly have known how long I would have to live under police protection ; I think , however , that the impact of the insane response to my cartoon will last for the rest of my life .
It is sad indeed , but it has become a fact of my life . ”
Five newspapers reprinted Westergaard ’s cartoon in a show of support :
Berlingske Tidende , was one of the newspapers involved in the republication by newspapers in Denmark .
It said : “ We are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper always will defend , ” in comments reported by The Associated Press .
Newspapers in Spain , Sweden and the Netherlands also republished the drawing Wednesday as part of their coverage of Tuesday ’s arrests .
As a show of solidarity and a reminder of how cowardly American media outlets refused to stand up when it counted , take a minute to reprint your favorite Mo cartoon or link back to the blogging you did on the cartoon rage two years ago .

Laughing Wolf and Blackfive show their support : “ Let freedom reign . ”
Go watch Bryan Preston ’s Taqiyya .
It ’ll refresh your memories of the lies that stoked the Mo Cartoon rage .
Ed Morrissey reprints Westergaard ’s cartoon and writes : “ It ’s easy to defend free speech when it does n’t cost anyone anything .
The Danes have manned the barricades when it counts . ”
In very related news , the Muslim lawsuit against Canadian publisher Ezra Levant , who reprinted the Mo cartoons , has been dropped .
Levant is going on the counter - offensive .
Good for him :
People face longer stays when admitted just before the weekend
The UK Institute for Public Policy Research found people admitted on Thursday spent 6.3 days in hospital - a day longer than a Sunday admission .
The think tank said delays were being caused by the reduction in staffing made at weekends .
Doctors said services could be designed more efficiently and more staff employed to create a 24/7 service .
AVERAGE HOSPITAL STAY Sunday - 5.3 days Monday - 5.6 days Tuesday - 5.6 days Wednesday - 5.8 days Thursday - 6.3 days Friday - 6.1 days Saturday - 5.5 days
The IPPR looked at hospital activity as recorded by the Healthcare Commission in 2006 .
It excluded people brought in for emergency trauma treatment and those in hospital long - term .
IPPR associate director Richard Brooks said : " There is real scope for improved efficiency in our hospitals .
" Patients who are admitted at the end of the week are likely to be kept in hospital significantly longer than those admitted at the beginning for the week .
" This is not due to medical need , but because many hospitals operate a reduced service at the weekend , creating delays in treatment and discharge . "
Services
The report said it was better for patients to spend less time in hospital as it reduced the risk of infections such as MRSA , saved money and meant patients were away from home for less time .
Jonathan Fielden , chairman of the British Medical Association 's consultants committee , said the findings illustrated the need for a better design of services .
" This illustrates what we have been saying for some time - hospitals need to be 24/7 , not nine to five Monday to Friday .
" This will obviously have cost implications with more staffing , but it is not just about that .
" Hospitals need to work out when their peak activity is and staff accordingly . "
Clinton used ' Vast Right - Wing Conspiracy ' paper to bash Obama pastor Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday March 26 , 2008

Print This Email This Update : Clinton campaign says response was ' sincere '
When comments from Barack Obama 's former preacher errupted into the spotlight earlier this month his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton seemed hesitant to make a campaign issue out of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright 's controversial comments .
Her campaign aides refused to comment on the former pastor 's satements , and would not say Wright 's comments were the cause of what they saw as Obama 's sinking poll numbers .
All of that hesitance ended Wednesday .
As Obama watched the Wright storm settle down enough to enjoy a couple days of relaxation on the beach , Clinton re-sparked the maelstrom in an interview with a newspaper long considered one of the main organs of the " vast right - wing conspiracy . "
If Clinton believes she needs to use the " Tonya Harding option " to take the Democratic nomination , it appears Richard Mellon Scaife is her Shane Stant and the Pittsburgh Tribune Review editorial board is his metal baton .
For an hour - and - a - half Tuesday afternoon , Clinton sat down with editors and reporters from the paper that spent endless hours investigating her husband 's presidential administration .
Scaife , the scion to the Mellon fortune who poured millions of his own dollars into Clinton conspiracy - mongering , sat directly to the right of the former first lady during the meeting .
Asked about Wright 's comments , she jumped in with both feet , implying that the pastor who recently retired from Trinity United Church in Chicago was peddling " hate speech " and that Obama had not done enough to condemn him .
The paper did n't ask about Wright 's 1998 visit with other religious leaders invited to the White House while Bill Clinton was mired in the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
" He would not have been my pastor , " Hillary Clinton told the Tribune - Review Tuesday .
" You know , you do n't choose your family , but you choose what church you want to attend .
" I spoke out against ( fired radio host ) Don Imus ... saying that hate speech was unacceptable in any setting , and I believe that , " she continued .
" If I had sat there for 20 years , I think you all would have a lot to say about someone who gave comparable sermons .
I just think you have to speak out against that .
You certainly have to do that , if not explicitly , then implicitly by getting up and moving . "
Obama 's campaign condemned Clinton 's comments .
 After originally refusing to play politics with this issue , its disappointing to see Hillary Clintons campaign sink to this low in a transparent effort to distract attention away from the story she made up about dodging sniper fire in Bosnia , " said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton .
" The truth is , Barack Obama has already spoken out against his pastors offensive comments and addressed the issue of race in America with a deeply personal and uncommonly honest speech .
The American people deserve better than tired political games that do nothing to solve the larger challenges facing this country . 
During a press conference later Tuesday , Clinton repeated her implicit condemnation without outright saying Obama should have left the church .
She demurred when asked if Wright 's comments were now " on the table " when trying to convince super delegates to reverse her essentially insurmountable deficit among pledged delegates .
Clinton said she was simply answering a question " about what I would do . "
Asked about the fact that Scaife 's newspaper was the forum for her first comments on the Wright issue , Clinton laughed and said " it was actually very pleasant , " although she recognized it was a " somewhat counterintuitive " place to sit down for an interview .
The campaign continued its offensive Wednesday , distributing a memo continuing its " just words " attacks on Obama and taking umbrage that his campaign would respond to her interview with the conservative paper .
" Yesterday , a Pennsylvania editorial board asked Sen .
Clinton how she would have ' responded if [ her ] pastor had said some of the things that Rev. Wright said ? '
In response , she said Rev. Wright would not have been her pastor , an honest view shared by many Americans , " the Clinton campaign memo said .
" Sen. Clintons response was sincere .
The Obama attack was disingenuous . "
Tuesday 's 90 - minute session was not the first time the Clintons have sought to make peace with the man who helped stoke the right 's vitriol towards them .
Scaife sat down with Bill Clinton in his Harlem office last year where the two had a friendly chat for more than two hours , and Scaife promised to donate generously to the William J. Clinton Foundation 's efforts to fight AIDS in Africa , as Newsweek reported .
While Scaife has n't fully hopped on board the Hillary Clinton express -- he donated $ 2,300 to GOP nominee John McCain 's campaign this year -- Obama seems to be taking the brunt of attacks from his organizations .
Conservative magazine NewsMax , which is partially funded by Scaife , has focused heavily on Wright 's speeches , even before the issue bubbled into the mainstream in recent weeks .
" Obama 's Pastor Slurs Italians " is its most recent offering on the subject .
An inaccurate NewsMax article about Obama attending one of Wright 's sermons made its way into a column by conservative New York Times columnist Bill Kristol , who later had to issue a correction .
The Clinton campaign also has used onetime Scaife organ the American Spectator , which the billionaire used to investigate conspiracy theories , to distribute dirt on Obama .
Clinton 's campaign distributed an article from the arch - conservative journal , with which Scaife has since severed ties , to highlight comments from Obama adviser Gen. Tony McPeak .
" It 's obviously a little Ironic that the Clintonites have been embracing all sorts of Clinton conspiracy - theorists lately , " observers The New Republic 's Noam Scheiber .
" The Spectator was home to the notorious " Arkansas Project , " which was mostly funded by Richard Mellon Scaife , the once rabid Clinton - basher whom Hillary sat down with yesterday in Pittsburgh . "
The reaction elsewhere to Clinton 's cozying up to the " vast right - wing conspiracy " has been even more pronounced .
" Hell Has Officially Frozen Over , " reads the headline on conservative National Review blog The Corner , highlighting the photo of Clinton and Scaife .
Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall question 's Clinton 's contention that her Wright condemnation was simply a response to a question she had to answer .
" This is sort of like , ' Hey , I go on Hannity and next thing you know he 's asking me about Wright and Farrakhan .
How was I supposed to see that coming ? ' " he writes .
" I do n't know just how this went down .
But the idea Sen .
Clinton and her staff went into an editorial board meeting with Scaife and his lackey reporters without a clear sense that they were going to get at least one choice Jeremiah Wright question just somehow does n't ring true to me . "
