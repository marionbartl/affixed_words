BEIJING , June 29 -- Years of negotiations between the Shanghai government and Walt Disney Co. appear to have clinched a deal for a huge Disneyland to be built in Pudong .
The official announcement is expected to be made after the Beijing Olympics in August .
An exclusive report published by the Hong Kong - based Wen Wei Po newspaper yesterday said the park will cover about 10 square kilometers of land - about eight times the size of Hong Kong Disneyland .
It will be near Pudong 's Chuansha Town , about 20 minutes ' drive from Pudong International Airport .
Earlier media reports had said the Shanghai government preferred it to be built on the city 's island county Chongming .
Yesterday 's report quoted unnamed people involved in the discussion , saying Shanghai Disneyland wo n't follow the Hong Kong model , in which the Hong Kong government leased the land to Disney .
The Shanghai government will provide the land , finance construction , and own the majority stake in the park , the report said .
Management rights will be given to Disney , which will also get royalties and a percentage of operational income .
The report said the park will open " at the earliest possible time " in 2012 , when about one - third of the park will be completed .
" Considering inflation , the budget to build the park , excluding the land cost , should rise to about 40 billion yuan ( 5.7 billion U.S. dollars ) , from the earlier estimate of 30 billion yuan , " an unnamed " expert involved in the appraisal of the project " was quoted as saying .
In March , Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng said the local government had applied to the central government to build a Disneyland .
It would be the third Disneyland in Asia after Japan and Hong Kong .
Walt Disney
Co signed a statement of intent to build a Disneyland on the Chinese mainland in 2002 , and then set up a venture to develop it .
The plan was put on hold because of concerns that the Hong Kong park , opened in 2005 , would suffer .

Evolution is supposed to inch forward over eons , but sometimes , at least in the case of a little fish called the threespine stickleback , the process can go in relative warp - speed reverse , according to a study led by researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and published online ahead of print in the May 20 issue of Current Biology .
" There are not many documented examples of reverse evolution in nature , " said senior author Catherine " Katie " Peichel , Ph.D. , " but perhaps that 's just because people have n't really looked . "
Peichel and colleagues turned their gaze to the sticklebacks that live in Lake Washington , the largest of three major lakes in the Seattle area .
Five decades ago , the lake was , quite literally , a cesspool , murky with an overgrowth of blue - green algae that thrived on the 20 million gallons of phosphorus - rich sewage pumped into its waters each day .
Thanks to a $ 140 million cleanup effort in the mid-'60s -- at the time considered the most costly pollution - control effort in the nation -- today the lake and its waterfront are a pristine playground for boaters and billionaires .
It 's precisely that cleanup effort that sparked the reverse evolution , Peichel and colleagues surmise .
Back when the lake was polluted , the transparency of its water was low , affording a range of vision only about 30 inches deep .
The tainted , mucky water provided the sticklebacks with an opaque blanket of security against predators such as cutthroat trout , and so the fish needed little bony armor to keep them from being eaten by the trout .
In 1968 , after the cleanup was complete , the lake 's transparency reached a depth of 10 feet .
Today , the water 's clarity approaches 25 feet .
Lacking the cover of darkness they once enjoyed , over the past 40 years about half of Lake Washington sticklebacks have evolved to become fully armored , with bony plates protecting their bodies from head to tail .
For example , in the late ' 60s , only 6 percent of sticklebacks in Lake Washington were completely plated .
Today , 49 percent are fully plated and 35 percent are partially plated , with about half of their bodies shielded in bony armor .
This rapid , dramatic adaptation is actually an example of evolution in reverse , because the normal evolutionary tendency for freshwater sticklebacks runs toward less armor plating , not more .
" We propose that the most likely cause of this reverse evolution in the sticklebacks is from the higher levels of trout predation after the sudden increase in water transparency , " said Peichel , whose Hutchinson Center lab has established the stickleback as a new model for studying complex genetic traits .
By examining multifaceted traits in the fish , such as body type and behavior , Peichel and colleagues shed light on the genetic networks at play in other complex traits , such as cancer and other common human diseases .

The ability of the fish to quickly adapt to environmental changes such as increased predation by the cutthroat trout is due , Peichel believes , to their rich genetic variation .
The sticklebacks in Lake Washington contain DNA from both marine ( saltwater ) fish , which tend to be fully plated , and freshwater sticklebacks , which tend to be low - plated .
When environmental pressures called for increased plating , some of the fish had copies of genes that controlled for both low and full plating , and so natural selection favored the latter .
" Having a lot of genetic variation in the population means that if the environment changes , there may be some gene variant that does better in that new environment than in the previous one , and so nature selects for it .
Genetic variation increases the chance of overall survival of the species , " she said .
The researchers ' findings challenge a widely held theory behind rapid evolutionary change , the idea of " phenotypic plasticity " -- when an organism can take on different characteristics independent of genetic influences .
Body type is one such example .
" There is some genetic component to body size , but if you eat more nutritious food as a child you 're probably going to grow taller than someone who has the same genes but may not have had as good of a diet growing up , " Peichel said .
" Our findings challenge the primary role of phenotypic plasticity in rapid evolutionary change . "
The gene that controls for plating is called Eda , which comes in two forms : one causes low plating and the other complete plating .
Peichel was the first person to home in on the neighborhood where the Eda gene lives while a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of David Kingsley , Ph.D. , at Stanford University .
In humans , mutations in this gene cause a syndrome called ectodermal dysplasia , a group of more than 100 inherited disorders that impact the ectoderm , the outer layer of tissue involved in the formation of many parts of the body , including the skin , nails , hair , teeth and sweat glands .
" There 's probably a developmental correlation between these external structures in humans and the bony plates on the fish , " Peichel said .
" It also looks like the Eda gene was probably important for human evolution although we do n't really know in what context , " she said .
Collaborators on the study included researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle ; the University of Texas in Austin ; Gifu Keizai University in Ogaki , Gifu , Japan ; and the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature in Kyoto , Japan .
The work was supported by a Uehara Memorial Fellowship , the Packard Foundation , Seattle Public Utilities , Water and People Project , and a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award in the Biomedical Sciences .

New Patented Technology allows you to use Power from the Phone Company to operate everyday items that you have to use - even if the power is out .
The Phone Company always has a steady source of DC power available .
Huge banks of storage batteries backed up by generators , supplying from 23 to 80 ma of power on every phone line ... for you to use whenever you want !
Telco Powered Products  convert the 48 Volts DC from the modular jacks in your home or office to a voltage that can be used to power the items you need to get on with your life , even if there 's no power from the electric company .
A Solution to the Energy Crisis ...
Our Chief Scientist , Dr. Emil Drizzlenik
PhD from the renowned Chernobyl Electrical Institute in Russia , developed this patented technology after an accident at the power plant left all of the homes and businesses in his area dark .
Dr. Drizzlenik found that the local telephone company was still up and running , and in fact telephone service never went down during the time the power was out .
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant , and the Chernobyl Electrical Institute Dr. Drizzlenik is used to working in the dark .
Power problems in Chernobyl changed everybody 's life , as they 're threatening to do today in California and other parts of the US .
Be prepared for the coming power outages by switching as many of your everyday items as you can to Telco Powered Products  from Mike Sandman ...
Chicago 's Telecom Expert .
Telco Powered Products  adapt popular consumer battery operated devices to 48 VDC telephone company power , allowing charging and operation when connected to any modular jack in the country .
All of these Telco Powered Products  will work anywhere in the US , and in most of the rest of the world .
There 's Plenty of Power Available from the Phone Company !
Phone Companies in the US supply a constant regulated voltage on all of their lines , whether they 're in use or not .
Many of these lines have much more current available than telephones need or can use !
For most of us , it 's hard to remember the phone service going down in our neighborhood ... but we can all remember the last power outage .
Phone companies strive for and achieve the highest possible reliability .
In some areas , the amount of electricity provided by the phone company can be dangerously high , causing improper operation or even damage to electronic phone systems at businesses or homes .
Our Loop Current Regulators are needed on many of those lines to bring the available current down to a safe level that wo n't damage electronic Key Systems or PBXs .
By tapping the energy on those lines during this power crisis and beyond , Americans will be able to continue using the electronic devices that made their lives easier when inexpensive , plentiful power was taken for granted ( last year ) .
The Phone Company is a FREE Source of Electric Power !
All you need is a phone line from the phone company to tap this free hidden source of power .
If you have two or more lines , you have that much more power available to you .
In many cases , the phone company leaves disconnected lines energized with power , figuring that the new tenant or homeowner will need the phone line turned on when they move in .
Instead of physically disconnecting the pair to the premise , they simply change the programming at the central office to remove the dial tone and the ability to receive calls .
The power is still on the line !
If you 're already paying for a phone line , you do n't have to pay anything more to make use of the power that 's always on it when you have Telco Powered Products  .

Tomorrow , unless something truly extraordinary happens , the Knesset will vote to disperse itself , setting the scene for November 2008 elections in Israel .
As we all know , the American public is scheduled to go to the polls in November 4th , but unlike their Mid-Eastern counterparts , they ’ll be doing it willingly .
It ’s been said time and time again in the Israeli media over the past couple of weeks that no one in the political arena is truly interested in initiating such a dramatic move , especially at such a critical point in time .
Nevertheless , it seems we ’re heading there anyway .
This is n’t debating
I think I ’ve probably said it before : Whoever wins the American elections in November will be a better president , just by going through the elections process , than he could be if he was elected today .
The political arena is the perfect training ground for any national leader — but only when this arena features the issues and not the backstage transactions .
Having to undergo 26 ( ! ) televised debates , the Democratic candidates had sufficient opportunities to clearly describe to the public their stance on all the major issues .
In fact , candidates who had started this campaign with vague platforms and relatively little public experience , had to become savants in economics , foreign policy , and health care — naming just a few of the issues — if they wanted to survive the process of primary elections and to present themselves as viable and serious candidates .
They also had to literally “ go to the people ” , hold local gatherings , tour the country , get to know their constituents first - hand .
The American voters have come to know these people rather well , being acquainted with their style of behavior , type of personality — and most importantly — knowing exactly where these candidates stand when it comes to the issues , and how well they understand what they ’re talking about .
Additionally , required to clearly state their platform time and time again , these candidates also demonstrate whether they hold an honest agenda or whether they constantly change their positions according to the recent opinion polls .
This is crucial information for constituents .
This entire process happens before an American president enters office !
He has plenty of time and opportunities to make noticeable mistakes and to learn from them before these mistakes have the potential to cause national instability .
Here in Israel , the same process tends to happen after a Prime Minister has been put in office by his party .
In short , what I ’m trying to say it this :
The Israeli public deserves to have a series of televised debates where all presumptive PM candidates face each other and publicly answer questions .
This is debating
It is frighteningly amazing how a man such as Ehud Barak can be chosen to lead a major political party in Israel without actually saying anything clear about the issues !
Or how both he and Ehud Olmert allow themselves to go public with peremptory announcements every now and then — and then to never go through with their own promises !
What ’s even more regrettable is the fact that no one expects them to be clear or consistent anymore !
This is absurd .
And I ’d like to see both the Israeli public and the Israeli media pushing forth the notion that Israeli politicians must follow the example of their American counterparts and publicly clarify their positions during face - to - face televised debates — before they enter office .

" Fabio " commits his crimes from the anonymity of a cyber cafe Cyber crime - internet banking and credit card fraud - is now the fastest growing sector of global organised crime , increasing at a rate of about 40 % per year .
With Brazil thought to have by far the largest number of cyber criminals , Misha Glenny , reporting for the BBC World Service 's How Crime Took On The World , went to meet some of those trying to profit from the $ 100bn ( £ 51 bn ) industry .
Fabio's small frame is hunched over an ancient computer screen in a dingy internet cafe in one of the favelas of Sao Paulo .
He is learning the basic skills needed to commit crime online .
Fabio - not his real name - is taking his online lessons from experienced computer hackers .
He is disarmingly matter - of - fact about his new career .
" I buy small things - mobile phones , cameras - so that people do n't even know I 've been using their credit cards , " he explains .
Fabio is a low - level frontline operative in a rapidly expanding battle taking place in the virtual world .
For the moment , he is unlikely to be caught because he is restricting himself to the regular theft of small amounts of money .
Incessant attacks Fabio works on the rational principle that only a minority of credit card holders check their statements carefully .
Even if they did , they might think twice before reporting a minor theft to the police .
And he also knows it is highly unlikely that the police will have the resources to pursue him .
CYBER CRIME Legal definition officially agreed in 2004 Worth over $ 100 bn per year Includes hacking - stealing data from other people 's computers - and " phishing " - sending fake emails asking for bank details
Many cyber criminals operate out of developing nations
Listen to How Crime Took On The World Nonetheless , Fabio 's modest assault on people 's bank accounts is the tip of a very large iceberg - and one which is creating a headache for law enforcement agencies around the world .
" The cost of identity theft and computer - based credit card fraud stood at $ 52.6 billion in 2005 , " says Peter Allor , boss of The X - Force , the cyber intelligence unit of leading cyber security firm IBM ISS .
Cyber crime 's turnover has been growing rapidly ever since , so that now estimates of its value stand at that huge $ 100 billion figure annually .
But banks and other major companies are reluctant to release any figures about the losses they sustain , for fear of scaring off customers .
That is why they continue to reimburse the victims of computer scams with no questions asked .
Serious money Fabio's descent into the world of cyber crime began recently .
He has never had a fixed job which paid well , and struggles to get by - he is divorced and travels two hours by bus to Sao Paulo in order to support his one son .
Poverty and destitution - common in the favelas of Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian cities - have certainly contributed to his determination to make money from cyber crime .
Fabio is one of only a tiny minority of young people in Brazil who use computers to commit crime .
But there are concerns that , as thousands more become web literate , there will be an exponential rise in cyber crime .
Access to the web is easy thanks to the cheap internet cafes studded around the suburbs of Brazil 's economic hubs - where most young people use them to play games or educate themselves .
Fabio is defensive when I suggest to him that crime on the internet is wrong - however poor he is .
" I 'm not trying to rob anyone who wakes up early in the morning and takes the bus , and has to get home and feed his kids , and does n't have money , " he insists .
And he tells me his ultimate aim is to befriend a very rich person online - " someone who owns a limo or a helicopter and who does n't care about poor people " .
He is convinced that he will be able to milk his victim for a serious amount of money .
For the moment , however , Fabio is small fry .
Stay clear Brazil 's new federal cyber police force in the capital Brasilia is constantly battling against large - scale scams originating in the country .
Hackers send out millions of spam emails to addresses across the world every day , and a small percentage of computer users are gullible enough to answer them .
Bank account numbers and passwords are then handed over unknowingly to unscrupulous cyber crooks .
There is no way to protect yourself 100 % from Fabio and his friends .
But you can minimise the risk .
Always keep anti-malware - programmes which prevent the installation of malicious programmes on your system - and anti-virus software up - to - date ; never answer an email if its origin is unclear .
And if anybody offers you free sex , stay well clear of that - you could end up with a nasty infection .

Karl Rove is facing contempt citations for his refusal to answer subpoenas to testify before congress .
But lucky for him , he 's gotten himself a friendly judge in Bush appointee John Bates :
A former deputy independent counsel in Ken Starr 's Whitewater investigation , Bates is the same judge who threw out a Government Accountability Office complaint against Vice President Dick Cheney in December 2002 .
Back then , the GAO 's comptroller general , David Walker , was seeking access to internal documents from Cheney 's secretive Energy Task Force , using arguments similar to those the judiciary committee is making today — namely that the White House 's refusal to provide information to congressional investigators is damaging Congress ' oversight mandate .
Note , of course , that a background working for Ken Starr clearly does not in this case signify a strong belief in vigorous oversight of the executive branch .
Rather , as Bates ' previous rulings make clear , he 's a believer in vigorous oversight of Democratic Party presidents while Republicans can do whatever they want .
Bush clearly chose well when deciding to make this guy a judge .

US Dollar Crisis Not Oil Crisis
It 's unfortunate that the Supreme Court , in its ruling this week that U.S. currency is unfair to the blind , did not make the next logical step and declare it unfair to everyone who buys gasoline .
In their search for explanations as to why oil has surged past $ 130 per barrel , Washington , Wall Street , and the financial media are as clueless as cavemen after a freak summer snow storm .
Despite the head scratching , the blame game is nevertheless in full force .
Speculators and big oil companies are being trotted out as scapegoats , and increased margin requirements and taxes on windfall profits and futures trading have been mentioned as appropriate sanctions .
It should be clear that this is pure farce , and that no one understands what is actually happening .
The reality is that after years of reckless consumption and dollar debasement , Americans are now being priced out of markets over which they formerly held unchallenged title .
As more affluent foreigners consume more of the resources and products they previously supplied to us , Americans are being forced to cut back .
The rising dollar - based price of gasoline is simply an illustration of this global trend .
Poorly concealed behind contrived government statistics , the signs of America 's falling standard of living are everywhere ; all one has to do is look .
We are unloading SUVs for less desirable compacts , and are paying more to fly on crowded planes ( where we pay to check luggage and dine only on what we bring onboard ) .
We drink our lattes at McDonalds or not at all , and we increasingly forego dining out , trips to the mall , and vacations , just so we can scrape together enough to fill our gas tanks and kitchen pantries , pay taxes and insurance , or make credit card , mortgage or car payments .
The collective belt tightening is simply the down payment on the Government 's massive bailout of Wall Street investment banks and mortgage lenders .
As the Fed creates money to buy bad mortgages and other shaky securities held by banks and brokerage firms , the value of the savings and wages of everyone on Main Street will continue to fall .
As a result , the costs of products previously taken for granted have begun to bite .
The various housing bills and stimulus packages now passing through Congress will add significantly to the staggering final price tag .
In the end , the “ free lunch ” currently being dished out by Washington will be the most expensive meal ever served .
The cost will be borne by ordinary Americans citizens every time they open their wallets .
Four dollar gasoline is just the beginning .
For all the talk of increased global demand , few seem to understand from where it actually comes .
The surge in global demand is both a function of the increased purchasing power of foreign currencies and the fact that foreigners are choosing to spend more of their incomes themselves .
In other words Greenspan 's famous “ global savings glut ” is turning into a global consumption binge , with Americans unable to crash the party .
This trend will only get worse as the dollar - denominated price of just about everything that is either imported , or capable of being exported , goes through the roof .
We can look for scapegoats all we want but the simply fact is Americans are going to have to get used to a much lower standard of living .
Those who have been putting all the food on our tables are finally pulling up chairs themselves .

‘ What is it that encourages ordinarily sensible people to start niche political parties ?
… What it [ the UK Libertarian Party ] will do , like the Libertarian Party has done in the United States , is to tarnish the libertarian brand , allowing the crazier aspects of libertarian thinking to come to the fore , and achieving nothing of any merit …
.. The lesson from American politics is that when libertarians create parties , they end up undermining liberty by diverting campaigners ’ efforts way from the mainstream .

Some presidents get carved into Mt Rushmore ; others have airports , motorways , and even entire cities named in their honour .
But when George Bush leaves office , his most visible memorial may be a mouldering patch of human effluent .
In November , alongside casting their ballot for the next president , the people of San Francisco will also vote on a measure to rename one of the city 's largest sewage works the George W Bush Sewage Plant , to provide a " fitting monument " to the outgoing commander - in - chief 's achievements .
Activists from the Presidential Memorial Commission of San Francisco , a mischievously - named group behind the move , will ask supporters to participate in a " synchronised flush " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It may sound like a student prank , but the proposal is almost certain to be passed .
Democrats usually secure between 70 and 80 per cent of the vote in San Francisco – and in 2006 passed a proposition to impeach Mr Bush and his Vice - President Dick Cheney by a majority of almost two to one .
" In 50 years from now , we want people to see George Bush 's name on that plant , and ask each other what went wrong , " said Brian McConnell , the Memorial Commission 's organiser .
" We want them to be reminded of the Iraq war , and his other dramatic mistakes , and this is the perfect way to do it . "
The ballot takes advantage of local government rules , which state that any proposal supported by a petition carrying the signatures of more than 7,168 voters must go to the polls .
At present , the supporters of the sewage plant proposal claim to have 8,500 signatures , and counting .
If the measure passes , city authorities will be forced to erect a prominent sign bearing the legend " George W Bush Sewage Plant " at the site of the bayside facility .
Local Republicans call it an " abuse of process " and promised to " use all means " to defeat it , Howard Epstein , the party 's spokesman , told the San Francisco Chronicle : " There 's no use to this other than to make these nutcases feel good . "
The proposal even jollified yesterday 's White House press briefing , where a spokesman three times refused to comment .
However , Mr McConnell claimed to have only noticed two forms of opposition during his campaign so far .
" First , we get people who say they just want to forget George Bush 's presidency , " he said .
" Second , we hear from those who say that sewage plants perform a valuable public service and , as such , it does not make sense to name one after George Bush . "
Is it luck of the draw in poker ?
No , says Michael DeDonno , a doctoral student from Case Western Reserve University .
Based on findings from two psychology studies , he suggests putting your bets on skills over luck when playing the card game .
DeDonno ’s findings from two poker - related studies with college students have implications for the gaming industry , and possibly even legal cases that challenge the theory of luck over skills .
According to DeDonno , the person who takes home the winnings is likely to pay higher taxes when money is considered earned by luck .
His article , “ Poker is a Skill , ” written with Douglas Detterman , Case Western Reserve psychologist , caught the attention of the journal , Gaming Law Review , which has been examining this luck - skill debate and recently published psychologists ’ findings .
“ This article provides empirical evidence that it is skill and not luck , ” concluded DeDonno from his two studies .
In the first study , DeDonno had 41 college students play eight games , totaling 200 hands , of Turbo Texas Hold ’em , a computerized simulation of 10 - player Hold ’em poker .
The game consists of being dealt two cards in the first round .
The player must decide whether to play or quit based on the hand .
If the person decides to play , then three cards are dealt for the community pot .
Again , the player has to decide whether to play or stop .
The player must also consider the betting patterns of the other players in making a decision in moving to the next round .
If continuing , then the player sees another card and has to decide again to bet or lay down the cards .
This is repeated until there are five cards on the table .
Overall most of the students had little experience playing poker , said DeDonno .
Half of the students in the first group were given charts that ranked the two - card combinations from best to the worst and also learned that professional poker players typically play about 15 percent of the hands dealt them .
The other group was given background on the history of poker with no strategies .
He found that students given some strategies to make decisions did better than those without the strategies .
When starting the study , almost two - thirds of the students ( 64 percent ) felt that winning at poker was 50 percent luck .
“ If it had been pure luck in winning , then the strategies would not have made a difference for the two groups , ” said DeDonno .
To statistically verify the results from the first study , he conducted a second study , but had students play 720 hands .
Again the group was divided into those provided with strategies and those with just a history of playing poker .
While all students improved their playing with practice over the large number of hands , the group given strategies continued to do better than those without the added information .
He also found that students reduced the average number of hands played at the beginning ( 27 ) to 15 hands after given strategies , which improved their games and validated that “ fewer hands does result in improved performance . ”
DeDonno ’s research evolved from his interest in playing poker .
He wanted to determine if there was a correlation between intelligence and the ability to play the game .
But the focus shifted to the luck - skill issue .
According to DeDonno , using poker strategies has some real life applications in such areas as investments and buying a home where partial information is available .
He also discovered that the poker simulation has applications in psychological testing for decision making and risk taking .
But in DeDonno ’s final analysis , skill wins out in playing poker .

As state leaders hunt for politically palatable solutions to the swelling budget shortfall , some Democrats are proposing unorthodox ways to generate cash .
Strip clubs , six - packs , grocery bags and iTunes downloads are all in their sights as alternatives to broad income or sales tax hikes .
So are gas guzzlers and yachts -- and a tax loophole for criminals .
Despite tough odds of overcoming an oath signed by their Republican colleagues to stop any tax hikes , Democratic lawmakers seem confident that their ideas will carry the day .
They predict the public wo n’t stand for painful cuts to schools and healthcare to close a shortfall the governor now pegs as high as $ 20 billion , and say anti-tax forces will ultimately have to accept that more revenue is needed to bring the state into the black .
GOP lawmakers say the majority party simply has an insatiable appetite for taking money from Californians .
The California Republican Party recently released an Internet video , set to the O’Jays ’ “ For the Love of Money , ” in which the tax ideas float across the screen after footage of Senate leader Don Perata ( D - Oakland ) telling the media in March his prescription for balancing the budget : “ Raise taxes .
That clear enough ?
Raise taxes . ”

Almost all of the Democrats ’ ideas are being met with some degree of scorn .
“ Some people are e-mailing , threatening to come and slug me , ” said Assemblyman Jim Beall ( D - San Jose ) , who hopes to see a $ 1.80 tax added to the price of every six - pack of beer sold in the state .
“ We ’re getting some pretty nasty comments . ”
The idea of taxing comforts and conveniences evokes the budget crisis of 1991 , when then - Gov. Pete Wilson agreed to impose a “ snack tax ” on Californians , raising the cost of junk food and bottled water .
Voters repealed it a year later .
Supporters of the latest measures may be encouraged by a recent softening of the governor ’s anti-tax rhetoric -- although he still says he ’s against new taxes -- and by reports that his administration is exploring possible new levies .

Some of the proposals would be used to help balance the budget ; others would fund specific new programs .
The legislators say their various causes -- as broad as averting further cuts to the general fund , which is tapped by all government programs , and as narrow as improving local trash cleanup -- are too important to let slide just because the state is broke .
They say their quest for revenue is the responsible course of action .
“ If we do n’t do some of these things , we are going to have to cut nearly $ 5 billion out of schools , ” said Assemblyman Charles Calderon ( D - Montebello ) , chairman of the Revenue and Taxation Committee .
He has proposed some of the Legislature ’s more unconventional measures , including taxes on digital downloads and adult entertainment .
Calderon said he was moved to push for levies on downloads such as iTunes because state sales tax laws do not reflect the high volume of purchasing that Californians do online .
Consumers can download music from the Internet through Apple ’s iTunes and other services tax - free , Calderon noted , while they pay sales tax for buying the same music on a compact disc at a store .
His proposal would empower state authorities to collect sales tax on the downloads , increasing the cost of a typical 99 - cent song to roughly $ 1.07 .
Calderon projects that the bill ( AB 1956 ) , which could also apply to pornography downloads , cellphone ring - tones , online books and feature films distributed on the Internet , would raise about $ 500 million for the state budget .

The idea stalled in committee this month in the face of fierce industry opposition .
But like the other proposals , it could be revived at any time , most likely when legislative leaders hammer out a budget agreement this summer .
Calderon said the resistance to his bill did not surprise him .
But he is perplexed that he has n’t been able to get more traction for another proposal : a 25 % tax on sex toys , strip shows , pornographic magazines and videos and anything else sold in an “ adult entertainment venue . ”
“ This is a major industry that is putting a disproportionate burden on state services , ” he said .
“ Drugs are heavily used .
The actors have a short life span .
Some leave the industry drug - addicted with no skills .
They wind up availing themselves of Medi-Cal and other state programs . ”
A coalition of porn stars , strippers and others in adult entertainment roamed the halls of the Capitol recently to lobby against the Calderon bill ( AB 2914 ) .

They have beaten back similar proposals in the past , typically with the help of anti-tax activists , who say that if levies are imposed , the industry will move elsewhere and jobs will be lost .
Assemblyman Mike Davis ( D - Los Angeles ) is targeting a wider group of consumers .
Almost every Californian would bear some of the brunt of his proposal to charge a 25 - cent tax on every plastic carryout bag from stores .
California consumers discard an estimated 19 billion of the bags each year , many of which wind up littered on the street .
Davis says his proposal ( AB 2829 ) would encourage consumers to use fewer bags -- or better yet , bring their own to stores -- and provide local governments with funds to clean up the litter .
The proposal has the backing of several environmental groups .
“ A person is going to think carefully before spending a quarter to get a bag , ” Davis said .

But Davis says he knows people are suffering financially and has proposed a property tax break for low - income seniors .
There ’s a catch :
The proposal ( AB 2459 ) would require seniors to “ work off ” their taxes in county offices , doing such jobs as gardening , record filing or data entry .
Other bills target gas guzzlers .
AB 2388 by Assemblyman Mike Feuer ( D - Los Angeles ) would place a surcharge on vehicles based on their weight and the amount of carbon dioxide they emit .
Assemblyman Joe Coto ( D - San Jose ) wants to collect new fees from drivers of luxury vehicles that get less than 15 miles per gallon .
His bill is AB 2638 .
The leader of the Assembly ’s Republicans , Mike Villines of Clovis , says the many tax bills “ show how out of touch the [ legislative ] majority has become .
. . .
Working people are looking at these taxes and saying , ‘ Are you kidding me ?
You are going to add more costs to my daily life ? ’
People want us to live within our means like they do . ”
Democrats retort that it is not they who are out of touch .

Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez ( D - Los Angeles ) has expressed bewilderment that GOP lawmakers wo n’t even talk about eliminating the mortgage deduction for vacation homes valued at more than $ 1 million -- a move Republicans say would discourage the wealthy from buying property in California .
And do n’t get Nunez started on the sales tax on yachts , which wealthy Californians have been able to avoid by docking their boats in Mexico for 90 days before bringing them home -- the result of what Nunez calls a “ sloophole ” that Republicans refuse to close .
Another bid the GOP has blocked , AB 1746 , was made at the behest of prosecutors who were frustrated to learn that felons can claim tax breaks on criminal business operations , even after being convicted .
The bill , an effort to eliminate the deductions , stalled on the Assembly floor .

Training can increase fluid intelligence , once thought to be fixed at birth
Training a person 's working memory may increase his or her general intelligence .
June 5 , 2008
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .

Can human beings rev up their intelligence quotients , or are they stuck with IQs set by their genes at birth ?
Until recently , nature seemed to be the clear winner over nurture .
But new research , led by Swiss postdoctoral fellows Susanne M. Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl , working at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , suggests that at least one aspect of a person 's IQ can be improved by training a certain type of memory .
Most IQ tests attempt to measure two types of intelligence -- crystallized and fluid intelligence .
Crystallized intelligence draws on existing skills , knowledge and experiences to solve problems by accessing information from long - term memory .
Fluid intelligence , on the other hand , draws on the ability to understand relationships between various concepts , independent of any previous knowledge or skills , to solve new problems .
The research shows that this part of intelligence can be improved through memory training .
" When it comes to improving intelligence , many researchers have thought it was not possible , " says Jaeggi .
" Our findings clearly show this is not the case .
Our brain is more plastic than we might think . "
Jaeggi , Buschkuehl and Walter Perrig from Bern University , Switzerland , along with Jon Jonides , their National Science Foundation - supported colleague from the University of Michigan , reasoned that just as crystallized intelligence relies on long - term memory , fluid intelligence relies on short - term memory , or " working memory , " as it is more accurately called .
This is the same type of memory people use to remember a phone number or an e-mail address for a short time , but beyond that , working memory refers to the ability to both manipulate and use information briefly stored in the mind in the face of distraction .
Researchers gathered four groups of volunteers and trained their working memories using a complex training task called " dual n- back training , " which presented both auditory and visual cues that participants had to temporarily store and recall .
Participants received the training during a half hour session held once a day for either eight , 12 , 17 or 19 days .
For each of these training periods , researchers tested participants ' gains in fluid intelligence .
They compared the results against those of control groups to be sure the volunteers actually improved their fluid intelligence , not merely their test - taking skills .
The results were surprising .
While the control groups made gains , presumably because they had practice with the fluid intelligence tests , the trained groups improved considerably more than the control groups .
Further , the longer the participants trained , the larger were their intelligence gains .
" Our findings clearly show that training on certain memory tasks transfer to fluid intelligence , " says Jaeggi .
" We also find that individuals with lower fluid intelligence scores at pre-test could profit from the training . "
The results are significant because improved fluid intelligence scores could translate into improved general intelligence as measured by IQ tests .
General intelligence is a key to determining life outcomes such as academic success , job performance and occupational advancement .
Researchers also surmise that this same type of memory training may help children with developmental problems and older adults who face memory decline .
But , that remains to be seen , because the test results are based on assessments of young , healthy adult participants .
" Even though it currently appears very hard to improve these conditions , there might be some memory training related to intelligence that actually helps , " says Jaeggi .
" The saying 'use it or lose it ' is probably appropriate here . "
Since it is not known whether the improvements in fluid intelligence last after the training stops , researchers currently are measuring long - term fluid intelligence gains with both laboratory testing and long - term field work .
Researchers say it will be some time before a complete data set is available to draw any conclusions .
University of Bern professor Walter J. Perrig also co-authors this study along with University of Michigan professor John Jonides .
The Swiss National Science Foundation funds Jaeggi and Buschkuehl 's visiting scholar status .

When I heard that federal authorities had arrested the people that the government tells us were responsible for much of the subprime meltdown , I anxiously awaited the perp walk that would befall some notorious characters .
Would we see Ben Bernanke wearing handcuffs , still dressed in his cams after having thrown even more money from the helicopter ?
Would the person shuffling before the media be Alan Greenspan , the architect of 18 years of legal counterfeiting ?
Had the federal authorities finally come to their senses and arrested the people most responsible for the chicanery and outright theft of the savings and investments of millions of people ?
Alas , no .
Instead , I was to find that the Great Villains of Wall Street are Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin , two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers who apparently did not jump out of their building when it became obvious a year ago that perhaps these mortgage securities flooding the market were worthless .
Federal prosecutors , following in the steps of Rudy Giuliani , who made his career out of prosecuting Michael Milken for the " crime " of financing much of the high - technology and telecommunications industry through " junk bonds , " have charged Cioffi and Tannin with the usual " securities fraud " and " conspiracy " charges , as well as charging Cioffi with " insider trading , " which is based upon a reading of the law that no one really claims to understand .
Moreover , we can be sure that this is going to be the beginning of a busy prosecutorial season in which government officials will attempt to criminalize the actions of people who , in the end , were far less responsible for the meltdown than officials from the Federal Reserve System and the U.S. Department of the Treasury .
Indeed , the latest criminal charges are based on the fact that Cioffi and Tannin privately had doubts about the quality and future of their hedge fund , but did not tell investors about their doubts .
Lest anyone believe that such a state of affairs is " criminal , " perhaps we should then wonder why Greenspan and Bernanke are let off the hook .
After all , both men — and especially Bernanke — have made optimistic statements before Congress , only to be proven wrong .
For example , let us look at what Bernanke told Congress last March :
Core inflation , which is a better measure of the underlying inflation trend than overall inflation , seems likely to moderate gradually over time .
Despite recent increases in the price of crude oil , energy prices are below last year ’s peak .
If energy prices remain near current levels , greater stability in the costs of producing non-energy goods and services will reduce pressure on core inflation over time .
Of course , the prices of oil and other commodities are very difficult to predict , and they remain a source of considerable uncertainty in the inflation outlook .
Actually , the latest figures show that inflation is increasing at double - digit rates and gasoline prices are going up and up in large part because Bernanke ’s Fed continues to destroy the dollar .
As for other statements , let us look at how Bernanke viewed the recent " stimulus " in which the government sent checks to our homes :
WASHINGTON — United for urgent action , the White House and Congress raced toward emergency steps Thursday to rescue the national economy from a possible recession , including tax rebates of $ 300 or more for many Americans .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke endorsed the idea of putting money into the hands of those who would spend it quickly and boost the flagging economy .
Now , I have no problem with someone sending me money in the mail , except that in this case , the government borrowed even more money , which means that I did not receive " free " money , but rather saw my family ’s real debt increased by a couple thousand dollars .
This was no " stimulus ; " it was a fraud , but Bernanke made public statements that he knew were not true .
For that matter , why stop at finances ?
It seems that a number of people in the Midwest listened to FEMA authorities , who insisted in 1999 that the levees holding back the Mississippi River were in great shape :
Juli Parks did n’t worry when water began creeping up the levee that shields this town of about 750 from the Mississippi River — not even when volunteers began piling on sandbags .
After all , FEMA and local officials had assured townspeople in 1999 that the levee was sturdy enough to withstand a historic flood .
In fact , some relieved homeowners dropped their flood insurance , and others applied for permits to build new houses and businesses .
Then on Tuesday , the worst happened : The levee burst and Gulfport was submerged in 10 feet of water .
Only 28 property owners were insured against the damage .
“ They all told us , ‘ The levees are good .
You can go ahead and build , ' ” said Parks , who did not buy flood coverage because her bank no longer required it .
“ We had so much confidence in those levees . ”
Around the country , thousands of residents who relied on the assurances of the Federal Emergency Management Agency may unknowingly face similar risks .
“ People put all their hopes in those levees , and when they do fail , the damage is catastrophic , ” said Paul Osman , the National Flood Insurance Program coordinator for Illinois .
“ New Orleans is the epitome ; a lot of those people did n’t even realize they were in a floodplain until the water was up to their roofs . ”
One cannot help but wonder why these officials are not wearing handcuffs and orange jumpsuits right now , as their false statements lured people to risk millions of dollars of property .
Yet , like all other government employees , the FEMA officials who told politically - motivated falsehoods wo n’t face a minute of legal trouble .
In the case of Cioffi and Tannin , they could have called me or anyone else associated with the Mises Institute to find a pretty accurate assessment .
In fact , I wrote this piece last year right after having a conversation with an economist from the Federal Reserve who assured me that the Fed had been following a most wise and prudent set of policies .
I wrote :
It is hard to know just how far the current meltdown in the stock market and housing market will go , but we can say unequivocally that it will not be business as usual , or business that has been usual for the last many years .
We can forget about a 14,000 - point Dow for a long while , as economic law — something that politicians have assured us exists only in the minds of “ kooks ” — reasserts itself , and the results are not pretty .
( One thinks that perhaps hedge fund members should be reading the pages of Lewrockwell.com and Mises.org if they wish to gain a sense of what is happening in the economy , as opposed to listening to the falsehoods told by Bernanke and his merry tricksters . )
I cannot say that Cioffi and Tannin " misled " investors so much as investors were hoping that somewhere , somehow , the Great White Father in Washington would bail out everyone .
Perhaps they were hoping against hope , or perhaps they were hoping that Countrywide would give them the same treatment it had given prominent lawmakers and cabinet officials , or perhaps that the government itself would bail out the lenders , as is what seems to be happening .
The larger point is that Cioffi and Tannin are scapegoats , pure and simple .
As the great criminal defense attorney Harvey Silverglate has told me more than once , federal prosecutors are able to take any action by anyone and turn it into a federal crime .
I wish I had better news for these two men .
Federal prosecutors are a vicious lot and they are going to be able to play on the anger and resentments of people who have lost money , just as federal prosecutors were able to destroy the late Ken Lay and others who worked for Enron .
Someone has to pay , it seems , and who better to destroy than hedge fund managers from Wall Street , as opposed to the monetary villains who inhabit the various Fed offices around the country .
Indeed , it seems that the real crime of Cioffi and Tannin is that their hedge fund went bust because they were following the government ’s line .
Since the government always is blameless no matter how great the disasters it creates , someone has to pay .
As more indictments come down the pipe , do n’t expect the media to ask the hard questions .
One does not forget that the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times were the big cheerleaders behind Rudy Giuliani ’s predations on Wall Street two decades ago , and that the Times played the role of Official Shill for Eliot Spitzer when he was shaking down Wall Street firms as New York ’s attorney general .
No doubt , the press will fall in line as it declares private fund managers to be the true Enemies of the People .
In the meantime , the counterfeiters at the Fed will churn out more false predictions , lead people into a false sense of security , and be praised lavishly by the political classes .
Correction :
In this article , I mistakenly said that K.C. Johnson and Stuart Taylor had included the Darryl Hunt case in their book in response to the charge that Robert Perkinson had made against them .
Indeed , there was no mention of the Hunt case in that book .
However , I must add that this omission was not due to Perkinson ’s charge that they had left out the Hunt case because they did not wish to disturb their own " narrative , " but rather because the chapter ( Chapter 23 ) of the book was dealing specifically with cases of prosecutorial misconduct .
Furthermore , the authors highlighted cases involving both blacks and white defendants who were convicted wrongfully because of misconduct by North Carolina prosecutors .
Darryl
Hunt ultimately was exonerated because of DNA testing , something that was not available when he first was convicted in the mid-1980s .
It is ironic that many of Nifong ’s supporters were willing to accept the results that freed Hunt but were not willing to accept the fact that no DNA by any lacrosse player on Crystal Mangum meant anything at all , except to mean the players were guilty .
( One North Carolina Central University student declared that the players " left nothing behind . " )

Cypher — The Graph Query Language
With Neo4j , connections between data are stored – not computed at query time .
Cypher is a powerful , graph - optimized query language that understands , and takes advantage of , these stored connections .
When trying to find patterns or insights within data , Cypher queries are often much simpler and easier to write than massive SQL JOINs .
Since Neo4j does n’t have tables , there are no JOINs to worry about .
For comparison with SQL , here 's a simple Cypher query matching all products in a category hierarchy :
Cypher
MATCH ( p: Product ) -[: CATEGORY ]->( l: ProductCategory ) -[: PARENT *0.. ]->(: ProductCategory {name : " Dairy Products "} ) RETURN p.name
Here 's a similar query in SQL , which is longer and more complex .
Unlike Cypher , where depth is unlimited , this SQL query selects just three levels of depth .

The Context : Being a slacker
In the early months of 1994 I wrote a program to play Scrabble .
It was a magnificent piece of code , easily the fastest Scrabble program I had ever seen .
The implementation ( in C ) was based on the GADDAG data structure and algorithm explained in a paper by Steven Gordon .
The resulting program was so fast that computer moves were instantaneous .
Unfortunately I had to keep my software a secret .
The lawyers at Hasbro love to send nastygrams to anyone who implements a Scrabble program .
These guys are a lot like the lawyers at the RIAA who have become famous for their lawsuits against toddlers and family pets .
The Hasbro legal team is merely less prolific .
Actually there was one other reason why I kept my Scrabble program a secret :
I wrote the entire thing on company time using my employer 's hardware .
At the time I was working for Spyglass .
We had recently finished shipping version 2.0 of our flagship product , Spyglass Transform .
Things were a bit slow , so I was discreetly hacking on my pet project .
I setup my office such that nobody could see my screen from the door .
Unfortunately , I gave myself away .
At times when I was working on my Scrabble code when my boss ( Tim Krauskopf ) walked in the door , I would flinch and quickly try to minimize the window .
About the third time it happened , Tim said , " All right , what game are you playing ? "
Suddenly I wished I actually was playing something like Doom .
In that moment , working on non-company software seemed more shameful than wasting time in a first - person shooter .
I offered a full confession and an apology .
I do n't remember what he said .
I do remember that he never mentioned it again .
The Inflection Point : Day 1 of the browser wars
A few weeks later , on April 4th , 1994 , Tim once again stepped into my office .
He said he needed to talk with me somewhere offsite .
We left .
In that conversation , Tim told me that the Spyglass management team was making the decision to abandon our then current business ( scientific data visualization tools ) and get into the web browser business .
He asked me to immediately begin working and commit to giving a demo to an important potential customer a few weeks later .
I shifted into high gear .
I came in at 5:30 am every day for weeks .
I was writing code at a fantastic pace .
The demo was successful .
We showed them our browser .
It did n't have as many features as NCSA Mosaic , but it was a lot faster .
We did n't tell them that it was written from scratch in less than a month by a kid who had never written any networking code before .
We got the sale .
And that was just the beginning .
The project started out with me alone , but two years later it was a team of 50 with me in a leadership role .
We were the first Internet IPO .
We licensed our browser to Microsoft and it became Internet Explorer .
That conversation on April 4th ended up being a defining moment for my career .
And it happened just a few weeks after Tim caught me skiving off on the job .
What the % #$@ was Tim thinking ?
The Premise : Tim made a wise choice
I 'm going to surface a lesson from this story , but you should probably read no further if you disagree with Tim 's decision .
And if you do , I can't really argue with you .
I 'm not going to defend my actions .
I was being irresponsible , even dishonest .
There are no excuses for behavior like that .
Maybe
Tim should have fired me .
At the very least , maybe Tim should not have entrusted the development of his company 's next big product to someone who lacked the discipline to stay on task .
Still , the overall results deserve some kind of voice in this argument .
Tim and his company were very successful .
Tim drives a Ferrari now .
Tim 's choice worked out very well for me , but it turned out pretty well for Spyglass too .
The Lesson Learned : Choose your manager carefully
This story may seem like it's about me , but really it 's about Tim Krauskopf .
I 've never asked Tim why , so I guess I do n't really know .
Maybe he just believes that being obsessive to a fault about code is n't the worst character defect for a developer to have .
I spent five years at Spyglass .
The incident described above is just one of many that left me in awe of Tim 's leadership skills and discernment .
I do n't think I ever really figured out what makes that guy tick , but I still think of him every time I measure myself as a manager and leader .
The part that seems most astonishing to me is that he kept his emotions in check .
Did n't he feel any sort of disappointment or even betrayal ?
Why did n't he overreact ?
That 's what most people would have done .
I probably would have .
All I really know here is this :
Your manager plays an enormous role in determining the success of your career .
Choose your manager very , very carefully .
Choose somebody smart .
Find somebody who is not merely smart , but " emotionally smart " .
Find somebody who is not merely smart , but wise .
Choose a person from whom you can learn .
Just to be clear , I am not saying you are powerless .
Your success is mostly determined by your own abilities and choices .
But one of those choices is the decision of who you are going to work with .
Do n't take that choice lightly .

Tavis chose the hairstyle himself A three - year - old boy has been banned from his Tyneside nursery school class for his trendy " tramlines " haircut .
The mother of Tavis Cook was told the youngster 's distinctive hairdo broke the rules of Riverside primary School in North Shields .
Donna
Cook has been told to keep her son away until his hair grows back .
North Tyneside Council said it was aware of the matter and was advising Ms Cook on her options .
No-one at the school was available for comment .
Miss
Cook took the youngster to the barber 's where he chose the trendy hairstyle .
He is the most placid , lovely lad , he 's never in trouble
Donna Cook
But less than an hour after dropping the youngster off for nursery class the next morning , she was telephoned and asked to return to collect him .
Miss Cook , 21 , a mother of two , of Cardonnel Street , North Shields , said : " The wall of the barber 's shop was covered with hundreds of pictures of different haircuts .
" Tavis marched straight up and picked out the one where the man had tramlines .
" I 'd checked with the school and been told there was no uniform policy for either the nursery year or reception year , and I thought the haircut looked good .
" When I arrived he was in floods of tears .
I can't believe they'd do this to a little boy like Tavis .
" He is the most placid , lovely lad , he 's never in trouble . "
A spokesman for North Tyneside Council said : " We are aware of this issue and are currently advising the parent on the matter . "
A spokesman from Riverside Primary School said head teacher Dame Mary MacDonald was not available for comment .

Eat your broccoli !
That 's the advice from UCLA researchers who have found that a chemical in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables may hold a key to restoring the body 's immunity , which declines as we age .
Published in the online edition of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , the study findings show that sulforaphane , a chemical in broccoli , switches on a set of antioxidant genes and enzymes in specific immune cells , which then combat the injurious effects of molecules known as free radicals that can damage cells and lead to disease .
Free radicals are byproducts of normal body processes , such as the metabolic conversion of food into energy , and can also enter the body through small particles present in polluted air .
A supercharged form of oxygen , these molecules can cause oxidative tissue damage , leading to disease -- for example , triggering the inflammation process that causes clogged arteries .
Oxidative damage to body tissues and organs is thought to be one of the major causes of aging .
" The mysteries of aging have always intrigued man , " said Dr. Andre Nel , the study 's principal investigator and chief of nanomedicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" While we have known for some time that free radicals are important in aging , most of the past attention has focused on the mechanisms that produce free radicals rather than addressing the pathways used by the body to suppress their production . "
A dynamic equilibrium exists in the body between the mechanisms that lead to increased free radical production and those antioxidant pathways that help combat free radicals .
" Our study contributes to the growing understanding of the importance of these antioxidant defense pathways that the body uses to fight free radicals , " said Nel , a practicing clinical allergist and immunologist at the Geffen School .
" Insight into these processes points to ways in which we may be able to alleviate the effects of aging . "
The delicate balance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant forces in the body could determine the outcome of many disease processes that are associated with aging , including cardiovascular disease , degenerative joint diseases and diabetes , as well as the decline in efficiency of the immune system 's ability to protect against infectious agents .

" As we age , the ability of the immune system to fight disease and infections and protect against cancer wears down as a result of the impact of oxygen radicals on the immune system , " Nel said .
According to the UCLA study , the ability of aged tissues to reinvigorate their antioxidant defense can play an important role in reversing much of the negative impact of free radicals on the immune system .
However , until this current study , the extent to which antioxidant defense can impact the aging process in the immune system was not properly understood .
" Our defense against oxidative stress damage may determine at what rate we age , how it will manifest and how to interfere in those processes , " Nel said .
" In particular , our study shows that a chemical present in broccoli is capable of stimulating a wide range of antioxidant defense pathways and may be able to interfere with the age - related decline in immune function . "
The UCLA team not only found that the direct administration of sulforaphane in broccoli reversed the decline in cellular immune function in old mice , but they witnessed similar results when they took individual immune cells from old mice , treated those cells with the chemical outside the body and then placed the treated cells back into a recipient animal .
In particular , the scientists discovered that dendritic cells , which introduce infectious agents and foreign substances to the immune system , were particularly effective in restoring immune function in aged animals when treated with sulforaphane .
advertisement
" We found that treating older mice with sulforaphane increased the immune response to the level of younger mice , " said Hyon - Jeen Kim , first author and research scientist at the Geffen School .
To investigate how the chemical in broccoli increased the immune system 's response , the UCLA group confirmed that sulforaphane interacts with a protein called Nrf2 , which serves as a master regulator of the body 's overall antioxidant response and is capable of switching on hundreds of antioxidant and rejuvenating genes and enzymes .
Nel said that the chemistry leading to activation of this gene - regulation pathway could be a platform for drug discovery and vaccine development to boost the decline of immune function in elderly people .
" This is a radical new way of thinking in how to increase the immune function of elderly people to possibly protect against viral infections and cancer , " Nel said .
" We may have uncovered a new mechanism by which to boost vaccine responses by using a nutrient chemical to impact oxidant stress pathways in the immune system . "
Kim said that although there is a decline in Nrf2 activity with aging , this pathway remains accessible to chemicals like sulforaphane that are capable of restoring some of the ravages of aging by boosting antioxidant pathways .
The next step is further study to see how these findings would translate to humans .
" Dietary antioxidants have been shown to have important effects on immune function , and with further study , we may be adding broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables to that list , " Nel said .
For now , Nel suggests including these vegetables as part of a healthy diet .
Nel said that these findings offer a window into how the immune system ages .
" We may find that combating free radicals is only part of the answer .
It may prove to be a more multifaceted process and interplay between pro- and antioxidant forces , " he said .
The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging , the UCLA Claude D. Pepper Older Adults Independence Center , and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
Other study authors included Berenice Barajas and Dr. Meiying Wang .
Doctors are calling her a ' miracle baby ' - the little girl who was delivered alive and well after growing in her mother 's ovary instead of the womb .
For nine months , Meera Thangarajah and her husband Ravi were completely unaware their baby was anything but normal .
It was only during the birth , at just before full term , that midwives realised they were dealing with a medical phenomenon .
Her parents have called the little girl ' Durga ' meaning Goddess , because ' she is our little deity ' , a beaming Mr Thangarajah said today .
British experts say the chances of a baby being carried for so long in this way and both mother and child surviving unharmed are a million to one .
Million to one : Ravi Thangarajah cuddles her miracle baby daughter Durga who grew inside her ovary for almost nine months
Professor James Walker , spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , said Mrs Thangarajah was ' very lucky ' .
' Not a lot of them will get to term - no more than one in a million and maybe even less than that , ' he said .
An ovarian pregnancy is one of the rarest variations of ectopic - or out of the womb - pregnancies , which can have life - threatening consequences for the mother .
' This form of pregnancy is rare enough , but to have it go full term is unheard of , ' said obstetrician Andrew Miller who delivered the child by caesarian section in Australia 's Northern Territory .
' I have never come across it in any hospital . '
As an overjoyed Mrs Thangarajah , 34 , cuddled her special baby in hospital last night , Dr Miller added : ' It truly is a miracle she got a living baby out of it - she 's extraordinarily lucky . '
He said he was astonished that , as the child grew , the mother 's ovary did not stretch and break which could have caused deadly internal bleeding .
Healthy :
The baby has been called Durga meaning Goddess because her parents believe she is ' their little deity ' , so small were the chances of her survival
Durga was born at 38 weeks , just two weeks earlier than full term , weighing 6lbs 3 oz ( 2.8kg ) .
Both she and her mother are completely healthy .
The extraordinary birth was the culmination of an apparently normal pregnancy , with the parents and doctors never suspecting that anything had gone wrong .
Mr and Mrs Thangarajah , who emigrated to Australia from India several years ago , drove to the Darwin Private Hospital at 6.30 in the morning to have a planned Caesarean operation for their second child .
There had been no complications during the pregnancy and even regular ultrasound tests had shown nothing unusual .
But as Dr Miller began performing the operation he could not believe his eyes - the baby was squeezed into the right ovary .
The skin was stretched so thin that he could see the baby 's hair and facial features through it .
He admitted later it was almost impossible to believe because an ectopic pregnancy , which occurs when a fertilised egg develops outside of the uterus , usually ends in miscarriage .
If it is discovered , doctors bring about a termination because of the threat it can cause to the mother .
But here was a woman who had carried the ' out of womb ' child to a full term .
' She was very lucky that the ovary had not ruptured as the baby grew and stretched the skin , ' said the obstetrician .
' The ovary could have ruptured at any moment , leaving both mother and baby 's lives at risk .
' This is indeed a medical phenomenon . '
Dr Miller explained that Mrs Thangarajah 's egg did not travel down the fallopian tube and into the uterus in the normal way , remaining instead in the ovary for the full term .
' Most women whose egg begins to fertilise outside of the womb present themselves to hospital with severe pain and bleeding in the early weeks of their pregnancy and they have no choice but to abort the baby - or risk their own life , ' he said .
Yet curiously Mrs Thangarajah had no symptoms apart from the usual morning sickness , discomfort and nausea .
Added to the chances of the rare pregnancy remaining undiscovered was the failure of the ultrasound monitor to show anything unusual , despite the mother - to - be 's regular check - ups .
' If we 'd detected this in the early stages , she would have been advised to abort , ' said Dr Miller .
Mrs Thangarajah was spellbound to hear of her attention - grabbing pregnancy last night .
Fighting back tears of happiness she said : ' I had no idea my pregnancy was abnormal .
' I did n't know anything about it until I woke up after the Caesarean and the doctors told me .
' I'm feeling like the luckiest woman in the world . '
The same words were expressed by her husband .
Mr Thangarajah said : ' Not only do I feel lucky - the doctors have told me I 'm one of the luckiest of men at the moment . '
Baby Durga is a little sister for the couple 's other daughter , six - year - old Gayatri .
Hospital spokeswoman Robyn Cahill said only 1 in 40,000 fertilisations implant in the ovary and unusual for one of those fetuses not to be born prematurely , before 37 weeks .
' It is extremely rare -- I have never seen a case that progresses until foetal viability , ' said Mark Erian , a specialist in high - risk obstetrics at the University of Queensland .
' She was absolutely lucky to have her pregnancy progress . '
Prof Walker said : ' The vast majority of pregnancies like this will end either with the loss of the baby because it cannot survive or with it being removed because there are risks to the mother .
' The chances of survival are very slim .
It was not that the woman was at risk all along .
It must have implanted in the right place and not caused problems .
' She was very luck that this occurred , allowing her to carry this baby to term .
In most cases she would not have died , but the pregnancy would have been lost . '
Ovarian pregnancies are a one in 40,000 occurrence and are usually terminated before 10 weeks .
The Thangarajahs had ' taken a little while to absorb the gravity of the news ' , Ms Keogh said .
' I think they are just so very grateful for the outcome . '
THE DEADLY TRUTH ABOUT ECTOPIC PREGNANCIES
An ectopic pregnancy happens in the wrong place - and the consequences can be deadly .
The fertilised egg implants outside the womb , often in one of the two fallopian tubes or by attaching to the abdominal wall , and starts to grow .
It is often not diagnosed for several weeks until symptoms develop into a medical emergency that can be life - threatening .
The baby must then be removed surgically , sometimes with the fallopian tube as well , which makes it more difficult to get pregnant again .
The condition kills at least four women every year out of 3,000 sufferers in the UK , usually though massive loss of blood .
Consultant obstetrician Dr Maggie Blott , spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , said the Australian case was a rare occurrence .
She said : ' We have seen abdominal pregnancies that have gone to term but an ovarian pregnancy that has gone almost to term is very , very unusual .
' Implanting in the ovary ensured a blood supply for the growing fetus , which would have been supported in the normal way by the placenta .
' But the mother was extremely lucky as the ovary could have burst .
If the embryo had implanted in only a slightly different position then it might have been a very different outcome as the consequences can be life - threatening .
' Ectopic pregnancies can be very difficult to spot in advance even in London hospitals which are equipped with the latest scanners . '
Among high - profile sufferers are Sophie , the Duchess of Wessex , and actresses Nicole Kidman and Amanda Redman , who also suffered the loss of ectopic babies .
Cases in the UK are going up from the rate of one in 200 pregnancies found 20 years ago to one in 60 for women in their 30s .
Experts blame the rising age of motherhood and pelvic infection which causes damage to the tubes , making it more difficult for the embryo to reach the womb .
Existing tests for the condition include blood screening and ultrasound but these are not accurate in the early stages of pregnancy , although new tests are being developed .
This review of Ronald Dworkin 's book Is Democracy Possible Here ?
( the " here " being the US ) will appear in the next issue of The Philosophers ' Magazine .
Ronald Dworkin , Is Democracy Possible Here ?
Principles for a New Political Debate , Princeton University Press , £ 12.95 /$ 19.95 ( hb )
Ten years ago , the political philosopher Michael Sandel published a book entitled Democracy ’s Discontent .
American politics were in a dreadful state .
Citizens were anxious and fearful , and felt helpless in the face of the seemingly irresistible unravelling of the “ moral fabric of community ” .
Worse still , Sandel argued , American politicians were incapable of making sense of this condition .
He was n’t alone in thinking something was up with American democracy , of course .
But there was something distinctive about Sandel ’s diagnosis of the crisis .
The reasons for the failure of politicians to address popular discontent lay not in the arguments they advanced but rather in the “ public philosophy ” that underpinned them .
Sandel ’s contention was that a version of the liberal political theory developed by John Rawls and others had come , in the post - war period , to form the background to political discussion and debate – which was focused principally on questions having to do with welfare reform , rights and the extent of legitimate government regulation .
Political liberalism of the Rawlsian variety had given shape to what Sandel called the “ procedural republic . ”
In this form of democracy the procedures for public decision - making are based on values of fairness and openness , and make no reference to more substantive ethical , moral or religious premises .
Indeed , the procedural conception requires that in politics people ’s most fundamental convictions be bracketed or set aside .
Since reasonable people can’t agree on the best way to live , government should be neutral on the question of the good life .
In Sandel ’s view , it was this aspiration to neutrality that was the source of democratic discontent , for the strictly procedural values of fairness are too thin and etiolated to sustain genuine civic engagement in public life .
The challenge for political philosophy was to figure out how political discourse might “ engage rather than avoid the moral and religious convictions people bring to the public realm . ”
In the ten years since Sandel wrote his book , a decade that has pitted “ red ” states against “ blue ” and the religious right against the secularist left , that challenge has , if anything , become even sharper .
But in Is Democracy Possible Here ? , Ronald Dworkin , a leading proponent of the kind of liberalism Sandel was criticising , attempts to meet it .
The bitterly divisive presidential election of 2004 dramatised some fundamental disagreements over , among other things , the place of religion in politics and the nature of democracy itself .
It also marked a low - point in the history of political debate in America .
Yet for all the unpleasantness and bitterness of that campaign , Dworkin is n’t convinced that the two contending blocs , the red and the blue , are cultural monoliths hermetically sealed from each other .
There is no intrinsic reason , for example , why those who favour a bigger role for religion in public life should also support tax cuts for the rich .
That ’s an accident of politics and history , not a matter of principle and philosophy .
And it ’s at the level of principled philosophical argument that Dworkin ’s book is pitched .
If “ decent ” political debate is to be possible , there must be some very basic principles shared by all the parties to discussion , irrespective of “ cultural ” and other differences .
Absent such a common ground and politics becomes just a kind of war .
Dworkin ’s aim is to show that there is common ground in America ’s divided political culture and that , consequently , genuine political argument ( “ democracy ” , in other words ) is possible .
What ’s most interesting about this enterprise is Dworkin ’s recognition that , as Sandel argued , purely formal principles of procedural fairness wo n’t suffice :
“ We must not try to exclude people ’s most profound convictions from political debate . ”
Rather , Dworkin thinks we ought to engage those convictions while at the same time seeking to stay true to the “ attractive hope ” which animates Rawls ’s political liberalism – that reasonable people with differing ethical , moral and religious beliefs will come to accept the constraints of public reason .
In the model Dworkin proposes , there are fundamental principles held in common by all parties , and these fundamental principles subtend political debate .
Genuine argument , therefore , will be about the direction in which those fundamental principles ramify .
And the principles in question are “ deep principles about human value ” and human dignity .
Dworkin calls them the “ principle of intrinsic value ” and the “ principle of personal responsibility ” .
The former holds that human lives have a special kind of objective value , qua human lives , and the latter that each person has a responsibility to make his life go better rather than worse .
In both cases , Dworkin needs to show that these principles really do constitute “ common ground ” .
Take the principle of intrinsic value .
Dworkin assumes that most of us think there is an objective standard of a good life and that a life can go more or less well .
Further , most of us would agree , he says , that the “ importance of our leading successful rather than wasted lives does not depend on our wanting to do so . ”
But what if one ’s conception of the importance of leading a good life derives from the conviction that god wants us to live in a certain way ?
Not all of us think that , however ; instead , some of us treat the importance of living a good life as an axiom ( it ’s important to lead a successful life just because we have a life to lead ) .
Dworkin ’s response is to point out that “ our American religions ” –and he is candid that the point might not apply elsewhere in the world– are “ religions of humanity ” in which all persons are equal in the eyes of god .
And if you believe that , he says , then you ’re bound to embrace the principle of intrinsic value .
Dworkin also appeals to the distinctive characteristics of “ American religion ” in expounding the principle of personal responsibility .
He considers the charge that this principle , which requires that persons freely choose their own ends , reflects a conception of what Sandel calls the “ unencumbered self ” , a self constituted prior to and independently of its purposes and ends .
Dworkin agrees that the idea of the person as a “ self - contained atom ” deciding questions of value entirely by himself is absurd .
Culture , after all , is inescapable .
But there is a difference between being influenced by the values of others and subordinating oneself to their will .
And people who equate living well with following the dictates of some religious tradition do n’t regard themselves as having been coerced into that opinion .
If that ’s right , then the principle of personal responsibility is not incompatible with the acceptance of religious conviction .
At least that ’s true of “ American ” religions .
Dworkin acknowledges that it clearly would n’t be true in places where , for instance , religious officials have the power to punish apostates .
There ’s another criticism one might make of Dworkin here , however , and it ’s that he has failed in his attempt to see things from the point of view of the religious believer : it ’s possible that , for the believer , the requirements of religious adherence do not appear as self - imposed but , precisely , as transcendent obligations .
What Dworkin is offering here is not a blueprint for the dissolution of political disagreements , but rather a new way of seeing them – as controversies about the “ best interpretation ” of values that are shared , rather than clashes between irreconcilable worldviews .
This invites a further question to which he gives rather scanter consideration : “ do we have the kind of political system that might accommodate a genuine debate ? ”
His answer seems to be : no , but we could have .
He envisages a “ partnership ” model of democracy , in which public reasoning and debate are placed at the centre of political and policy justification .
This deliberative conception functions as a sort of utopian ideal , but since Dworkin is doing political philosophy here and not advocacy , his book is none the worse off for it .
Senator Larry Campbell is drafting a bill to protect the Canadian Football League from a full - scale American invasion , arguing that a National Football League franchise making a full - time home in Toronto would “ be the demise of the CFL . ”
Speculation on the NFL ’s future in Canada has been swirling anew this year , with the Buffalo Bills set to play eight games inside the Rogers Centre over the next five seasons , beginning with an exhibition game in August .
Organizers have trumpeted the high demand for tickets , and some believe the arrangement will ultimately lead to the team ’s permanent relocation to Toronto .
“ I believe that it ’s time that we just say , ‘ enough , ’ ” Mr. Campbell said Thursday
“ We have a vibrant league .
We have millions of people who watch it .
We have a much more exciting brand of football .
And let me tell you , I ’m an NFL fan .
I ’ve gone to the last two Super Bowls , so it ’s not like I ’m anti-NFL .
I just do n’t need it in Canada . ”
He plans to present the bill to the Senate in two or three weeks , before it adjourns for the summer .
Mr. Campbell addressed the issue on the floor last month and , as a long - time supporter of the B.C. Lions , he does not intend for his actions to be merely symbolic .
“ I do n’t do symbolic gestures , ” he said .
“ I do n’t run up against walls , I do n’t fight battles that I do n’t think I can win .
“ I plan on trying to make it very difficult for the NFL to come into Canada , and I expect that I am going to call upon politicians , both in the Senate and the House [ of Commons ] , to stand up , ” the Senator said .
Mr. Campbell would not disclose the details of his planned bill or how it might impede NFL forays into Canada .
Rogers Communications is paying the Bills $ 78 - million for the eight games in Toronto , with announced ticket prices for the public ranging as high as $ 295 .
The least - expensive seat will still cost $ 55 , tapping into the kind of wealth that has largely vanished from Buffalo .
“ I think there are many ways of protecting the CFL , which can be worked out between the leagues , ” said Toronto Blue Jays president Paul Godfrey , who has spent two decades trying to land an NFL team .
“ It does n’t need government involvement .
Nobody wants to protect the CFL more than the people who are trying to bring the NFL to Canada . ”
Mr. Campbell is not the first would - be protector of the CFL .
Former federal health minister Marc Lalonde introduced the Canadian Football Act to the Senate on April 10 , 1974 , in response to another U.S. - based threat .
The now - defunct World Football League was preparing to place a team in Toronto — called the Northmen — and Mr. Lalonde ’s bill sought to ban foreign leagues from Canadian soil .
It never became law .
“ It was a warning shot kind of thing , ” Mr. Lalonde said with a chuckle Thursday .
“ It was not the top priority of the government , let ’s put it that way .
It made a lot of noise and news for a while , and the situation took care of itself . ”

NASA scientists have uncovered new details about how plasma from superstorms interact with Earth ’s magnetosphere .
“ The surprising result of this model is that the magnetosphere ’s main phase pressure is dominated by energetic protons from the plasmasphere , rather than from the solar wind , ” says Mei-Ching Fok , an astrophysicist at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. Fok and her team will present their findings on May 29 at the American Geophysical Union conference in Ft. Lauderdale , Fl .
Violent activity on the sun , such as a solar flare , can produce a monster superstorm that releases plasma into the solar wind .
Large flares often result in an ejection of material from the solar corona , called a coronal mass ejection ( CME ) .
A CME can spew billions of tons of plasma away from the sun and toward Earth at speeds faster than 1.5 million mph .
The plasma affects Earth and the vicinity surrounding Earth dominated by its magnetic field , called the magnetosphere .
As plasma from a superstorm interacts with Earth ’s magnetosphere , it can trigger spectacular displays of the Northern Lights , called auroras , interfere with communications between satellites and airplanes traveling near the North Pole , and interrupt global positioning systems and our power grid .
Fok and her team used their global ion kinetic model to evaluate contributions to magnetospheric pressure from the solar wind , polar wind , auroral wind , and plasmaspheric wind .
Their model , which simulates sources of superstorm plasmas , found that energetic protons from the plasmasphere dominate the magnetosphere ’s main phase pressure .
Until now , scientists thought energetic protons from the solar wind most affected the magnetosphere .
The inner region of Earth ’s magnetosphere contains a low - density mixture of hot and cold plasmas , which include the ring current , the plasmasphere , and the radiation belt .
The plasmasphere is a donut - shaped region of the inner magnetosphere .
During space storms , the plasmasphere is squashed and pressurized by the solar wind , forming a long tail called the plasmaspheric plume .
The plume particles are picked up and further energized by the solar wind .
When they re-enter the magnetosphere , they supply the majority of energetic protons that affect the magnetosphere ’s main phase pressure during a superstorm event .
Simulating the sources of superstorm plasmas will help to better understand superstorms and pave the way to predicting their impact on Earth .
The details uncovered in the team ’s model provide a new piece of the Sun - Earth puzzle .
Areas of brain linked to risky , risk - averse financial choices , researchers find
L.A. Cicero Kuhnen , left , and Knutson are co-authors of “ The Neural Basis of Financial Risk - Taking . ”
A Stanford psychology professor and a doctoral candidate in finance have shown for the first time that activation of two parts of the brain linked to excitement and anxiety influence rational and irrational financial decisions .
The findings , the researchers argue , ultimately could be used to improve the design of economic institutions to help investors make better choices .
" If you read academic finance and economic literature , you see that people do n't really accept the notion that affect , or emotion , can play a role when you make economic choices , " said Camelia Kuhnen , a doctoral candidate at the Graduate School of Business .
Kuhnen and psychology Assistant Professor Brian Knutson are co-authors of " The Neural Basis of Financial Risk - Taking , " which was published Sept. 1 in Neuron .
" We academics tend to assume that people are rational and levelheaded when they make important decisions , " Kuhnen added .
" But psychologists show that [ emotion ] matters for a lot of things . "
In one of the first collaborations between neuroscience and economics , Kuhnen and Knutson carried out the study to find out whether emotion also can affect a person when it comes to making investments .
They discovered that it does .
" People are not as rational as we would like them to be , " Kuhnen said .
" I 'm happy we got these results because I believe this is evidence that economists should take [ emotion ] into consideration when we write [ investing ] models for individuals . "
Kuhnen and Knutson used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to scan volunteers ' brains as they performed an exercise that required them to choose between two stocks and a bond that offered real financial gains and losses .
( fMRI scans use magnetic fields to map blood flow in brain regions .
When an area is active , blood flow increases . )
In the study , the researchers randomly designated one of the stocks a " bad " stock , which was more likely to lose money , and the other a " good " stock , which was more likely to make money .
The bond offered a safe but low - return investment .
The 19 study participants , all Stanford doctoral students , were asked to pick between the two stocks and one bond 10 times during 20 separate games .
The volunteers did not know which stock was good or bad , but had to figure out which was which by watching the market .
Subjects also could select the bond .
During the experiment , held at Stanford 's Richard M. Lucas Center for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy , the researchers looked at activation of two parts of the brain linked to emotion .
The nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) is a peanut - sized area that becomes active when someone expects a reward of a primary nature , such as water if a person is thirsty , Kuhnen said .
It is an area rich in the molecule dopamine and is linked to the addictive effect of drugs .
In past studies , Knutson has shown that the nucleus accumbens also activates if someone anticipates a financial reward , even before he or she actually receives the money .
In contrast , the anterior insula , another part of the brain linked to anxiety , lights up when a person sees disgusting , repulsive stimuli , such as mutilated bodies , or when someone anticipates physical pain , Kuhnen said .
In the study , the researchers discovered that the nucleus accumbens kicked into action two seconds before subjects made a " risk - seeking " choice that was a mistake — when they decided to invest in a stock even if it had a bad history .
In contrast , the anterior insula was activated just before the volunteers made a less than optimal " risk - averse " choice that prompted them to invest in a safe but low - return bond instead of the good stock .
Overall , the study found that volunteers made the rational , optimal choice 75 percent of the time .
" Basically , [ the findings ] confirmed our hypothesis that these two areas are involved in decision - making , " Kuhnen said .
" What was [ most ] interesting was to look at the activation of these two areas before one makes investment choices .
The question is , can you predict whether or not people are going to choose a risky investment or a risk - less investment ?
Moreover , can you predict whether people will make a mistake when they choose an investment ? "
The researchers noted that institutions encouraging either " risk - seeking " behavior — such as casinos — or " risk - averse " behavior — such as insurance companies — understand how excitement and anxiety influence people 's decisions .
" You go to Vegas , and you are surrounded by all these rewards — free food , potential prizes , " Kuhnen said .
" We know from past studies that sights of potential rewards can activate your NAcc .
What this study shows is that when the NAcc is activated , you tend to be more risk seeking .
You tend to choose the stock more often and you tend to choose it when you should n't . "
An insurance company appeals to opposite emotions , Kuhnen added .
" If you go to an insurance office , people will show you pictures of crashes or tell you how you could be hurt .
We know that such a stimulus might activate your anterior insula .
Our study shows that high insula activation is a predictor of you making a risk - averse choice . "
According to the researchers , if the emotional states of individuals are included in rational decision - making models , people will be able to make better financial choices .
" That 's our contribution , " Kuhnen said .
" This work encompasses the rational model but it gives you a little more .
Nobody has ever predicted [ financial decisions ] using brain activation — you really can't go deeper than that . "
The findings can benefit individuals , Kuhnen said , in addition to economic institutions .
For example , she explained , if people see a piece of chocolate cake that stimulates their nucleus accumbens , they may be more likely to engage in " risk - seeking " behavior , such as shifting their portfolio into high - risk foreign stocks : " You have to ask yourself , is this my true preference ?
If I woke up tomorrow , would I make the same choice ? "
In other words , when making a big decision , take a step back and think before plunging ahead .
One of the most surprising things about the launch of an ultra-portable laptop dubbed " Air " by Apple was n't its thinness but the lack of an embedded WWAN radio .

I ’m an IT manager in the “ real world ” and as result , a pretty large portion of my time is spent interviewing potential candidates for both contract and full time IT positions .
I interview for positions on my team and also assist other managers when they are interviewing .
Lately , I ’ve been interviewing far more than usual due to the high workload we currently have .
I enjoy the interview process , as it provides me an opportunity to meet new people and expand my interpersonal and oral communication skills .
I ’m a bit of an introvert , so having to walk into a room and talk to a complete stranger is definitely out of my comfort zone , but interviewing has really helped .
It ’s amazing to me how much the various candidates differ .
Some are very technical , some not at all .
Some professional , some not .
Some very talkative and others hardly say a word .
As I ’ve been interviewing over the past couple of months , I ’ve compiled a list of 10 things you should n’t do during an interview .
These are things that pretty much make me cut the interview short and walk out .
Say you know something when you do n’t
This is the number one blunder in my book .
Nothing irritates me more than to say you know something on your resume , during an interview and then not be able to answer questions about it .
One candidate I interviewed claimed on his resume that “ He was the primary developer for all parts of the system “ .
I thought this was great and is exactly the kind of person I like to hire , someone well rounded .
I began asking him questions about the system and in a very short period of time , it became clear that he only worked on one part of the system , “ but knew about the other parts “ .
He knew about the whole system alright , knew they existed !
But he could n’t tell me anything more about the rest of it .
He flat out lied on his resume .
Next !
When you put together your resume , it ’s fine to sell yourself , but do n’t oversell or flat - out lie about your experience or what you worked on .
During the interview if you ’re asked about something , be honest and state your exact involvement .
If you do n’t know something or do n’t know the answer , just say you do n’t know .
One answer that really impresses me when I am interviewing is “ I do n’t know , but the first thing I would do is pull up Google and learn about it “ .
This answer shows both honesty and initiative , two primary things I look for .
I do n’t expect you to know everything , but I do expect you to know how to find the answers .
Dominate the conversation
A fairly recent candidate we interviewed looked really promising .
They had tons of technical experience and lots of knowledge about the development products we use .
At first he seemed great , he was very communicative , friendly and easy going .
The problem was we could n’t get him to stop communicating .
He would barely let us talk , let alone ask a question .
We would ask him a question and he would start to answer before we even finished asking .
Then he would ramble … and ramble and ramble .
We had one hour scheduled for the interview , and at the end of the hour I think we asked him a total of 3 or 4 questions .
We normally have about 30 .
Needless to say we did n’t hire him .
We also developed a way to communicate to each other ( we often do paired interviews ) that we do n’t like the candidate .
As the candidate , you should definitely talk more than the interviewer , but stay focused on answering the question and be wary of the amount of time the interview is scheduled for .
If there is time at the end of the interview , you can always ask questions and elaborate on previous answers .
Tell Jokes , Discuss Politics , or Religion
While this does n’t happen often , it does happen .
I had one guy a year or so ago that while waiting for my manager to come into the room , started telling me inappropriate jokes .
Some of them were sexual in nature , but most were female blond jokes .
I was trying not to rude , but I did n’t appreciate them one bit .
About the time I was getting ready to say something to him , my manager walked in .
She ’s blond .
I have never seen a guy turn so pale in my life .
I told him that based on our short conversation , I did n’t think he was a good fit for the position and escorted him to the door .
All the while he was apologizing all over himself .
Another candidate we interviewed asked me if I was religious during the interview .
First off , having these kinds of discussion is a HUGE HR no -no .
Second , it ’s just plain inappropriate for a job interview .
Anyway , I asked him why he wanted to know .
He proceeded to tell me about his particular religious association , about their beliefs and how Christians were such a huge problem .
Of course me being Christian , I had obvious issues with his comments , but held my tongue .
Again , I did n’t proceed with the interview .
If he is willing to bring these kinds of discussion up in an interview I can only imagine what issues he would cause in the workplace .
I have enough to deal with without adding a huge HR issue to my team .
Avoid telling jokes all together as you never know the person ’s perspective your talking to .
Avoid politics and religion as they really are n’t appropriate in most professional environments and they cause a great deal of controversy .
Also , they just are n’t pertinent in an interview .
I ’m talking to you because of your credentials and experience , not because of your religious or political perspective .
Dress too casually
This is another one that does n’t happen to often , but I ’ve had candidates arrive too casually dressed .
First , let me state that I do n’t hire people based on how they dress .
That is n’t important to me .
I do expect you to look decent and adhere to the corporate dress policy ( which is at a minimum jeans and a polo shirt ) .
I do n’t think showing up in jeans and a t - shirt is appropriate for an interview though , at least not where I work .
The far safer option is to overdress a little more than usual .
For example , in my normal job I wear khaki slacks , casual dress shoes , and either a polo or button down shirt .
For an interview I would wear the same but add a sport coat .
You ca n’t go wrong with a suit and tie .
At at previous employer who required people to wear suits , we had a candidate show up in shorts .
HR did n’t even bring him upstairs .
The best option is to ask the company about their dress code before the interview and either meet or exceed the dress code .
Dressing too casually shows lack of respect for the companies policies and lack of interest in the job .
After all , if I ca n’t get you follow the dress code , what success am I going to have in making you follow other even more important company policies .
Managers have enough work to do dealing with their good employees without having to manage a rebel .
Arrive Late
If I have to explain this one too much , you probably have larger issues need to consider , but arriving late ( without a really good reason ) will make me trash your resume in a heart beat .
During the normal business day , I probably have 1 - 2 hours at my desk to get work done .
The rest of my time is spent in meetings either with my employees , my management , or with my business area .
I also like to leave at a reasonable hour to spend time with family in the evening .
Do n’t disrespect me and waste my time by being late .
Inevitably things will occur such as traffic jams , car problems , family emergencies , etc .
Keep the contact number for the HR person or manager you are interviewing with handy .
If something happens and you are going to be late , call them immediately to let them know .
Even better , leave extra early .
Personally , I would rather wait in the parking lot for 30 minutes than be 5 minutes late .
Also , if for some reason you ca n’t make the interview due to misunderstanding the time , or some other crazy reason , call the company to explain and make an effort to reschedule .
I had scheduled a phone screen with a candidate a month or two ago .
I dialed in at the agreed upon time and waited on the phone for a good 15 minutes and they joined the conference call .
They also never called to explain why they did n’t call in .
They did n’t get the job .
Use profanity
I know this is a very personal thing and some people are okay with it and some people are n’t .
Profanity is just inappropriate in an interview .
You do n’t know what what the interviewers thoughts are about profanity so just do n’t risk it .
To me , use of profanity just shows you are n’t intelligent enough to find more appropriate words to express how you feel .
Just do n’t do it …at all .
Chew Gum
I had a candidate one time come into the interview chewing gum .
At first I had no problem with it , but as we proceeded through the interview it became more and more distracting .
I got so distracted with their gum chewing I had a hard time focusing on what they were saying .
To make matters worse , chewing gum was their nervous habit , so as the questions became tougher , the gum chewing became more aggressive .
It ’s perfectly fine to have a mint or gum before an interview , but remove it before meeting the interviewer .
Chewing gum in an interview just looks unprofessional .
Smoke a cigarette right before the interview
As a non-smoker , there is nothing worse than having to sit in a small interview room with someone who just finished smoking a cigarette .
I know , you smokers ca n’t smell it , but us non-smokers can .
Personally , I have asthma and would n’t even be able to stay in the room with you .
I ’m fine with people who smoke , but be aware of the effect it may have on the interviewer .
If you do need to smoke before an interview , smoke outside so the smoke does n’t get in your clothes as much .
Wash your hands , and chew some strong gum or a mint before interviewing .
Do n’t forget though , spit it out before the interview !
Have no questions for the interviewer
Nothing says I ’m not interested in the the job more than having no questions to ask .
At the very least I expect candidates to ask about the working environment , the type of equipment they ’ll have , dress code , culture , etc .
I also like it when a candidate asks how they did and whether I feel they would be a good fit for the job .
Be warned though , you may not get the answer you want .
So if you are n’t going to be okay with the answer , do n’t ask .
I would come prepared with at least 3 - 5 questions .
Visit the companies web - site and look at recent news items and ask about how a particular news item is going to impact work in the area .
Ask about how the department you are interviewing fits into the larger corporate picture .
These are just a few examples , but put some thought into it up front .
Asking questions will go a long way in showing the interviewer you are sincerely interested in the job and the company .
When multiple interviewers ask you the same question , give the same answer
A pretty common interview strategy is to have the candidate interview with multiple managers or team members .
Often the interviewers will ask the same or similar questions either through coincidence or strategy .
It amazes me at the number of candidates who do n’t think we ’ll compare answers after the interview is over .
When interviewing make sure you keep your answers consistent .
Do n’t make the mistake of changing your answers based on what you think the interviewer wants to hear .
Keep your answers honest and consistent and be assured they will be compared later .
One of the questions we ask is for the candidate to rate themselves on a scale from 1 - 10 on how well they know a technology .
You might be surprised at the number of candidates that rate themselves higher to non-technical interviewers and lower to technical interviewers .
Needless to say , people that do this do n’t get hired .
It ’s an integrity issue .

" AMERO " MEDALLIONS
Medallion Design by Daniel Carr
COPYRIGHT 2006 Designs Computed , All Rights Reserved
Fair Use Clause Invoked
The " Amero " is a hypothetical currency that , solely in theory , could be used to replace the Canadian and United States Dollars and the Mexican Peso , not unlike the way the Euro replaced many of Europe 's long - standing currencies .
The " Amero " presently exists only in theory , and there are no established plans to replace North America 's currencies with the Amero .
In August 2007 , rumors and conspiracy theories began circulating across the Internet regarding alleged United States Treasury issued " Amero " coins .
The inspiration behind these rumors may have the posting of images of medallions created by coin designer Daniel Carr .
Carr , who designed the Maine , New York and Rhode Island statehood quarters of 2001 , sells medals and tokens of his own design on his commercial website , " Designs Computed " ( also known as " DC Coin " ) .
Among his designs were three fantasy issues of an " Amero " coin , with the legend " Union of North America " on the back , with his company 's logo , a stylized " DC " , in small type .
Concerning his " Amero " designs , he mentions on his website : " My goal with these coins is not to endorse a Union of North America or a common ' Amero ' currency .
I fully support the United States Constitution , and I would not welcome ( in any form ) a diminishment of its provisions .
I expect that these coins will help make more people aware of the issue and the possible ramifications .
I leave it up to others to decide if they are in favor of , or against a North American Union .
And I encourage citizens to voice their approval or disapproval of government plans that impact them . "
Unauthorized postings of images taken from his website have been reposted widely across the internet , often being used as supposed " proof " of the Amero coinage .
Notably , former internet radio talk show host Hal Turner ran a full article on the " Amero coin " , claiming to have arranged for a United States Government minted " Amero " to be smuggled out of the Treasury Department by an employee of that organization .
Hal Turner 's website is now off - line , but an archive of the page in question is available at Internet Archive .
( Notice : Page contains openly racist & Anti-Semitic material . )
Following Turner 's assertions of federal minting of Ameros , a web site marketing the curio coins released a statement debunking Turner 's claims of a government cover up regarding Daniel Carr 's Amero products .
The urban legend reference website Snopes also ran a further debunking of Turner 's claims .
Contrary to what Hal Turner stated on his website , the DC Coin website was not erected simply to discredit him , but was , according to a WHOIS search via Network Solutions , registered on 5 September 2005 .
Archived versions of the website , dating back to 6 December 2005 , can be found at the Internet Archive 's Wayback Machine .
So there you have it .
The " Amero " coins with " Union of North America " on the back are privately issued numismatic novelties and nothing more !
However , they are available for sale from Carr 's website , and from the informational website AmeroCurrency.com .
Besides , if these coins were to be used in the United States as well as Canada and Mexico , would n't they have text in French and Spanish as well ?
ANTI - TAX ARGUMENTS ( United States of America )

" BRITISH ARCTIC TERRITORY " PRANK
While neither a deliberate nor intentional fraud , this was part of an April Fool 's Day joke that got entirely out of hand , and nearly sparked an international diplomatic incident !
A mock government website has been established to further explain this .
Below is an explanation by Clay Moss of Flags of the World , who helped design the flag ( An expanded explanation is on the webpage for the flag ) .
" This was the hoax territory I made up in 1995 .
I 've been strongly encouraged to write an article about the whole ' BAT ' ordeal , and will sometime when I get around to it .
I never dreamed so many would fall so hard for this hoax .
I thought I made it perfectly clear from the beginning it was an April Fools joke .
However , for 4 days after being asked if my story were true , the British Government would neither confirm nor deny the existence of the territory .
The Canadian government contacted me as well , not to tell me I was mistaken , but for verification of the story .
The US government also added the BAT to its ' official ' list of nations and territories .
It took quite a bit of effort to convince them the territory did n't really exist . "
In case you 're curious , the British Antarctic Territory , one of a number of Antarctic territorial claims , really does exist .

" BRITISH WEST INDIES "
There is a thriving market for " camouflage passports " used by international travelers ( Do a websearch for " camouflage passports " and see what comes up ) .
These intentionally fake passports are intended to be used to bluff would - be terrorists and kidnappers from abducting or shooting you , by using this to " prove " you 're not from the USA or other " evil " nation .
They are perfectly legal to sell and own in most countries , but using them fraudulently ( ie ; opening a bank account , obtaining a visa , etc. ) can constitute a felony .
These passports have names of countries that either :
(1 ) no longer exist ( such as " German Democratic Republic " , " South Vietnam " or any of the former South African bantustans / tribal homelands ) ,
( 2 ) have changed their names ( with the country 's original name on the passport , such as " Rhodesia " [ now Zimbabwe ] , or " New Hebredies " [ now Vanuatu ] ) ,
(3 ) never existed , but have familiar sounding names ( like " New Grenada " instead of Grenada or " Eastern Samoa " instead of Samoa ) .
The " British West Indies " is one of these name - only countries .
There is no country called the " British West Indies " !
Rather , it is a geographic term used for a group of islands ( Anguilla , Bermuda , British Virgin Islands , Cayman Islands , Montserrat , Turks and Caicos Islands ) in the Atlantic Ocean .
However , a number of people have sold " BWI " motor vehicle license plates , driver 's licenses , insurance cards , auto title & registration papers as part of a " sovereign citizen " package , supposedly to render one " exempt " from traffic laws and state registration requirements .
Such is not the case , and these items were ( and remain ) illegal to use as identification and registration .
There have been reports of fake " International Driver 's Licenses " being sold over the internet , supposedly issued by the " British West Indies " .
Be forewarned !
A " BWI " driver 's license can be seen on the image gallery page of the Militia Watchdog Archives .
Wikipedia has a listing on the British West Indies .
" Independent Sovereign State of the Principality of CAMSIDE "
This is another " fake nation " that is warned about on Quatloos .
They claim to be the true owners of Australia .
" What makes the sCamside ( sic ) fraud unique is that it is tied to one of the strangest scams of all times , the NESARA cult / scam by a woman named ' Dove ' in the Washington area who is more than a few fries short of a Happy Meal and who has urged the removal of President Bush ( apparently Dove is a big Saddam Hussein supporter ) .
Of course , just like the other fake nation scams the people behind sCamside have not just a few screws loose .
sCammers of a feather flock together . "

Imposters to the Kingdom of EDAN
This is a new country project that has had counterfeit passports issued in its name .
One of the project 's organizers , Richard Stump , aka King Richard , sent me an e-mail explaining the situation :
" In January 2001 I learned that at least three African families had been sold passports and visas to travel to the Kingdom of Edan for political asylum .
The first we learned of this was when someone I know recognized the name of Edan when a query came over her desk .
She contacted me and we determined that someone was selling political asylum to Edan for about $ 400 US per person .
We also learned that they were using the Edanian web site as ' proof ' that we were a full - fledged nation .
We quickly took it down . "
The project was restarted in 2012 , and the official website is here .
" Kingdom of ENENKIO ATOL " ( " Eneen - Kio " , " EnenKio " , " Enen Kio " )

" JOHNSTON ATOLL " LICENSE PLATES

While there have been motor vehicles on this unincorporated US territory , it has never issued its own license plates .
Any plates used were either from the jurisdiction where the vehicles originated ( usuially Hawaii ) , US Government vehicles with US Government plates , or Department of Defense vehicles with their registration numbers painted on them .
These plates were supposedly " issued " by former workers on the island as souvenirs .
However , some are being sold on the collectors market as genuine .
They are n't .

" KAWEAH INDIAN NATION "
There have been a number of charlatans preying on people seeking US Citizenship by offering them what appears to be " membership " a supposed Native American tribe .
According to Wikipedia : " The Kaweah Indian Nation , Inc. , is a civic group interested in Native American interests .
They applied for status as a federally recognized Native American tribe in the USA in the 1980s , a petition which was denied .
" Recently , scam artists have sold purported citizenships in the non-recognized tribe , particularly to Mexican nationals who have entered the US illegally .
Only one tribe , the Kickapoo , actually has dual citizenship with the USA and Mexico . "

" Principality of NEW UTOPIA "
The following is taken directly from an e-mail sent by Ian W. Sawyer .
The words are his : " I was involved with the project as one of the Board of Governors from early 1998 through to late 1999 , resigning after very major problems started appearing in the whole basis of the legality of New Utopia and Prince Lazarus ' dogmatic and dictatorial approach to them .
" Unfortunately I am restricted somewhat on what I can say as the result of a court ruling following a spectacularly unsuccessful attempt by Lazarus to sue me and a colleague for $ 10 billion , however there are copies of all the correspondence , which include the legal basis for the reasons I resigned from the project and all the subsequent comments by Lazarus and others , on the New Utopia Discussions Group with Yahoo at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/new-utopia, starting in October 1999 .
There have been further exchanges on the present position of New Utopia as late as the end of 2000 when it seems to have regrettably become little more than a scam .
" I hope that these are of interest to you and possibly your web site readers should you wish to publicise this URL ; after all , it is an open discussion group for all to read .
" I 'm still very interested in the principle of free nations , but subsequent to the considerable research I did into the subject following the discovery of Lazarus ' own inadequate research , I now firmly believe that about the only way that we will be able to achieve a new free sovereign nation , particularly one run along laissez faire capitalist lines , will be by the purchase of an uninhabited island from a poor third world nation , then seceding from it under economically viable terms for the formerly owning country . "
The original name of " Prince Lazarus Long " has been revealed as " Howard Turney " ( He had it legally changed ) .
The name " Lazarus Long " appears to have been taken from a character of science fiction writer , Robert Heinlein .

" NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS " COINS
In 2004 , the National Collector 's Mint , a USA based company that is , according to its website , " an independent , private corporation not affiliated with , endorsed , or licensed by the U.S. government or the U.S. Mint " , was selling coins that were promoted to be made from silver that was stored in the vaults of the World Trade Center in NYC , and were supposed " World Trade Center Commeratives " .
They were also marketed as " Freedom Dollars " or " Freedom Tower Silver Dollars " .
The problem is that the coins were marked " Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands " , which is a U.S. Territory and has no authority to mint its own currency .
Also , the coin is reportedly not solid silver , but made of bronze with a 100 mil silver plating .
These " coins " are no longer being offered by the company .
In the past , they have offered silver clad " State Quarter Tributes " of non-states such as Washington , DC and Puerto Rico .
A class action lawsuit was filed against the company .

Please treat these web sites as suspicious .
If you wish to donate to support the Red Cross or Red Crescent , you can do so through the authorized channels , which are as follows :
The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
The International Committee of the Red Cross
The National Societies of the Red Cross or Red Crescent

" Independent Principality of SAINT VALENTINE "
This country was tentatively listed on the " Actual Small Countries " page .
While it claims to be " ... a micronation between Switzerland and Austria and governed from the romantic medieval Saint Valentine Castle " , a " WHOIS " search through Network Solutions / VeriSign shows this website is owned by a " Daniel Reimann " in Ft. Lauderdale , Florida , USA .
E - mail sent to the " St. Valentine " address went unanswered .
On 12 July 2000 , the following e-mail was received from Ralf Strölin ( reproduced verbatim ) : " I was born in Radolfzell on the Lake of Constance ( Bodensee ) , which is only about 100 km by car from the point you can see on the map of the principality 's homepage .
" I can confirm you : between Switzerland and Austria , north of the Principality of Liechtenstein there is definitely NO other country .
" You can compare Saint Valentine with the Principality of Pontecorvo and the Republic of the Howland and Baker Islands .
According to their homepages all three seem to be recognized in our real world but they are fictitious Microstates . "
Danke , Herr Strölin .
NOTE : As of 9 February 2002 , the " St. Valentine " website had vanished , and the site 's URL routed to one operated by " United States Mail Security " .

Imposters to the Principality of SEALAND
There are only two official websites to the Principality of Sealand .
One is located at http://www.sealandgov.org and an older " historical " site at http://www.fruitsofthesea.demon.co.uk/sealand/index.html.
However , there are allegations that someone is using the title of " Sealand International Business Foundation " as the front for an Spanish criminal syndicate that may involve money laundering , drug smuggling , illegal arms trafficking and the sale of counterfeit Sealand identity documents .
Bates and family are reportedly ( and understandably ) irate over this , but are not implicated in the affair .
The Spanish Civil Guard is leading an investigation .
There are a anumber of websites posing as " official " Sealand websites , but are fake .
A list can be found here on the Official Sealand website .
One such fraudulent website is at http://www.principality-sealand.net.
According to a WHOIS search via Network Solutions / VeriSign , the site is registered to a German firm ( The link is provided solely for comparison , and may be shut down at any time ) .
Also , many of the links on this site no longer work [ this alone should cause the warning flags to start waving ] .
Caveat emptor . )
NOTE : As of 21 November 2001 , this site has apparently been shut down .
The second site is at http://www.principality-of-sealand.eu ( also routing through " www.principality-of-sealand.de " ) .
This claims to be a website run by Sealand 's " government in - exile " , led by an Alexander Gottfried Achenbach , who supposedly was Sealand 's Prime Minister * .
The site rather boldly states , " Please note that sovereign power of the Principality of Sealand cannot be exercised by the deposed Roy Bates or his collaborators . "
NOTE : Roy Bates ( Prince Roy of Sealand ) has not been deposed , and all official dealings with HavenCo have been with Prince Roy and his son Michael !
The site is bi-lingual ( English / German ) and also features such topics as UFO sightings and some sort of " free energy " device .
Also , a WHOIS search via Ripe NCC reveals a collection of German names and addresses connected to this particular website .
( Thanks to Tiffany Lavender for this information ! )
( * This may be the " German businessman " referred to in the official Sealand 's history page )
A third unauthorized website , this time in Spanish ( ! ) , can be found at http://www.telebase.es/sealand/.
A message from Cesidio Tallini , dated 29 May 2008 , is posted here verbatim .
The text is his alone :
The Micronational Professional Registry has been advised by the Bureau of Internal Affairs of Sealand that the entity called ...
Sealand University
... is wholly unconnected with the Principality .
We advise all National , Micronational , Organisational , and Professional members of the MPR to avoid any dealings with this purported university .
It seems to be abusing the Principality of Sealand 's good name , but it is also very probably a diploma mill .
We have informed the Distinguished President of Georgetown University that the purported university may be using his good name as well for its own nefarious purposes , and may be also violating Georgetown University 's website copyrights .
" united States Civil flag "
( Also known as " United States Civil Flag for Peacetime " )
" WESSEX Principality "
This page is almost all text , and offers the sale of citizenships and diplomatic appointments , but offers no information on the " Wessex Principality " .
To quote the website verbatim ( including typecase ) :
" this is a virtual principality , and citizenship is honoured by countries that we have diplomatic relations .
it can also be used as a secondary passport if in a dangerous country where your other passport can get you in hot water with your government or even death on sight of some countries passports .
the diplomatic appointments are given to all that wish to be a diplomat for the principality in their home city or country . "
There are no illustrations of the passport , nor any list of recognized nations .
The website requests that all payment be made payable to " CASH " and sent to a Post Office Box in Roseland , New Jersey , USA .

WORLDWIDE MICROPATRIOLOGICAL
INSTITUTE
( INSTITUT MONDIAL DE MICROPATOLOGIE ) [ WMI - IMM ]
The following is the text of an e-mail received from HM Cesidio Tallini of TTF - Bucksfan , on 5 January 2002 .
It is reprinted verbatim , and the words are his alone .
" I 've recently noticed on your " Micronation , Successionist & Homeland Groups " page that you have the link for a certain ' Worldwide Micropatrological Institute ' .
" Please note that a certain Patrice Chairoff advertises on this page ... http://isuisse.ifrance.com/microwatch/
" ... which is linked to his Home Page , that he has a certain literary work entitled ' THE MICROPATROLOGICAL BIBLE 2001 Edition ' .
This work , which is reported to be available for sale , in reality probably does not exist .
" If it existed , it would have been published in France , and in English , and that is very unlikely ...
" Also , France is where I sent the money when I ordered the work , and I sent Dr. Chairoff ( the degree may be false also ) the money via the reputable Western Union .
The work in question was never delivered , although they received my money , and no explanation was given either .
Then I was told that they were moving to Spain ...
" Please also note that the ' Worldwide Micropatrological Institute ' has been on the Internet at least since mid-1999 , and yet the Institute does n't seem to have a single Member ...
That 's pretty strange !
" It also does n't have enough traffic to even ensure its existence , nevermind the distribution of a multi-volume pubblication ( sic ) , and the website was last updated on ' Sun Dec 31 , 2000 9:39 am EST ' , according to stats available on the site itself ...
" If you did n't understand so far that the site , and organisation supposedly behind it , is a SCAM , then you are even more gullible than I am , and that 's very unlikely , since I 'm probably already registered as a Saint in Heaven ( which is part of the reason why I sent them $ 135 , for the work and postal expenses , and I 'm not even crying about the money ) .
" Just wanted you to know these details , but also because people like that simply do n't deserve the free publicity they are getting from you . "
A similar e-mail was received on 14 January 2002 , from George Cruickshank ( Georgivs II , Imperator et Primvs Inter Pares , Sovereign Head of State , Empire of Atlantium ) .
It is posted here verbatim .
" I am able to provide independent verification of Mr Tallini 's comments on your website concerning ' Dr Patrice Chairoff ' .
" I too have had the identical experience of purchasing ' Chairoff's ' alleged publication by wiring funds to France , without subsequent supply of the ( obviously non-existent ) goods ordered .
In my case I eventually received an email communication in response to a number of increasingly irate queries claiming that ' Chairoff ' had been involved in a serious car accident , delaying the despatch of my purchase .
Further queries were then ignored altogether .
" Prior to the conclusion of our financial transaction ' Chairoff ' claimed to be soon relocating to Spain , where he was due to open the world 's first ' micronational ' embassy in Barcelona in September 2001 , with the full support of the Catalan government .
Reference is made to this fantasy project on the website of the ' Republic of Texas ' , so I assume this group has also been hoodwinked in a similar manner .
" I have subsequently determined that ' Chairoff's ' real name is Dominique Calzi , and , apart from having a background in dubious espionage activities , he has been successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for fraud in France on at least several occasions .
These facts were made known to me privately by a member of the French legal profession .
" ' Chairoff ' works under a number of different aliases - some of them female - and I have seen at least two different websites for his ' Worldwide Micropatrological Institute ' - an organization that as far as I can determine does not exist .
His list of ' micronations ' is apparently a direct steal from the index of Fabrice O'Driscoll 's publication ' ILS NE SIÈGENT PAS À L'ONU '.
" He has falsely claimed in private communications to me to be a personal friend and professional associate of SAS Prince Giorgio of Seborga , HRH Michael of Sealand , and of Fabrice O'Driscoll , former Vice Foreign Minister of the Hutt River Province .
Mr O'Driscoll has refuted this claim in public communications to me .
" I published my experiences of dealing with ' Chairoff ' elsewhere on the web several months ago , in response to which ' Chairoff ' publicly threatened me with legal action .
I invited him to pursue this course of action in any jurisdiction he felt appropriate , and unsurprisingly have heard nothing more from or about him since that time .
" I trust this communication provides sufficient clarification for the purposes of visitors to your website .
If you have any other questions related to this matter please do not hesitate to ask . "
Another micropatriologist , who has requested anonymity , sent me the following message on 26 August 2002 : " As well as having an interest in micronationalism , I 'm also interested in heraldry .
I was quite interested to find that the name of Chairoff / Calzi is well known in this field as well .
He is associated with groups which will sell you a knightship ( carefully differentiated from a knighthood ) , maybe that of the Order of Lazarus , etc. , with convincing details of how this is a revived Order from mediaeval times .
" Originally he upset people in this field was by writing a book called ' False Knights , Real Suckers ' ( in the original ' Faux Chevaliers Vrais Gogos ' ) .
This upset two categories of people - those who were in the racket of selling ' knightships ' , and those who ordered his book , paying in advance , and never received anything .
" The reason why correspondence with him is erratic is simple ; he is in and out of gaol ( jail ) a lot .
He claims that this gives him time to concentrate on his main interest , writing .
By all accounts , he is man of great personal charm , who genuinely does try to satisfy people 's desire to buy his books .
However , as the French Government is only too willing to give him the ' time ' he wants to write these books - and of course when sequestered he cannot handle money - invariably some buyers are going to be disappointed .
" Most likely the monies sent to him have been deposited in his bank account .
When a judgment is made against him for a sum he cannot pay , his funds are confiscated in part payment , and then he pays society , if not his creditors , for the rest by doing some more creative writing .
" The above is a composite of post I have read in different fora , and on several websites , and is thus hearsay .
It 's not difficult to check up on what I 've summarised by doing a websearch under ' Patrice Chairoff ' or ' Dominique Calzi ' - a rudimentary working knowledge of French , however , is helpful .
Some of these suggest that , in his youth , he had a somewhat darker side to his character . "
YAMASSEE NATIVE AMERICANS ( USA )
Not to be confused with the Yamasee tribe that assimilated into the Seminole tribe .
This group claims to be exempt from Federal taxes , but is not a Federally recognized tribe ( Nearly all the professed members are African - American ) .
The group was originally known as " The Nuwaubian Nation of Moors " but changed its name after its leader , Dwight York ( alias " Malachi Z. York " , alias " Imperial Grand Potentate Noble : Rev. Dr. Malachi Z. York 33°/720° " , alias " Chief Black Thunderbird Eagle " , alias " Issa Al Haadi Al Mahdi " ) was convicted in 2004 for multiple racketeering , child molestation , transportation of minors for unlawful sex and tax evasion charges and sentenced to 135 years in prison at the Administrative Maximum facility in Florence , Colorado ( also known as " ADMAX " or " SuperMax " ) .
A polar bear that swam more than 200 miles in near - freezing waters to reach Iceland was shot on arrival in case it posed a threat to humans .
The bear , thought to be the first to reach the country in at least 15 years , was killed after local police claimed it was a danger to humans , triggering an outcry from animal lovers .
Police claimed it was not possible to sedate the bear .
The operation to kill the animal was captured on film .
The adult male , weighing 250kg , was presumed to have swum some 200 miles from Greenland , or from a distant chunk of Arctic ice , to Skagafjordur in northern Iceland .
" There was fog up in the hills and we took the decision to kill the bear before it could disappear into the fog , " said the police spokesman Petur Bjornsson .
Iceland 's environment minister , Thorunn Sveinbjarnardottir , gave the green light for police to shoot the bear because the correct tranquiliser would have taken 24 hours to be flown in , the Icelandic news channel Visir . is reported .
Sveinbjarnardottir's account was disputed by the chief vet in the town of Blönduó , Egill Steingrímsson , who said he had the drugs necessary to immobilise the bear in the boot of his car .
" If the narcotics gun would have been sent by plane , it would have arrived within an hour , " he said .
" They could keep tabs on the bear for that long . "
Steingrímsson also criticised police for not closing a mountain road where people congregated after hearing news of the bear .
" There were around 50 to 60 people there watching .
The police did not have many options when the bear ran down the hill , approaching the crowd , " Steingrimsson said .
" I 'm very unsatisfied that the police did not try to catch it alive and did not close the road . "
The oldest record of polar bears being sighted in Iceland is from 890 , 16 years after the first settlers arrived .
The last visit was in 1993 , when sailors saw a bear swimming off the coast of Strandir .
It was also killed .
Polar bears were frequently tamed during the middle ages , but since then no bear has been captured alive in Iceland .
Receding North
Pole ice is diminishing their hunting and mating grounds and jeopardising their survival .
A spokesman for PolarWorld , a German group dedicated to the preservation of the polar regions and the creatures which inhabit it , called the bear 's death " an avoidable tragedy ... another great day for mankind " .
Superman used to be just strong and sort of invulnerable , but now his powers are officially out of control .
According to Superman II , he can erase your mind just by kissing you , not to mention his super - breath , super - hearing and super - ventriloquism .
But Superman 's out - of - control power really started with his super - peepers , which have a whole arsenal of eye - related powers .
Check out our list of Superman 's overcharged eyeball abilities .

It 's no secret that Superman was so overpowered in the comic books that he used to move planets around , was extremely super - smart , traveled through time ( without flying around the Earth backwards ) on a regular basis , and had powers ranging from super - smell to super - mimicry .
He outmatched nearly everyone in the universe , except God , so they had to retcon his ass a few times .

Chief among Superman 's powers was his vision , which started out of just the ability to see things fairly sharply , but over the years he must have had laser - eye surgery , because things got a whole lot better for him :
Probably the most - wanted usage of Supey 's eyes was his ' x - ray ' vision .
What teenage boy ( and possibly some girls ) would n't have wanted to see through clothes ?
You could even order x-ray spex ( that sadly did not work ) from the back of comic books .
He could n't see through lead , and according to Kingdom Come he could n't give you cancer either .
No ' melanoma vision ' for our hero .
His ' heat vision ' ( which was originally a by - product of the x-ray vision ) is portrayed as either lasers shooting from his eyes , fiery optic blasts , or the literal balls of fire which they seem fond of on Smallville .
The comics later explain that he 's able to shoot his stored - up solar energy out through his eyes .
His ' telescopic vision ' grew over the comics to eventually let him see not just distant planets , but what was happening on those planets .
We wonder if he could flip that vision around so things just appeared very , very tiny .
Superman used his ' microscopic vision ' on many occasions in the 1970s , analyzing fingerprints , checking out atomic structures , electrons , and protons .
In fact , he could have made a fortune alone just by checking houses for fleas .
Superman could also see into the electromagnetic spectrum , which allowed him to do dorky things like follow broadcast signals back to their origins .
You know , for when crooks go on TV to brag about their plans .
Supey also sported ' radar vision , ' which was apparently just low - powered infravision , allowing him to see in the dark .
He could also combine these vision powers , like using x-ray vision and telescopic vision at the same time , so he could see those distant planets without an asteroid blocking his view .
Ultra Boy from The Legion of Super - Heroes had abilities similar to Superman's , although his ' penetra - vision ' could see through everything , including lead , and his ' flash - vision ' burns twice as hot as Superman 's heat vision .
Oh , and it 's blue .
Speaking of blue vision , Superman developed a new ' electrical vision ' power in Grant Morrison 's All - Star Superman as an homage to the electric blue Superman from the 90s .
Why you 'd want to send a shout - out to that particular version of Superman , we 'll never know .
When Superman " died " and his " Superboy " clone appeared , he did n't have any vision powers .
However , he later was given a pair of goggles that simulated most of Superman 's vision abilities .
Why does n't Superman just give a pair of those to every cop on the planet ?
Paglia : A woman president in the White House will be nothing like Hillary Clinton
Telegraph UK ^ | 25 May 2005 | Camille Paglia
... in matter of hours because they made really good points .
This excerpt from another site is the last real bit I could find of the that article :
Posted on Saturday , May 24 , 2008 6:09:41 PM by shrinkermd
Right now , Hillary is in Godzilla mode , refusing to accept Barack Obama 's looming nomination and threatening to tie the Democratic party in legal knots until the August convention and beyond .
Those who think she will withdraw gracefully in a few weeks are living in cloud cuckoo land .
The Clintons are ruthless scrappers who will lock their bulldog teeth in any bloody towel .
In her raw ambition and stubborn , grinding energy , Hillary will certainly cast a long shadow on young women aspiring to high office .
She is both inspiring role model and cringe - making bad example - a feminist who never found a way to succeed without her husband 's connections , advice , and intervention .
Bill Clinton may have masterminded Hillary 's runs for the Senate and for the Democratic nomination , but he has been a gross liability in recent months , as he has co-opted the hustings to maunder on about himself or to inject divisive racial overtones into the debate .
The next major female presidential candidate will be well advised to stuff any errant husband into a rucksack and chuck him down a laundry chute .
If they are to be truly equal , women must fight their own fights and not rely on a borrowed spotlight .

Breaking news on Countdown today , The New York Times is reporting that top advisers from Senator John McCain 's 2000 presidential campaign allege that they were convinced he was having a romantic relationship with Vicki Iseman , a telecom lobbyist , and that they had to " intervene to protect McCain from himself . "
This story , which was actually covered by Matt Drudge on December 20 , 2007 , while denied by both McCain and Iseman , it 's the last thing the unpopular candidate , who is trying to court the conservative base of his party , wants to hear .
This alleged scandal raises major doubts about McCain 's ethics and also leaves him open to attacks from both Democratic and Republican candidates .
Could this be the reason Mike Huckabee is still hanging around and Mitt Romney merely suspended his campaign instead of ending it altogether ?
Jane Hamsher says :
No jokes about " lobbyists " and " pork . "
John Amato : So much for the Straight Talk Express .
Oh , and is n't there a little problem about McCain 's " ethics " now ?
You know , giving favors to lobbyists and all .... Chuch Todd on MSNBC said that it seems like the NY Times did n't print all they had .
Bob Bennett is calling McCain , the last honest man on H&C .
There is a rumor that The New Republic was working on the story and that prompted them to run it now ... This should get really interesting ...
Here ’s what I hope you ’ll agree is a nice example of bytecode analysis and of creating custom control structures in Smalltalk .
One might think that a dynamically - typed language like Smalltalk is difficult to analyze .
But in fact there are many ways of analyzing it , and this post concerns analyzing bytecode .
Further , languages that support closures ( Smalltalk calls them blocks , and you might know them as anonymous functions ) allow one easily to construct custom control structures , and this post works up to a nice example .
First some context , which is code within the Just - in - Time compiler for Cog , the Smalltalk virtual machine for Squeak , Scratch et al that this blog discusses .
In the bowels of Cog ’s Just - in - Time compiler is code that merges control flow when a jump bytecode jumps to another bytecode .
The execution state for the control flow falling though to the target bytecode must be merged with the execution state of the bytecode jumping to that bytecode ( or vice verse ) .
Also , a jump instruction generated as part of a jump from some previous bytecode to some target bytecode must be " fixed up " to jump to the first instruction generated for the target bytecode when the JIT gets around to generating the instructions for the target bytecode .
That ’s not the topic of this post ;-) .
What is the topic is simplifying the code that does this , because when I wrote it in the first place I made a mistake , writing the code in an ugly manner .
Now I want to write the code in a cleaner manner and I want to check that the clean up is always appropriate .
The two methods that are at the heart of the " merge " and the " jump to " operations are ensureFixupAt : and ensureNonMergeFixUpAt :.
Typical usage looks like this :
( self fixupAt : nextPC - initialPC ) notAFixup if True : " The next instruction is dead .
we can skip it . " [ deadCode := true .
self ensureFixupAt : targetBytecodePC - initialPC . self ensureFixupAt : postBranchPC - initialPC ] if False : [ self deny : deadCode ] . " push dummy value below " self assert : ( unforwardArg or : [ unforwardRcvr ] ) .
orNot == branchDescriptor isBranchTrue " orNot is true for ~ ~ " ifFalse : " branchDescriptor is branch False " [ fixup := ( self ensureNonMergeFixupAt : postBranchPC - initialPC ) asUnsignedInteger . self JumpZero : ( self ensureNonMergeFixupAt : targetBytecodePC - initialPC ) asUnsignedInteger ] ifTrue : [ fixup := ( self ensureNonMergeFixupAt : targetBytecodePC - initialPC ) asUnsignedInteger . self JumpZero : ( self ensureNonMergeFixupAt : postBranchPC - initialPC ) asUnsignedInteger ] .
The bug you can see is that all calls to the routines first subtract initialPC from the bytecode PC to get to the index of the fixup for that pc .
That ’s ugly .
I ’d like to move the " - initialPC " sends into ensureFixupAt : and ensureNonMergeFixupAt :.
But I ’d like to know if all calls on the two methods involve " - initialPC " before I make this change .
One simple way to do this is to scan the bytecode of the relevant methods .
For this I can use Smalltalk ’s InstructionStream , which is used for all sorts of things including the debugger .
[ An aside to non-Smalltalkers ; one of the powerful things about Smalltalk is that the system is not merely a compiler for Smalltalk source ; it ’s a live object space , and the code exists as Compiled Method objects in the system that one can look at directly ] .
What I want to do is look for all sends of either ensureFixupAt : or ensureNonMergeFixupAt : and verify that they ’re always preceded by a bytecode that pushes the initialPC instance variable of the Just - in - Time compiler and a send of #-.
InstructionStream provides a custom control structure " scanFor : " that takes a one - argument block and evaluates it with the numeric value of each bytecode in a method until the block answers true .
scanFor : answers false if the block never evaluates to true .
The bytecodes look like this :
279 < 70 > self 280 < 8C 03 05 > pushTemp : 3 inVectorAt : 5 283 < 80 1C > pushRcvr : 28 285 < B1 > send : - 286 < EE > send : ensureFixupAt : 287 < 87 > pop 288 < 70 > self 289 < 8C 05 05 > pushTemp : 5 inVectorAt : 5 292 < 80 1C > pushRcvr : 28 294 < B1 > send : - 295 < EE > send : ensureFixupAt : 296 < 94 > jumpTo : 302 297 < 70 > self 298 < 84 40 B7 > pushRcvr : 183 301 < EC > send : deny : 302 < 87 > pop 303 < 70 > self 304 < 12 > pushTemp : 2 305 < 99 > jumpFalse : 308 306 < 71 > pushConstant : true 307 < 90 > jumpTo : 309 308 < 11 > pushTemp : 1 309 < 83 31 > send : assert : 311 < 87 > pop 312 < 10 > pushTemp : 0 313 < 8C 01 05 > pushTemp : 1 inVectorAt : 5 316 < D8 > send : is BranchTrue 317 < C6 > send : == 318 < AC 1C > jumpFalse : 348 320 < 70 > self 321 < 8C 03 05 > pushTemp : 3 inVectorAt : 5 324 < 80 1C > pushRcvr : 28 326 < B1 > send : - 327 < 83 33 > send : ensureNonMergeFixupAt :
Now this is more than a little inconvenient to parse .
In particular , the details of the bytecode for each send vary .
Smalltalk has compact bytecodes for common selectors such as #- , so there ’s a special bytecode for it ( 16rB1 at 294 ) and for #== ( 16rC6 at 317 ) .
Some times the literal offset for the ensureFixupAt : selector will mean a one byte send bytecode can be used ( such as 16rEE at 286 ) and sometimes it ’ll have to be a two byte bytecode ( such as 16r83 16r33 at 327 ) .
Any attempt to look at the code at this level will cause confusion and delay .
Luckily InstructionStream has facilities to extract the bytecode semantics , lifting the level of abstraction well above the numeric values .
peekInstruction answers a Message instance that is the message that InstructionStream would send to a client when decoding a bytecode .
So in the above at 280 peekInstruction will return a Message selector : #pushTemp:inVectorAt : arguments : # ( 3 5 ) .
selectorToSendOrSelf answers either the selector of a message send bytecode or the InstructionScanner itself , so at 286 selectorToSendOrSelf will answer #ensureFixupAt : , but at 287 it will answer the InstructionStream .
With these facilities we can write something almost comprehensible :
self systemNavigation browseAllSelect : [ : m | | is pi ppi | is := InstructionStream on : m . ppi := pi := is peekInstruction . is scanFor : [ : b | | ok | ok := ( # ( ensureFixupAt : ensureNonMergeFixupAt : ) includes : is selectorToSendOrSelf ) and : [ ppi selector == # pushReceiverVariable : and : [ ppi argument = 28 and : [ pi selector == # send: super:numArgs : and : [ pi argument = #- ] ] ] ] . ppi := pi . pi := is peekInstruction . ok ] ] localTo : Cogit
The heart of this is
ok := ( # ( ensureFixupAt : ensureNonMergeFixupAt : ) includes : is selectorToSendOrSelf ) and : [ ppi selector == # pushReceiverVariable : and : [ ppi argument = 28 and : [ pi selector == # send: super:numArgs : and : [ pi argument = #- ] ] ] ] .
which sets ok to true if the current instruction is a send of ensureFixupAt : or ensureNonMergeFixupAt : and the previous previous instruction ( ppi ) is a push of initialPC , and if the previous instruction ( pi ) is a send of #-.
So the block must manage updating ppi and pi .
Hence haivng to save the value of the test in the variable " ok " , and the statements
ppi := pi . pi := is peekInstruction .
to update them before answering " ok " as the value of the block , and the statement to initialize them to message objects before scanFor : is invoked .
Would n’t it be nice if we could add a method that abstracted away from the need to wrangle these variables ?
Indeed , and it ’s quite easy .
Let ’s add a method scanForInstructionSequence : to InstructionStream to do precisely this :
InstructionStream methods for scanning scanForInstructionSequence : naryBlock " naryBlock is a block taking one or more arguments .
Evaluate it for each sequence of instructions of length n in the receiver until nary Block evaluates to true .
Answer if nary Block evaluated to true . " | instructions | instructions := OrderedCollection withAll : ( ( 1 to : nary Block numArgs ) collect : [ : ign | self atEnd ifTrue : [ ^ false ] . self nextInstruction ] ) . [ ( nary Block valueWithArguments : instructions asArray ) ifTrue : [ ^ true ] . self atEnd ] while False : [ instructions removeFirst ; addLast : self nextInstruction ] . ^ false
Let ’s break this down .
naryBlock numArgs answers the number of arguments the block takes .
This way we do n’t need a method for one - instruction sequences , another for two - instruction sequences , etc ; we ’ll just have one method for any length of sequence ( up to the maximum argument count for a block , which in Squeak and Pharo is currently 15 ) .
( 1 to : nary Block numArgs ) constructs an Interval from 1 to that value , and collect : applies its argument to each element of the Interval ( collect : is Smalltalk ’s map ) .
self atEnd ifTrue : [ ^ false ] .
checks that there is an instruction avalable to parse , and aborts if not , so if a method does n’t have enough bytecodes to supply naryBlock , scanForInstructionSequence : answers false instead of raising an error as it tries to access bytecodes that do n’t exist .
OrderedCollection is Smalltalk ’s double - ended queue , so we can maintain the sequence of instuctions by adding a new one to the end and removing an old one from the front .
nextInstruction is the method that collects the message for a given bytecode and advances the InstructionStream ’s pc to the next bytecode .
So the first statement collects the first nary Block numArgs bytecode messages , answering false if there are n’t enough .
The next statement is a while loop that supplies the bytecode messages to naryBlock , testing the result and answering true if nary Block answers true .
valueWithArguments : is the block evaluation method that evaluates a block with a collection iof arguments , as opposed to value , value : , value : value : et al that take individual arguments .
But valueWithArguments : takes an Array , not an OrderedCollection , so the OrderedCollection is copied to an Array before sending valueWithArguments : .
As long as there are still isntructions to be processed ( self atEnd is false ) , the body of the while loop removes the first bytecode message before adding a new one at the end .
Finaly , if nary Block never evaluates to true , scanForInstructionSequence : answers false .
So we ’ve abstracted away from wrangling those instructions and created a custom control structure that evaluates a block with any length of instruction sequence from 1 to 15 , answering whether that block evaluated to true .
Neat .
So let ’s apply this new method to our previous example .
And let ’s add another search that answers the converse , finding all sends of ensureFixupAt : or ensureNonMergeFixupAt : that are not preceded by a push of initalPC followed by a send of #-.
self systemNavigation browseAllSelect : [ : m | ( InstructionStream on : m ) scanForInstructionSequence : [ : a : b : c | a selector == # pushReceiverVariable : and : [ a argument = 28 and : [ b selector == #send : super : numArgs : and : [ b argument = #- and : [ c selector == # send:super:numArgs : and : [ # ( ensureFixupAt : ensureNonMergeFixupAt : ) includes : c argument ] ] ] ] ] ] ] localTo : Cogit ; browseAllSelect : [ : m | ( InstructionStream on : m ) scanForInstructionSequence : [ : a : b : c | c selector == # send:super:numArgs : and : [ ( # ( ensureFixupAt : ensureNonMergeFixupAt : ) includes : c argument ) and : [ ( a selector == # pushReceiverVariable : and : [ a argument = 28 and : [ b selector == # send: super:numArgs : and : [ b argument = #- ] ] ] ) not ] ] ] ] localTo : Cogit
Nice .
And using this I find that the only such sends in the Just - in - Time compiler that do n’t involve a " - initalPC " are overrides of ensureFixupAt : or ensureNonMergeFixupAt : in subclasses :
RegisterAllocatingCogit methods for compile abstract instructions ensureNonMergeFixupAt : targetIndex " Make sure there 's a flagged fixup at the target Index ( pc relative to first pc ) in fixups .
Initially a fixup 's target is just a flag .
Later on it is replaced with a proper instruction . " | fixup | fixup := super ensureNonMergeFixupAt : targetIndex .
fixup mergeSimStack ifNil : [ self setMergeSimStackOf : fixup ] . ^ fixup
So indeed , it is safe to make the change .

Web fonts are gaining in popularity now , but they can still be a bit of a challenge to use .
Copyright issues often require the use of a third - party font service , which can be risky and expensive .
The good news is that all major operating systems come with a variety of fonts that you can use to create your font stacks .
This article lists fonts installed with major operating systems and software , shows how those fonts look on that platform , and attempts to suggest fonts with similar appearance and metrics .
This is an updated version of the article originally published in November , 2007 .
Differences from the previous version
This version makes several changes and updates to the original version , published in November , 2007 :
Updated font lists to include different versions of the major operating systems in separate columns .
Added new OS versions released since 2007 ( Windows 7 , OSX 10.5 - 10.7 , Ubuntu releases ) .
Added mscorefonts for Linux in a separate column ( this package is not installed by default , but is quite common ) .
Added iPhone and iPad fonts .
Added fonts installed with Adobe Creative Suite 5 ( and various other Adobe products ) .
Removed section on Foreign Language fonts ( see explanation below ) .
Updated similar font matchings .
About these tables
Fonts listed in the same row are near equivalents of each other , with the exception of the last row in each table which is used for other / non matching fonts .

Foreign Language Fonts
I have removed the lists of foreign language fonts ( non-latin ) from this version of the article .
The reason for this is because there are a lot of foreign language fonts included with each operating system , and it's a lot of work to figure out which language they are for and when they are installed .
There also seems to be more variations between versions of each OS .
Many of these fonts do include Latin character sets and could be used to render text in English and other Latin - based languages and appear to be standard sans - serif typefaces when used to render Latin characters .
However , since they are intended to be used for non-Latin languages , I am classifying them as " foreign language " fonts .
If you have a font on your operating system that is not included in this article , it 's probably a foreign language font .
Or I made a mistake , and you can let me know .

Obama , Clinton Look to Set Aside Differences , Campaign Together Democratic rivals will meet again for first joint fundraiser , campaign events .
June 23 , 2008  --
Political campaigns are often accused of being symbol - minded , but that wo n't stop Sen.
Barack Obama from holding his first joint campaign stop with ex-rival Sen. Hillary Clinton in a town called Unity .
The two politicians , who thumped each other throughout a bitter marathon of primary battles , will make their debut in Unity , N.H. , Friday as the political odd couple on the campaign trail .
The location for their stumping ground was selected for its obvious name appeal , but also because New Hampshire will be a key battleground in the fall election .
In addition , Obama and Clinton each won 107 votes in Unity during the state 's January primary .
Clinton and Obama will be together again on Thursday when Obama appeals for help from Clinton 's top fundraisers at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington .
That meeting is designed to help raise money for Obama , but to also find a way to help Clinton pay down her $ 10 million campaign debt .
At both events , her words and body language will be parsed for any lack of enthusiam for Obama .
Like old times , Clinton will take a bite out of Obama 's spotlight again this week , first by simply returning to work at the Senate and later with her appearance on the campaign trail .
Her reemergence comes as the two sides are still dealing with some raw emotions left over from the hard fought primary that dashed Clinton 's White House hopes .
Hard Feelings Divide Clinton , Obama Camps
People close to Clinton are frustrated that the Obama campaign has yet to propose a way to help her retire her campaing debt , while some close to Obama think the Clintons are being sore losers who wo n't go out of their way to praise Obama .
A case in point was Bill Clinton 's appearance Sunday at the U.S. Conference of Mayors .
During his address , the former president mentioned Obama only once , and that was to praise Obama for supporting one of programs begun during Clinton 's administration .
" I was delighted to read that Senator Obama said he would reinstitute the COPS program , " Clinton told the conference .
And when Hillary Clinton made her first public appearance this weekend since her concession speech , she never even mentioned Obama 's name .
The closest the New York senator came to citing Obama during her speech at a Bronx high school 's graduation was to say , " No one five years ago , or four years ago , could have conceived that an African - American and a woman would be competng for the president of the United States . "
Clinton to Raise Money for Obama's Bid
Some of those tensions could be smoothed over on Thursday , when Obama meets with Clinton 's top fundraisers in Washington .
" This meeting plays a very important role in healling the tensions , " veteran Democrat strategist Tad Devine , who worked on Sen .
John Kerry 's presidential race , told " Good Morning America " on Monday .
Elizabeth Edwards Supports Obama
Obama has won the backing of another powerful woman who had previously withheld her support — Elizabeth Edwards .
The wife of one - time presidential contender John Edwards had remained on the sidelines even when her husband threw his support to Obama at a time when Clinton was making a last - ditch effort to keep her candidacy alive .
Mrs. Edwards , who is coping with breast cancer that has mestastized in her bones , had preferred Clinton 's health plan to Obama 's health plan .
Neverthelesss , she told " GMA , " " I am backing Senator Obama now . "
She said she was confident that Clinton and Obama would be able to unite the party and cited the " enormous amount of graciousness " in Clinton 's concession speech as proof .
" I think if we keep that feeling going , I think we have a great capacity .
And I think if it 's going to happen , I think it will happen before the convention , " she said .
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Obama has tried to make a public show of his respect for Clinton .
In Detroit recently , some of his supporters in the crowd booed when Clinton 's name was mentioned .
Obama interrupted his speech to scold the heckler , saying , " You up there !
Senator Clinton is one of the finest public servants we have in American life today . "
But late last week , during a session with the Congressional Black Caucus , it was apparent how sensitive Clinton 's backers still are to any apparent slight .
When a member of the caucus asked Obama to reach out Clinton 's female supporters , Obama said he would try to soothe any raw emotions , but he also suggested that the conservative positions on women 's issues held by Sen .
John McCain , the presumptive GOP nominee , might help Clinton supporters " get over it . "
Those three little words — " get over it " — angered some of Clinton 's backers , showing just how delicate a Democratic truce may be .
Rep. Diane Watson , D - Calif. , a longtime Clinton supporter , found Obama 's words were dismissive , off - putting .
" Do n't use that terminology , " Watson told Obama .
But another former Clinton backer , Rep Yvette Clarke , D - N.Y. , did not react the same way .
" I , personally , as a Hillary supporter , did not take that as something distasteful , " Clarke said .
" Nothing like that . "
But , Clarke said , Watson " latched on to those three words . "
ABC 's Jennifer Duck contributed to this report .
June 24 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has offered new steps to crack down on speculation in oil markets , saying his plan would help rein in runaway fuel costs .
A jump in gasoline prices above $ 4 a gallon has spurred consumer anger and is a major theme in the race between Obama and his Republican rival in the November election , John McCain .
McCain , an Arizona senator , has also expressed concern about oil - market speculation and has called for investigating cases of abuses as well as overhauling regulations for the trading of futures contracts in energy stocks , bonds and other instruments .
Here are some details of Obama 's plan :
* The Illinois senator 's campaign said he would close the so - called Enron loophole that exempts some energy speculators from U.S. regulations that apply to commodities traded over exchanges .
It takes its name from the energy giant that benefited from the law and later collapsed because of massive accounting fraud .
* His plan would require U.S. energy futures to trade on regulated exchanges .
* Obama is calling for more data on index funds and other similar types of investments to boost transparency of institutional players in commodities markets .
* He backs legislation that would direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate proposals such as increasing margin requirements in the market .
* He would aim to stop energy traders from evading U.S. regulations by conducting transactions through foreign subsidiaries of U.S. exchanges .
* He would call on the Federal Trade Commission to expedite investigations of suspected price manipulation and direct the Justice Department to look at whether illegal activity has contributed to the run-up in oil prices .

The following post is my cut and paste review of a new paper by Charles Hall , Robert Powers , and William Schoenberg titled " Peak Oil , Investments , and the Economy in an Uncertain Future " .
This paper , along with 16 others ( including 2 by theoildrum.com contributors ) , will be part of an upcoming book edited by Professor David Pimentel , " Renewable Energy Systems : Environmental and Energetic Issues " .
( I 'll provide links when published ) .
The paper by Professor Hall et al. is a thoughtful preliminary treatise on the impact that projected lower net energy for petroleum might have on the economy and investments .
The following graphics and grey box quotes are taken , in order , from the paper " Peak Oil , Investments , and the Economy , in an Uncertain Future " .
The paper is much longer than what is pasted below , but this post should give a general sense of the authors work .
The comments between the grey boxes , as well as the conclusion , are my own :
While we are used to thinking about the economy in monetary terms , those of us trained in the natural sciences consider it equally valid to think about the economy and economics from the perspective of the energy required to make it run .
When one spends a dollar , we do not think just about the dollar bill leaving our wallet and passing to some one else ’s .
Rather , we think that to enable that transaction , that is to generate the good or service being purchased , an average of about 8,000 kilojoules of energy ( equal to roughly the amount of oil that would fill a coffee cup ) must be extracted from the Earth and turned into roughly a half kilogram of carbon dioxide .
Take the money out of the economy and it could continue to function through barter , albeit in an extremely awkward , limited and inefficient way .
Take the energy out and the economy would immediately contract immensely or stop .
Professor Hall also has recently written a textbook on Biophysical Economics , and the above example illustrates part of the difference between biophysical economics and neo-classical economics .
There is no ' substitute ' for energy .
Conventional economists see economic activity as a function of infinite " money creation " , rather than a function of finite stocks and flows .
Though we are not taught this way , the economy is 100 % dependent on available energy .
( Biophysical economics is a step in the right direction , but does not address the demand - side problems with neo-classical economics - e.g. we are not rational utility maximizers , ' utility ' itself being a scientifically non-measurable tautology , wants are not needs , neuromarketing CAN influence our decisions , etc . )
Without a growing energy surplus , the only way we can have economic growth is by a ) borrowing from environment , b) an increasing global GINI coefficient of wealth inequality , c ) concomittant increases in efficiency and / or conservation .
Otherwise ' increases ' in GDP are just accounting tricks .
When oil peaks ( and probably before , due to net energy ) , global growth will be over .
( I acknowledge several non-zero , but extremely low odds exceptions to this statement )
Cuba found this out in 1991 when the Soviet Union , facing its own oil production and political problems at that time , cut off Cuba ’s subsidized oil supply .
Both Cuba ’s energy use and its GDP declined immediately by about one third , all groceries disappeared from market shelves within a week and the average Cuban lost 20 pounds .
I could use 2 - 2.5 of these energy crises ... ;)
( There is also a movie " The Power of Community " about the successful response of Cuba to their oil crisis )
While the United States has become more efficient in using energy in recent decades , most of this is due to using higher quality fuels , exporting heavy industry and switching what we call economic activity , and many other countries , including efficiency leader Japan , are becoming substantially less efficient .
The very large use of fossil fuels in the United States means that each of us has the equivalent of 60 to 80 hard working laborers to “ hew our wood and haul our water ” as well as to grow , transport and cook our food , make , transport and import our consumer goods , provide sophisticated medical and health services , visit our relatives and take vacations in far away or even relatively near by places .
Simply to grow our food requires the energy of about a gallon of oil per person per day , and if a North American takes a hot shower in the morning he or she will have already used far more energy than probably two thirds of the Earth ’s human population use in an entire day .
A quibble ~ this differs from the numbers I 've been using .
I 've seen it several places that 1 barrel of oil has the amount of calories that equates to roughly 25,000 hours of human labor .
Of course , me sitting at a computer will use less calories than my friend the jackhammer operator , but consider that as average .
Working 50 weeks per year at 40 hours per week , that equates to 12.5 years of labor per barrel - each American uses 25 barrels + of oil per year , which is 312 ' hard working laborers ' , not 60 .
If we include gas and coal , the number is over 700 of these ' energy slaves ' .
( Professor Hall works much harder than I do , so if he meant 60 - 80 " Charlie Halls " , I 'll agree ... ;)
I guess I need to track down a source for my 25,000 figure .
....
So our physical capacity to produce oil depends upon our ability to keep finding large oil fields in regions that we can reasonably access , our willingness to invest in exploration and development , and our willingness to not produce too quickly .
The usual economic argument is that if supply is reduced relative to demand then the price will increase which will then signal oil companies to drill more , leading to the discovery of more oil and then additional supply .
Although that sounds logical , the results from the oil industry might not be in accordance to that logic as the empirical record shows that the rate at which oil and gas is found has little to do with the rate of drilling .
Annual rates of total drilling for and production of oil and gas in the US , 1949 - 2005 ( R2 of the two = 0.005 ; source : U.S. EIA and N. D. Gagnon ) .
Since drilling and other exploration activities are energy intensive , other things being equal EROI is lower when drilling rates are high .
The United States clearly has experienced “ peak oil ” .
In a way this is quite remarkable , because as the price of oil increased by a factor of ten , from 3.50 to 35 dollars a barrel during the 1970s , a huge amount of capital was invested in US oil discovery and production efforts so that the drilling rate increase from 95 million feet per year in 1970 to 250 million feet in 1985 .
Nevertheless the production of crude oil decreased during the same period from the peak of 3.52 billion barrels a year in 1970 to 3.27 in 1985 and has continued to decline to 1.89 in 2005 even with the addition of Alaskan production .
This surprised me .
I would have thought there was some stronger correlation than ZERO .
Obviously a much better predictor of this years production , is last years production plus ( 2 years ago prod . minus last years production ) .
Only around the peak would that have not had high predictive value .
But I leave such details to the experts .
The graphic is also potentially misleading in that it does not show discoveries of oil but production - some of those wells might have been drilled for different reasons than production ( exploration , injection , etc . )
In 2006 , when oil averaged over $ 60 , there was a 20 year record of drilling feet .
According to API estimates , 290 million feet were drilled in 2006 with over 74 million in the fourth quarter alone .
But annual production declined to 1.86 billion barrels .
Energy return on investment ( EROI or EROEI ) is simply the energy that one obtains from an activity compared to the energy it took to generate that energy .
The procedures are generally straightforward , although rather too dependent upon assumptions made as to the boundaries , and when the numerator and denominator are derived in the same units , as they should , it does not matter if the units are barrels ( of oil ) per barrel , Kcals per Kcal or MJoules per Mjoule as the results are in a unitless ratio .
The running average EROI for the finding and production of US domestic oil has dropped from greater than 100 kilojoule returned per kilojoule invested in the 1930s to about thirty to one in the 1970s to between 11 and 18 to one today .
This is a consequence of the decreasing energy returns as oil reservoirs are increasingly depleted and as there are increases in the energy costs as exploration and development are shifted increasingly deeper and offshore .
Even that ratio reflects mostly pumping out oil fields that are half a century or more old since we are finding few significant new fields .
( In other words we can say that new oil is becoming increasingly more costly , in terms of dollars and energy , to find and extract ) .
While we do not know whether that extrapolation is accurate , essentially all EROI studies of our principal fossil fuels do indicate that their EROI is declining over time , and that EROI declines especially rapidly with increased exploitation ( e.g. drilling ) rates .
This decline appears to be reflected in economic results .
In November of 2004 The New York Times reported that for the previous three years oil exploration companies worldwide had spent more money in exploration than they had recovered in the dollar value of reserves found .
Thus even though the EROI of global oil and gas is still about 20:1 as of 2007 , this ratio is for all exploration and production activities .
It is possible that the energy break even point has been approached or even reached for finding new oil .
Whether we have reached this point or not the concept of EROI declining toward 1:1 makes irrelevant the reports of several oil analysts who believe that we may have substantially more oil left in the world , because it does not make sense to extract oil , at least for a fuel , when it requires more energy for the extraction than is found in the oil extracted .
This is a critical ( and shocking ) observation .
So I can enjoy my weekend , I will assume the suggestion of energy break even for new oil is for the United States , and not the world .
But I 'm not sure hard data exists in either case , a fact Dr. Hall has pointed out and lamented .
It is quite possible that energy break even is already occurring globally , at least for replacement costs ( e.g. much of the 86 mbpd currently produced is using energy that was ' input ' long ago .
In this sense , global net energy decline is ' stealth ' in nature .
** Of course it could / will make sense to extract oil at energy break even or lower , if the energy we used to extract it was plentiful .
But oil and natural gas are the primary fuels used to extract and refine , crude oil , so approaching energy break even would be an extremely fast treadmill for the economic system , as we will see below .
It also suggests that the economy ' feels ' the high EROI stuff which was found long ago , but that the ' yet - to - be - discovered ' may not translate to ' yet - to - be- produced ' due to high costs .
How well we weather this coming storm will depend in large part on how we manage our investments now .
From the perspective of energy there are three general types of investments that we make in society .
The first is investments into getting energy itself , the second is investments for maintenance of , and replacing , existing infrastructure , and the third is discretionary expansion .
In other words before we can think about expanding the economy we must first make the investments into getting the energy necessary to operate the existing economy , and into maintaining the infrastructure that we have , at least unless we wish to accept the entropy - driven degradation of what we already have .
Investors must accept the fact that the required investments into the second and especially the first category are likely to increasingly limit what is available for the third .
In other words the dollar and energy investments needed to get the energy needed to allow the rest of the economy to operate and grow have been very small historically , but this is likely to change dramatically .
This is true whether we seek to continue our reliance on ever - scarcer petroleum or whether we attempt to develop some alternative .
Technological improvements , if indeed they are possible , are extremely unlikely to bring back the low investments in energy that we have grown accustomed to .
The main problem that we face is a consequence of the “ best first ” principle .
This is , quite simply , the characteristic of humans to use the highest quality resources first , be they timber , fish , soil , copper ore or , of relevance here , fossil fuels ....
It is critical for CEOs and government officials to understand that the best oil and gas are simply gone , and there is no easy replacement .
Perhaps that message is starting to be heard and understood by CEOs and government officials .
The issue is that when they see a problem , they like to hear a solution .
The solutions are difficult , complex and do not conform to the systems that put the CEOs and government officials in the positions they now hold .
We pay for imported oil in energy as well as dollars , for it takes energy to grow , manufacture or harvest what we sell abroad to gain the foreign exchange with which we buy fuel , ( or we must in the future if we pay with debt today ) .
In 1970 we gained roughly 30 megajoules for each megajoule used to make the crops , jet airplanes and so on that we exported .
But as the price of imported oil increased , the EROI of the imported oil declined .
By 1974 that ratio had dropped to nine to one , and by 1980 to three to one .
The subsequent decline in the price of oil , aided by the inflation of the export products traded , eventually returned the energy terms of trade to something like it was in 1970 , at least until the price of oil started to increase again after 2000 .
A rough estimate of the quantity and EROI of various major fuels in the U.S. , including possible alternatives , is given in Figure 5.5 .
An obvious aspect of that graph is that qualitatively and quantitatively alternatives to fossil fuel have a very long way to go to fill the shoes of fossil fuels .
This is especially true when one considers the additional qualities of oil and gas , including energy density , ease of transport and ease of use .
Figure 5.5 . “ Balloon graph ” representing quality ( y graph ) and quantity ( x graph ) of the United States economy for various fuels at various times .
Arrows connect fuels from various times ( i.e. domestic oil in 1930 , 1970 , 2005 ) , and the size of the “ balloon ” represents part of the uncertainty associated with EROI estimates .
( Source : US EIA , Cutler Cleveland and C. Hall ’s own EROI work in preparation ) Click to Enlarge .
By quality here , on the y - axis , they mean EROI , as opposed to ' energy quality ' .
So EROI x Scale = Total energy gain .
The " USA 2005 " balloon should be a different color - as its a ' consumption ' , not an energy source .
But note that it is 20 % greater than the total photosynthesis for the entire country !
And this graph suggests an important story .
Yes , I 've increasingly heard about 10:1 + EROIs on new generation biofuel technologies that are ' pending ' .
This may or may not be true .
But even if it is we have to multiply EROI X Scale .
With oil , we are getting the energy content of 86 million barrels a day times 20:1 , or whatever the current energy gain average is .
Biofuels , even the ones that might attain high EROIs , will be limited in scale .
The scale issue is less clear but still relevant for the other alt energy sources of wind , solar and nuclear .
The implications of all this is that if we are to supply into the future the amount of petroleum that the US consumed in the first half of this decade it will require enormous investments in either additional unconventional sources , in import facilities or as payments to foreign suppliers .
That will mean a diversion of investment capital and of money more generally from other uses into getting the same amount of energy just to run the existing economy .
In other words investments , from a national perspective , will be needed increasingly just to run what we have , not to generate real new growth .
If we do not make these investments our energy supplies will falter or we will be tremendously beholden to foreigners , and if we do , the returns may be small to the nation , although of course if the price of energy increases greatly the returns to the individual investor may be large .
Another implication is if this issue is as important as we believe it is then we must pay much more attention to the quality of the data we are getting about energy costs of all things we do , including getting energy .
Finally the failure of increased drilling to return more fuel calls into question the basic economic assumption that scarcity - generated higher prices will resolve that scarcity by encouraging more production .
Indeed scarcity encourages more exploration and development activity , but that activity does not necessarily generate more resources .
It will also encourage the development of alternative liquid fuels , but their EROIs are generally very low .
What would be the impacts of a large increase in the energy and dollar cost of getting our petroleum , or of any restriction in its availability ?
While it is extremely difficult to make any hard predictions , we do have the record of the impacts of the large oil price increases of the 1970s as a possible guide .
These “ oil shocks ” had very serious impacts on our economy which we have examined empirically in past publications ( e.g. Hall et al. 1986 ) .
Many economists then and now did not think that even large increases in the price of energy would affect the economy dramatically because energy costs were but three to six percent of GDP .
But by 1980 , following the two “ oil price shocks ” of the 1970s , energy costs had increased dramatically until they were 14 percent of GDP .
The Cheese Slicer Model
We have attempted to put together a conceptual and computer model to help us understand what might be the most basic implications of changing EROI on the economic activity of the United States .
The model was conceptualized when we examined how the U.S. economy responded to the “ oil shocks ” of the 1970s .
The underlying foundation is the reality that the economy as a whole requires energy ( and other natural resources derived from nature ) to run , and without these most basic components it will cease to function .
The other premise of this model is that the economy as a whole is faced with choices in how to allocate its output in order to maintain itself and to do other things .
Essentially the economy ( and the collective decision makers in that economy ) has opportunity costs associated with each decision it makes .
Figure 5.6 shows our basic conceptual model parameterized for 1970 , before the oil shocks of that decade .
The “ Cheese slicer ” diagrammatic model , which is a basic representation the fate of the output of the U.S. economy , 1970 .
The box in the middle represents the U.S. economy , the input arrow from the left represents the energy needed to run the economy , the large arrow on the left of the box represents the output of the model ( i.e. GDP ) which is then subdivided as represented by the output arrow going to the right .
In other words the economic output is “ sliced ” into different uses according to the requirements and desires of that economy / society .
( Data principally from the U.S. Department of Commerce .

The large square represents the structure of the economy as a whole , which we put inside a symbol of the Earth biosphere / geosphere to reflect the fact that the economy must operate within the biosphere .
In addition , of course , the economy must get energy and raw materials from outside the economy , at least as narrowly perceived , that is from nature ( i.e. the biosphere / geosphere ) .
The output of the economy , normally considered GDP , is represented by the large arrow coming out of the right side , where the depth of the arrow represents 100 percent of GDP .
For the sake of developing our concept we think of the economy , for the moment , as an enormous dairy industry and cheese as the product coming out of the right hand side , moving towards the right .
This output ( i.e. the entire arrow ) could be represented as either money or embodied energy .
We use the former in this analysis ( as almost all of the relevant data is recorded in monetary , not energy , units ) , but it is probably not terribly different from using energy outputs .
So , our most important question is “ how do we slice the cheese ” , that is how do we , and how will we divide up the output of the economy , or said differently , in what way can the output of the economy be divided up with the least objectionable opportunity cost .
Most economists might answer “ according to what the market decides , ” that is according to consumer tastes and buying habits .
But we want to think about it a little differently because we think things might be profoundly different in the future .

The results of our simulation suggest that discretionary income , including both discretionary investments and discretionary consumption , will move from the present 50 or so percent in 2005 to about 10 percent by 2050 , or whenever ( or if ) the composite EROI of all of our fuels reaches about 5:1 .
As ' new oil ' replaces ' found oil ' , the EROI will drop faster than the global decline rate .
In this sense , the authors time estimate ( 2050 ) for the contraction of discretionary spending might be ( extremely ) conservative as there is evidence already of a crowding out of non-energy sectors .
Further study combining net energy with global decline rates is urgently needed , especially as the worlds last giant oil fields deplete , we will be replacing them ( if we 're lucky ) , with newer , more expensive ( in energy and dollar terms ) production .
Who knows how high of energy gain Ghawar has provided the world - 200:1 ?
1000:1 ???
Impossible to tell because we do n't have the data .
Another insight is the difference between ' fixed ' vs. ' marginal ' EROI .
As oil wells and infrastructure were created in era of cheap fuel , they continue to produce high return oil .
What would be the EROI of this oil if it had to be rebuilt now ?
( Eg. how many stripper wells in GOM remain profitable but if damaged by hurricane are n't repaired because marginal cost is too high ? )
The above sensitivity analysis from 2007 to 2050 , were it to be done in ' dollars ' , would likely not show this decline in discretionary income for society .
Deep seated assumptions about technology , capital and efficiency improvements , combined with the unlimited support of central bank fiat currency , would underestimate the shrinkage in discretionary investment , especially if conflated perceptions between the ' actual production ' and ' productive capacity ' of oil persist .
Such an analysis would likely also fall victim to the phenomenon of ' receding horizons ' , as tar sands , deep water oil , etc. might look slightly profitable at $ 90 + oil but when oil is at $ 150 , they will STILL only be slightly profitable as the inputs will have also increased in price .
This ' running in place ' is the real world manifestation of a low energy gain technology , and why biophysical analysis is important .
Individual businesses would be affected by having their fuel costs increase and , for many , a reduction in demand for their products .
This simultaneous inflation and recession happened in the 1970s and is projected to happen into the future as EROI for primary fuels declines .
The “ stagflation ” that occurred in the 1970s was not supposed to happen according to an economic theory called the Phillips curve .
But an energy - based explanation is easy ( e.g. Hall 1992 ) .
As more money was diverted to getting the energy necessary to run the rest of the economy disposable income , and hence demand for many non-essential goods and services , declined , leading to economic stagnation .
Meanwhile the increased cost for energy led to inflation , as there was no additional production that occurred from this greater expenditure .
Although unemployment increased overall during the 1970s it was not as much as demand decreased , as labor at the margin became relatively useful compared to increasingly - expensive energy .
Individual sectors might be much more impacted as happened in 2005 , for example , with many Louisiana petrochemical companies that were forced to close or move overseas when the price of natural gas increased .
On the other hand alternate energy businesses , from forestry operations and woodcutting to solar devices , might do very well .
So what can the scientist say to the investor ?
When the price of oil increases it does not seem to be in the national or in corporate interest to invest in more energy - intensive consumption , as Ford Motor Company seems to be finding out with its large emphasis on large SUVs and pickup trucks .
We are likely to have over invested already in the number of remote second homes , cruise ships , and Caribbean semi-luxury hotels , so that it may not a particularly good idea to do more of that now .
This is due to the “ Cancun effect ” – that such hotels require the existence of large amounts of disposable income from the US middle class and cheap energy , even though that disposable income that may have to be shifted into the energy sector with less of an opportunity cost to the economy as a whole .
Investors who understand the changing rules of the investment game are likely to do much better in the long run .
So what can the scientist say to the investor ?
The options are not easy .
As noted above worldwide investments in seeking oil have had very low monetary returns in recent years .
Investments in many alternatives may not fare much better .
Ethanol from corn projects are financially profitable to the individual investor because they have been highly subsidized by the government , but they are probably a poor investment for the Nation .
It is not clear that this fuel makes much of an energy profit , with an EROI of 1.6 at best , and less than one for one at worst , depending upon the study used for analysis .
Biodiesel may have an EROI of about three to one .
Is that a good investment ?
Clearly not relative to remaining petroleum , but some day as petroleum EROI declines it may be .
However real fuels must have EROIs of 5 or 10 or more returned on one invested to not be subsidized by petroleum or coal in various ways , such as the construction of the vehicles and roads that use them .
Other biomass , such as wood , can have good EROIs when used as solid fuel but face real difficulties when converted to liquid fuels , and the technology is barely developed .
This is the issue of energy quality , which cannot be ignored due to how embedded liquid fuels are in our transport system , hence total economic system .
Even though electricity currently is a higher quality fuel than oil , that may change as attempts to turn all sort of disparate BTU sources into transportation fuel may occur ( Fischer - Tropsch Coal - to - liquids , biodiesel , ethanol , etc . )
So EROI and scale are important , but so is quality , which is determined by what is needed and desired by society .
The scale of the problem can be seen by the fact that we presently use more fossil energy in the US than is fixed by all green plant production , including all of our croplands and all of our forests .
Biomass fuels may make more sense in nations where biomass is very plentiful and , more importantly , where present use of petroleum is much less than in the US .
Alternatively one might argue that if we could bring the use of liquid fuels in the United States down to , say , 20 percent of the present than liquid fuels from biomass could fill in a substantial portion of that demand .
Nevertheless we should remember that historically we in the U.S. have used energy to produce food and fibre , not the converse , because we have valued food and fibre more highly .
Is this about to change ?
Apparently , yes .
Energy return on investment from coal is presently quite favourable compared to alternatives ( ranging from perhaps 50:1 to 100:1 ) , but the environmental costs are probably unacceptable as the case for global warming and other pollutants from coal burning becomes increasingly clear .
Injecting carbon dioxide into some underground reservoir seems unfeasible for all the coal plants we might build , but it is being pushed hard by many who promote coal .
Nuclear has a debatable moderate energy return on investment ( 5 - 15:1 , some unpublished studies say more ) , but newer analyses need to be made .
Nuclear has a relatively small impact on the atmosphere , but there are large problems with public acceptance and perhaps safety in our increasingly difficult political world .
Windmills have an EROI of 15 - 20 return on one invested , but this does not include the energy cost of back up or electricity “ storage ” for periods when the wind is not blowing .
They make sense if they can be associated with nearby hydroelectric dams that can store water when the wind is blowing and release water when it is not , but the intermittent release of water can cause environmental problems .
Photovoltaics are expensive in dollars and presumably energy relative to their return , but the technology is improving .
One should not be confused by all claims for efficiency improvements because many require very expensive “ rare - earth ” doping materials , and some may become prohibitively expensive if their use expands greatly .
According to one savvy contractor the efficiency in energy returned per square foot of collector has been increasing , but the energy returned per dollar invested has been constant as the price of the high end units has increased .
Additionally while photovoltaics have caught the public ’s eye the return on dollar investment is about double for hot water installations .
Windmills , photovoltaics and some other forms of solar do seem to be a good choice if we are to protect the environment , but the investment costs up front will be enormous compared to fossil fuels .
The authors allude to , but do not explicitly say , that Peak Oil may initiate a " Tragedy of the Investing Commons " .
Short - term ( 3 - 5 years ) high returns can be made by entrepreneurs and corporations by using both government subsidies ( in the case of ethanol ) and societal subsidies ( in the case of roads , hospitals , food , etc. ) that only exist due to cheap transport fuels .
Decisions that may look promising from a corporate boardroom perspective , would not look good from a global declining EROI perspective .
So , investments in ' moderate ' EROI technologies might pay off for individuals , while simultaneously the global energy gain cushion continues to drop .
( But I guess this has been happening for a long time wrt the environment )
CONCLUSION
It seems obvious to us that the U.S. economy is very vulnerable to a decreasing EROI for its principle fuels , whether that comes from an increase in expenditures overseas if and as the price of imported oil increases more rapidly than that of the things that we trade for it , or as domestic oil and gas reserves are exhausted and new reservoirs become increasingly difficult to find , or as we turn to lower EROI alternatives such as biodiesel and or photovoltaics .
We do not know exactly what all this means , but our straightforward model suggests that a principal effect will be a decline in disposable income and a greater requirement for getting energy , with all the economic impacts that entails .
Since more fuel will be required to run the same amount of economic activity the potential for environmental impacts increasing is very strong .
On the other hand protecting the environment , which we support strongly , may mean turning away from some higher EROI fuels to some lower ones .
We think all of these issues are very important yet are hardly discussed in our society or even in economic or scientific circles .
Concluding Thoughts
As many in the Peak Oil aware community know , Charlie Hall has been researching and writing about energy for almost 30 years , initially as a graduate student of the late systems ecologist Howard Odum .
I posted excerpts from this paper because I believe the implication of declining net energy is the single largest overlooked supply side phenomenon about oil and gas depletion , both on Wall St and on Main St .
As ' best first ' becomes ' best available now ' , more energy will be diverted to the energy sector , and as the authors have pointed out , this means less for productive society .
This does n't happen while everything stands still - the primary allocation mechanism for lower net energy is already underway - higher prices - squeezing less developed countries , less profitable businesses , less traveled air routes , etc .
A secondary mechanism of declining net energy is negative economic growth resulting in global recession / depression , reducing energy prices and pulling the marginal EROI processes offline , many of them forever .
However , there are many problems with EROI analysis , not the least of which is the difficulty of parsing non-energy limiting inputs , like water , soil , or knowledge , into energy terms .
Its just simpler to denominate everything in dollars , and of course that is what has happened gradually , but nearly completely , over the last 3 decades .
Net energy analysis also has the problem of correctly adjusting for energy quality , as all kilojoules are not created equal , nor do they stay equal in preferences / needs of a civilization .
( did the Yibali tribesman 5 centuries ago in Saudi Arabia care about light sweet Arabian crude ?
No - they cared about strong Arabian horses ) .
Net energy analysis is not a surgical tool , but more like a blunt instrument .
But what EROI lacks in precision , it makes up for in scope .
It at least attempts to ground analysis based on first principles - we need energy to procure more energy - to procure more dollars , we just print them ( using paper , ink and energy ) .
The battle between the financial economy and the biophysical economy is seeing its first serious skirmish , as oil flirts with $ 100 , pricing out someone , somewhere .
Somehow , more analysis like this one by Hall et al. need to be examined , understood and advanced .
Grounding supply side analysis in physical terms is not easy , but it will ultimately be more accurate and a better predictor of the future on a planet with finite stocks and flows .
I give great credit to the authors and their academic peers who continue to think about the world in this way .
Limited funding , limited data and limited government interest , are prohibiting scientists like Prof .
Hall from accomplishing more than just nibble around the edges of this vital topic .
Finally , though net energy analysis is an important tool , it is still a part of the larger science that is essentially just a ' documentation ' of natural resource depletion and the environmental entropy process .
Until we thoroughly address the demand side of our energy consumption , better and more correct energy analyses cannot be optimized .
The World from Berlin Lame Duck Bush with Lame Duck Putin on the Black Sea
US President Bush met with his Russian counterpart Putin at the Black Sea resort of Sochi over the weekend .
The two went out of their way to be nice to each other .
But as German commentators point out , plenty of problems remain .
Everybody seems to know we need government …
But pirates did n’t !
How did they manage without the state ?
In this issue ’s thought - provoking lead essay , Peter T. Leeson , the BB&T Professor for the Study of Capitalism at George Mason University , explores what pirate “ constitutions , ” credit institutions among 19th century African bandit traders , and the well - being of Somalians after the collapse of the Somalian state have to tell us about the possibility of practical anarchy .
Can organizations solve complex problems of coordination without government coercion ?
Can voluntary bands provide public goods ?
Are there conditions under which groups really are better off stateless ?
Leeson will be joined by three eminent commentators : Florida State economics professor Bruce Benson , author of the seminal The Enterprise of the Law : Justice without the State ; Dani Rodrik , professor of international political economy at Harvard ’s Kennedy School ; and Randall Holcombe , another distinguished Seminole economist and current president of the Public Choice Society .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Wal - Mart Stores Inc. plans to open up to 400 in - store health clinics over the next two to three years , building on a pilot program begun in 2005 , in an aim to implement customer solutions to America 's health - care crisis , the company 's chief executive said Tuesday .
The clinics , which will lease space in Wal - Mart WMT , - 0.08 % stores , will be managed by local or regional hospitals or other third - party organizations .
They will also post prices for services and procedures , helping to bring " much - needed price transparency " to the American health care system , according to the company .
" We know that customers like and want these clinics .
At existing clinics in our stores , about 90 % of patients report being satisfied or very satisfied .
They appreciate the fast , easy and convenient experience , " said Lee Scott , president and chief executive , in a speech Tuesday at the World Health Care Congress in Washington .
Currently , there are 76 clinics operating inside Wal - Marts in 12 states .
The company , which has faced criticism on its own employee health coverage , said up to 2,000 clinics could be in stores over the next five to seven years if current market forces continue .
" We think the clinics will be a great opportunity for our business .
But most importantly , they are going to provide something our customers and communities desperately need -- affordable access at the local level to quality health care , " Scott said .
" We believe we can deliver effective and efficient health care at the local level . "
Also at the congress , Scott said people do n't have the tools and the information they need to make the best possible health - care decisions , preventing them from being good health - care consumers .
He added that the answer to improving health care is to lower costs for the whole system , and that information technology " is perhaps the single largest opportunity " to drive out costs .
" The private sector can make a difference , " he said .
" I believe American businesses can lead and we should . "
Wal - Mart 's move with the clinics comes at a time when consumers are being asked to take more responsibility for their care and its costs , and is part of a broader trend Forrester Research calls the " retail - ization " of health care .
Another harbinger came last summer when CVS acquired MinuteClinic and went on to purchase pharmacy - benefits manager Caremark .
MinuteClinic began in the early 2000s in the Minneapolis - St. Paul metro area .
Another in - store health clinic called RediClinic , of which Steve Case 's Revolution Health Group is the principal investor , is rapidly expanding in partner stores such as Wal - Mart and Walgreens .
RediClinic is in about 50 locations today .
Revolution Health hopes to double that quantity by the end of 2007 and grow to 500 by the end of 2009 , spokesman Brad Burns said .
The clinics are a bet that time - pressed , price - sensitive consumers will seek care for simpler conditions such as ear infections , pink eye , strep throat and seasonal allergies just steps away from where they buy milk and household items .
Some retailers also see an advantage in managing health - care expenses for their own employees with this model , according to a 2006 report on retail clinics from the California Healthcare Foundation .
Firing up critics
Wal - Mart 's expansion of in - store clinics enrages critics of the world 's largest retailer , who say the company has done little to alleviate the plight of its own uninsured and underinsured workers .
" This is another attempt by Wal - Mart to avoid the responsibility of providing health care to its workers and lessening the burden on taxpayers , " said Chris Kofinis , spokesman for WakeUpWalMart.com , a grass - roots advocacy group in Washington .
" This is part of a pattern .
They talk about addressing health care , but they do n't address their own health - care crisis . "
Kofinis said the company " seems much more concerned with cynically addressing its faltering public image " than providing affordable health care to its uninsured workers , and called for Wal - Mart to provide universal coverage .
He added that 775,000 Wal - Mart employees and their families had no company health care last year , a number Wal - Mart spokesman Dan Fogleman disputes .
Fogleman says 90 % of the company 's 1.3 million U.S. workers have some kind of health coverage .
More than 47 % have medical insurance through Wal - Mart , with others receiving benefits through spouses , school plans or other sources .
Medicaid and other state programs account for 3 % of workers ' coverage , while 9.6 % of employees are uninsured .
" By creating jobs and opportunities for people , we 're providing a gateway for them to employer - sponsored health care -- in many cases for the first time , " Fogleman said .
In a move widely believed to be aimed at Wal - Mart , Maryland lawmakers tried to require companies with more than 10,000 workers to spend at least 8 % of their payroll on medical benefits or pay that money into the state 's health program for low - income people .
A federal judge overturned the law last summer .
Clinics target uninsured
Surveys indicate that more than half of those who visited a clinic in a Wal - Mart said they were uninsured , and almost 15 % of customers said they would have gone to a hospital emergency room for their care if they could not have gone to one of the clinics , according to the prepared remarks .
Providers running the clinics , which will be staffed by certified nurse practitioners or physicians , will determine what services to offer , and will include preventive and routine care for conditions such as allergies and sinus infections , as well as services such as cholesterol screenings , according to the company .
Scott also said that Wal - Mart WMT , - 0.08 % customers have saved about $ 290 million on selected generic prescription drugs since September 2006 , when the company began selling prescriptions for $ 4 each in Tampa , Fla .
The $ 4 prescriptions have been available nationwide since November , and now account for more than 35 % of all prescriptions filled at Wal - Mart , and almost 30 % of the $ 4 prescriptions are filled without insurance , according to the company .
" Within days of announcing our $ 4 program , countless other discounters , drug stores and supermarkets dropped their prices on generic prescriptions , " Scott said .
" That has surely saved our health - care system millions of more dollars .
So let there be no doubt that the private sector can lead . "

Mainstream media yawns as Kucinich offers impeachment Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday June 10 , 2008
|
Print This Email This On Monday evening , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) took to the floor of the House of Representatives to read out 35 articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush in an almost five - hour marathon .
Kucinich 's action made an immediate splash on the Internet .
For example , at progressive website Democratic Underground , the historic performance quickly garnered an astonishing 56 separate threads on the most - recommended list .
By noon on Tuesday , RAW STORY 's article on the subject was the top political story of the day at digg.com and the 10th most popular for the last year .
A separate article at afterdowningstreet.org was also high in the ratings .
Both sites , as well as Kucinich's own webpage , were experiencing slowdowns due to the volume of traffic .
However , the mainstream media were far more reticent in their coverage of Kucinich 's resolution -- much as they were following the release last week of the Senate Intelligence Committee 's report on the administration 's misuse of prewar intelligence .
For example , the Washington Post and USA Today had short items in their blog sections , while other major outlets merely ran wire service coverage from AP or Reuters .
Kucinich supporter John Kusumi responded angrily at OpEdNews , writing , " The most important thing going happened on Monday night .
An event that matters greatly to the course of history and to all Americans .
Did you hear about it ?
Did ABC , CBS , and NBC break into normal programming with special coverage ?
Are there special alerts and bulletins on the cable news networks , where people can see them ?
No , no , and no ! "
NewsHounds was equally scathing , saying , " So , what if they impeached the president and nobody reported it ?
As of 3 AM EDT the goddam liberal media is largely silent on Dennis Kucinich 's introduction of Articles of Impeachment on the floor of the House last night .
Are they afraid of getting it ' wrong ' ?
Just report it , as does RawStory .
...
No matter what you think of it , this is news .
News .
Relevant , important , history - making news .
It was live , on C - Span . Reality TV .
Yet our most famous , trusted , 24/7/365 cable news media outlets are asleep at the wheel - or holding back .
Neither is a good option . "
More considered analysis of the actual political and historical significance of Kucinich 's move was mixed .
At The Huffington Post , political historian Joseph A. Palermo , the author of Robert F. Kennedy And the Death of American Idealism , headlined a blog entry " Dennis Kucinich Makes History Again - Impeach Bush ! "
Palermo wrote , " Kucinich 's lengthy and detailed indictment of this wayward president is the most thorough and powerful case made to date .
He outlined a litany of high crimes and misdemeanors and showed without a shadow of a doubt that George W. Bush deserves to be impeached and removed from office .
Kucinich made clear that Bush has violated his oath of office and his Constitutional duty that the laws be ' faithfully executed . ' "
In contrast , Salon.com 's political blogger , Alex Koppelman , wrote dismissively , " Some liberals in the blogosphere are complaining about the dearth of coverage of Kucinich 's resolution .
I have to disagree -- as I 've pointed out before , when discussing complaints of liberal bias from the right , the media is in the business of covering news .
This barely qualifies ; if it deserves mention in the mainstream media at all , it certainly does n't deserve to be accorded the status of something big and breaking .
I 'm sorry , but the action of a lone congressman who 's widely considered something of a laughingstock , especially when it 's clear that action will never come to anything , just is n't especially newsworthy . "
Jim Trakas , Kucinich 's Republican opponent in next fall 's Congressional election also took the opportunity to blast his rival , complaining that " on the day his constituents first started paying $ 4 for a gallon of gasoline , Congressman Kucinich uses his time and efforts for more political games and not trying to solve the real problems in Washington . "
Candy is normally a tasty little sweet treat designed to give pleasure to all .
However , that is not always the case , as this list proves .
For some unknown reason , some candy manufacturers have recently started producing the most disgusting candies you could image ( they must be running out of ideas ) .
Here is our list of the most disgusting candies you could ever eat .
1. Ear Wax Candy
2. Candy Scabs
3. Dubbel ZoutDubbel Zout
4. Hotlix Candy
5. Gorilla Boogers
6. Ant Candy
7. Jane - Jane Tasty Tuna Tidbits
9. Durian Candy
10 . BeanBoozled
BON APETTIT !
I do n’t care how this candy tastes , who in their right mind would enjoy scraping ear wax out of a plastic ear for eating ?
The whole idea just makes me want to gag !
It even comes with its own swab .
How many kids are going to start digging in their ears after they run out candy I wonder ?
Smart .
The gross factor in these candies is not their flavor , but the fact that they are designed to look like scabs - complete with plasters .
I could possibly cope with that , but just imagine this scenario : Johnny and Jimmy are playing hide and seek .
Jimmy hides in the bush that his dog Rover just recently pooped in .
Jimmy inadvertently gets Rover ’s poop on his hand and does n’t realize it .
They finish playing and mommy gives them some Candy Scabs to eat .
Jimmy sticks it on his hand , pulls it off , and ….
I think you get the picture .
Dumb idea .
The first thing this Dutch candy has going against it is that it is licorice flavored .
I know a lot of people like the taste of licorice , but a lot of people voted for George Bush too - it does n’t make it right .
The next problem here is that this is licorice made with an enormous amount of salt .
That ’s right - it is salt “ candy ” .
Add to that the fact that it looks like something you would expect to find on the floor of an English nightclub , and you have the makings of one of the worst candies ever .
Okay - it is sweet - I will give them that , but inside each of these tasty candies is a REAL LIFE scorpion .
Yup - when you lick through the sugar coating , you get to chow down on scorpion guts .
Whoever came up with this candy needs to be forced to eat some Dubbel Zout .
We are really walking a thin line with this one - gorilla boogers are sweetened dried black beans ( popular in Asian cooking ) .
I was on holiday in korea once and had some of their sweet bean candy ( they beat the beans to a pulp then shape it in to small bite sized pieces ) .
It tasted like dirt .
These boogers are made from the same beans .
They taste like dirt too .
Sweetened dirt .
Enough said .
Like the scorpion candy above , this is basically a lump of melted sugar with a bunch of dead ants thrown in to it .
Of all the things in the world that they could have thrown in to their candy , what the hell made them choose ants .
How does this stuff get past the FDA ?
Tuna was invented by mother nature for hippy vegetarians and people trying to shed some fat - so how has it managed to find its way in to candy ?
The main ingredient in these little blobs of sugary disgustingness is tuna .
After that comes a bunch of chemicals of unknown origin , and finally sugar .
Seriously - who would eat fish flavored candy ?
Just because Moses and the Jews ate locusts in the desert does n’t mean anyone should do it now !
These are real crickets sprinkled with a variety of flavors .
I realize that chips ( which they are similar to ) are not usually labeled as candy , but they are so gross ( and both are equally bad for you ) that they deserve a spot here .
Anyone that eats these things by choice deserves to be hit with a plague of boils .
Durian fruit is a common fruit in Southeast Asia .
To people unfamiliar to it , it usually evokes feelings of utter disgust .
One food writer said : “ its odor is best described as pig- shit , turpentine and onions , garnished with a gym sock . ”
You are not even allowed to bring this stuff in to hospitals or hotels in South East Asia .
In Singapore , they have signs that forbid you from taking it on the public transport system ( see here ) .
That is how disgusting it is .
So , it makes a lot of sense to make candy out of it .
Not .
But there you have it - someone has done it .
This one was nearly number 1 on the list , until we discovered BeanBoozled … BeanBoozled are jellybeans made by the company that brought us Gourmet JellyBeans .
In a box of BeanBoozled we find 10 colors of beans and 20 flavors - every color has one tasty flavor , and a disgusting flavor - the idea is that you never know whether you are about to get a good one or a bad one .
This makes it ideal for party games .
So - why is this number one on the list ?
After you read the selection of “ bad ” flavors , you will understand : Skunk Spray , Moldy Cheese , Baby Wipes , Rotten Egg , Vomit , and more .
And guess what ?
They really taste like their names .
Next time you are watching a movie in the dark with friends , slip a few of these in to their bag of jellybeans for a great gag ( literally ) .
An Italian bishop has reportedly told a young paraplegic he cannot have a church wedding because he is impotent , despite his fiancee being aware of the problem .
Salvatore de Ciuco , spokesman for Bishop Lorenzo Chiarinelli of Viterbo in central Italy , told SkyTG24 television : " No bishop , no priest can celebrate a wedding when he knows of admitted impotence as it is a motive for annulment " of the marriage .
The 26 - year - old groom , who took part in a civil marriage ceremony on Saturday in Viterbo , has been paraplegic since he was involved in a car accident .
XFL : Flash 's New Source Format
I recently met with Flash authoring product - manager , Richard Galvan , to talk about Diesel , the next version of Flash ( i.e. , Flash CS4 , or version 10 for those counting ) .
Adobe has already demonstrated a bunch of high - impact features for Diesel , including inverse kinematics , a new tweening model , 3D " postcards in space " , and advanced text components ( see MAX 07 keynote , FOTB 07 keynote , and FITC Amsterdam 08 keynote ) .
But Richard was keen to talk about a lesser known feature quietly percolating behind the scenes : XFL .
Since its inception , the Flash authoring tool has stored documents in a binary source - file called . fla .
Historically , interchanging source with the Flash authoring tool has been virtually impossible for third - party software because the specification for .fla has never been public .
But things are changing in the next version of Flash .
Flash CS4 will be able to export * and * import a new source format called XFL .
An XFL file is a .zip file that contains the source material for a Flash document .
Within the .zip file resides an XML file describing the structure of the document and a folder with the document 's assets ( graphics , sounds , etc ) .
The exact details of the XFL format are not yet available , but Richard assures me that Adobe intends to document them publicly , allowing third - party tools to import and export XFL .
So in theory , you might one day edit the images of an XFL file directly in Photoshop without disturbing the timeline information also contained in that file .
Or you might be able to import a page from a word processing document into a Flash presentation .
But perhaps even more exciting is the potential for the smaller , grass - roots community .
Being XML - based , the new XFL format should be fairly easy to understand and generate .
That means any small tool company , web agency , or even independent developer will be able to create a purpose - built authoring tool that can output XFL .
Of course , the XFL file would then need to be opened in the Flash authoring tool for final . swf export .
But a . jsfl script should be able to ease the workflow between an XFL - generating tool and the Flash - authoring . swf - compilation process .
The natural next step in the evolution of XFL authoring would be to take the Flash authoring tool out of the equation altogether .
If Adobe were to offer a command - line XFL - to - SWF compiler along with XFL , nearly any decent programmer would be able to create a . swf - authoring tool , even in ActionScript .
The Flash developer community itself would finally be able to create its own custom Flash - authoring tools .
I wonder who would be the first to nostalgically make Flash 4 for AIR in ActionScript ?
XFL might not have the instant appeal of inverse kinematics , but it could eventually prove to be the feature in Flash CS4 that has the greatest impact on the Flash industry .
After all , its name has an " X ' in it .

How close did I come to getting arrested by Maricopa County sheriff 's deputies today ?
As Maxwell Smart would say , " Missed it by that much . "
These cowardly MCSO deputies refused to identify themselves .
The problem : I had the nerve to want to look at the same public records that sheriff 's deputies were scouring at the City of Phoenix public records counter .
Related Stories ASU Media Relations Office Is an Embarrassment to Cronkite Journalism School
First , a little background .
You 'll recall that Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon has been putting a lot of political heat on Sheriff Joe Arpaio in recent months , ripping Arpaio for conducting " crime - supression sweeps " that are really intended to find illegal immigrants .
At a luncheon in March to honor Cesar Chavez , Gordon said the Sheriff 's Office was doing little more than locking up " brown people with broken tail lights . "
He reiterated the theme in a May 2008 Latino Perspectives Magazine article , writing that Arpaio has " created a ' Sanctuary County for Felons ' with his reckless priorities –that target brown skin and cracked tail lights – instead of killers and drug dealers . "
Pretty harsh words , and when the sheriff gets attacked , he bites back .
In late April , the Sheriff 's Office put in a public records request for every e-mail obtained or received from the mayor and a bunch of his staff members , including City Manager Frank Fairbanks .
Arpaio also wants to see the mayor 's meeting calendar and cell phone records .
As New Times columnist Sarah Fenske wrote last month , the request appears to be a fishing expedition for any records that could harm the mayor politically .
It should go without saying that this request is another example of how Arpaio abuses the police powers of his office to try to intimidate and quiet his critics .
But it 's also proving that Arpaio and his deputies are hypocrites , for two reasons :
Because the sheriff 's public information officials often complain when the news media attempts the same kind of fishing expedition that his office is now conducting .
And because the MCSO is taking advantage of a liberal public - records policy at the City of Phoenix that allows the public to scan in or photograph public records for free to avoid copying fees .
As I 've written in a previous article , the Sheriff 's Office wo n't let anyone to scan or photograph public records it releases , instead demanding a whopping 50 cents a page for copies .
As my article notes , after I argued with the sheriff 's publicly funded private lawyer about this issue in October , the Sheriff 's Office cited me for disorderly conduct .
I pleaded not guilty and am continuing to fight the charge .
Today , I got wind that sheriff 's deputies were at the City of Phoenix building at 200 West Washington scanning public records into a machine they 'd brought with them .
When I arrived at the 15th - floor records counter about 3 p.m. , two deputies were sitting near their scanner , waiting for the device to process a stack of papers .
A large file box was next to the scanner , full of thousands of pages of documents .
I strolled up to the deputies , identified myself , and asked who they were .
They refused to reveal their names , but that 's them in the picture at the top of this article .
I told the pair I was interested in seeing what documents the city had released to them , and asked them if it was all right if I took a peek at some of the documents in the box that they were n't using at the time .
They said no way , then turned over some of the public records that had been face - up so I could n't see them .
I stated that I had the right to simply reach into the box and look at the records , but the deputy in the blue shirt said he " would n't advise that . "
Which I took to mean , by the words and his tone , that he 'd arrest me .
I called the mayor 's office and told Scott Phelps , Gordon 's spokesman , what was happening .
And a few minutes later , City Attorney Gary Verburg showed up .
In no uncertain terms , Verburg told the deputies I had the right to look at the public records .
Unfortunately , Verburg had to attend a City Council meeting and could n't stick around .
By then , brave blue - shirt had called for back - up .
In walked MCSO Captain Jim Miller and a couple of other deputies , including one of the sheriff 's legion of highly paid flacks , Paul Chagolla .
The deputies surrounded the scanner so I could n't get near it to see what secrets they had obtained from the city .
Miller proved himself to be a real bully , practically begging me make a move that would allow him to arrest me .
He accused me of wanting to take public records literally from his deputies ' hands , warning me that such an action would certainly lead to arrest .
He picked up a couple of random folders sitting on the records counter and waved them in my face .
" Take these papers from my hand ! " he snarled .
" Take these papers from my hand ! "
When I declined , he grinned smugly .
" Wise man , " he said .
Captain Jim Miller , ( and the back of flack Paul Chagolla 's head ) .
Then , Chagolla took his turn .
He wagged a finger in my face , threatening repeatedly to arrest me for interfering with the sheriff 's " investigation " if I tried to look at the documents getting scanned , or those in the box next to the scanner .
Telling him the city attorney said it was my right legally to look in the box did n't phase him .
Chagolla warned that he intended to report my actions to the City of Phoenix prosecutor who is helping the Sheriff 's Office ream me on the bogus disorderly conduct charge .
A Phoenix security officer showed up , as well as two or three Phoenix police officers , including one commander .
Hoping to prevent the showdown from getting truly ugly , the Phoenix records clerks said I could begin looking at the boxes of documents the deputies had scanned already , and I agreed to do that .
In about an hour , I quickly flipped through a few thousand pages of copies .
It was a big pile of nothing .
Typical e-mails about immigration issues .
Citizens e-mailing city staff members newspaper articles , sometimes railing against or lending support to the mayor 's views .
Boring internal memos .
I went through the stacks pretty fast .
It seems the Sheriff 's Office is getting zilch in this publicly funded vendetta against Gordon for speaking his mind ( not that this would stop Arpaio from trumping up something against Gordon .
He 's done it before .
His minions have done it to me ) .
While I was perusing the documents , a city " conflict resolution manager " walked up and laid down an Arizona law book .
She pointed to the section of public records law that essentially says anyone can look at any public record during business hours .
And then City Attorney Verburg came back and told me and the deputies again that I had the right to look at any public record .
Upon hearing that , the deputies warned me again that if I tried to look at the documents in the box next to the scanner , I 'd be arrested .
Of course , by then it did n't matter , since I 'd seen most of the documents they 'd scanned in previously , and those in the box ( as well as two or three other boxes of papers the deputies had yet to scan in ) were likely just more of the same .
In any case , it appeared there was nothing worth getting arrested over today .
New Times will look at the rest of the records soon enough .
" It 's an unusual request , " Verburg said later of Arpaio 's public records search .
" I do n't think it will turn up anything . "
Whether that prediction is accurate remains to be seen .
But the city should 've made the sheriff 's request for records a much more difficult endeavor -- by forcing Arpaio to play by his own rules .
That is , forbid the deputies from using a scanner .
Charge them 50 cents a page .
Heck , why not make the deputies review records in the city jail , using only a pencil and paper to take notes .
( Arpaio has forced reporters he does n't like , including me , to review records , using only a pencil and paper , inside one of his county gulags . )
That is , the city should fight back with the same intimidation tactics that Arpaio unleashes routinely on anybody who bucks him .
Suicide is ubiquitous .
Around the world , in just about every culture , some people decide to take their own lives .
It happens far more often than most people realize , making news only in prominent cases , as with Deborah Jeane Palfrey , known as the " D.C. Madam , " who apparently chose to kill herself last week rather than face up to 55 years in prison .
More interesting , just about everyone can imagine the urge to end it all , although most of us never get remotely close to acting on that thought .
And yet , suicide , even thoughts of suicide , makes no sense , at least from an evolutionary point of view .
Humans , like all animals , are designed to pass along genes to the next generation .
But ending your own life means , in stark evolutionary terms , cutting off , or harming your future reproductive success .
When young people kill themselves , their genes are eliminated from the gene pool ; when adults kill themselves they can no longer care for dependent children ; when elderly people kill themselves , they , too , abdicate the role of caring parent for the next generations .
Why would such a negative behavior be part of human nature ?
The answer is complicated by the fact that any number of emotions and experiences can push a person toward suicide .
It might be loss , or loss of hope , or a change in life that makes life not worth living .
Or it might be a lifetime of hardship topped by some final misery that makes suicide look more appealing than carrying on .
The answer is also complicated by the fact that the human mind is notoriously fickle .
What is overwhelming to one person might be a seen as a temporary glitch to another , and our attitude about life changes over a lifetime .
For example , we might be easily despondent in our teens , resilient at 20 , and then unable to cope at 40 .
Negative emotions also have deep evolutionary roots .
Primatologist Frans de Waal of Emory University has shown that chimpanzees and other primates lead complex emotional lives , ones full of happiness as well as negativity .
Chimps not only love and care for others , they also hate and become depressed .
Although chimps can't talk about their feelings , researcher say these emotions are easily spotted by body language and behavior that mirrors the same emotions in people .
Researchers have even watched as chimps die from what looks like a broken heart .
Obviously , sadness is part of life for animals with big brains .
The capacity to feel presumably helps us solve problems and survive , and is essential for group living , and perhaps inconsolable depression is simply emotional baggage that tags along with the good stuff .
Or maybe unhappiness and a tendency towards suicide is the product of the uncontrolled nature of our quicksilver minds .
We think a lot , and our wondering minds are just as likely to think sad as happy .
It 's also possible that deep sadness has , in some way , been selected for .
Attempted suicide is much more frequent than " successful " suicide .
Commonly called a cry for help , these acts do indeed change the life of a survivor as well as the people around them .
In the best case scenario , the attempt is seen as a red flag that all is not well , and loved ones step in and make things right .
In an unexpected twist , the most negative of humans acts can become a life saver , and a way to keep genes where they belong — in the gene pool .

There is a lot of material on good software management out there , and not everybody took the time to read all the important one .
This material can sometimes be contradictory , and sometimes false .
Nevertheless , I decided to integrate it here into what I 've perceived and concluded to be the best choices .
I 'm not trying to be original in this article , because an essayist ( or any kind of artist ) does not get credit for coming up with perfectly original concepts or ideas ( as I note later in a different context ) .
What I 'm trying to do is summarise everything I 've learned , judged and concluded , so far , based on the many sources I 've read .
I may be just a dwarf standing on the shoulders of giant , but hopefully I 'll still be able to see farther than most .
So this time , I 'm going to try again and hopefully be more successful .
This article aims to cover the elements that great programmers would love to see in a perfect workplace .
By implementing as many of them as possible , or at least giving them a serious thought , you can make such potential employees want to work for you , love to work for you , want to stay , and be happy as long as they are working for you .
Furthermore , you will know better than to irrationally fire perfectly good employees .
I can see why people would think so after reading the " End of IT Slavery " .
However , my intention in the article was to guide employers ( and employees ) as to how to best treat their employees , and give them good conditions , so they 'll be happier and more productive .
Going over the original article , I can see that I indeed had a very ranting tone , and gave bad examples for what not to do exclusively .
One of the comments I received said that I kept giving bad examples for conditions I disliked from previous workplaces , instead of positive elements I would have liked to see .
Another commentator told me in private , that he felt that the " End of IT Slavery " and other essays of mine reflected the fact that I had a " primadonna attitude " instead of a more positive " team - player " attitude .
I originally wrote " The End of Info - Tech Slavery " about a year ago , shortly after I was fired from a job I liked and for which I worked about three months .
Some people who commented on the article found it of good value .
However many people who commented on it have voiced some criticism .
The Elements of a Perfect Workplace
Hire the Best Developers " Joel on Software " and others have written about the importance of having very good developers .
See for example his " Guerilla Guide to Interviewing " .
Bad programmers will create code that 's buggy , insecure , hard - to - maintain , etc .
The so - called " Medium - level techs " will probably not , but will be heavily under - productive in comparison to star programmers .
( And according to Brooks ' Law , you can't effectively replace one good programmer with many worse ones . )
As I noted there are many aspects that qualify someone as a good programmer .
However , it does not change the fact that hiring a large number of mediocre programmers will never be as effective as hiring one or two good or very good programmers .
Openness
One of the most important trends in the software world recently was towards " openness " : open - source , open - content , open - specifications , etc .
Most good programmers you can find will find the open source ( also known as " Free Software " ) movement very appealing , and share some of its ideals .
I do n't propose you should make your software open - source , although , of course , this is often a good business model .
However , there are other aspects of openness that you should follow if you want to attract and keep good programmers .
First of all , do n't over protect your code .
Make it open - source if possible , give your contractors and consultants ( including outsource ones ) access to it , and allow your programmers to show parts of it to their online friends to get some advice .
You should make as much of it as possible public , under open source licences to allow it to be used more often , increase its quality , and grow a culture around it .
From my experience , working on " shrinkwrap " software that is used by end - users in the wild , and open - source software in particular , is the best way to increase the quality of the software as it requires the most discipline to work on and support .
Openness does not end at that .
Another important aspect is to allow your programmers to tell their friends and family about what they do .
Some defence - related companies seem to think keeping everything confidential is a good idea , but that will cause your employees to feel unnecessarily trapped and unable to get help .
So if you want to attract the best programmers , make sure they can tell other people of what they do , and what problems they are facing .
( I 'm not advocating complete transparency , if it 's not appropriate , but rather not being overly secretive . )
Finally , you should avoid vendor lock - in : use standard or documented protocols and specifications , take Joel Spolsky 's advice of letting your users go back , and make sure your users have control of their data and can access it , back it up and access it .
A good example for this is the photo - sharing site Flickr , which has published full APIs for its service , and even allowed these APIs to be used by competing site .
Great Working Conditions
You should make sure your employees have great working conditions .
Kitchen
There should be a kitchen with a lot of food , hot and cold beverages , etc. Comfortable Offices I do n't necessarily agree that your workers should have spacious offices with doors that close , but they should still be comfortable enough .
At one of my workplace , I constantly had to move to let other people out of their seats , and this was unbearable .
So do n't do that .
In one job that I fondly remember , every employee had their own spacious cube , with a desk to put a computer and a place to put a few chairs .
This was much more like it .
This can not stressed enough .
As Joel Spolsky notes ( based on Steve McConnell ) in item No. 9 of the Joel Test , you need to " use the best tools that money can buy " .
If you buy old , broken and / or barely functioning hardware , you 'll spend a lot of time debugging the problems there , which will waste a lot of precious time .
And you may lose a lot of reputation and customers due to down - time .
Relying on reliable , high - end hardware is a much better idea .
I 've been to two workplaces that gave me an old computer with a 40 GB hard - disk .
It was n't enough at all .
At one place , we 've reached the limit of this hard - disk due to several large source code checkouts , and as a result needed a bigger hard - disk .
And the only hard - disks the lab had were 80 GB ones , which were bought because they were the cheapest ( per-disk , not per-capacity ) .
Please , buy large enough hard - disks .
At the same workplace , I was given a computer with a read - only CD - ROM drive .
It was not even a DVD reader .
I brought a DVD of audio files from home , and could not read it .
In this day and age , read / write DVD drives are the standard , and are ultra-cheap .
Sometimes you 'll need several computers , or a decent virtual machine emulator , to run alternative operating systems on the same machine .
Make sure your workers have a high - quality screen .
They need to look at it most of the day , and they want it to look nice .
A decent 19 " LCD screen nowadays is very cheap nowadays and well worth the added productivity .
You also need a state - of - the - art version control system , of which there are currently several high - quality open - source alternatives .
Some very costly version control systems have a bad reputation for being extreme troublemakers , while the modern open - source alternatives " just work " .
If there 's a good commercial software that your employees like to use and can recommend , do n't hesitate to buy it .
You 'll also find O'Reilly Safari Licences to be a good idea so your employees can easily look up and read information in many books online .
Sane Working Hours
Give your employees sane working hours - 40 hours work - weeks or less .
While sometimes asking them to stay late to finish a deadline is acceptable , the so - called " crunch mode " is under - effective and a recipe for disaster .
Location , Location , Location Find a good place which is close enough for most people to get to .
Make sure your programmers can commute to you easily .
Even pay for taxi - cabs out of your own expense , or ask other employees to give them a ride , if there is n't good public transportation .
The money you spend on the cabs is very small compared to the one you would lose by lost productivity , and by frustrations of travelling .
A Lot of Paid Vacation
Give your workers a lot of paid vacation .
Humans are not machines - they need rest and relaxation .
The 14 annual vacation days mandated by the Israeli government are a joke .
You should give them much more than that .
Joel Spolsky 's Fog Creek software gives 6 weeks of paid vacation , which is much more reasonable .
Avoid Over - Strict Firewalls
Some organisations put their intranets below firewalls that block access to almost all services .
It is not uncommon to see only the HTTP and HTTPS ports open for free access .
However , there are many other Internet services that star programmers need in order to be productive .
Among them are : Internet Relay Chat and other forms of Instant Messaging .
This allows star programmers to discuss problems and share solutions interactively with their peers , or just to take a break from work and chat .
SSH - Secure Shell - allows access to remote computers over the network .
BitTorrent - allows downloading some content that is otherwise not available on the Web .
And naturally , malware can easily propagate and survive using HTTP and HTTPS alone , and there are ways that clueful workers can overcome such restrictions .
At one of my workplaces , I was able to chat on the IRC , connect using IM , ssh to everywhere I wanted , etc. without any restriction .
It was a liberating feeling and I felt at home there .
At a more recent one , I needed to connect to a remote host , and invoke port forwarding in order to talk on the IRC which was annoying and error prone .
So make sure your firewall is not over - zealous and does not prevent legitimate uses .
About the Salary Competitive Salary ?
Yes , it 's important , but not absolutely everything .
Great programmers wo n't work for you for free , but they 'll find many other conditions much more tempting than an over - blown salary .
See what Eric Raymond wrote about it in " Homesteading the Noosphere " , quoting many studies : Psychologist Theresa Amabile of Brandeis University , cautiously summarizing the results of a 1984 study of motivation and reward , observed `` It may be that commissioned work will , in general , be less creative than work that is done out of pure interest .''.
Amabile goes on to observe that `` The more complex the activity , the more it 's hurt by extrinsic reward . ''
Interestingly , the studies suggest that flat salaries do n't demotivate , but piecework rates and bonuses do .
Thus , it may be economically smart to give performance bonuses to people who flip burgers or dug ditches , but it 's probably smarter to decouple salary from performance in a programming shop and let people choose their own projects ( both trends that the open - source world takes to their logical conclusions ) .
Indeed , these results suggest that the only time it is a good idea to reward performance in programming is when the programmer is so motivated that he or she would have worked without the reward !
Conditions : Conclusion
One final note : you might thing to yourself : " how can I afford all that ? " .
Well , the answer is that the cost of all these advantages is very small in comparison to your general operation .
And they will pay themselves much more as time goes by in the happiness , productivity and loyalty of your workers .
The last thing you want is to lose a competent developer .
And all these things will better make sure that he or she will stay with you .
Pair Programming
When doing Pair programming , there are two programmers sitting next to a single computer screen and keyboard , with one of them actually writing the code , and the other one observing and helping .
At first glance , it seems like it's a waste of resources : wo n't they be under - productive ?
The answer is a " no " .
First of all , pair programming increases run-time code review , as the " passive " programmer observes what the active programmer writes , gives him advice and answers his question .
Code - review is always a good thing .
Secondly , pair programming causes both programmers to have more discipline , and they are less likely to procrastinate as the active programmer will bore the watching one .
Pair programming is also more fun , because people feel more comfortable working in pairs than alone .
Finally , pair programming is more productive , because it was shown that it yields more output than two individual programmers .
I had had a very good experience working in pairs back when I was an undergraduate student at the Technion and can highly recommend it .
Give Your Employees the Freedom to Do What They Want If your employee is responsible , he 'll care about his job to be productive , even if you do n't watch him .
If he is n't , then no amount of watching will make him responsible .
You should n't constantly monitor your employees .
Instead , give them time to clear their mind and do non-coding - related activities such as : Play computer games .
Browse the web .
Watch videos or listen to netcasts .
Read articles or books .
Work on open - source software or their own personal projects .
Chat with their co-workers or online peers .
Take walks in the neighbourhood , do sports , go to clubs and other activities .
These tasks and others do n't interfere with the work much , and actually contribute to productivity .
And along with pair programming , you can be more certain your programmers will work .
Do n't judge your employees by how they spend their time at work - instead judge them by the overall progress they do in the long run .
Moreover , some tasks that your employees do at their free time , may eventually bring your company publicity and esteem .
Part of the reason Joel Spolsky 's " Fog Creek Software " company is so well - known is because of the Joel on Software blog , which is one of the most - read weblogs about software management .
This in turn resulted in a lot of publicity to the Fog Creek products .
If your employees are productive , you should not really be concerned what they are doing on their work time .
Google allows its employees work on non-work - related - tasks 20 % of the time ( while Google still owns the intellectual rights to their creations ) .
I would go a step further by saying you simply should allow your employees to do as much non-work - related leisure as they feel they need to on their working hours .
Tell them you expect long - term results , not 100 % productivity - of - time .
Phrase Your Job Ads in a Unique and Smart Way " 3 Years Experience in Perl - Must " , " 20 Years Experience in PHP - Advantage " , " Team Player " , " Independent Thinker " .
Boring .
Your job ad need to stand out .
Take this job ad that was posted to the Israeli Ruby mailing list for an excellent example :
We are looking for a developer who :
Want a full time , salaried position .
Want to work in a fun , young workplace .
Want to work in an environment that allows them to use ( just about ) whatever tools they wish to get the job done .
Knows and love Ruby .
Ideally have experience with PHP and Python .
Want to work on large scale Rails / Merb projects that have nothing to do with " the Social Web " .
Want to drown a puppy every time they hear phrases like " the Social Web " .
See ?
I also want to write sites that are not necessarily " Social Web " , and I also got tired of the " Social Web " and its association with Ruby and other similar technologies .
So this ad has caught my attention .
As Joel on Software notes about experience , the reason companies want people with a lot of experience in a certain niche , is because they tend to overcome problems they encounter more easily and so can help themselves and their co-workers with their problem more easily .
However , as long as you have someone with enough experience , then bright people without a lot of experience can still prove to be useful and very productive .
So do n't demand too much from them .
As of 2008 , there are n't enough clueful developers in Israel for all the workplaces ( and I think that 's also the case in most other places ) , and you can't afford to be too picky .
Another tip I can offer to look for employees is to use specialised job boards like the the Joel on Software job - board , and jobs .
perl.org , the DailyWTF " Non-WTF " board which highly - qualified and niche people follow .
Just make sure to phrase your ad in a non-boring way , as I noted earlier .
Read a Lot of Software Management Material
It 's impossible to put all the good advice I found regarding software management and software engineering online and offline , in one document .
So I argue you as a manager or an employee to read as much different material you can find .
There 's a lot of good advice out there .
Socrates said : " I know that I do not know . " , and he was right .
While it 's easy to dismiss other people as " idiots " or what they say as being " stupid " , one should realise that even incorrect conclusions or reasoning can bring useful insights , and give some food for thought .
Sometimes , I find some useful insights in rehearsed things or short blog entries .
If you 're a manager or team - leader , you should make sure that you 're not much more clue - less than your programmers are , but that has often been the case for me and others .
Listen to Your Developers
Which brings us to this : you obviously cannot get every aspect of software management right at first .
Your programmers may eventually become unhappy , and you should make sure they can tell you how they feel , and to take note of what they say .
Otherwise , you 're risking underproductivity or downright clinical depression .
Do n't Over -Specialise
Many workplaces seem to think that it is a good idea to make sure every developer is limited to a certain aspect of the development process , and will specialise exclusively in it .
Taken to extreme , however , such a trend is very dangerous .
Programmers need to have a solid understanding of the entire product stack in their head .
Good programmers can also benefit from a change of scenery .
And naturally , reviewing someone else 's code , and criticising it , is also always beneficial .
Therefore , you should make sure that your workers do n't over - specialise .
Let them dedicate some time to work on what they find interesting , and let them review and criticise other people 's work .
Once , before I started my undergraduate studies , I worked for a developer of a software - based modem ( so - called " Winmodems " ) .
I was impressed from the atmosphere there , and how professional and clueful the managers were .
One of the things I liked about the job was that while I was initially hired as a tester , I eventually was appreciated for my eclectic knowledge of different aspects of sound , games , modems , Internet , and other fields .
So , I was given more diverse things to do there , involving many aspects of our operation .
You should follow suit and involve your star developers in as many aspects of your development .
Listen to Your Customers or Users Joel on Software gives a lot of good advice on having a good customer service .
You should listen to what your customers ( or users ) say .
Do n't dismiss them .
Do n't give them annoying canned responses .
Open your bug - tracker to the world as a web - service .
There are many web - based , and gratis bug - trackers , such as Bugzilla , and you should use one of them for better interaction with your customers .
As Joel indicates , a bug report , email , or query usually indicates a problem in the software : a bug , a missing feature , or something that 's not clear enough .
Such problems need to be fixed in the code .
Furthermore , if one or more of your customers are requesting a feature , and it seems to be important enough , give a priority to implementing it .
As a Mercury Interactive ( Now part of HP ) developer noted usually the features requested by the customers , are the ones that will yield the most newer customers , not - to - mention will allow keeping customers , if they are paying for upgrades or as a " software - as- a - service " model .
Joel Spolsky also notes that good customer service is part of the key to a small ISV 's success .
" Good Poets Borrow .
Great Poets Steal . "
Originality and " innovation " is not as important as people think it is .
It is perfectly OK to create a product in a niche which has a lot of existing competition , it 's OK to build on other people 's efforts , and it 's OK to " borrow " or " steal " ( see the quote at the top ) ideas from your users , competitors and friends .
You 're not getting credit for originality - you 're getting credit for high - quality products ( software , services , support , etc. - whatever you do ) and especially for revenue and profits .
See " Converting Capital into Software That Works " for more information Another common fallacy is that ideas are the hardest part of the production process .
However , ideas are very cheap , and creative people have far too many good ideas .
It 's actually harder to develop the idea into a product , to mass - produce it , and then to mass - distribute it .
Edison was not the first to come up with the Electrical Lightbulb , or to develop a working prototype , but he was the one to have put up all the effort in making it so popular and prevalent .
Therefore , he is rightly credited as its inventor .
Similar in software , you can often see competing products displacing more established competition , or sometimes a market where there is n't a clear winner ( e.g : window managers and desktop environments for Unix , Bug trackers , text editors , etc . )
Even making rounder wheels is a good way to earn a living and to get respect .
Study Psychology
Your co-workers are people .
As such they have thoughts , feelings , emotions , and desires , which guide them and affect them .
Learning how people 's psychology works , and how to motivate people and help them if they are feeling de-motivated - will help an employer be more effective , and make his employees more productive .
This is also the case for your customers , users , associates and friends , who you will surely have to interact with , make sure they are happy most of the time , and deal with their problems effectively .
Here are a few good resources on Psychology : " Feeling Good : The New Mood Therapy " - the best book I 've read about Psychology .
A self - help book of Cognitive - behavioural therapy , this books explains what causes Clinical depressions , and other negative mood swings , and why people behave the way they do .
It is a stark anti-thesis to Freudian psychology , which makes little sense and is completely not helpful .
" The Neo - Tech Discovery " - an off - shoot of Ayn Rand ' Objectivism , Neo -Tech is the best idea - system I 've encountered yet .
Note that it is easy to both dismiss Neo - Tech as a stupid cult , or to hugely misunderstand it at first .
So when reading Neo - Tech go over the material ( preferably without skipping , but possibly while taking breaks ) , and then let it sink for a while .
Note that as of May 2008 , the old hyperlinks to the Neo - Tech site lead to redirects or PHP errors .
You can still find the old pages on the web archive , and I hope they 'll get fixed .
In any case , it may be a good idea to order " The Neo - Tech Discovery " book .
( It is not available in book stores ) .
" The Design of Everyday Things " - this book is a must read to everyone doing user - interface design .
It explains how frustrating it is to use many everyday objects ( and , by inflection , software and software devices ) , and how to design them right .
" Helplessness : On Depression , Development and Death " - I have n't read this book yet , but it was recommended on the " Joel on Software " book reviews , which I found to be of value .
It is also written from the Cognitive - Behavioural Psychology viewpoint .
Naturally , becoming a more psychologically - capable person is a process .
No one is fully friendly , tactful , helpful , and considerate at all times .
But one must always aspire to be more .
For example , at one of the workplaces I had , whenever I told my boss that I did n't finish what he asked for , but instead found out something else of importance or made some other progress he said " So what you 're saying is that you did n't achieve anything . " .
This is a classical case of the " All or Nothing Thinking " cognitive error , which is given in " Feeling Good " as a possible primary cause of depression .
This attitude caused me to think and feel that nothing I could do , would possibly please him , and that he was demotivating on purpose .
This was one of the reasons that caused me to assume a variation of a clinical depression called " Hypomania " , which in turn made me under - productive .
Read Success and Failure Stories
One of the many quotes featured at the signature of a friend of mine is “ Learn from mistakes of others ; you wo n't live long enough to make them all yourself ” .
It is important to read success and failure stories of what people did , what mistakes they performed and what are their conclusions .
I believe we can learn more from the failures of ourselves and others , than we can learn from successes .
That 's because in a success , almost every aspect was done right , while in a failure one can look back and say where things went wrong .
You can find many such stories on the Internet , and sometimes you 'll hear about them in news sites , blogs , and various forums .
Avoiding " Knowledge in the Ether " One of the anti-patterns I encountered in previous workplaces and one especially is that of the " Knowledge in the Ether " .
Quoting from my original post :
One anti-pattern I noted in a previous workplace was what I called " Knowledge in the Ether " : most of the instructions for getting the application up and running , and a lot of the collective knowledge were not written down in a collective place .
TDDPirate said he was familiar with it and called it the " Oral Torah " syndrome .
The solution for this is simple : set up a wiki for the company , and instruct people to write a note there whenever they need to explain to someone how to do it ( or give a link to a previous note ) , instead of guiding him how to do it .
While this requires some discipline and getting used to , it can also be done after the fact .
Obviously the amount of knowledge in people 's head and in the Ether can never be completely eliminated .
But it should be kept down to a minimum .
There was also a comment that said one should write a script to do that .
And it's a good idea to keep good README files , comments , etc. and to use a standard building procedure , or prepare distribution - level packages for the software .
Nevertheless , a workplace should encourage its employees to note down every useful knowledge and procedure .
My friend once told me that in his previous workplace they kept a knowledge - base as a group of Microsoft Word documents stored inside Visual SourceSafe .
As a result , people felt it was too much bother to update and maintain them .
Eventually , he set up an instance of MediaWiki there , which proved to be much more convenient , accessible and quick .
FROM Capitol Hill to Wall Street to the campaign trail , the recent surge in oil prices is quickly threatening to supplant the mortgage crisis as the country ’s leading economic issue .
Last week , prices for crude set another record , finishing at $ 125.96 a barrel on Friday , while gasoline prices closed in on $ 4 a gallon .
But even as the presidential candidates debate whether to cut federal gas taxes this summer and legislators look at other ways to ease prices at the pump , a harder - to - control factor is emerging as a main reason behind the increase in energy costs : the sinking dollar .
While no one disputes that China and other emerging economies are craving more crude , the stunning rise of oil from $ 62 a year ago is hard to explain as only a matter of supply and demand .
After all , analysts have noted adequate inventories .
Over the same period , the dollar has declined nearly 15 percent against the euro , and the jump in oil prices “ is very much driven by the dollar , ” says Roger Diwan , a managing director at PFC Energy , a consulting firm in Washington .

One of the more interesting bits of news from the National Association of Broadcasters show in Las Vegas this week was from TDVision Systems , which released a special 3D visor two years ago .
Now , the company says that it can project a stereoscopic image using a TV , which will appear in 2D on an ordinary television but in 3D when connected to one of the newer , 3D - capable displays .
The kicker is that the company claims that there is “ no loss in color , resolution or frame rate ” when rendering the 3D technology as 2D , which would mean that 3D movies could be broadcast to the market at large without a specially formatted channel .
Unfortunately , it ’s also a claim that I cannot independently verify .
At the CEDIA show last year , both Samsung and Mitsubishi showed off the next generation in DLP technology : 3D technology .
While the 3D performance was n’t jawdropping , I ’d suspect it would do a passable job rendering Beowulf and other 3D - encoded films .
TDVision said it presented Blu-ray discs encoded using its technology , including a “ dimensionalized ” Star Wars clip .
The real money for the company , however , is selling its devices to studios as an encoding and distribution solution .
TDVision manufactures a 3DP2 camera , which directly encodes recorded video into its native 3D format .
Whether or not the company will succeed , there ’s definite evidence that the studios see 3D as a next - generation technology , if not the saving grace of movie theaters .
DC checkpoint plan latest ' police state ' tactic : Councilman Nick Juliano

Over the last few months , city officials in Washington , DC , have instituted an array of tactics that has civil libertarians fearing the nation 's capital is looking at the Bill of Rights as little more than a suggestion .
The latest proposal from DC 's mayor and police chief would have officers patrolling Soviet - esque checkpoints limiting residents ' ability to travel to and from targeted neighborhoods .
The plan was reported Wednesday in The Examiner : D.C. police will seal off entire neighborhoods , set up checkpoints and kick out strangers under a new program that D.C. officials hope will help them rescue the city from its out - of - control violence .
Under an executive order expected to be announced today , police Chief Cathy L. Lanier will have the authority to designate  Neighborhood Safety Zones . 
At least six officers will man cordons around those zones and demand identification from people coming in and out of them .
Anyone who doesnt live there , work there or have legitimate reason to be there will be sent away or face arrest , documents obtained by The Examiner show .
A city councilman who represents some of the affected neighborhoods -- in the District 's northeast quadrant -- was cautiously optimistic about the proposal 's potential to " crack down on ... open - air drug markets . "
But the local lawmaker , Harry Thomas , did express worries about DC " moving towards a police state . "
Local blog DCist mocked the proposal and its defenders .
" Interim Attorney General Peter Nickles actually said that measures of this sort have ' been used in other cities , ' " the blog noted .
" Which cities are those , Mr. Nickles ?
Warsaw ? "
Libertarian blogger Megan McArdle asked , " Where the hell am I living ? " DC has had a spate of violence recently , and I applaud the police department 's urge to do something .
However , this something seems to follow the logic outlined by Bryan Caplan :
1. Something must be done
2 . This is something
3 . Therefore , this must be done
Crime tears the fabric of society , but so does a government which believes that it may at any time control the movements of its citizens like so many ( presumptively suspicious ) sheep ...
This latest draconian move follows several other recent proposals from DC officials that seemed to look upon individual rights and privacy concerns as little more than afterthoughts .
After outrage from civil liberties and gun-rights groups , DC delayed implementation of one plan that would send police door - to - door in targeted neighborhoods to conduct warrantless searches looking for drugs or guns .
The so - called " safe homes " initiative has not been called off , however , so the local ACLU chapter is holding training sessions to educate people of their rights .
Another plan with Orwellian echos has the District creating a 24 - hour surveillance network that aims to link together and constantly monitor thousands of closed - circuit video cameras distributed throughout the district .
The neighborhood checkpoint plan is scheduled to go into effect next week in the Trinidad neighborhood in northeast DC , according to the mayors office .
A local law school dean who leads DC's ACLU chapter called the idea " cockamamie " and ineffective .
 I think they tried this in Russia and it failed ,  Shelley Broderick told The Examiner .
 It s just our experience in this city that we always end up targeting poor people and people of color , and we treat the kids coming home from choir practice the same as we treat those kids who are selling drugs . 
A YouTube - based political cover / parody act calling itself The Free Bees rewrote the lyrics of the 1970s disco anthem and Saturday Night Fever theme " Stayin ’ Alive " to promote the theory that the tragedy of 9/11 was a home - grown conspiracy .
The song and video ( embedded ) , called " 9/11 ’s a Lie , " kicks off with the lyrics , " Well you can tell by the way the buildings fell / There was something wrong , Now it ’s time to tell . "
The refrain includes : " Whether you ’re a brother or whether you ’re a mother , 9/11 ’s a lie , 9/11 ’s a lie / Neo-cons are shaking , the world has started waking / 9/11 ’s a lie , 9/11 ’s a lie . "
There ’s no official statement yet on how the surviving members of the Bee Gees feel about having their iconic hit rewritten .
The video originates from the opposite side of the political spectrum from the predominantly country - western 9/11 songs commemorating the thousands of dead victims of the terror attacks .
In either case , it ’s safe to say none of the artists involved stopped to ask the husbands , wives , fathers , mothers , sons and daughters — the thousands of shattered , grieving families — how any of them felt about having the day they lost their loved one set to music to promote a political viewpoint .

They blew each other kisses just before Miquelle entered the front door .
West planned to pick her up after school and supervise her homework , just like on any other school day .
But she never made it back .
That morning , federal agents arrested West on charges of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances , making false statements to a bank , money laundering , and aiding and abetting a drug - related murder .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
For a long time — somewhere around twenty years —
I ’ve been unsatisfied with the hit point system of Dungeons and Dragons in all its incarnations over the years .
Initially , combat rounds were a minute long , and every attack in melee combat represented a flurry of attacks and defenses , with successful to - hit rolls representing someone pressing an advantage , wearing down the opponent ’s reserves , and maneuvering the opponent toward a possible killing blow .
Minor lacerations and contusions are assumed to be part of the process , but not really addressed directly .
It was a very abstract system , in general , and in some ways very clearly showed D&D ’s heritage in tactical wargames where “ damage ” was done to a unit that may consist of any number of soldiers ( depending on the unit type ) .
In terms of individual combat , however , the abstract model of battle failed when other combat effects than plain vanilla melee weapon conflicts came into play .
For instance , it did n’t handle when less lethal ( but no less effective ) attacks were used , when ranged weapons such as crossbows and spears entered the mix , and when clearly mismatched weapon types such as a halfling ’s dagger versus a storm giant ’s mattock faced each other .
Suddenly that “ flurry of blows over the course of a minute ” did n’t work so well to suspend disbelief or in some meaningful way represent how battle might actually progress .
Then , of course , the urge for ultra-realism , to varying degrees , started sneaking into the game .
Critical hit tables , combat rounds that were a few seconds long at most , and other more fine - grained approaches to combat became en vogue .
At that point , the “ flurry of blows ” approach completely failed , for essentially every type of attack available .
In general , everybody just ignored the elephant in the room for decades : the complete divorcement from reality of a hit point system , as it is used in D&D .
Other game systems , with essentially no relation to the D&D system at all , have been created that approach combat damage to the individual in a completely different manner .
Some of them even do a very good job of handling wounds and damage , such as the White Wolf multiple - d10 system from the original World of Darkness games ( I have n’t bothered to look closely enough at the new system to see if it ’s substantially the same ) , the quite different multiple - d10 system for 7th Sea , and quite a few others — including probably half a dozen different game systems I ’ve created myself over the years that use general wound categories , anatomical effect charts , accrued stat or action penalties , and other mechanisms for simulating wounds and damage .
Unfortunately , D&D ’s entire high - fantasy flavor is , to some extent , bound up in its hit point system .
This seems like it might doom all D&D games — and D&D - like games , such as the upcoming Pathfinder RPG — to an exercise in selective blindness on the part of game participants .
You simply have to choose willful ignorance of the unrealism of the hit point system to continue enjoying the game , which can work just fine in general , but once in a while I find that it bothers me on some level .
I just have a deep - seated desire for game systems that make sense .
The Unearthed Arcana for D&D 3rd Edition offers some variant damage systems .
One of them uses wound categories , which is great except for some “ minor ” issues that crop up unavoidably :
Your game is no longer compatible with anyone else ’s D&D games , at all .
This may or may not be a problem for you .
Conversion is ponderous and annoying .
The “ feel ” of an authentic D&D game is , sadly , gone .
You might as well just buy a different game ( or create your own ) and play that instead — which , I must admit , I ’ve done from time to time .
In fact , my longest - running game collected so many house rules over the years that it was no longer D&D , having essentially replaced all core rules .
There ’s nothing wrong with that , unless you actually wanted to play D&D .
Another damage system in Unearthed Arcana ( the meat of which is available with some System Reference Document collections online , because UA content was made available under the OGL ) is the Wounds and Vitality system .
In this system , there are actually two types of damage you take in normal combat — Wounds and Vitality ( naturally ) .
Vitality is essentially just your hit points , as normal , but is used to represent minor lacerations and contusions , weariness , increasing distraction and desperation , and other factors that might eventually contribute to making a fatal mistake .
It is determined as normal ; roll your hit dice , and just call it Vitality instead of HP .
Meanwhile , you have a number of Wound Points equal to your Constitution score — and this is the real damage , the stabs and crushing strikes and deep cuts , the broken bones and damaged organs and severed arteries that result from someone fully getting through your guard .
Wounds , under this system , are inflicted in two ways :
If you run out of Vitality points , any further damage goes to your Wounds .
If someone achieves a critical hit , rather than doing extra damage , the normal weapon damage is simply applied to your Wounds total rather than your Vitality total .
There ’s a bit more to it , but this is the fundamental essence of the Wounds / Vitality system .
This introduces many improvements to the way the damage system works in games like D&D and Pathfinder .
Among them :
It ’s possible ( in a reasonable sense of the word “ possible ” ) for a low - level character to kill a high - level character , though still much more difficult than for the high - level character to kill the low - level character .
I ’ve always thought it was ridiculous that , in essence , a first - level character sneaking up on a tenth - level character and stabbing him when he ’s completely unaware of the attack results in what amounts to a cosmetic scratch in the standard hit point system , and this solves that neatly if you allow for an improved chance of critical hits .
Vitality is a lot more believable than hit points , because Vitality serves as a veneer of sorts over Wounds , whereas with hit points there ’s no difference between a critical hit with double max damage resulting in a flesh wound and a minimum - damage hit with a pen knife doing that one final point of damage needed to finish off a character .
They all just do damage to hit points — so you fight at full capacity until you suddenly fall over dead ( or , using negative hit points , fall over and start bleeding to death — not really an improvement ) .
Critical hits that might reduce one fighter ( at first level ) from full health to death and effectively count for nothing against another ( at tenth level ) are no longer a problem .
Instead , critical hits really hurt , no matter who you are , but probably wo n’t kill you outright ( again , no matter who you are ) , unless it ’s a storm giant ’s mattock hitting you or you have a Constitution of 3 or so ( in which case you should be felled by a stiff wind anyway ) .
First - level characters no longer fall over dead at the first mosquito bite that comes their way , while twentieth - level characters have reason to think hard before entering combat , even if they have more than a hundred Vitality points .
No more immediate death any time your first - level wizard takes a hit no matter how weak , and no more shrugging off unexpected magical battle - axe strikes to the forehead with a laugh .
I ’m rather enamored with the concept of the Wounds / Vitality system , in case you could n’t tell , but it needs some work .
As presented in UA , it ’s a trifle underdeveloped .
I think I ’ll address the problems with the Wounds / Vitality system from UA in another SOB entry , along with some ideas about what needs to be changed to address those problems .
This entry has already gotten long enough .

A story appeared on Slashdot about a mysterious fax received at Fermilab written in an unknown code .
The full story is here .
I looked at it and immediately noticed a few things :
1 . The first part looked like ternary ( base 3 ) with digits 1 ( | ) , 2 ( || ) and 3 ( | | | ) .
2 .
The last part looked like binary with digits 1( | ) and 2 ( || ) 3 .
The middle bit looked like either a weird substitution code , or I wondered if it might be machine code .
4 .
In the last part the digit 2 ( || ) never occurs more than once , perhaps it was actually a separator and the last part is not binary .
The first step was to convert the bars into numbers .
Here 's a copy of my marked up print out :
The first part has the numbers ( or at least I thought ) : Noticing this had 113 digits ( which is a prime number ) I went off on a wild goose chase around primes , and then around the interpretation of this number in hexadecimal as a string in ASCII , Unicode or binary ... waste of time .
Then I started thinking about ternary again and wrote down the largest ternary numbers that can be expressed with 1 , 2 , 3 , ... digits :
One of those stood out : with three digits the maximum number is 26 and there are 26 letters in the alphabet !
Then the only question was was how to map the three digits used in the code ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to the three ternary digits ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) .
To simplify things I wrote a small Perl program that tries out all the possible mappings and outputs the ternary interpreted as a string ( with 001 = A , etc . ) :
With my initial interpretation of the top part of the coded message I got the following output : A ha !
The 021 block ( which corresponds to the mapping 3 -> 0 , 2 -> 2 , 1 -> 1 ) seems to have a partial message : [ email protected ] @WOULD and then it 's garbage .
Going back to the original message I realized that 113 is not divisible by three and that I 'd either missed a symbol , or had two too many .
After much fiddling around I discovered that the correct interpretation of the top block is that two of the threes are wrapped from one line to another ( there appears to me some indentation in the message that indicates this , take a look at the original , but this could be just random ) .
Rerunning my Perl program output the full message : So much for the first part .
The second part took me off into Z - 80 , 6502 and 6809 machine code wondering if it was a program and then nowhere .
I still do n't understand what this part is trying to say .
The third part looked initially like binary but on closer examination I decided that the 2s ( || ) were actually separators and the message should be interpreted as number separated by 2s by counting the 1s ( | ) .
That yields : ( Once again there was a wrapping ' problem ' in the message where a run of 8 |s was actually 3 |s then 1 || and 3 more |s . )
Using the little Perl program reveals : So , the same mapping between digits is used .
That leaves some final questions : 1. Who is Frank Shoemaker ?
2 .
Why is base spelt incorrectly ?
3 .
Is the extra S in BASSE a reference to the middle section where three symbols start with S.4 .
If # 3 is correct , then those three symbols could be intepreted as FCwhich is 252 .
Could this be the employee number of the author ?
5 .
Why is the letter A missing from the middle section when all the other hexadecimal digits are there ?
Labels : pseudo - randomness
RALEIGH , N.C. 
The release of the third death row inmate in six months in North Carolina last week is raising fresh questions about whether states are supplying capital - murder defendants with adequate counsel , even as an execution on Tuesday night in Georgia ended a seven - month national suspension .
In all three cases , North Carolina appeals courts found that evidence that would have favored the defendants was withheld from defense lawyers by prosecutors or investigators .
In two of the cases , including that of Levon Jones , who was released on Friday after 14 years on death row , the courts said the defendants ’ lawyers had failed to mount an adequate defense .
Nationwide , Mr. Jones ’s release was the sixth in a year .
John Holdridge , director of the A.C.L.U. Capital Punishment Project , which provided representation for Mr. Jones , said the successful appeals showed that the problem with the death penalty was not the method of execution  the issue ruled on by the Supreme Court last month  but instead “ poor people getting lousy lawyers . ”
“ All these states are gearing up to start executing people again , and nobody seems to be concerned about these systemic problems , ” Mr. Holdridge said .
Using his self - designed AI program , Philip M. Parker has " authored " 200,000 books without ever lifting his pen .
While his work features some self - explanatory medical texts like The Official Patient 's Sourcebook on Acne Rosacea , most of Parker 's publications are 100-300 page industry analysis pieces like DAGENHAM MOTORS GROUP PLC : Labor Productivity Benchmarks and International Gap Analysis .
Parker uses his automated software to do basic market research ( scouring the internet to pull various facts and figures ) , and then to completely assemble the book ( with charts , a full table of contents and plenty of text ) .
Each can take anywhere from 13 minutes to 3 hours .
Here 's a clip in which Parker shows off the process :
While the bulk manufacture of micro niche topic publications is Parker 's current approach , the clip above shows that Parker is very much interested in expanding his system to create things like turn - key game shows in alternate languages — still exploiting niche markets — but this time from the perspective of the entertainment sector , not business / industry .

Technology lets us do things that once seemed like science fiction .
From thoughtless navigation to limitless recollection , machines have made nearly every facet of our lives easier .
But in doing so , have they also taken away skills that were once second - nature ?
An expanding argument suggests the internet and general abundance of technology may , in fact , be making us stupid .
The Atlantic ‘s Nicholas Carr points out how his mind does n’t work the way it used to .
Reading long articles or books , he says , seems like an impossible feat now ; he loses focus after a few pages .
The idea of getting information so quickly and easily has seemingly shifted the way his mind works .
Carr notes how Nietzsche observed changes in his writing style with the advent of the typewriter decades ago .
“ Our writing equipment takes part in the forming of our thoughts , ” he is quoted as writing .
So could our brains again be evolving , so to speak , as a result of our dependence on modern technology ?
There ’s certainly evidence to suggest some kind of change .
A scientific study conducted a couple years ago found the ability to remember personal information — anything from a birthday to a phone number — is significantly lower in younger people who have grown up with cell phones and computers than in members of previous generations .
I ’m sure I ’m not the only one who ’s seen the effect firsthand : I used to know the phone number of every friend , relative , and business I called with any level of frequency .
Nowadays ?
Not so much .
Outside of a few basics , I ’ve inadvertently moved from storing the information in my brain to archiving it in my Outlook Contacts list .
Memory may not be the only function affected , either .
An ABC News report out this week suggests the sudden ubiquity of GPS technology may be causing us to lose our senses of direction , as well as our drives to explore unknown terrain .
The question that remains , then , is if there is a true physiological shift as a result of all of this .
Is technology actually making us stupid ?
Are we losing brain functionality with every previously mind - driven task we farm out to a machine ?
Science does n’t have a definite answer yet , but maybe you do .
The floor is open to discussion — unless , that is , your short attention span and limited memory capacity have already caused you to drift away .

Last week , video surfaced of an August 2007 town hall meeting featuring Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski ( D - PA ) , in which the Congressman said that Democrats “ stretched the facts ” about their ability to stop the Iraq war during the 2006 election season .
The 31 - second You Tube video is available here .
Here is an imperfect transcript of the Congressman ’s controversial remarks :
I ’ll tell you my impression .
We really in this last election – when I say we [ I mean ] the Democrats – I think pushed it as far as we can to the end of the fleet – did n’t say it , but we implied it – that if we won the congressional elections , we could stop the war .
Now anybody who was a good student of government would know that was n’t true .
But , you know , the temptation to want to win back the Congress , we sort of stretched the facts , and people ate it up .
This short clip was posted by a user called “ PAWatchter , ” who joined You Tube on May 22 , 2008 .
The video was posted on May 23 , and by Sunday it had been viewed over 30,000 times .
The remarks are taken out of context , so it ’s not clear what exact question Kanjorski was responding to .
Luckily , there exists an extended video on You Tube of the very same town hall meeting .
This video is almost eight minutes long , and was posted in September 2007 , just one month after the town hall occurred .
With context intact , it appears that Kanjorski was responding to a question about the feasibility of impeaching President Bush when he admitted that Democrats “ stretched the facts ” about stopping the Iraq war .
Kanjorski went on to acknowledge that Democrats would pay a price when “ we over - promise , or mis-promise , what could happen . ”
The eight - minute version of Kanjorski ’s remarks has been viewed just over 800 times in eight months .
Advertisements
So “ PAWatcher ” edited Kanjorski’s “ stretched the facts ” comment into handy soundbite form , making it easily digestible for internet news watchers .
Thus Kanjorski was compelled to issue a statement on Friday about his months - old remarks :
“ In an August 2007 town meeting , I shared the frustration of my constituents that the war in Iraq continued , ” he said .
“ I expressed my belief that some Democrats in 2006 overestimated the ability of a single house of Congress to end the war , particularly in the face of an intransigent President and Senate Republicans who are committed to continuing the war . ”
Despite this clarification , the central point that Democrats “ stretched the facts ” about their desire to end the war in Iraq is self - evidently true .
In 2007 , tens of thousands of additional troops were sent to Iraq as part of Gen. David Petraeus ’ counterinsurgency strategy , with only rhetorical opposition from Democrats .
Just before Christmas , the U.S. House approved $ 70 billion in war funding for 2008 as part of a $ 555 billion spending bill .
House Democrats have not made serious efforts to pass a timetable for troop withdrawals , or establish mandatory legislative benchmarks that the Iraqi parliament must achieve .
Presumptive Democrat presidential nominee Barack Obama has made ending the Iraq war one of his central campaign themes .
However , Obama has also repeatedly said that as Commander in Chief he will evaluate the situation on the ground , and consult with military commanders before making any changes to our force structure .
Could Obama be over - promising – or even mis-promising – about his ability to end the war in Iraq ?
As Kanjorski pointed out , that strategy was a winner in the 2006 elections .
Most of the stars in the universe will end their lives as white dwarfs , the class of star thatâ€™s just a remnant of the starâ€™s former self when all the nuclear fuel in the starâ€™s core has burned .
Studying these white dwarfs gives astronomers an important view of the endpoint of most stars .
Recently , researchers from the University of Texas have confirmed the existence of a new type of dwarf star , a â€œpulsating carbon white dwarf.â€ 
Since pulsating stars can reveal the inner workings of these stars , astronomers are hoping now to be able to learn more about what goes on inside white dwarf stars .
Until recently , astronomers knew of only two types of white dwarf stars : those that have an outer layer of hydrogen ( about 80 percent ) , and about those with an outer layer of helium ( about 20 percent ) , whose hydrogen shells have somehow been stripped away .
Then in 2007 , a third type was discovered , a very rare â€œhot carbon white dwarf.â€ 
These stars have had both their hydrogen and helium shells stripped off , leaving their carbon layer exposed .
After these new carbon white dwarfs were announced , Michael H. Montgomery from the University of Texas calculated that pulsations in these stars were possible .
Similar to how geologists study seismic waves from earthquakes to understand what goes on in Earthâ€™s interior astronomers can study the changes in light from a pulsating star to â€œlookâ€ into the starâ€™s interior .
In fact , this type of star - study is called â€œasteroseismology .â€ 
Montgomery and his team began a systematic study of carbon white dwarfs with the Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory , looking for pulsators .
They discovered a pulsating star about 800 light - years away in the constellation Ursa Major , ( called SDSS J142625.71+575218.3 ) fits the into this category .
Its light intensity varies regularly by nearly two percent about every eight minutes .
“ The discovery that one of these stars is pulsating is remarkably important , ” said National Science Foundation astronomer Michael Briley .
“ This will allow us to probe the white dwarf ’s interior , which in turn should help us solve the riddle of where the carbon white dwarfs come from and what happens to their hydrogen and helium . ”
The star lies about ten degrees east northeast of Mizar , the middle star in the handle of the Big Dipper .
This white dwarf has about the same mass as our Sun , but its diameter is smaller than Earthâ€™s .
The star has a temperature of 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit ( 19,500 C ) , and is only 1/600th as bright as the Sun .

Cooling Data Centers Could Prevent Massive Electrical Waste
June 27th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
It is estimated that the data storage sector consumed about 61 billion kilowatt - hours ( kWh ) in 2006 ( 1.5 % of total U.S. consumption , or roughly equivalent to the amount consumed by 5.8 million average U.S. households ) .
These numbers are only expected to grow .
The energy used by the nation ’s servers and data centers is growing at an unsustainable rate .
Not only that , but web servers are notoriously inefficient .
For example , computer servers are used at only 6 percent of their capacity on average , while data center facilities operate at roughly 65 % to 75 % efficiency , meaning that 25 % to 35 % of all the energy consumed by servers is wasted ( converted to heat ) .
If we are to even consider reducing our energy consumption and carbon footprint , the growing demands generated by our web servers must be near the top of the list of possible improvements .
And the Department of Energy agrees .
Researchers at DOE ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) in Washington and National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) in Colorado are hard at work figuring out ways to make our data storage infrastructure more efficient by running them at lower temperatures .
The technology exists to achieve efficiencies of 80 % to 90 % in conventional server power supplies .
Moving this heat source away from the server allows the cooling efforts to be focused on the computing elements .
Alternative Cooling Approaches
Evolutionary progress is being made with conventional air cooling techniques that are known for their reliability .
Current investigation focuses on novel heat sinks and fan technologies with the aim to improve contact surface , conductivity , and heat transfer parameters .
One of the most effective air cooling options is Air Jet Impingement .
The design and manufacturing of nozzles and manifolds for jet impingement is relatively simple .
The same benefits that apply to Air Jet Impingement are exhibited in Liquid Impingement technologies .
In addition , liquid cooling offers higher heat transfer coefficients as a tradeoff for higher design and operation complexity .
One of the most interesting liquid cooling technologies are microchannel heat sinks in conjunction with micropumps because the channels can be manufactured in the micrometer range with the same process technologies used for electronic devices .
Liquid metal cooling , used in cooling reactors , is starting to be an interesting alternative for high - power - density micro devices .
Large heat transfer coefficients are achieved by circulating the liquid with hydroelectric or hydromagnetic pumps .
The pumping circuit is reliable because no moving parts , except for the liquid itself , are involved in the cooling process .
Heat transfer efficiency is also increased by high conductivity .
The low heat capacity of metals leads to less stringent requirements for heat exchangers .
Heat extraction with liquids can be increased by several orders of magnitude by exploiting phase changes .
Heat pipes and Thermosyphons exploit the high latent heat of vaporization to remove large quantities of heat from the evaporator section .
The circuits are closed by either capillary action in the case of heat pipes or gravity in the case of Thermosyphons .
These devices are therefore very efficient but are limited in their temperature range and heat flux capabilities .
Thermoelectric Coolers have the ability to provide localized spot cooling , an important capability in modern processor design .
Research in this area focuses on improving materials and distributing control of TEC arrays such that the efficiency over the whole chip improves .
Capturing Waste Heat
Reusing the waste heat from a data center may not make the server room itself more efficient , but depending on how heat is reused , it can save a company a significant sum of money .
In its report to Congress last year on data center energy consumption , the federal Environmental Protection Agency suggested the practice .
And the idea has gained traction , according to Mark Fontecchio of SearchDataCenter.com .
For example , in Winnipeg , Canada a media company called , Quebecor , efforts have been made to take the heat from the 2,500 - square - foot data center on the ground floor and use it to heat other parts of the building .
Because of the cool Winnipeg climate , engineers decided to make use of that cool air by installing air - side economizers that draw in outside air .
The economizers include baffles that open to varying degrees depending on the outside temperature and how much cooling the data center needs .
After the air cycles through the approximately 100 eight - way servers , it warms up in the process .
It then goes into an overhead plenum , where about 10 % of the air is re-circulated to warm the outside air that comes into the data center .
Another duct out of the exhaust plenum to the intake duct of the editorial office upstairs .
Quebecor also added a second thermostat to its editorial offices ; the first controls the traditional heating furnaces .
That whole process used up another 60 % of the waste heat .
The data center dumps the remaining 30 % into the adjacent warehouse .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
In aggregate , Morgan Stanley reduced its estimates for 2008 large bank earnings by $ 17 billion , or 26 percent , and reduced 2009 forecasts by $ 13 billion , or 15 percent .
The analysts expect higher loan losses and expenses , offset by higher net interest income , though profits could fall further still if the Federal Reserve stops lowering interest rates .
" More capital hikes and dividend cuts ( are ) coming as our credit deteriorates and forward earnings decline , " analysts led by Betsy Graseck wrote in a report .
" We think we are only in the third inning of the credit cycle and expect this credit cycle will be worse than ( the slump in ) 1990 - 91 . "
A growing number of investors , and industry executives including Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack , in recent weeks have predicted markets are closer to the end of the current mortgage and corporate credit crisis than to the beginning .
These more upbeat comments , and recent efforts by banks to bolster their balance sheets , helped spark a rebound in bank stocks last week .
Morgan Stanley 's top " long " picks have less credit sensitivity or better capital structures : Bank of New York , JPMorgan Chase and PNC Financial Group .
By contrast , investors should " underweight " banks with greater exposure to mortgages -- Wells Fargo and Wachovia -- and those that operate in harder hit sections of the United States -- Fifth Third Bancorp and KeyCorp .
Morgan Stanley also called for underweighting Citigroup citing its exposure to risky assets relative to common equity .

I consider Dr. Slammy one of those thoughtful bloggers that any / all can gain from reading and considering .
Yesterday , he sent An open letter to Progressive America .
This piece , very worth reading , lays out Dr. Slammy ’s regret for his non-vote in 2000 .
I ’d like to begin with a confession : I did n’t vote in 2000 .
It ’s the only presidential election since I turned 18 that I ’ve sat out , and I ’m more than embarrassed about it .
It remains one of the biggest mistakes of my political life , and that ’s saying something .
The fact that my participation would n’t have made any difference ( I lived in Massachusetts at the time ) affords no solace , nor should it .
I was stupid .
I fucked up .
Period .
Dr Slammy then looks back on how the world and US government might have been different with Al Gore in the Oval Office .
He makes a powerful appeal for all Clinton and all Obama supporters to understand the clear difference between a choice between the Democratic candidate ( whichever it might be ) come November and John McCain .
Dr Slammy considers a raft of issues and seeks to highlight the stark choice before us / the US :
What about McCain , though ?
He voted in favor of waterboarding – after repeatedly calling it torture ?!
He not only supported the invasion of Iraq , he supports staying there for a thousand more years .
He also promises that there will be more wars .
He supports repealing Roe v. Wade .
He voted no on a $ 100 M initiative to reduce teen pregnancy by education & contraceptives .
He ’s rated 0 % by NARAL , indicating a pro-life voting record .
He ’s rated 83 % by the Christian Coalition , indicating a strongly ( euphemism alert ) “ pro-family ” voting record .
A powerful statement , a powerful appeal for seeking unity post - primaries , to understand the starkness of the choice before us and the US .
And , a raft of serious issues .
A raft of serious issues with a very serious gap .
Where is the environment in Dr Slammy ’s discussion ?
Absent !
Where is Global Warming ?
Absent !
Where is energy ?
Absent !
These absent issues are critical for our future .
These absent issues are arenas of substantive and very meaningful differences between Hillary / Barack / the Democratic Party and John / the GOP ( Greedy Old Polluters ) on the other .
And , these are arenas where John McCain ’s tenuous hold on reality and deceptive “ Straight Talk ” create an appearance of reasonableness on McCain ’s part not matched by his reality .
And , it is critical to highlight the reality of these differences so that when Hillary or Barack enter the Oval Office next January ( with 61 Democratic Party Senators ) , there is a clear mandate for substantive change when it comes to US government policies in these arenas .
Looking back over the past 7 + years , is it hard to see that Al Gore would have pursued energy , environmental , and global warming issues as incompetently and disastrously as we ’ve seen from the Bush - Cheney ( mal ) Administration .
Energy Task
Force dominated by people from fossil fuel industries ; tax cuts favoring polluting over renewable energy ; regulatory support for mountain top removal ; failure to enforce existing laws and regulations ; etc â€¦ Would Gore have assigned rabid foxes to guard the hen houses of America ?
While I could spend millions of words speaking to the past seven years , the issue of import is looking forward .
There are fundamental differences between Obama and / or Clinton , on the one hand , and McCain , on the other , when it comes to energy concepts , global warming , and environmental issues .
Sadly , however , these fundamental differences are too often obscured by the McCain “ Straight Talk Express ” which translates into a Dirty Energy Twisted Non-Action Machine when it comes to the real world .
John McCain gets much credit for his Straight Talk when it comes to Global Warming , speaking tough even in the face of a Republican Party that seems determine to reject reality .
The Republican Base seems to trust their hatred of Al Gore more than what the data , science , and the weather all around us ( US ) say to those focused on reality - based policy - making .
McCain , however , is on the record as to the need to invest in renewable power to deal with Global Warming , even in face of special - interest opposition .
Yet â€¦ yet â€¦ repeatedly â€¦ when given the opportunity to take action to go along with his Green Straight Talk Express , John McCain has boarded the Black Twisted Action Delay Machine and help inhibit ( rather than help ) a move toward an Energy Smart future .
He has studiously avoided being present for votes that might have made his “ Straight Talk ” into reality , votes where his absence doomed action on renewable power .
McCain received a zero ( yes , a big 0 ) from the League of Conservation Voters ( LCV ) in their 2007 scorecard .
Clinton a 73 and Obama a 67 .
While not a perfect judge of their records , this is a pretty clear statement of some serious differences as to how these candidates have acted in the Congressional careers .
And , the traditional media has been complicit , far too often , in the blurring of the fundamental differences .
USA Today reports favorably on McCain and environmental issues …
“ I want to compete in California , ” the Arizona senator said Monday , saying his outlook on such issues as the environment will be a help in the traditionally blue state .
… while failing to note that McCain has a “ lifetime score of 24 percent from the League of Conservation Voters . ”
Or , how about The Washington Post ’s blurring of the differences when it comes to Global Warming ?
In contrast to President Bush , the next president will not start as a skeptic about the danger posed by global warming , and he or she will favor , not resist , legislation to impose mandatory caps on greenhouse gases , even without an international agreement binding other nations .
Yes , according to the Post , there is no meaningful difference and we are to cheer that McCain has enough of a sense of reality that he is not a global warming denier .
In fact , a key element of the Republican “ win ” strategy will be to figure out how not to anger those living in the Black Hole of Denial on Global Warming while seeking to get buy in from those who live in the reality - based world that John McCain is somehow reasonable on Global Warming and energy issues .
Yes , McCain will state that Global Warming matters , that we require green technologies .
But he wo n’t be bothered to show up to vote for them .
( As did Clinton and Obama . )
McCain will speak of how polluters are obstructing progress :
Special interests .
It ’s the special interests .
It ’s the utility companies and the petroleum companies and other special interests .
They ’re the ones that have blocked progress in the Congress of the United States and the administration .
That ’s a little straight talk .
Yet , when given the opportunity , he wo n’t show up to vote on bills that those “ special interests ” oppose .
( As did Obama and Clinton . ) Presidential Candidate Obama is promising serious action on energy and global warming issues .
Presidential Candidate Obama has laid out energy policies that will enrich the United States , lower oil imports , and improve our health while helping turn the tide on global warming .
Presidential Candidate Obama has a policy construct that targets 80 % reductions in US CO2 emissions by 2050 , in line with science .
And â€¦
Presidential Candidate Clinton is promising serious action on energy and global warming issues .
Presidential Candidate Clinton has laid out energy policies that will enrich the United States , lower oil imports , and improve our health while helping turn the tide on global warming .
Presidential Candidate Clinton has a policy construct that targets 80 % reductions in US CO2 emissions by 2050 , in line with science .
And â€¦
Presidential Candidate McCain is talking of some action related to energy and global warming , with a voluntary target of 60 % reduction by 2050 , a level that scientists conclude will create a ( far ) greater chance of catastrophic climate change with massive implications economically , for national security , for the habitability of the planet .
And â€¦
Just as there were quite serious energy and environmental policy and philosophy differences between Presidential Candidates Al Gore and George W Bush , there are quite serious differences between Presidential Candidates Obama / Clinton and John McCain .
We cannot allow McCain ’s misleading Straight Talk Express to nowhere to go unanswered , to allow RNC greenwashing to confuse the issues .
Guest Post from A Siegel , Energy Smart and Chair , Energize America .
AS AN economic storyline , inflation has lost some of its glamour over the past few months , making room for financial collapse , looming recession , and continued pain in housing markets .
That does n't mean it 's gone away , or that continued price increases wo n't create a serious problem for the Federal Reserve and the broader economy somewhere down the road .
I have watched the numbers roll upward on the sign at my neighbourhood petrol station for ages now .
But , in keeping with the language common in price index press releases , the rise in goods costs did n't much extend beyond that .
In just the past week , however , my local coffee and sandwich shops , independent of each other , adopted across the board price hikes .
When I discovered the jump at the first business , I was irked .
When I learned of the increase at the second , I shrugged and concluded that this would be the way of things for the near future .
In other words , my expectations adjusted , and I 'm not the only one experiencing such a shift in perception .
As consumers get more used to the idea of price increases , other businesses will realise that they , too , can get away with a hike without suffering much in the way of consumer blowback .
Recession or no , consumers will only stomach so many increases in prices before demanding wage increases to compensate .
Employers may well grant them , concluding that they can make up the expense by raising their prices , a practice consumers will have come to expect and accept .
And on the spiral goes .
Eventually , these expectations will have to be wrung out of the system .
That will mean an increase in interest rates and yet another economic slowdown .
At the moment , of course , the Federal Reserve rightly feels that it cannot afford to take such measures , given the fragility of the economy and the financial system .
But the problem is growing , and the longer the central bank waits to deal with it , the more painful will be the squeeze at the end .

The Project : Overview page has more details .
Emphasis on variety .
No ports of old NES , Super NES , Genesis , etc. games .
# 10 TMNT ( Ubisoft )
Ubisoft released several different games on various systems to tie into the TMNT movie .
This is the only one that anyone liked and it ’s easy to see why .
The sprites are very sharp and colorful but it ’s the gameplay that people will embrace : it ’s basically an extension and improvement on the old Konami beat - em-ups .
Now there are many more moves at your disposal and even an experience system .
#9 GUNSTAR SUPER HEROES ( Treasure / SEGA )
Sequel to the classic Gunstar Heroes on Genesis .
The gameplay is largely the same .
Many of the characters are the same .
Great game but maybe a bit too familiar .
For the unfamiliar , it ’s like a wacky , cartoon Contra .
But not like Metal Slug .
Deeper , crazier , more sci-fi !
#8 MARIO VS .
DONKEY KONG ( Nintendo STC / Nintendo )
This is a sequel to the old Donkey Kong game on Game Boy .
In other words , it ’s a platformer with very heavy puzzle elements .
The graphics are very different , though , going with a DKC - ish pre-rendered look .
Lots of Mario enemies are used throughout , like Shy Guys but something about the game just does n’t feel very Mario-ish .
There are many , many levels in this game .
And when you beat the boss , there ’s basically a new game ’s worth of levels to play , with another final boss to boot .
# 7 MARIO KART SUPER CIRCUIT ( Intelligent Systems / Nintendo )
It actually plays very much like the original Mario Kart on SNES but it attempts have a more 3D look , even using the character designs from Mario Kart 64 .
It features all 20 tracks from the original game plus 20 brand new tracks .
There ’s a LOT of racing to do with 3 speed settings on each of those tracks .
It ’s as solid as ever .
#6 SABRE WULF ( Rare / THQ )
Even though Microsoft bought Rare from Nintendo in 2001 , they still allowed Rare to develop games for Nintendo handhelds , an unusual situation .
This is the best of the games that resulted from that arrangement .
The main character is great , as he ’s a totally unrelatable , uninteresting 19th - century - style British explorer .
Basically , you have a bunch of make - believe animals that have different abilities that you capture and then use to make your way through various levels in order to steal some treasure from the Sabre Wulf .
At that point each level becomes a very fast - paced action platformer as you attempt to renegotiate the same terrain back the way you came with the wolf hot on your heelz .
# 5 THE LEGEND OF ZELDA : THE MINISH CAP ( Capcom / Nintendo )
The last of the Zelda games that Nintendo asked / allowed Capcom to develop .
It uses the same sprites and game engine as the “ Four Swords ” bonus game on the GBA version of A Link to the Past .
It ’s a fun adventure with some nice equipment .
You kan shrink !
# 4 SONIC ADVANCE 3 ( Dimps / Sonic Team / SEGA )
There were three Sonic Advance games for GBA with surprising differences between them .
This game wins the spot on the list because of its length and depth .
It also introduces the semi-interesting idea of choosing a pair from the available characters to enter each level .
The pair will have different abilities depending on the combination .
The Sonic Advance games have a graphical style that reminds me more of Super Mario Bros. than the classic Genesis Sonic titles .
# 3 WARIO LAND 4 ( Nintendo )
Eight years later , there still has n’t been another Wario Land game so I guess this was the swan song but you could n’t have asked for a better one .
It ’s basicaly the perfect synthesis of Mario style action and Metroid - style exploration .
And then came Wario Ware and ruined everything !
# 2 METROID FUSION ( Nintendo )
This is a great game for several reasons , one of those being that it does n’t attempt to simply ape the earlier games .
It ’s definitely more linear than its predecessors but change can be good .
This time around there ’s a lot of drama and scripted moments that create some real tension .
There ’s a real story throughout and it ’s a decent one .
Pretty boss .
# 1 CASTLEVANIA : CIRCLE OF THE MOON ( Koncami CEK / Konami )
This was the 1st Castlevania game on GBA and also the 2nd - ever ‘ Metroidvania ’ - style game .
The reason why this entry gets the top spot over the Castlevania on GBA is that it ’s the only one that captures the hardcore elements of the pre-1997 Castlevanias .
Several of the bosses in this game are just goddamned hard .
You may have to try several times or run around leveling up to get past them .
There ’s also an interesting , card - based magic system .
Occasionally enemies will drop a card that has a spell or part of one .
Combining different cards will have interesting results and provides for interesting experimentation .

Watch that 's back from the seabed ...
And it 's still working , after 67 years
The last time Teddy Bacon saw his expensive gold watch it was sinking down into the harbour in Gibraltar .
That was in 1941 , and the watch had slipped off his wrist when Lieutenant Bacon threw a line to shore from his ship , HMS Repulse .
After two divers failed to find his lost treasure , the young officer gave up on ever seeing it again .
Veteran Teddy Bacon is thrilled to be reunited with his watch 67 years later
But 67 years later , it turned up on his doormat - still ticking .
The Bulova Automatic , wrapped in a brown paper bag , did not seem at all the worse for wear after decades on the ocean floor .
The timepiece had been discovered by workers dredging the harbour in 2007 , who scooped it up with other debris in their machine .
Still is working order : The Bulova watch
Because the deputy harbourmaster in 1941 had made a log with a description of the watch and its approximate location , staff knew who it belonged to .
So they posted it back to the address Lieutenant Bacon had left for them on a scrap of paper all those years ago .
After being redirected from his many former homes it eventually landed on the doormat of his house in Tarvin , Cheshire .
' To say I was stunned could be considered a major understatement , ' said Mr Bacon , a widower and father of four who is almost 90 .
' It truly was a miracle that I had been reunited with that watch after a lifetime .
' Now I wear it every day and it keeps perfect time , even after all those years in the water .
It is absolutely excellent and I consider it a long - lost friend . '
Lieutenant Bacon bought the watch in the Azores for 55 dollars on his way to Singapore as part of a fleet sent to counter the Japanese invasion , and was wearing it in Gibraltar .
He said : ' I was showing one of the sailors how to throw a line to shore and I remember , as clear as day , seeing the watch sail off my wrist and disappear into the water .
' I was pretty annoyed about it and two divers attached to the flotilla went down to have a look for it but could not see it .
' So I went to the deputy harbourmaster and left a full description , location and probable depth of around 40ft and left it at that .
Obviously I did n't expect to see it again . '
He continued on to Singapore where he narrowly escaped with his life when Repulse was sunk during an attack by Japanese planes .
Teddy Bacon was on HMS Repulse when he lost his watch
After the war Mr Bacon continued his nautical career with his family 's shipping brokerage and is now enjoying his retirement .
Francis Cantos , a spokesman for the Gibraltar Government , said : ' It just goes to illustrate the special and enduring relationship between the Royal Navy and Gibraltar . '
Do We Really Need a Few Billion Locavores ?
We made some ice cream at home last weekend .
Someone had given one of the kids an ice cream maker a while ago and we finally got around to using it .
We decided to make orange sherbet .
It took a pretty long time and it did n’t taste very good but the worst part was how expensive it was .
We spent about $ 12 on heavy cream , half - and - half , orange juice , and food coloring — the only ingredient we already had was sugar — to make a quart of ice cream .
For the same price , we could have bought at least a gallon ( four times the amount ) of much better orange sherbet .
In the end , we wound up throwing away about three - quarters of what we made .
Which means we spent $ 12 , not counting labor or electricity or capital costs ( somebody bought the machine , even if we did n’t ) for roughly three scoops of lousy ice cream .
As we ’ve written before , it is a curious fact of modern life that one person ’s labor is another ’s leisure .
Every day there are millions of people who cook and sew and farm for a living — and there are millions more who cook ( probably in nicer kitchens ) and sew ( or knit or crochet ) and farm ( or garden ) because they love to do so .
Is this sensible ?
If people are satisfying their preferences , who cares if it costs them $ 20 to produce a single cherry tomato ( or $ 12 for a few scoops of ice cream ) ?
This is the question that came to mind the other day when we received an e-mail from a reader named Amy Kormendy :
I emailed Michael Pollan recently to ask him this question , and nice guy that he is , he promptly answered “ Good question , I do n’t really know ” and suggested I pose it to you good folks :
Would n’t it be more resource - intensive for us all to raise our own food , than if we paid an expert to raise lots of food that s/he could sell to us ?
Could n’t it therefore be more sustainable to purchase food from large professional producers ?
We ’re taught that the invention of division of labor gives us a more efficient way to use resources on a societal scale .
I love gardening , but it takes me more time and overall investment to get inferior produce to what I could buy from a professional farmer nearby .
Similarly , a friend once attempted to sew a skirt for herself .
Adding up the time and energy to visit the store , select and buy the fabric & pattern , go home and measure , cut , and stitch , she says the skirt cost her $ 200 , resulted in lots of wasted fabric , and she stitched the hem crooked .
“ I could have bought a better skirt for $ 50 at Nordstrom , ” she said — her experiment in self - sufficiency was a bigger overall resource hog than the conventional supply chain to her local retailer .
So , some of Professor Pollan ’s advice seems to be that we would be better off as a society if we did more for ourselves ( especially growing our own food ) .
But I ca n’t help but think that the economies of scale and division of labor inherent in modern industrial agriculture would still render the greatest efficiencies in resource investment .
The extra benefit of growing your own food only works out if you count the unquantifiables such as the sense of accomplishment , learning , exercise , suntan , etc .
I very much understand the locavore instinct .
To eat locally grown food or , even better , food that you ’ve grown yourself , seems as if it should be 1 ) more delicious ; 2 ) more nutritious ; 3 ) cheaper ; and 4 ) better for the environment .
But is it ?
1 ) “ Deliciousness ” is subjective .
But one obvious point is that no one person can grow or produce all the things she would like to eat .
As a kid who grew up on a small farm , I can tell you that after I had my fill of corn and asparagus and raspberries , all I really wanted was a Big Mac .
2 ) There ’s a lot to be said for the nutritional value of home - grown food .
But again , since one person can grow only so much variety , there are bound to be big nutritional gaps in her diet that will need to be filled in .
3 ) Is it cheaper to grow your own food ?
It ’s not impossible but , as my little ice cream story above illustrates , there are huge inefficiencies at work here .
Pretend that instead of just me making ice cream last weekend , it was all 100 people who live in my building .
Now we ’ve collectively spent $ 1,200 to each have a few scoops of ice cream .
Let ’s say you decide to plant a big vegetable garden this year to save money .
Now factor in everything you need to buy to make it happen — the seeds , fertilizer , sprout cups , twine , tools , etc. — along with the transportation costs and the opportunity cost .
Are you sure you really saved money by growing your own zucchini and corn ?
And what if 1,000 of your neighbors did the same ?
Or here ’s another , non -food example : building your own home from scratch versus buying a prefab home .
With a site - built home , you need to invest in all the tools , material , labor , and transportation costs to make it happen , and the myriad inefficiencies of having dozens of workmen ’s pickup trucks retrace the same route hundreds of times all for the sake of erecting one family ’s home — whereas factory - built homes like these create the opportunity for huge efficiencies by bundling labor , materials , transportation , etc .
4 ) But growing your own food has to be good for the environment , right ?
Well , keeping in mind the transportation inefficiencies mentioned above , consider the “ food miles ” argument and a recent article in Environmental Science and Technology by Christopher L. Weber and H. Scott Matthews of Carnegie - Mellon :
We find that although food is transported long distances in general ( 1640 km delivery and 6760 km life - cycle supply chain on average ) the GHG emissions associated with food are dominated by the production phase , contributing 83 % of the average U.S. household ’s 8.1 t CO2e / yr footprint for food consumption .
Transportation as a whole represents only 11 % of life - cycle GHG emissions , and final delivery from producer to retail contributes only 4 % .
Different food groups exhibit a large range in GHG - intensity ; on average , red meat is around 150 % more GHG - intensive than chicken or fish .
Thus , we suggest that dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average household ’s food - related climate footprint than “ buying local . ”
Shifting less than one day per week ’s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken , fish , eggs , or a vegetable - based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food .
This is a pretty strong argument against the perceived environmental and economic benefits of locavore behavior — mostly because Weber and Matthews identify the fact that is nearly always overlooked in such arguments : specialization ( which Michael Pollan mostly dislikes , and which has been around for a long , long time ) is ruthlessly efficient .
Which means less transportation , lower prices — and , in most cases , far more variety , which in my book means more deliciousness and more nutrition .
The same store where I blew $ 12 on ice cream ingredients will happily sell me ice cream in many flavors , dietetic options , and price points .
Whereas I am now stuck with about 99 % of the food coloring I bought , which will probably sit in the cupboard until I die ( hopefully not soon ) .

Homeless people living in cars and motorhomes across the US are being joined by a new breed : the middle class .
As mortgage foreclosures continue to rise , growing numbers of middle - class professionals are losing their homes and downsizing from four bedrooms to four wheels .
With numbers rising , New Beginnings , a homeless agency in Santa Barbara , California , has launched a safe parking scheme , whose aim is to provide a refuge of sorts for those who have nowhere to go other than their vehicle .
Guy Trevor lost his job as an interior designer when the sector contracted thanks to the foreclosure crisis .
With his furniture sold and his belongings in storage , he now lives in his car , spending the nights in one of the 12 gated car parks in Santa Barbara run by New Beginnings .
" I see myself as a casualty of a perfect storm , " he said .
" The people sleeping at the [ car parks ] are ... just like me .
They come from normal , everyday homes .
I think a lot of people in this country do n't realise that they , too , are a couple of pay cheques away from destitution . "
In normally affluent Santa Barbara there were 150 foreclosures last month , with a total of 800 for the year ending in May , according to the county assessor 's office , which assesses property for tax purposes .
Each month , an auction of foreclosed properties is held on the steps of the Santa Barbara courthouse .
" The way the economy is going , it 's amazing the people who are becoming homeless .
It 's hit the middle class , " Nancy Kapp , of New Beginnings , told CNN .
Another of Kapp 's clients , Barbara Harvey , 67 , also lost her job and subsequently her home thanks to the foreclosure crisis .
As with Trevor , her job as a loans processor was connected to the housing market .
Harvey now lives with her three dogs in her car , parking at night in a women - only car park run by the agency .
" I did n't think this would happen to me , " she said .
" It 's just something that I do n't think that people think is going to happen to them . "
The rise in the number of homeless people sleeping in cars has led to a clampdown in Los Angeles .
In common with many US cities , it is illegal to live in vehicles on public streets .
This year the city banned almost all overnight parking on residential streets .
A first violation receives a $ 50 ( £ 25 ) fine , while subsequent offences carry fines of up to $ 100 .
" For more working class and lower middle class people , the car is the first stop of being homeless , and sometimes it turns out to be a long stop , " Gary Blasi , a University of California , Los Angeles , law professor and homelessness activist told the Associated Press .
The city has the highest number of homeless people in the US , with an estimated 73,000 living rough .
A survey last year of more than 3,000 of them showed that 250 were sleeping in their cars .
Pickens ' Panhandle wind project orders 667 turbines
Mesa Power , controlled by billionaire investor Boone Pickens , ordered 667 wind turbines from General Electric Co. to begin a $ 10 billion wind - farm project in Texas that will be the nation 's largest .
Delivery of the equipment will begin in mid-2010 , Dallas - based Mesa said today in a statement .
When completed in 2014 , the Pampa Wind Project in northern Texas will be capable of producing 4,000 megawatts , the company said .
That 's enough power for about 1.2 million average U.S. homes .
Abundant wind , open land , federal tax credits and rising electricity prices have made Texas the largest U.S. producer of electricity from wind .
Mesa 's Pampa Wind Project would almost double that generating capacity .
Royal Dutch Shell Plc has proposed a 3,000 - megawatt wind project in the state .
``Such gigawatt - size projects are evidence of the strong interest in investing in wind power , to take advantage of vast , windy land in the U.S. , '' Christine Real de Azua , a spokeswoman for the Washington - based American Wind Energy Association , said in an e-mail .
The wind turbines ordered from GE for the $ 2 billion first phase of the Pampa Wind Project will be capable of producing a total of 1,000 megawatts , Mesa said .
A megawatt of wind - power is enough for 300 average U.S. homes , according to the association .
Mesa has yet to obtain rights - of - way for a $ 2 billion power line that will deliver the wind - farm 's output to the Texas power grid , Pickens said an interview on CNBC .
The farm will be constructed on leased property in Carson , Gray , Hemphill , Roberts and Wheeler counties , where landowners will receive annual royalties , Mesa said .
``We've had a great response to this project , '' Pickens said in the statement .
``Landowners and local officials understand the economic benefits . ''

US Senator Norm Coleman ( Republican , MN ) is up to his hypocritical antics , again .
After the entire wing of the Republican Party ridiculed Al Franken ( Democrat , MN ) for his recent tax troubles , Norm stepped up to the plate and should have silenced his crowd .
Norm Coleman 's DC residence is a 10 foot by 10 foot room in a friend 's basement ; but that 's only half the story .
The other half , Norm has n't been paying his monthly rent of $ 600 .
Let the games begin .
Before I destroy Coleman , I 'm going to point out a major oversight by the right wing when it comes to Franken 's tax problem .
Al Franken made an effort to pay his taxes , he hired an accountant like most everybody else , but the accountant made a major mistake .
As a result " Franken paid state income taxes only in the states where he lived -- New York and Minnesota .
That meant he overpaid taxes in those two states , but shorted the other 17 states by more than $ 50,000 . "
[ Source : MPR ]
Al Franken is not a tax expert ; he is not running for ' US Tax Expert , ' and he made a mistake , but at least Franken made an attempt , Norm can't make that same claim .
To begin the ridicule I 'll reference the original article from the National Journal .
The very fact that such an article was even published about Norm Coleman predicates a complete failure in even attempting to pay the rent .
What 's more is that his excuse is just terrible , " I can assure Minnesotans that while partisans will attempt to raise questions about the perception of my paying rent to live in a bedroom of a house of a friend , there is no extraordinary reason for my staying there other than it fit my family 's budget . "
Let me get this straight , Norm Coleman is staying in a basement because of financial reasons ; the $ 169,300 he earns a year as a US Senator just simply is n't enough for him to stay on top of his rent .
So either Coleman simply does n't have the money , or he was n't responsible enough to just pay the rent .
This presents an interesting scenario , take your pick ; either he is struggling to make ends meet with an income greater than 96.87 % [ Source : US Census 2005 ] of the population or Norm Coleman is an idiot .
At this juncture I 'm ready to name both candidates incompetent when it comes to the basic concept of exchanging money for goods or services , but Norm may currently have the slight edge .
I would now expect certain right wingers ( MN Democrats Exposed ) to end their relentless crusade against Franken and his taxes after Norm 's latest demonstration of hypocrisy .
Now to drop a baseless right wing style quote : Norm Coleman is creating a pattern of not being upfront with voters .
Actually Norm Coleman made a mistake , and so did Al Franken .
As a result the discussion should shift away from these stupid distractions and move onto their differences on issues that matter .
For example Norm continues to support the Iraq War , Franken supports a withdrawl ; Coleman is not in favor of a gas tax that would generate additional funding to support infrastructure , while Franken believes extra money should be rasied to ensure our roadways are save after the 35W Bridge collapse .
More on the issues in future posts .
Australia is now the world 's fattest nation , with 26 % of adults labeled obese , a new report said Friday .
The report , titled '' Australia 's Future Fat Bomb ' ' was undertaken by the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute , and revealed that some 4 million Australian adults are now classified as obese .
The alarming new figures mean the nation has officially overtaken the United States , which has a 25 % obesity rate .
According to the report , some 1.5 million middle - aged Australians are currently obese , a figure the report predicts will result in an additional 700,000 cardiovascular - related hospital admissions in the next 20 years .
The report proposed a number of recommendations to curb the nation 's expanding waistlines , including a national weight loss strategy similar to the high - profile smoking and skin cancer campaigns and the subsidizing of gym memberships .
" If we ran a fat Olympics , we'd be gold medal winners as the fattest people on earth at the moment , " Institute preventative cardiology head Professor Simon Stewart told the Age newspaper .
While the report said Australia had overtaken the United States as the fattest nation on the planet , recent U.S. studies show around 34 % of Americans are overweight or obese .
In all , there are currently 1.6 billion overweight adults in the world , a number that is expected to grow by 40 % over the next decade , according to the World Health Organization .
Nutrition expert Rosemary Stanton said Australia needs to take urgent action to address growing obesity and re-think failed health messages .
" We 've got to somehow or other get a message across .
We 've got to start taking this very seriously , rather than just talking about it , " Stanton said , pointing the finger at " huge resistance " in the processed and fast food industries .
The report proposed a number of recommendations to curb the nation 's expanding waistlines , including a national weight loss strategy similar to the high - profile smoking and skin cancer campaigns and the subsidizing of gym memberships .
The findings , which will be presented at a government inquiry into obesity , have drawn a sharp reaction from Health Minister Nicola Roxon , who labeled the results '' staggering . ''
Speaking to reporters in Canberra , Roxon said the fight against obesity is a national priority and the government hopes to have an effective nationwide strategy in place within the next 12 months .

●中藤小学校の先生が言いたかったこと
前のエントリーでは、図を少し縮小して貼っていたので、以下のリンクをクリックして原寸大の図を脇に表示しておいてください。
( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) の5つの例で、周囲の長さはすべて16です。しかし、面積は異なります。念のために表にまとめておけば：
＼ ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) 周囲の長 さ 16 16 16 16 16 面積 16 15 14 13 7
小学校の先生が言いたかったことを、（子供向けじゃなくて）大人の言葉で表現すれば次のようになります。
面積が周囲の長さから求まるなら、
面積 = f( 周囲の長さ )
という関数fがあるはずです。もし仮にそうなら、面積 = f( 16 ) となり、5つの例すべての面積は同じ値となりますが、実際には違います（上の表のとおり）。だから、面積と周囲の長さは無関係ですね、いいですね、みなさん。
もちろん、この先生の言い分は正しいものです。しかし、面積
= f( 周囲の長さ , 他の要因 , ... ) という関数fの存在までは否定できません。
●あの子が発見した面積公式
「面積が周囲の長さだけから決まる」は嘘なんですが、周囲の長さが分かっている状況で、面積を簡単に求める方法があります。もう一度図をよく見てください。5つの図形において、その内部にある点（4つのタイルがあわさる点）が小さな黒丸で描いてありますよね。この内部点（interior points）の個数を勘定してみます。
＼ ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) 周囲の長 さ 16 16 16 16 16 内部点の個数 9 8 7 6 0 面積 16 15 14 13 7
「 面積 - 内部点の個数 」がすべての例で 7 ですね。つまり 、
面積 = 内部点の個数 + 7
となります。このときの「7」は周囲の長さに依存する数で、周囲の長さが変われば変わります。ですから、
面積 = 内部点の個数 + 周囲の長さに依存する数
となり、面積を決定する要因として、周囲の長さが関与しているのです。
ところで 、 「周囲の長さに依存する数」の具体的な形はどうなるでしょうか？
例えば、周囲の長さを12 , 18 , 20くらいにして、例と同様な実験をすると予測がつくと思いますよ。
ここで、みなさんが実験と予測をする時間を持てるように、続きは別エントリーにします。ここから先、「面積を、内部点の個数と周囲の長さから求める公式」を一般化していくつもりでが、適当な区切りでエントリー（ページ）を替えることにします。推測や発見の過程を楽しむためには、エントリーの区切りで実験と予測を実際に行ってみることをお勧めします。

Clint Eastwood has advised rival film director Spike Lee to " shut his face " after the African - American complained about the racial make - up of Eastwood 's films .
In an interview with the Guardian published today , Eastwood rejected Lee 's complaint that he had failed to include a single African - American soldier in his films Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima , both about the 1945 battle for the Japanese island .
In typically outspoken language , Eastwood justified his choice of actors , saying that those black troops who did take part in the battle as part of a munitions company did n't raise the flag .
The battle is known by the image of US marines raising the American flag on Mount Suribachi .
" The story is Flags of Our Fathers , the famous flag - raising picture , and they did n't do that .
If I go ahead and put an African - American actor in there , people 'd go : ' This guy 's lost his mind . '
I mean , it 's not accurate . "
Referring to Lee , he added : " A guy like him should shut his face . "
Lee 's comments came during a press conference to promote his own war film , Miracle at St Anna , at the Cannes film festival last month .
" Clint Eastwood made two films about Iwo Jima that ran for more than four hours total , and there was not one Negro actor on the screen , " Lee said .
" If you reporters had any balls you 'd ask him why .
There 's no way I know why he did that ...
But I know it was pointed out to him and that he could have changed it .
It 's not like he did n't know . "
Lee 's own film , about members of the all - black 92nd Buffalo Division , which fought in Italy , is an attempt to set second world war history straight .
Eastwood , who described himself as libertarian - " Just stay out of everybody else 's hair " - has a reputation for outspoken remarks .
He once said he would kill fellow film - maker Michael Moore if he showed up uninvited at his house .
His 2004 double - Oscar - winning film Million Dollar Baby was criticised by Christian groups who objected to part of the plot involving " assisted suicide " .
Defending the racial make - up in his films as historically accurate , Eastwood referred to another of his films , Changeling , which was set in Los Angeles before the city had a large group of African - Americans .
" What are you going to do , you going to tell a fuckin ' story about that ? " he said .
" Make it look like a commercial for an equal opportunity player ?
I 'm not in that game .
I 'm playing it the way I read it historically , and that 's the way it is .
When I do a movie and it's 90 % black , like Bird , then I use 90 % black people .
" He was complaining when I did Bird ( the 1988 biopic of Charlie Parker ) .
Why would a white guy be doing that ?
I was the only guy who made it , that 's why .
He could have gone ahead and made it .
Instead he was making something else . "
Eastwood 's next project , The Human Factor , will be about Nelson Mandela 's attempts to foster national unity in post - apartheid South Africa .
Asked if he would remain historically accurate with depictions of the former president , he said : " I 'm not going to make Nelson Mandela a white guy . "

WASHINGTON  A former Republican congressman from Michigan was indicted Wednesday on federal charges of money laundering and obstruction of justice .
The allegations involve his work as a lobbyist for an Islamic charity accused of illegally funneling about $ 130,000 to an Afghan warlord considered a terrorist by the United States government .
The former congressman , Mark D. Siljander , who was defeated for re-election in 1986 after three terms in the House , was accused by a federal grand jury in Kansas City of accepting $ 50,000 in stolen government aid money as his lobbying fee from the now - defunct charity group , the Islamic American Relief Agency .
The charity  which was based in Columbia , Mo. , and closed in 2004  and several of its former leaders were already under indictment on charges of illegally transferring money to Iraq and stealing government money .
The broader indictment issued Wednesday also accused the charity and its former officers of transferring about $ 130,000 to Pakistan for the benefit of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , a former prime minister of Afghanistan .
Mr. Hekmatyar is a warlord who has been formally designated a terrorist by the United States because of his links to Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Mr. Siljander , a conservative who runs a Washington consulting firm , was not accused of involvement in money transfers to Mr. Gulbuddin .

TOLEDO MAYOR TELLS MARINES " NO " TO URBAN WARFARE TRAINING IN CITY
By Jim Kouri
Posted 1:00 AM
Eastern
February 14 , 2008
NewsWithViews.com
In a move that 's sure to create national controversy , the mayor of Toledo , Ohio told a battalion of armed Marines to get out of his city forthwith .
Mayor Carty Finkbeiner ordered about 200 Marines who traveled from Grand Rapids , Michigan to halt their military exercises and leave his city , according to news accounts .
The armed Marines -- members of Company A , 1st Battalion , 24th Marines from Grand Rapids , Michigan -- were in Toledo to participate in an urban warfare training exercise , one of several planned across the nation by the Pentegon .
According to sources in Toledo , the city 's police commanders , including Chief Jack Smith , were aware of the urban warfare training , but the mayor was kept in the dark .
Brian Schwartz , Mayor Finkbeiner 's spokesman , told local TV news reporters that " the mayor asked [ the Marines ] to leave because they frighten people .
He did not want them practicing and drilling in a highly visible area [ of his city ] . "
Meanwhile , according to the same TV report , Toledo police officials said they knew about the training and had approved the Marines ' use of that city 's resources .
The hands - on training program was scheduled to begin on Friday , February 8 in the afternoon and end on Sunday , February 10 .
USMC Marine Corps Elite Warrior Urban Warfare Training Program includes using city buildings as fortresses and handling insurgents and enemy snipers .
It combines advanced combat techniques with state - of - the - art weaponry .
Police officials told reporters that " the unit 's presence would have a minimal impact on the city . "
In fact , they said that the Toledo Police Department issued a media release earlier in the week notifying the news media and public that the marines would be wearing green camouflage uniforms , operate military vehicles , carry rifles , perform foot patrols , and fire blank ammunition during their urban warfare training .
While some citizens have characterized Mayor Finkbeiner 's actions as being unpatriotic , there are others who believe the Toledo mayor 's action are justified and welcomed .
" Why are these Marines training in US cities ?
Why are n't they training in Afghanistan or Iraq or somewhere outside of the continental US ?
Why do American cities need this kind of attention by our military leaders ? " asks conservative political strategist Michael Baker of New Jersey .
" Americans -- people who are always there to support their fighting men and women -- should be willing to draw a line separating what 's acceptable and what 's unacceptable when it comes to military operations in their own backyard , " adds Baker .
But former New York City police detective Sid Francis believes the motive for training US troops inside American cities is more sinister .
" The police power has traditionally been reserved for the states .
The fact that we 're allowing military troops to train in US cities is a violation of that tradition .
We do n't need federal troops to intervene in matters that should be handled by local police officers , state troopers and the National Guard , " said Francis , himself a former US Marine .
Is there a danger to having US troops operating within our borders ?
Many observers told NewswithViews.com , " Yes ! " During the tragic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans , amid all the chaos and death , the federal government considered it a priority to send in members of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms to confiscate firearms legally owned by civilians .
" The Bush Administration thought the priorty was disarming law - abiding citizens in the throes of lawlessness .
In essence , the ATF was sent into the ravaged city of New Orleans to make certain people could not protect themselves , their families and their property from lawbreakers who took advantage of the tragic hurricane and flood , " claims Police Officer Edna Aguayo .
" So what are they going to do during the next American disaster or state of emergency ?
Send in armed Marines geared up for war ? " she asks .
One retired military officer who requested anonymity believes they are performing " Urban Warfare Training " in American cities because they are expecting something big to happen soon .
There are four rationales US government officials will use to justify their violation of the Posse Comitatus Act 1 , monetary collapse 2 , health emergency such as a pandemic 3 , at attack on America or 4 , large scale rebellion against globalization .
" Americans are an understanding people for the most part and will support the government trying to protect them from a serious threat .
However , Americans should be more skeptical about the use of military forces to conduct what are basically police and humanitarian operations , " he said .
" Granted there are political leaders who may have good intentions during a crisis , but many of the politicians in the United States today have ulterior motives , " said Mike Baker .
" Who in his or her right mind trusts a Hillary Clinton or a Barack Obama or a John McCain to make decisions regarding use of American military power ?
During the administration of Hillary 's husband , paramilitary operations were used to kill men , women and children at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas .
A followup investigation showed that most of the rationales for such a draconian response were false , " said Det. Francis .
Toledo ,
Ohio is not the first or only city to be a testing ground for urban warfare operations .
In a May 6 , 2007 article , Boston Globe correspondent Christine MacDonald examined the delicate balance of a city enabling military training for possible terrorist scenarios with its commitment to protect its citizens from potential hazards caused by live training .
Boston officials said they needed assurances from the military that no live fire or ammunition would be used in the proposed war games on the South Boston Waterfront before they would give the go - ahead .
The Navy had applied for the city 's permission to practice hostage rescues , sea landings , and urban warfare techniques for 10 days in June .
The use of Toledo is not the first time Marines trained in urban warfare in Ohio .
In Dayton , Ohio 600 marines took part in a two week " urban warfare " training exercise .
The exercise , entitled " Training in an Urban Environment Exercise or ' Truex ' " ended on Sept. 26 , 2002 , according to Col. Andrew Frick of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit ( MEU ) which conducted the exercise .
The unit 's home - base is Camp Lejeune , North Carolina but they were stationed at Wright - Patterson Air Force Base for the duration of the Truex training .
According to Col. Frick and reports by the Dayton Daily News , some of the exercises used live ammunition .
" The increasing use of Urban Warfare Training Exercises , I believe , desensitizes both the public to the deployment of military forces in their own neighborhoods , " warns one police chief , whose mayor endorses the use of military forces within the US .
" It also desensitizes military and police personnel so that they will accept what was once considered unacceptable , " he added after requesting anonymity .
Urban Warfare Training has actually become a growth industry in the United States .
Several private organizations offer such training for military , police and security personnel .
For example , the Urban Warfare Center provides training for US military and police personnel with state - of - the - art equipment .
Their facilities are located in North Salt Lake , Utah and they boast a client list that includes US Airborne Special Forces , SWAT , the Army National Guard , US Secret Service , the BATF , and other military and paramilitary organizations .
“ We were born .
We grew up .
We escaped . ”
So reads the motto of ExScientology Kids.com , a website launched Thursday by three young women raised in the Church of Scientology who are speaking out against the religion .
Their website accuses the church of physical abuse , denying some children a proper education and alienating members from family .
One of the women behind the site , Jenna Miscavige Hill , is the niece of David Miscavige , the head of the church , and Kendra Wiseman is the daughter of Bruce Wiseman , president of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights , a Scientology - sponsored organization opposed to the practice of psychiatry .
The day before ExScientology Kids.com launched , another inflammatory allegation about the church began to circulate virulently online .
“ L. Ron Hubbard Plagiarized Scientology , ” read a headline at the popular Internet culture blog BoingBoing .
The post linked to images of a translated 1934 German book called “ Scientologie , ” which critics say contains similar themes to Hubbard ’s Scientology , which he codified in 1952 , according to a church website .

These were just the latest in a series of Scientology - related stories to burn across the Internet like grass fires in recent weeks , testing the church ’s well - established ability to tightly control its public image .
The largest thorn in the church ’s side has been a group called Anonymous , a diffuse online coalition of skeptics , hackers and activists , many of them young and Web - savvy .
The high - wattage movement has inspired former Scientologists to come forward and has repeatedly trained an Internet spotlight on any story or rumor that portrays Scientology in unflattering terms .
No corner of the Web , it appears , is safe for Scientology .
Blogger and lawyer Scott Pilutik recently posted a story noting that Scientology was yanking down EBay auctions for used e-meters , the device the church uses for spiritual counseling .
EBay allows brand owners -- Louis Vuitton or Rolex , say -- to remove items they believe infringe on their trademark or patent rights .
Basically , fakes .
But , Pilutik said , the used e-meters being taken down were genuine .
Reselling them was no different than putting a for - sale sign on your old Chevy .
“ What ’s actually going on here , ” he wrote , is that the church is “ knowingly alleging intellectual property violations that clearly do n’t exist . ”
Within a day Pilutik ’s blog had gotten over 45,000 visitors -- so much traffic that his site crashed completely .
Facing a steady stream of negative publicity and a growing number of critical voices , Scientology has found itself on the defensive .

The church has referred to Anonymous as a group of “ cyber- terrorists ” and , in a statement , said the group ’s aims were “ reminiscent of Al Qaeda spreading anti-American hatred and calling for U.S. destruction . ”
“ These people are posing extremely serious death threats to our people , ” said church spokeswoman Karin Pouw in a phone interview .
“ We are talking about religious hatred and bigotry . ”
A recent video posted to YouTube contained a threat to bomb a Southern California Scientology building .
An FBI spokeswoman said an investigation was in progress but that no suspects had been identified .
Reporters have long had to tread carefully when writing about Scientology , fearful that lawsuits and other kinds of retaliation would follow any story that Scientology did not like .
But that may be changing .

“ Before this Internet onslaught , ” said Douglas Frantz , a contributing editor at Portfolio magazine who covered Scientology for the New York Times in the 1990s ( and is a former editor at the L.A. Times ) , “ they were always able to go after their critics and do a good job of being able to discredit or intimidate them . ”
Angry former church members also perceive a kind of safety in numbers afforded by the Internet , and more are coming forward to share their stories .
“ People have been scared out of their minds to speak out about Scientology , ” said Hill , Miscavige ’s niece , in an interview .
“ Nobody should have to be that scared to speak out about a church . ”
Wiseman echoed the sentiment , adding that the Anonymous campaign had influenced her decision to reveal her identity last week .
“ The Internet is listening .
If something happens to me , all of these people will know . ”

The current wave of anti-Scientology activity began in January , when a video of Tom Cruise extolling the religion ’s tech - based approach to enlightenment was leaked onto YouTube , where users holding it up to ridicule copied and recopied it ; several sites posted it without hesitation .
It was n’t long before Nick Denton , who as publisher of the blog syndicate Gawker Media had put the video online first , received a legal threat from a law firm representing Scientology , alleging copyright infringement .
But Denton refused to take the video down .
“ It was an awesome news story , ” Denton wrote in an e-mail .
“ If we did n’t race to post it up , some other site would have .
That , rather than litigation by Scientology , was the fear going through my mind . ”
The church ’s whack - a- mole campaign with the Cruise video became a rallying cry for Anonymous , which saw efforts to remove the videos from YouTube as an unwanted incursion into the domain of digital culture , where information and media , copyrighted or no , are often exchanged freely .

In a YouTube video of its own , Anonymous declared open war on the church .
Early on , the group also staged cyber-attacks on Scientology websites .
But on Feb. 10 , thousands of masked Anonymous members picketed at Scientology locations around the globe , chanting slogans and handing out fliers .
No violent incidents were reported .
The protests generated yet another wave of online media -- videos , photos , news stories , blog posts -- little of it in praise of Scientology .
The result of all this attention has been that just about any story critical of Scientology -- even those that have been publicly accessible for years -- can gain immediate Web currency .
On Digg.com , a popular “ social news ” aggregator that features popular stories from around the Web , dozens of Scientology stories have ascended to the site ’s most - viewed list in the last several weeks .
A successful Digg story can drive tens of thousands of views to the originating site , as was the case with Pilutik ’s post about e-meters .
In addition , the clamor generated by Anonymous has raised the profile of the small but vehement anti-Scientology community that existed before Anonymous , and even made for some cross-pollination between the two camps .

Scientology ’s longtime detractors , such as those at Operation Clambake ( xenu.net ) and Scientology Lies , claim it is not a religion at all but a business that charges its parishioners ever more onerous fees for access to revealed truths .
Other online forums , such as the Ex-Scientologist Message Board and ExScientologyKids , have become places for former members to congregate , share stories and offer support
Ironically , it is the church ’s aversion to negative publicity -- and the legal strategy it has long used to prevent it , that has aroused more online ire than any other issue .
The website ChillingEffects .com has posted dozens of cease - and - desist letters sent by Scientology ’s lawyers to various website and Internet service providers requesting that copyrighted material be removed .
But in the diffuse and often Byzantine world of the Web , some precision legal strikes are more likely to backfire than hit their target .
Scientology ’s use of copyright law appears to be an increasingly losing battle on the Web , said Andrew Bridges , a San Francisco - based intellectual property attorney .
“ The big question is :
Is the copyright serving the purpose of promoting science and the useful arts , or is the purpose essentially the stifling of criticism ? ”

Still , according to Scientology spokeswoman Pouw , the church views the Internet as a positive tool .
It is , Pouw said , “ concentrating on using the Internet as a resource for promoting its message and mission in this world , not as a ground for litigation . ”
But now that goal will have to exist alongside a seemingly steady stream of online attacks .
And while anonymous political activity , such as postering around a town , is nothing new , Bridges noted , the speed of the Web is what is giving Scientology trouble .
“ What ’s different is that more people can see the stuff faster than Scientology can go around and get it taken down . ”
Heavily armed police and federal agents stormed into a Glassell Park neighborhood Wednesday morning to wrest control away from a street gang -- and loyalists with deep family ties to its members -- that has in effect turned the sequestered swath of run-down apartments into rogue territory .
With a sweeping federal racketeering indictment , more than 500 agents , including 10 SWAT teams , arrested 28 people in an attempt to root out the Avenues gang members who have ruled the area with violence and near impunity .
The indictment , which grew out of a 10 - month investigation , names 70 defendants -- mostly connected to the Drew Street clique of the larger Avenues gang .
The gang dates to the zoot suit era in Northeast Los Angeles and is closely connected to the Mexican Mafia prison gang .
Twenty - six defendants were already in custody and 16 are at large .
Prosecutors allege that the gang committed three murders , shot at police , extorted businesses , conducted home invasion robberies , taxed drug dealers for the Mexican Mafia and threatened potential witnesses -- all as part of an enterprise to distribute methamphetamine and rock cocaine in the area .
Authorities say undercover agents conducted scores of drug purchases from the gang during the investigation .

U.S. Atty .
Thomas P. O’Brien called the sweep “ the largest gang take - down in recent L.A. history . ”
He said he was confident that by targeting so many defendants with heavy federal charges , the effort would accomplish what previous crackdowns , convictions , injunctions and evictions have so far been unable to do : break the gang ’s grip on the low - income neighborhood , which is heavily Latino .
Half of the defendants could face life in prison without parole if convicted , said Thom Mrozek , spokesman for the U.S. attorney ’s office .
Francisco “ Pancho ” Real , 26 , who was identified as the leader of the Drew Street clique , brought in $ 1,200 a day in drug money alone , according to a wiretap recording described in the indictment .
He was arrested at his home in Glendale .

The gang stirred a storm of media coverage and police attention after a wild , rolling shootout in February .
The indictment suggests that the shooting stemmed from a brewing turf battle between the Avenues , backed by the Mexican Mafia , and the Cypress Park gang .
On Feb. 21 , in order to prevent Cypress Park from dealing drugs in their territory , the indictment alleges , Real ’s cohorts shot to death one of its members , Marcos Salas , as he held his 2 - year - old granddaughter ’s hand in front of her elementary school .
Minutes later police pulled over the three suspected gunmen , who then opened fire with an assault rifle .
Police fatally shot one of them , Real ’s half brother Daniel Leon .
Authorities had wiretaps on Real ’s phones at the time .
The day after the shooting , Real shrugged off Leon ’s death , using a profanity to say " [ stuff ] happens , ” according to the indictment .
Advertisement
The gang did n’t skip a beat after the shootout , the summaries of the wiretaps suggest .
In March , Real ordered the owner of a local tire shop to pay him $ 30,000 within 24 hours , prosecutors allege , or he would kill him and burn down his shop .
When the owner of an adjoining tire shop told Real that he did not understand why they had to pay him , Real said they were operating in his territory , the indictment alleges .
Real is one of 13 children of Maria Leon , the matriarch of the gang and a defendant in the case , according to law enforcement .
She has a criminal record with three drug arrests and was in custody Wednesday morning for reentering the country after a deportation .
The family hails from a sweltering , lawless part of the Mexican state of Guerrero , as does much of the neighborhood .
Based on their shared roots , many residents maintain a fierce solidarity and loathing for the police .

On Wednesday , an 81 - year - old woman on Isabel Street , Olga Martinez , called the police “ gestapos ” after they broke down her door looking for her son .
Numerous other residents declined to talk .
“ We do n’t know anything , we did n’t hear anything , we did n’t see anything , ” said a woman who lives on Drew Street and declined to give her name .
The layout of the small neighborhood -- cut off by San Fernando Road , backed up against Forest Lawn Memorial - Park -- helps this separation from mainstream society persist just four miles from downtown Los Angeles .
With few entrances , spotters easily monitor who comes and goes .
Gang interventionists , common in other tough neighborhood , do n’t even go there .
“ The Drew Street gang ordinarily is vigilant to the presence of ‘ outsiders , ’ ” the indictment says .
“ Gang members are likely to identify and physically threaten to kill them . ”
Advertisement
The Avenues , which police estimate has about 400 members , had a bout of infamy in 1995 when members shot and killed 3 - year - old Stephanie Kuhen , whose family made a wrong turn into a dead - end street in Cypress Park .
The dense configuration of apartments on Drew Street allows gangbangers to disappear when police roll in .
“ This is a claustrophobic neighborhood , and the gang members use it to their advantage , ” City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo said .
Delgadillo ’s office shut down Maria Leon ’s house on Drew Street last year with a nuisance abatement lawsuit .
More than 40 arrests had been made there in 2006 .
During a raid in 2002 , police found cocaine , marijuana , a Tec - 9 assault weapon , ammunition , a small explosive and a cellphone that was ringing with customers ’ drug orders , according to court records .
Six children under 10 were inside , including Leon ’s youngest child , a 3 - month - old boy .

Leon and her family moved to Victorville , where the Internal Revenue Service recently seized their home as part of this investigation .
Eighteen agencies were involved in the probe , including the LAPD ; federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , FBI , IRS , Glendale police and the Los Angeles city attorney .
On Wednesday , Delgadillo announced 10 more nuisance abatement lawsuits to clean out properties in the area .
The suits aim to force property owners to provide armed security guards , security cameras , strict tenant screening and the eviction of anyone involved in drug sales or use .
“ The people who live in this neighborhood are prisoners in their own homes , ” he said .
Advertisement
Authorities said the gang routinely threatened witnesses to their crimes , creating a climate of fear that allowed members to operate freely .
In one allegation detailed in the indictment , three members robbed a residence on Marmion Way , using a 9 - millimeter handgun and an M - 11 assault rifle .
When Real got word that the victims were to appear at a police lineup , he directed a subordinate to “ instruct the victims . . . that they were to ‘ keep their mouths shut ’ and not identify any of the Avenues or Drew Street gang members at the lineup that day or [ he ] would retaliate against them , ” the indictment said .
Two of the victims did what he said , but one did not , the indictment said .
Real allegedly drove to that person ’s house that night and threatened to retaliate against them or their family if they went to court again .
Advertisement
U.S. Atty .
O’Brien said his office was investigating allegations that an attorney for one of the gang members tipped Real off when witnesses showed up at police lineups .
Police and state prosecutors often complain that the gang cannot be brought to trial because witnesses are intimidated .
Because much of the 157 - page indictment is based on federal wiretap evidence and drug buys by undercover agents , prosecutors hope to circumvent that obstacle .

The Avenues
A look at the case :
The gang
Enduring law enforcement crackdowns spanning nearly six decades , the Avenues is a multi-generational gang rooted in a swath of Los Angeles neighborhoods northeast of the 5 Freeway near the 2 Freeway .
Leaders and associates are tied to a series of high - profile crimes , including the 1995 slaying of 3 - year - old Stephanie Kuhen , whose family strayed into the gang ’s territory , and a 1997 racketeering conspiracy involving Alex “ Pee Wee ” Aguirre , a reputed Avenues leader and Mexican Mafia prison gang veteran .

The latest focus
The recently formed “ Drew Street ” branch of the gang claims its turf as near Drew Street and Estara Avenue .
Estimated to be 500 strong , Drew Street clique members are accused in an 88 - count federal grand jury indictment of racketeering , distributing crack cocaine and methamphetamine , extorting drug dealers , businesses and residents , as well as intimidating African Americans who enter the area .
The allegations
The 158 - page indictment , naming 70 defendants , alleges that Avenues and Drew Street members :

Attempted to shoot and kill two Los Angeles police officers who were arresting a gang member suspected of being under the influence of drugs in 2003 .
A second attempt to kill officers was made earlier this year .
Participated in a series of homicides , attempted homicides and homicide conspiracies from 2003 to this year involving street gang rivals and victims who ventured onto the gang ’s turf .
Members operated under the authority of the Mexican Mafia .
Maintained a ready supply of stolen and unregistered machine guns , assault rifles , shotguns and automatic handguns , as well as body armor , used for attacks and intimidation against enemies , police , outsiders and or anyone posing a threat to the gang ’s illegal activities .
Laundered tens of thousands of dollars in drug dealing profits from sales of cocaine and methamphetamine into the purchase of a Victorville residence .

Warned victims of a 2007 home - invasion robbery not to appear at a police lineup or testify .
A gang leader directed an associate to reward those who complied and punish those who had cooperated with police and prosecutors .
Gave a tire shop owner 24 hours to make a $ 30,000 extortion payment or provide a gang leader with a Hummer SUV .
The business owner was warned that gang members knew where to find his relatives and he would be killed and his businesses torched if he failed to comply .

In a major pushback against music industry efforts to expand copyright control at the expense of consumers , a California judge has ruled that recipients of promotional CDs are free to do with them as they please .
In other words , what would seem obvious to the layman , in this case also happens to be the law .
However , during a long - running legal battle that shut down an eBay seller , Universal Music Group had argued that it retained licensing rights and could prohibit such resale despite the fact that its promo CDs are distributed willy - nilly to thousands of music industry insiders who neither ask for them nor are not expected to return them .
Tuesday 's ruling by U.S. District Court Judge S. James
Otero is meaningful not merely because it protects an income stream for CD resellers , says the Electronic Frontier Foundation , but primarily because it affirms the so - called " first sale " doctrine .
From the EFF 's press release :
" This is a very important ruling for consumers , and not just those who buy or sell used CDs , " said EFF Staff Attorney Corynne McSherry .
" The right of first sale also protects libraries , used bookstores , and businesses that rent movies and videogames .
This ruling affirms and protects the traditional balance between the rights of copyright owners and the rights of the public . "
" It was clear to the court that these CDs were the property of ( the eBay merchant ) , and therefore he had the right to resell them , " said Joseph C. Gratz , attorney with Keker & Van Nest .
" Copyright holders can't strip consumers of their first sale rights just by sticking a ' Not for Sale ' label on a CD . "
The bottom line from the judge :
" The promo CDs are unordered merchandise , " Otero writes in his order ( PDF ) . " ...
By sending the promo CDs to music industry insiders , UMG transferred title to those insiders and the promo CDs are subject to the First Sale Doctrine . "
When I first wrote about this issue two months ago , EFF intellectual property attorney Fred von Lohmann answered a number of questions regarding the nitty - gritty of the case in an interview you can read here .
When it comes to science , creationists tend to struggle with reality .
They believe , after all , that evolution by means of natural selection is false and that Earth is only a few thousand years old .
They also believe that students who are taught a creationist view of biology  or who are taught to disregard the Darwinist view  are not being disadvantaged .
The Texas State Board of Education is again considering a science curriculum that teaches the “ strengths and weaknesses ” of evolution , setting an example that several other states are likely to follow .
This is code for teaching creationism .
It has the advantage of sounding more balanced than teaching “ intelligent design , ” which the courts have consistently banned from science classrooms .
It has the disadvantage of being nonsense .
The chairman of the Texas board , a dentist named Don McLeroy , advocates the “ strengths and weaknesses ” approach , as does a near majority of the board .
The system accommodates what Dr. McLeroy calls two systems of science , creationist and “ naturalist . ”

But it 's cool if you take it to Apple , because if your broke - ass iPhone does become a refurb for some discount - seeking soul , Apple scrubs it to the bone , right ?
Nope .
Using a standard forensic toolkit ( or probably just some decent quasi - hacking ) , your personal data can be recovered from a refurb , as Jonathan Zdziarski — the guy who wrote the iPhone Forensics Manual for Law Enforcement , ironically — discovered .
A detective bought his past iPhone , and was able to pull his email , photos and financial info , no sweat .

Update : Kevin reminded me that the 2.0 firmware will have remote wipe as part of its enterprise feature set , so this problem might be solved next month .

When we covered the magical algae - powered VW Westfalia , we did n't imagine there would be a commercially viable version of the faux dino - juice available anywhere in the near term .
Little did we know about the happenings over at Solazyme , which has just completed the rigorous ASTM D - 975 ( nerd speak for standard test ) certification for diesel fuels .
This new green diesel is made with a combination of algae and enzymes in a big enclosed vessel with all kinds of industrial leftovers as the feedstock .
Huh , sounds like some kind of silver bullet .
We , for one , welcome our new algae - baron overlords .
Presser below the fold .
It was when the oil light came on that I started to run through the appropriate next steps in my …
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO , CA - June 27 , 2008 : Solazyme announced recently that SoladieselRDTM , a microalgae - derived renewable diesel , has passed American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM ) D -975 specifications .
SoladieselRDTM
is the first algal - based renewable diesel to meet these standards .
In a 100 % blend , SoladieselRDTM has been road tested in a factory standard 2005 Jeep Liberty diesel .
The fuel 's chemical composition is identical to that of standard petroleum based diesel , and SoladieselRDTM is fully compatible with the existing transportation fuel infrastructure .
Having fewer particulate emissions , SoladieselRDTM
also has a more desirable environmental footprint than standard petro-diesel .
In addition , it meets the new ASTM ultra low sulfur diesel ( ULSD ) standards .
" This now marks the production of our second fuel that meets current U.S. fuel specifications and is an important validation of our proprietary process using microalgae to produce renewable fuels , " said Jonathan Wolfson , chief executive officer of Solazyme .
" Solazyme 's leadership in the green fuels space will continue to grow as we now execute on our strategy for commercial launch . "
The only advanced biofuels company producing at scale , Solazyme implements a unique microbial fermentation process that allows algae to produce oil in massive vessels quickly , efficiently and without sunlight .
The process can utilize many forms of non-food feedstocks , including waste glycerol and many cellulosic materials including wood chips , corn stover and switchgrass .
The resulting oils can be leveraged across a wide variety of industries and applications , including fuels , edible oils and chemicals and are completely biodegradable , nontoxic and safe .

It was particularly difficult this year to find out when and where the annual conclave of world powerbrokers , the Bilderberg Group , would take place .
Finally , it appears certain that the highly secret meeting of western political - military elites will take place from June 5 – 8 in Chantilly , Virginia , near Washington , in a luxury hotel immersed in nature , the Westfield ’s Marriott .
The first Bilderberg meeting at the Hotel de Bilderberg in Arnhem , Holland , on May 29 , 30 , and 31 , 1954 .
What is Bilderberg ?
The Bilderberg group , which convened for the first time in 1954 in Holland , is considered the most powerful decision - making organization in the world .
Semi-secret ( without even a website ) , the group consists of elite political , financial , managerial , military , and media leaders from North America and Western Europe .
In contrast with the Trilateral Commission , which was created out of the Bilderberg Group specifically to work with emerging Asian nations ( Japan in the Seventies , China and India today ) , the Bilderberg Group is a genuine “ shadow government ” of the West that , some critics say , decides the fate of the world to suit the interests of the restricted oligarchy it represents .
Ottawa newspaper reporting the " world ’s elite " arriving at a " secret meeting " in Canada in 2006 .
On the Table .
Two years ago , a press release sent out on the date of the opening session in 2006 ( held in Ottawa , Canada ) , explained that the annual meeting would discuss the War on Terrorism , the situation in Iran and the Middle East , Oil , Russia , US - EU relations , and relations between the West and Asia , as well as Immigration .
It is to be supposed that this year ’s meeting will include discussion of current international emergencies , such as Afghanistan , the high cost of oil , and the world economic crisis .
Concerning oil : after the Ottawa meeting , indiscreet leaks reported that a decision had been announced by oil producers to raise the cost of oil to over $ 100 a barrel over the course of two years .
The most recent list of Bilderberg members dates from the 2006 meeting , and includes high Bush administration officials , Henry Kissinger , the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank , Credit Suisse , Rothschild Europe ( Vice President Franco Bernabè ) , representatives of Shell , BP , and ENI ( Paolo Scaroni ) , Coca Cola , Phillips , Unilever , Time Warner , AOL , Tyssen - Krupp , and Fiat ( Vice President John Elkann ) .
Also present were representatives from Nato , the United Nations , the World Bank , the European Union , and economists ( including Giulio Tremonti and Mario Monti ) and many Western leaders ( Italy ’s representative was Tommaso Padoa - Schioppa ) .
See below other Italian participants at past Bilderberg meetings .
Why all the privacy ?
Considering the grave importance to the public of the subjects discussed and the people present at the meetings , it would be logical – if for no other reason that to discourage paranoid theories – not to keep the meetings so private ( or secret , if you prefer ) , and not to hold them behind closed doors in super - secure locations surrounded by armed guards , far from the prying eyes of journalists and the curious .
If they have nothing to hide , why are they hiding ?

One of the great staples of the modern Washington movie is the dark and ruthless corporation whose power extends into every cranny around the globe , whose technological expertise is without peer , whose secrets are unfathomable , whose riches defy calculation , and whose network of allies , in and out of government , is held together by webs of money , ambition , and fear .
You ’ve seen this movie a dozen times .
Men in black coats step from limousines on wintry days and refer guardedly to unspeakable things .
Surveillance cameras and eavesdropping devices are everywhere .
Data scrolls across the movie screen in digital fonts .
Computer keyboards clack softly .
Seemingly honorable people at the summit of power — Cabinet secretaries , war heroes , presidents — turn out to be pathetic pawns of forces greater than anyone can imagine .
And at the pinnacle of this dark and ruthless corporation is a relentless and well - tailored titan — omniscient , ironic , merciless — played by someone like Christopher Walken or Jon Voight .
To be sure , there is n’t really such a corporation : the Omnivore Group , as it might be called .
But if there were such a company — and , mind you , there is n’t — it might look a lot like the largest government contractor you ’ve never heard of : a company known simply by the nondescript initials SAIC ( for Science Applications International Corporation ) , initials that are always spoken letter by letter rather than formed into a pronounceable acronym .
SAIC maintains its headquarters in San Diego , but its center of gravity is in Washington , D.C.
With a workforce of 44,000 , it is the size of a full - fledged government agency — in fact , it is larger than the departments of Labor , Energy , and Housing and Urban Development combined .
Its anonymous glass - and - steel Washington office — a gleaming corporate box like any other — lies in northern Virginia , not far from the headquarters of the C.I.A. , whose byways it knows quite well .
( More than half of SAIC ’s employees have security clearances . )
SAIC has been awarded more individual government contracts than any other private company in America .
The contracts number not in the dozens or scores or hundreds but in the thousands : SAIC currently holds some 9,000 active federal contracts in all .
More than a hundred of them are worth upwards of $ 10 million apiece .
Two of them are worth more than $ 1 billion .
The company ’s annual revenues , almost all of which come from the federal government , approached $ 8 billion in the 2006 fiscal year , and they are continuing to climb .
SAIC ’s goal is to reach as much as $ 12 billion in revenues by 2008 .
As for the financial yardstick that really gets Wall Street ’s attention — profitability — SAIC beats the S&P 500 average .
Last year ExxonMobil , the world ’s largest oil company , posted a return on revenue of 11 percent .
For SAIC the figure was 11.9 percent .
If “ contract backlog ” is any measure — that is , contracts negotiated and pending — the future seems assured .
The backlog stands at $ 13.6 billion .
That ’s one and a half times more than the backlog at KBR Inc. , a subsidiary of the far better known government contractor once run by Vice President Dick Cheney , the Halliburton Company .
It is a simple fact of life these days that , owing to a deliberate decision to downsize government , Washington can operate only by paying private companies to perform a wide range of functions .
To get some idea of the scale : contractors absorb the taxes paid by everyone in America with incomes under $ 100,000 .
In other words , more than 90 percent of all taxpayers might as well remit everything they owe directly to SAIC or some other contractor rather than to the IRS .
In Washington these companies go by the generic name “ body shops ” — they supply flesh - and - blood human beings to do the specialized work that government agencies no longer can .
Often they do this work outside the public eye , and with little official oversight — even if it involves the most sensitive matters of national security .
The Founding Fathers may have argued eloquently for a government of laws , not of men , but what we ’ve got instead is a government of body shops .
The unhappy business practices of the past few years in Iraq — cost overruns , incompetence , and corruption on a pharaonic scale — have made the American public keenly aware of the activities of mega- contractors such as Halliburton and Bechtel .
Although SAIC takes on government projects such as those pursued by contractors like these , it does not belong in exactly the same category .
Halliburton and Bechtel supply the government ’s brawn .
They pour concrete , roll out concertina wire , build infrastructure .
They call on bullnecked men to provide protection .

Health and safety zealots tell youngster her 2ft paddling pool needs a lifeguard
For nearly a quarter of a century , Lourdes Maxwell has celebrated the arrival of summer by putting a paddling pool in the garden .
This year , however , her two grandchildren and the children of her neighbours may have to find another way to cool off in the heat .
Miss Maxwell 's local council has decided that the pool - which is only 2ft deep - needs a lifeguard .
The 47 - year - old divorced mother of three has also been told she must have insurance before she can inflate the toy outside her house in Portsmouth .
Cooling off : Lourdes Maxwell ( left ) and neighbours young and old enjoy a dip in the pool which the council says needs a lifeguard
The health and safety edict came after she wrote to the city council asking for permission to put a bigger pool in the communal garden outside her home .
Not only was she told it was too dangerous , but the council told her to empty the existing pool .
After her MP intervened , the local authority softened its stance , saying Miss Maxwell could have a pool if she paid for insurance and ensured supervisors were on constant watch .
Residents near the communal gardens already have to obey a raft of rules governing their use .
They are even supposed to ask the council for permission before having a barbecue .
Miss Maxwell , who is a full - time carer to her son Aiden , said yesterday : " It is absolutely pathetic .
" I have had a paddling pool outside the front of my flat every summer for 24 years , ever since Aiden turned one year old .
" Neighbours ' children would come and enjoy the pool and I would give them ice lollies .
It was always a very social occasion . "
She added : " Now suddenly I 'm not allowed .
" I asked around for insurance and they just laughed at me .
No one offers insurance for paddling pools .
" I 'm always there to supervise but they 're trying to tell me I need lifeguards for a kiddies ' pool as well - it's crazy . "
Nigel Selley , Portsmouth Council 's neighbourhood manager , defended the ruling yesterday .
He said : " We did not have sufficient assurances that the risks associated with providing such a facility would be well - managed .
" We have since spoken to Ms Maxwell and she is aware of our concerns for child safety and the risks associated with drowning . "
Steven Wylie , the councillor in charge of housing , added : " I want to encourage people to enjoy the communal gardens .
" We want to help where we can to ensure that it is a fun and safe place for everyone to use . "
Getting Rejected !
Interested in being a scientist ?
Then you had better get used to rejection and failure , because the truth is that most of your experiments will fail , most of your original ideas will be wrong , and most of your grant proposals and papers will be rejected on the first submission ( especially if you submit to competitive journals ) .
This does n't mean you 're a bad scientist - failure and rejection is a normal fact of life for most scientists ( that is , all scientists except ones who are n't doing any science ! ) .
But this means that peer - review is a good thing , even when it affects you personally as your paper gets rejected ( as mine was last week ) .
How does peer review work in scientific publishing ?
One of the most important things you do as a scientist is produce publishable results , which generates not just in fame and glory , but hopefully progress in understanding an important question .
When you have publishable results , you submit them to a professional journal .
At the journal , an editor makes a triage decision ( is there any hope at all that this paper will be accepted ? ) , and either immediately rejects your paper , or sends it to 2 - 3 outside experts , who in all likelihood are people you know , even though they are technically anonymous ( scientific communities are generally pretty small ) .
These reviewers pass judgment on the significance of the work , as well as look for flaws in the reasoning or experiments .
A paper is usually rejected , either before or after review , for one of three major reasons : 1 . The paper will only get the scientists in your specialty excited , so it does n't belong in Nature ( or Science , or Cell , or PLoS Biology , etc. ) - most of these journals reject 80 % - 95 % of the papers they receive .
2 . The paper needs more - in Scientific Blogging terms , it 's a blog post , not a feature article .
Journals want feature articles .
( My recent paper fell victim to this particular criticism . )
3 . There is some horrendous flaw , completely obvious to the reviewers but missed by you , your labmates , your friends in the department - except for that one curmudgeon who kept badgering you at your talks , telling you that you need to do experiment X , which you thought was ridiculous and too much work anyway .
While the odds may not look good , many of the scientists I work with ( and I agree with them , in spite of my recent rejection experience ) think that peer - review is n't stringent enough .
All of the safeguards notwithstanding , many mediocre papers still get published .
This is my long - winded way of getting to the point of this whole post : when you read about scientific breakthroughs in the media , remember that these breakthroughs have not yet passed the most stringent test of peer - review : the approval of more than just the 4 people who reviewed it before publication ; the real test is whether the dozens or hundreds of scientists working in the same field find the results persuasive .
When these people start using and citing the results , then you know that the results have some merit - although in the end , they still may be wrong .
Self - Parody : Pessimistic Bias in the Media By Bryan Caplan
I while back I argued that it ’s easy to detect media bias from headlines alone .
A recent NYT piece on life expectancy makes my point for me better than I ever could .
The facts : U.S. life expectancy for all income levels rose .
The headline : “ Gap in Life Expectancy Widens for the Nation . ”

Oh , Metallica , why can't you get it right ?
The band seemed to have learned somewhat from the dark days of the Napster debacle by offering fans online access to pre-release material and in - studio video footage , but now it has apparently unleashed another potentially damaging fiasco upon itself by forcing bloggers to take down reviews of their upcoming album .
Metallica representatives played the album for The Quietus contributor " Bob Mulhouse " in London last Wednesday , after he did what one would expect : he posted a review on his blog .
They did , after all , invite him to listen to it , knowing that he reviewed music online .
Soon thereafter , the band 's management had the review expunged from the internet , along with other early reviews that were a result of the same listening party .
" Metallica held an album listening party for selected music journalistsin London this Wednesday past , " Quietus editor Luke Turner told Blinded by the Hype ( via Idolator ) .
" One of the writers was kind enough to write a piece about the albumwhich , if you were lucky enough to read it before it was taken down ,
was full of praise about a return to form .
At no point was the writerask[ed ] to sign a non-disclosure agreement .
The Quietus and otherwebsites ran pieces on the album , but were quickly contacted byMetallica 's management via a third party and told to remove thearticles . "
Let me get this straight ...
Metallica held a listening party formusic reviewers and was surprised when some of them wrote reviews ?
Thathas to be a public relations first .
Update : Some sources say that Metallica 's representatives requested that the reviews were taken down because the listening party heard an early mix of the album .
It 's still unclear why Metallica 's management did n't require the reviewers to sign non-disclosure agreements if they did n't want them to write about it .
" The Quietus kept our article up the longest and , as nonon - disclosure agreement had been signed , [ was ] not prepared to removeit merely due to the demands of Metallica 's management , " Turner continued .
" We onlyeventually removed the article earlier today to protect theprofessional interests of the writer concerned ( the piece was writtenanonymously ) . "
Ironically , the offending review was n't even negative : " This albumcould be good , or it could be mediocre – too much depends on the otherfour songs to make a call at this point . "
Or , it wo n't matter because Metallica 's foot is even bigger than its mouth .

A marshmallow toasting dragon slayer from Montréal asked about the unary & .
I like this question , because when I saw it , I realized immediately that although I ’ve figured out how to use it to accomplish certain things , writing an answer serves the excellent purpose of forcing myself to learn more .
Let ’s start with what I do know , and what everyone can figure out from grepping source code :
It has something to do with converting things to and from blocks .
If you take nothing else away from this , remember that when you see a unary “ & ” in Ruby , you are looking at making something into a block , or making a block into something .
Now , blocks in Ruby are not first - class entities .
You can not store them in variables .
They are not objects .
There is no Block . new expression .
The only way to make a block in Ruby syntax is to write one as part of a method call , like this :
[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] .map { |x| x * x } => [ 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 25 ]
As we said above , you cannot assign a block to a variable :
square_block = { |x| x * x } => syntax error , unexpected ' } ' , expecting $ end
What do we do with these blocks ?
Well , inside of a method , we can yield to a block .
Yielding to a block is something very much like calling a function .
The value of an expression yielding to a block is the value of the expression in the block , paramaterized by anything you pass in the yield expression .
Oh heck , an example is much better :
def take_a_guess ( range ) # expects a block testing a guess guess = range .
begin + rand( range.end - range.begin ) if yield ( guess )
" Yay , I guessed correctly " else " Boo hoo , my guess was wrong " end end take_a_guess ( 1..10 ) { |x| x == 6 } =>
" Boo hoo , my guess was wrong " take_a_guess ( 1..10 ) { |x| x == 6 } =>
" Boo hoo , my guess was wrong " take_a_guess ( 1..10 ) { |x| x == 6 } =>
" Yay , I guessed correctly "
This method plays a guessing game with you : it takes a range ( “ guess a number from one to ten ” ) and a block for testing whether the guess was correct .
It takes a guess and yield the guess to the block .
It then exclaims its joy to the world if it guesses correctly .
Notice that there is nothing in the method signature saying it expects a block .
There is no name for the block .
You have to look for the yield keyword to figure out what is going on if the programmer does n’t add a comment .
converting blocks to procs
So …
Let ’s talk conversions .
If you want to do anything besides invoke a block with yield , you really want a Proc , not a block .
For example :
class Guesser attr_reader : range , : tester def initialize ( range , &tester ) @range , @tester = range , tester end def take_a_guess guess = range .
begin + rand( range.end - range.begin ) if tester.call( guess )
" Yay , I guessed #{guess} correctly " else " Boo hoo , my guess of #{guess} was wrong " end end end foo = Guesser.new ( 1..10 ) { |n| n == 6 } foo.take_a_guess =>
" Boo hoo , my guess of 2 was wrong " foo.
take_a_guess =>
" Boo hoo , my guess of 8 was wrong " foo.
take_a_guess =>
" Yay , I guessed 6 correctly "
We want to store the tester block as an instance variable .
So what we do is add a parameter at the very end with an ampersand , and what Ruby does is take the block and convert it to a Proc , which you can pass around as an object .
And when you want to use it , you send it the #call method .
Now if you think about this for a second or two , you ’ll realize that almost every Proc you ever create works this way :
We pass a block to a method , and the method turns it into a proc by having a parameter with an & .
Let ’s try writing another one :
def our_proc( &proc ) proc end double = our_proc { |n| n * 2} double.call(7 ) => 14
Not much to it , is there ?
When you want a Proc , you can create one by calling a method with a block and using ¶meter to convert the block to a Proc .
There is no other way to convert a block to a proc because the only place blocks exist is in method invocations .
converting procs to blocks
Okay , we know how to make a Proc out of a block .
What about going the other way ?
What if we want to make a block out of a Proc ?
Let ’s reopen our Guesser class :
class Guesser def three_guesses guesses = Array.new ( 3 ) { range.
begin + rand( range.end - range.begin ) } if guesses.any ?( &tester ) " Yay , #{guesses . join ( ' , ' ) } includes a correct guess " else " Boo hoo , my guesses of #{guesses . join ( ' , ' ) } were wrong " end end end bar = Guesser.new ( 1..10 ) { |x| x == 3 } bar.
three_guesses =>
" Yay , 5 , 9 , 3 includes a correct guess "
What just happened ?
For starters , we made an array with three guesses in it .
That line of code includes a block , but let ’s ignore that as being irrelevant to this particular discussion .
The next part is what we ’re after :
We then want to call Enumerable #any ?
to ask the array if any of its members are the correct guess .
Now #any ?
expects a block .
But we do n’t have a block , we have a Proc .
So now we do the reverse of what we did when we wanted to convert a block to a Proc : instead of a method having an extra parameter with an ampersand , we pass a parameter to the method and apply the ampersand to the parameter we are passing .
So “ &tester ” says to Ruby : “ Take this object and pass it to a method as a block . ”
The #any ?
method gets a block , it has no idea we are doing any Proc to block conversion shenanigans .
We can prove that :
def did_you_pass_me_a_block ? if block_given ?
yield else " NO BLOCK " end end did_you_pass_me_a_block ? => " NO BLOCK " did_you_pass_me_a_block ?
{ ' I passed you a block ' } =>
" I passed you a block " proc = Proc.new { ' I passed you a proc ' } did_you_pass_me_a_block ?( &proc ) =>
" I passed you a proc "
As you can see , our methods do n’t really know whether they get a block or a proc passed as a block .
They just yield and all is well .
( And yes , you can convert a block to a proc and then the method can convert it right back into another proc . )
to_proc shakur
Which leads us to the final piece of the puzzle .
How does Ruby convert whatever you pass with “ & ” into a block ?
The answer is that if it is not already a Proc , it tries to convert the object to a Proc by calling the object ’s # to_proc method , and from there it converts the Proc into a block .
So you can do fun stuff like convert strings into blocks by defining a method that converts a string to a Proc :
( 1..5 ) .map &'* 2 ' => [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ]
Note that this conversion only happens when you try to pass a string as a block to a method with “ &. ”
It is not correct to say that “ & ” converts an object to a Proc , the #to_proc method does that .
It is correct to say that when passing an object to a method , the “ & ” unary operator tries to convert the object to a block , using the Object ’s # to_proc method if need be .
We ’ll close with an example , where we decide that a Guesser can be converted to a Proc :
class Guesser def to_proc Proc.new { |guess | " Yay , I guessed #{guess} correctly " if tester.call( guess ) } end end foo = Guesser.new ( 1..10 ) { |n| n == 8 } & foo => syntax error , unexpected tAMPER foo.to_proc => #< Proc:0x0008cc08@-:26 > ( 1..100 ) .map( foo).compact.first =>
ArgumentError : wrong number of arguments ( 1 for 0 ) ( 1..100 ) .map(&foo ).compact.first =>
" Yay , I guessed 8 correctly "
So that ’s it :
When you want to convert a block to a Proc , define an extra parameter for your method and preface it with an ampersand .
When the method is called , the parameter will hold a proc .
When you want to convert any object to a block , pass it to a method expecting a block and preface it with an ampersand .
Ruby will call the #to_proc method if need be , then convert the Proc into a block .
because it ’s friday
I really hate writing anything too serious on a Friday .
So if you ’re eyes have glazed over and you ’ve marked this to be read later , here ’s a little diversion for you .
I just picked up The Magic Garden of George B. And Other Logic Puzzles by my favourite nonfiction author , Raymond Smullyan .
Right off the bat , the first paragraphs of the preface introduce a neat puzzle :
Here is a remarkable problem : Imagine a garden of magic flowers that can change color from day to day .
On any one day , a flower is either blue the entire day or red the entire day , but can change from one day to another .
Given any flower A and any flower B , there is a flower C that is red on all and only those days on which A and B are both blue .
Also , we are given that for any distinct flowers A and B , there is at least one day on which A and B are of different colors .
Now suppose that the number of flowers is somewhere between 200 and 500 .
How many flowers are in the garden ?
Amazingly enough , the problem actually has a unique solution !
Does n’t this surprise you ?
Have fun !

Cosmic microwave background could hold clues about the Big Bang A team of physicists has claimed that our view of the early Universe may contain the signature of a time before the Big Bang .
The discovery comes from studying the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , light emitted when the Universe was just 400,000 years old .
Their model may help explain why we experience time moving in a straight line from yesterday into tomorrow .
Details of the work have been submitted to the journal Physical Review Letters .
The CMB is relic radiation that fills the entire Universe and is regarded as the most conclusive evidence for the Big Bang .
Although this microwave background is mostly smooth , the Cobe satellite in 1992 discovered small fluctuations that were believed to be the seeds from which the galaxy clusters we see in today 's Universe grew .
Every time you break an egg or spill a glass of water you 're learning about the Big Bang
Professor Sean Carroll ,
California Institute of Technology Dr Adrienne Erickcek , from the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , and colleagues now believe these fluctuations contain hints that our Universe " bubbled off " from a previous one .
Their data comes from Nasa 's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) , which has been studying the CMB since its launch in 2001 .
Their model suggests that new universes could be created spontaneously from apparently empty space .
From inside the parent universe , the event would be surprisingly unspectacular .
Arrow of time Describing the team 's work at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) in St Louis , Missouri , co-author Professor Sean Carroll explained that " a universe could form inside this room and wed never know " .
The inspiration for their theory is n't just an explanation for the Big Bang our Universe experienced 13.7 billion years ago , but lies in an attempt to explain one of the largest mysteries in physics - why time seems to move in one direction .
Nasa 's WMAP has been studying the CMB since 2001
The laws that govern physics on a microscopic scale are completely reversible , and yet , as Professor Carroll commented , " no one gets confused about which is yesterday and which is tomorrow " .
Physicists have long blamed this one - way movement , known as the " arrow of time " , on a physical rule known as the second law of thermodynamics , which insists that systems move over time from order to disorder .
This rule is so fundamental to physics that pioneering astronomer Arthur Eddington insisted that " if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope ; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation " .
The second law cannot be escaped , but Professor Carroll pointed out that it depends on a major assumption - that the Universe began its life in an ordered state .
This makes understanding the roots of this most fundamental of laws a job for cosmologists .
" Every time you break an egg or spill a glass of water , you 're learning about the Big Bang , " Professor Carroll explained .
Before the bang
In his presentation , the Caltech astronomer explained that by creating a Big Bang from the cold space of a previous universe , the new universe begins its life in just such an ordered state .
The apparent direction of time - and the fact that it's hard to put a broken egg back together - is the consequence .
Much work remains to be done on the theory : the researchers ' first priority will be to calculate the odds of a new universe appearing from a previous one .
In the meantime , the team has turned to the results from WMAP .
Detailed measurements made by the satellite have shown that the fluctuations in the microwave background are about 10 % stronger on one side of the sky than those on the other .
Sean Carroll conceded that this might just be a coincidence , but pointed out that a natural explanation for this discrepancy would be if it represented a structure inherited from our universe 's parent .
Meanwhile , Professor Carroll urged cosmologists to broaden their horizons : " We 're trained to say there was no time before the Big Bang , when we should say that we do n't know whether there was anything - or if there was , what it was . "
If the Caltech team 's work is correct , we may already have the first information about what came before our own Universe .

Rafael Nadal looks to build on a promising start to his quest to match Roger Federer 's 20 Grand Slam titles at the French Open on Wednesday while Serena Williams faces a familiar foe in round two of her latest push to equal Margaret Court 's all - time mark .
The armored fish Materpiscis attenboroughi , which appeared during the Devonian Period , may have given birth to its young tail - first , similar to some sharks and rays .
An armored fish was about to become a mom some 380 million years ago .
Though the primitive fish perished , its fossilized remains remarkably reveal an embryo and umbilical cord inside the soon - to - be mother 's body .
The discovery marks the oldest evidence of an animal giving live birth , pushing the known record of such reproduction back by some 200 million years .
It also supports the idea that internal fertilization in vertebrates ( animals with backbones ) originated in a group of primitive fish .
" When I first saw the embryo inside the mother fish , my jaw dropped , " said researcher John Long , a paleontologist at Museum Victoria in Melbourne , Australia .
" It dawned on me after studying the specimen that this was the earliest evidence of vertebrates having sex by copulation — not just spawning in water , but sex that was fun . "
The new species called Materpiscis attenboroughi is a type of placoderm , a group of extinct , armored fish with bone - crushing jaws that ruled the seas throughout the Devonian Period , from 417 million to 354 million years ago .
During an expedition funded by the Australian Research Council , Long and his colleagues discovered the fish remains buried in the Gogo Formation , a renowned treasure trove of well - preserved fish fossils .
When Materpiscis lived , this area in Western Australia was a tropical reef teeming with life .
The female placoderm measured less than 10 inches ( 25 cm ) in length .
And tucked inside what the researchers speculate was the uterus , the tiny tot was about 25 percent of its adult size .
" The large size of the embryo relative to the mother indicates that the young of this fish were born well - formed , a strategy that may have evolved to counter predation from other larger fishes , " said Steven Salisbury of the University of Queensland , who was not involved in the current study .
Long 's team also re-analyzed a previously discovered placoderm ( Austroptyctodus gardineri ) , finding possibly three embryos in the fish 's body .
This pregnant placoderm lived during the same time as Materpiscis .
The two pregnant placoderms make the case that some primitive fish had remarkably advanced reproductive biology , comparable to that of modern rays and sharks , the researchers say in the May 29 issue of the journal Nature .
Examples in the fossil record of animals giving birth are extremely rare .
Scientists announced in 2006 the discovery of remains of a pregnant ichthyosaur that lived about 100 million years ago .
Google famously bid on the 700MHz spectrum auction that wrapped up last week , but was outbid by Verizon .
Most observers have characterized Google as an ecstatic loser , since the FCC 's open access rules that it wanted so badly will have to be followed by Verizon .
With the auction behind it , Google is turning its attention to another wireless broadband initiative , the push to open up the " white space " in the digital TV spectrum for web access .
Today , the company ratcheted up the pressure on the FCC to act on the white space issue , submitting a letter to the Commission outlining its plans for the spectrum .
Google believes that the empty spaces in the television spectrum used by channels 2 through 51 should be made available once analog television transmissions end in February 2009 .
" TV white spaces can provide uniquely low - cost mobile broadband coverage for all Americans , " wrote Google in its FCC ex parte filing ( PDF ) .
" In the context of TV white space , consumers will be able to enjoy robust access to the Internet , including the ability to download and utilize any lawful applications or content that is desired . "
The search giant is even willing to throw its considerable financial and technical resources behind the effort .
" Google also would be willing to provide , at no cost to third parties , the technical support necessary to make these plans happen , " reads the filing .
" This could include intellectual property and reference designs for underlying technologies , open geo-databases maintained by Google , and other supporting infrastructure . "
Since its inception last year , the white spaces project has seen its fair share of controversy .
Prototype devices submitted to the FCC have not performed as hoped , with some of the blame due to broken hardware .
The FCC is currently testing prototype devices capable of sensing the presence of digital TV and other transmissions , including those of wireless microphones .
Testing is scheduled to continue throughout this week .
This is what will happen to your digital TV picture
if white
space
broadband becomes a reality , according to the NAB
Broadcasters have seized upon every testing hiccup to argue that the white spaces should be left alone .
The National Association of Broadcasters , in particular , is bitterly opposed to allowing unlicensed broadband service in the white spaces .
Last month , the group said that the hardware problems experienced by the White Space Coalition 's devices " vindicates beyond doubt the interference concerns expressed by broadcasters , sports leagues , wireless microphone companies , and theater operators . "
Other groups weighing in on the issue include the National Football League , wireless microphone manufacturers , and even audio engineers .
Audio equipment manufacturer
Shure said that " important wireless microphone systems " would be at " severe risk of disruption " if the sub -700MHz spectrum is used for wireless broadband .
The NFL is concerned that white space devices would cause " debilitating interference " with the microphones used by its referees .
Google believes those concerns are groundless , saying that there 's no risk to broadcasters and those who use wireless microphones .
" There are many ways to safely and reliably protect DTVs and wireless microphones , not all of which require spectrum sensing , " argues the search giant .
White space devices would rely on " all clear " signals from a database of licensed transmitters or a " geo-located device with access to that database . "
Devices without database or geo-location access would not transmit at all .
The search giant also suggests the use of inexpensive " beacons " by wireless microphones to prevent interference .
Channels 36 -38 would be completely off - limits to white space broadband to prevent interference with radio astronomy services and medical telemetry devices that use spectrum assigned to channel 37 .
" The future is now , " Google concludes .
" The value of the TV white space to all Americans simply is too great to allow this unique opportunity to be blocked by unfounded fear , uncertainty , and doubt . "
Your hunch is correct .
Your cat decided to live with you , not the other way around .
The sad truth is , it may not be a final decision .
But do n’t take this feline diffidence personally .
It runs in the family .
And it goes back a long way — about 12,000 years , actually .
Those are among the inescapable conclusions of a genetic study of the origins of the domestic cat , being published today in the journal Science .
The findings , drawn from an analysis of nearly 1,000 cats around the world , suggest that the ancestors of today ’s tabbies , Persians and Siamese wandered into Near Eastern settlements at the dawn of agriculture .
They were looking for food , not friendship .
They found what they were seeking in the form of rodents feeding on stored grain .
They stayed for 12 millennia , although not without wandering off now and again to consort with their wild cousins .
The story is quite different from that of other domesticated animals : cattle , sheep , goats , horses — and dogs , cats ’ main rivals for human affection .
It may even provide insight on the behavior of the animal that , if not man ’s best friend , is certainly his most inscrutable .
“ It is a story about one of the more important biological experiments ever undertaken , ” said Stephen J. O’Brien , a molecular geneticist at the National Cancer Institute ’s laboratory in Frederick , Md. , and one of the supervisors of the project .
“ We think what happened is that cats sort of domesticated themselves , ” said Carlos A. Driscoll , the University of Oxford graduate student who did the work , which required him , among other things , to befriend feral cats on the Mongolian steppes .
Today , there are 37 species in the family Felidae , ranging from lions through ocelots down to little Mittens .
All domestic cats are descended from the species Felis sylvestris ( ” cat of the woods ” ) , which goes by the common name “ wildcat . ”
The species is indigenous to Europe , the Middle East and East Asia .
The New World , Japan and Oceania lack wildcats .
North America ’s closest counterpart is the lynx .
There are five subspecies of wildcats , and they look very much like many pet cats , particularly non-pedigree ones .
The Scottish wildcat , for example , is indistinguishable from a barn cat with a mackerel tabby coat .
These animals , however , are a true wild species .
They are not escaped pets that have become feral , or reverted to the wild .
Driscoll and his collaborators , who included Oxford zoologist David Macdonald , took blood samples and ear punch biopsies from all wildcat subspecies as well as from fancy - breed cats , non-pedigree pet cats and feral cats .
They analyzed two kinds of genetic fingerprints : nuclear DNA , which carries nearly all of an animal ’s genes and reflects inheritance from both parents , and mitochondrial DNA , which exists outside the cell nucleus , carries only a few genes and descends through the generations only from mothers .
Both fingerprints showed that domesticated cats around the world are most closely related to the wildcat subspecies ( called lybica ) that lives in the Near East .
( War prevented the sampling of Iraqi wildcats , but the researchers believe those animals are of the same species as animals they collected samples from in Israel and on the Arabian Peninsula . )
One might think that people in each region would have domesticated their local wildcats .
In that case , European pet cats today would genetically most closely resemble European wildcats and Chinese cats would be descended from East Asian wildcats .
But that is n’t the case .
Why not ?
Genetics can’t answer the question , but history and archaeology can provide a good guess .
Large - scale grain agriculture began in the Near East ’s Fertile Crescent .
With the storage of surplus grain came mice , which fed on it and contaminated it .
Settled farming communities with dense rodent populations were a new habitat .
Wildcats came out of the woods and grasslands to exploit it .
They may have lived close to man — but not petting - close — for centuries .
Eventually , though , natural selection favored individual animals whose genetic makeup by chance made them tolerant of human contact .
Such behavior provided them with things — a night indoors , the occasional bowl of milk — that allowed them to out - compete their scaredy - cat relatives .
For people , it was a great package — agriculture , food surplus ( and all the civilizing effects that came with it ) , with domesticated cats thrown in to protect the wealth by eating the mice .
“ When that technology was transferred to other cultures , so were the cats , ” said Robert Wayne , an evolutionary biologist at the University of California in Los Angeles .
Therein lies the reason other cultures did n’t domesticate local wildcats , he said .
“ Why reinvent the wheel ? ”
This is not true with other acts of animal domestication .
Genetic studies have shown that cattle , goats , sheep , pigs and water buffalo were all domesticated at least twice in independent events .
With horses , it happened many times .
The consequence of one other feline behavior — the average cat ’s uncertainty about whether it wants to be indoors or out — was also written in the genes Driscoll studied .
He found that a significant fraction of wildcats in Europe , southern Africa and central Asia were hybrids .
They carried genetic evidence of having tomcatted around from time to time with their domesticated relatives .

Reflections on Attending the 2008 Libertarian Party Convention in Denver
DIGG THIS
Just this past weekend ( 5/22—25/08 ) I attended the Libertarian Party Convention in Denver .
In what follows are some reflections on this experience , and ruminations on the future of the party in particular , and on the libertarian movement in general .
I had heard , beforehand , that the LP was on the verge of being taken over by conservatives , and nothing in my experience of that convention was incompatible with that surmise .
The first evidence I personally witnessed in this regard was the high profile and very well - received speech of Richard Viguerie , of all people .
Thought I , uh , oh , what oh what is this conservative fund raiser even doing at an LP convention , let alone addressing it at a plenary session ?
The second time my nose was pushed into this new conservative reality of the LP was when the moderator of the presidential debate was announced : Jim Pinkerton .
Happily , as his conservative credentials were being read to the audience in his introduction , there was widespread booing and hissing reverberating around the large hall .
Well , maybe , not all that widespread ; I was doing so much of it myself that I failed to realize that this was not at all the majority opinion of the assembled delegates .
To be fair to Mr. Pinkerton , apart from one minor non-ideological glitch — he asked one question out of order — I thought he did an excellent job as moderator .
But why oh why was he chosen in the first place ?
Were there no libertarian moderators around ?
The main indication of the new conservative orientation of the Libertarian Party ( writing this last phrase , I confess , was very irksome ; but the truth is the truth ) was of course the election of Bob Barr as its presidential candidate , and of Wayne Allyn Root for vice president .
Why do I say this ?
That question is equivalent to asking why I consider both of these men to be conservatives , not libertarians ; well , okay , conservative libertarians .
In some sense , this claim of mine is difficult to defend , for , surely , there is a gradation between these two views ; there is no hard and clear distinction to be made between libertarianism and conservatism .
Certainly , there are conservative libertarians , and libertarian conservatives .
How , then , simply , to distinguish Barr and Root from " real " libertarians ?
I suggest two litmus tests : foreign policy and drug legalization .
Lord knows , libertarians disagree on many things .
Heck , if you get 10 libertarians into a discussion , you ’ll have 10 different opinions on many things , maybe even 11 .
But , there is unlikely to be any difference of opinion on the importance of ending U.S. foreign imperialistic interventionism , right now , and legalizing drugs , all of them , immediately .
Both are clear violations of the libertarian non-aggression axiom , if ever there were any .
How , then , do Barr and Root stack up on these two questions .
At the convention , neither would clearly and unambiguously commit themselves to the libertarian position on either of these two questions .
Both avoided a clear commitment to pulling U.S. troops , all of them , out of the some 730 military bases now located in roughly 130 different countries around the globe .
They evaded questions attempting to elicit clear positions on these two issues .
On the drug question they both hid behinds states ’ rights : it is not a federal issue ; they are running not for state but federal office ; therefore , let the states decide .
In any case , they would only commit themselves to medical marijuana , not its recreational use , and legalization of anything stronger would certainly be anathema to them .
On foreign policy , they would only make " major " troop withdrawals , not total and complete ones .
Since Ron Paul , a member of the Republican Party , not only embraces these two planks , but makes them central elements of his candidacy for that party ’s presidential nomination , we have arrived at an anomalous pass where a prominent member of the GOP is more libertarian than the two standard bearers of the LP .
Who would have anticipated such a sorry state of affairs ?
Who would have thunk it ?
Poor Murray Rothbard must be spinning in his grave .
But perhaps I am being unfair .
Perhaps I misheard , some of the answers of Barr and Root in the presidential debate .
After all , they came thick and fast .
Candidates were allowed only a minute or two for responses .
Maybe I got the wrong impressions ?
In order to determine this , let us go to the record .
Here is Root on war :
" The WAR in Iraq : * Republicans say “ stay forever ” ( or 100 years as John McCain predicted ) .
Wrong answer .
Democrats say “ Go right now . ”
Wrong answer .
It is a much more complicated issue than that .
I believe the answer must involve a combination of nuance , compromise and common - sense .
* Admit the Iraq war is a disaster .
* Admit post - war planning was a disaster .
* Admit it ’s a civil war in Iraq — and our boys do not belong in the middle of a civil war .
Our troops are not policeman .
* Use the success of the surge to declare victory and make plans to get out of Iraq as soon as reasonably possible "
Well , yes .
Our servicemen should not police a civil war , and , it cannot be denied that the Iraq " police action " has been a total , complete and utter disaster .
But , leave " as soon as reasonably possible ? "
Why , you can drive a big truck through that loophole .
Why is " right now " the " wrong answer " ?
In making this claim , Root shows himself as less libertarian than even many members of the Democratic party .
And here is Root on drugs :
" * The war on drugs is a failure — this is one of the biggest wastes of taxpayer money .
Let ’s start with legalization of medical marijuana — this is a states ’ rights issue .
The federal government has no constitutional right to interfere in this issue versus states that have approved the use of medical marijuana by individuals . "
Again , yes .
The war on drugs is a failure .
Our jails are bulging with victimless criminals , there has been murder and mayhem on our city ’s streets , and there is widespread talk of invading countries other than those in the " axis of evil " which do not follow our crop " recommendations . "
Sure , let ’s , indeed " start with legalization of medical marijuana . "
But , if this is truly " a states ’ rights issue " why does our Libertarian Party Vice Presidential Candidate ( I did n’t enjoy writing that , either ) even mention it ?
And what , pray tell , about the victimless crime of recreational marijuana , to say nothing about the harder drugs ?
What of Congressman Barr on these two issues ?
Look at this site ; it shows Mr. Barr in a very poor libertarian light , to say the least , not only on foreign policy and drugs , but on a whole host of other important issues ; see , also , in this regard here , here and here .
Most telling is a recent appearance of his on Fox television .
See here for Barr on Hannity and Colmes .
For once , I was actually rooting for Hannity ( will we in the future see him running for president on the LP ticket ?
He favors free enterprise , does he not ? )
Hannity was trying to get to the bottom of Barr ’s views on drugs , but the latter was too canny for the former .
Now that we have discussed some of the major indications that LP has taken a sharp right turn toward conservatism , here are some minor ones :
one of the speakers at the banquet to celebrate the Barr - Root victory ( the mayor of a small town in Wisconsin ?
Minnesota ?
He had a failed run at the governorship of that state ) had a slip of the tongue ; instead of saying " We libertarians … . "
He said " You libertarians … "
the treatment of Anthony Gregory .
I regard Anthony as one of the most notable of the younger generation of libertarian theoreticians .
Indeed , his very numerous ( he has contributed no fewer than 160 columns to LewRockwell.com ) and highly impressive publications , his magnificent insights , his brilliant and inspiring lecturing ability , already in my opinion render him one of the leaders of the entire libertarian movement , young as he is ( 27 years old ) .
I knew and was a friend of Roy Childs , Jr. , all during his life .
Had Roy not been taken from us at an altogether too young age , would have made even more signal contributions to the cause of liberty .
In my opinion , Anthony shows all the promise of equaling , or even surpassing , the contributions of Roy Childs .
How was Anthony treated at this convention ?
Well , he was offered no fewer than three speaking opportunities , which is fine .
Indeed , it is perfectly consistent with his accomplishments .
But , two of them were scheduled for small breakout rooms , with a total capacity of about 20 .
His third talk was at a plenary session , but it was scheduled during a dinner break on Saturday , May 24 , right before the momentous presidential debate .
I was in the room ; it had a seating capacity of about 1000 ; I would estimate that only about two - dozen people were in attendance .
Fortunately , his magnificent extemporaneous talk was based on this column , his 160th LewRockwell.com entry , and thus is available for posterity .
All three of his presentations are available here , here and here .
( Editor ’s note : the speeches given by Gregory , Block and Edelstein are not yet available ; they will be inserted in the spots indicated when they are .
Look at these spaces in about a week or so , except for Gregory ’s , which will be up within a few months ) .
But my favorite talk of his ( of course I attended all three of them ) was the one where he attempted to wrestle with the question of when is a political compromise pro-liberty , and when is it anti-liberty .
There must have been , oh , 8 people in attendance , roughly the same size of his third audience .
I also very much liked that analysis of his of rights and privileges , with a similar sized audience .
my own experiences .
I was treated in roughly the same manner .
I was scheduled for two talks , both in breakout rooms .
I volunteered to give a third speech .
My first , on economics for libertarians , had an overflow in the small room with room for 20 .
Fortunately , we were able to move to a " large " hall , where I had an audience of about 60 .
My second two speeches , on libertarian punishment theory and fallacies , misconceptions and controversies in libertarianism , had audiences of 3 and 7 , respectively .
No , those numbers are not misprints .
My three talks are available here , here and here .
there was a motion to thank U.S. servicemen for tasks performed abroad .
It was approved overwhelmingly ; there were no objections .
Since their military activity takes place mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan , I had a hard time reconciling this with the libertarian non-aggression axiom
Dr. Mary Ruwart offered a motion to thank Dr. Ron Paul for his services to libertarianism .
This was not approved of overwhelmingly .
Instead , there were calls to examine the verbiage , because some of the words " needed more careful study " in the ( paraphrase ) view of a delegate who objected .
Fortunately , this was beaten down in a vote by the assembly .
Vince Miller , proprietor of Laissez Faire Books , told me that they had sold more publications at a recent meeting attended by 80 libertarians , than the so called Libertarian Party convention which had almost 2000 attendees .
When told by someone that it was surprising that so few sales were made to libertarians , he corrected the speaker and said that most of the delegates were conservatives , not libertarians .
By the way , a grand total of 11 copies of my book Defending the Undefendable were sold , as were a total of 3 of my new book Labor Economics from a Free Market Perspective : Employing the Unemployable .
Enough with the negativism .
What are some of the positive elements of the LP convention experience , 2008 ?
First and foremost was Dr. Mary Ruwart .
She was magnificent .
I can think of no better way to say this than that Murray Rothbard would have been proud of her .
She was the leader of the radical ( non Barr - Root ) caucus .
Her every spoken word was a credit to our movement .
My favorite statement of hers was when she nominated Steve Kubby for the party ’s vice presidency , saying something to the effect that we should have at least one libertarian on the ticket , someone who favors legalization of all drugs , not just marijuana for medicinal use .
Second is another libertarian woman , Christine Smith .
She was also a candidate for the presidency , and did yeoman work in supporting libertarian principle all throughout the proceedings .
The highlight of her contribution from my perspective was when she made an impassioned plea to the assembly to the effect that Congressman Barr was not a libertarian ; his views on foreign policy , drugs , and several other issues were entirely incompatible with libertarian principle .
It was difficult for me to hear her , though , so loud were the boos and hisses from the conservative delegates .
Well , I suppose , if you ca n’t refute an argument , the conservative tactic is to make it impossible for the speaker to be heard .
( In contrast , when the libertarians were expressing outrage with the Republican credentials of Pinkerton , we were not trying to drown out his introduction ) .
I got to hang around my very good friends Anthony Gregory and Michael Edelstein .
I got to hear magnificent presentations by both of them ( Michael spoke on libertarian feuding , burnout and public speaking : see here ; available soon ) .
I renewed ties with dozens of friends and acquaintances I have n’t seen in years and even decades ( boy , did they look old ) ; for example , Dave Walters , Joe Cobb , Dean Ahmad , Vince Miller , Jim Elwood , Jim Peron , Jim Lark , Manny Klausner , Sharon Harris , David Nolan , Willie Marshall , Michael Cloud , George Phillies .
I met , oh , another two - dozen interesting libertarians with whom I will now be in contact
I did greatly enjoy the libertarian twists placed on the state by state voting announcements : " we ’re from the state of X , home of bad guy Y , but we apologize for that . "
" We ’re from the state that has the lowest taxes , the greatest growth in LP membership , etc . "
One of the most moving of these announcements was made by my own state LP chairman from Louisiana , Adrien Monteleone , who thanked the assembly for the voluntary help afforded us in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and attacked FEMA .
Another positive element of the 2008 LP Convention is that Barr will take more votes from McCain than Mary Ruwart would have .
I am already on record as favoring socialist Obama over mad dog McCain , so this is all to the good .
If Mary Ruwart had won the LP nomination , and Obama beat out Hillary for the Democratic one as seems likely as of this writing , Mary might have attracted the votes of many ( non-ideological ) women , but this probably would have been more at the expense of the Democrats than the Republicans .
Look , if you are determined to find a silver lining in this LP debacle , here ’s one ; do n’t blame me that it is so pathetic .
What of the future ?
What should libertarians now do ?
Quit the party en masse ?
Set up a new party ?
If so , should we call it the Real Libertarian Party ?
Flock to the banner of the Free State Project ?
This all depends in my view upon what happens in the next few months , but , before we consider any of that , let us rehearse the reasons for having a libertarian party in the first place .
Why have a libertarian party at all ?
To promote liberty , of course .
But how ?
Through education !
When the party was started in 1971 , the knowledge of the electorate of libertarianism was , how shall I say this , non existent .
It was commonly confused with libertinism , librarianism , Liberianism , Liberace and libertoonianism , whatever that is .
Come to think of it , while matters are much improved since then , there is still more than quite a bit of that going around still .
( Evidence : Hannity and Colmes of course are no libertarians ; but , they are supposed to be at least knowledgeable about politics ; they show little indication of this in their interview of Barr . )
But if education is the goal , why create , of all things , a political party ?
Why not just start a school , for goodness sakes ?
For two major reasons .
First , the overwhelming majority of people are simply not interested in political issues for most of the year .
Instead , they are concerned with earning a living , taking care of their children , and with their golf , tennis or garden clubs , with pizza , beer and bowling , with professional sports , movies , television , American Idol and , of course , sex .
It is only once every four ( or two ) years that their focus turns in this direction to even the slightest degree .
Then , they will at least pay attention to politics , and the LP was designed to address this educational opportunity .
By and large the Libertarian Party has acquitted itself pretty well in this regard .
Although at the top of the ticket we have garnered only somewhat less than 1 % of the vote , we have attracted more publicity than otherwise would have accrued to us via lower - level successes such as with wins for small town mayors and city councils , and by being the balance of power in close elections between the two major parties in congressional and governorship races .
We are still confused with libertinism , but not , I think , with libraries , Liberace , Liberia or libertoonianism .
As for more narrowly construed education , there are already think tanks such as the Mises Institute , and others , many others , that publish libertarian writings and focus on encouraging young scholars to obtain their PhD degrees , so as to be able to venture into the often unwelcoming ( to libertarians ) academic world .
The second case for a Libertarian Party is that it is practically costless in terms of manpower .
What else could be done with the large number of highly educated and motivated libertarians who are either unable or unwilling to join a free market think tank or become a university professor or journalist , the " secondhand dealers in ideas " of Hayek ?
Think of all the doctors , engineers , lawyers , architects , computer programmers and , yes , plumbers , carpenters , waiters , artists and cab drivers who can only promote libertarianism as amateurs ; that is , they are not paid , as part of their profession , to engage in the promotion of our ideology .
What are they to do ?
Yes , they can and should donate some of their money to libertarian think tanks , and those very few universities that actually promote liberty on net balance .
However , in addition to finances , these people also have energy that , without the vehicle of a libertarian party , would have no outlet .
Well , I suppose they could write letters to the editor , and place flyers on windshield wipers , but an LP is surely a better vehicle to utilize their talents than that .
With this background , we are now ready to consider the future of our beloved LP ( I say this as a long - time member and supporter of the party ; in 1972 I ran for the New York State Assembly , the lower house of the New York congress ; my motto ?
" Block for DisAssembly . "
Since then I have run , once , for the LP Vice President candidacy , and have given dozens of lectures , all around the country , to state LP annual meetings ) .
What should we now do ?
This depends , in my opinion , entirely on what ensues in the coming months .
Here are several possible scenarios :
1 . Barr shows great improvement as a libertarian , whether through osmosis by interacting with libertarians , by reading some libertarian literature , or perhaps by patterning his campaign after Ron Paul’s .
If this happens , we can thank our lucky stars that he and his minions have taken over the LP .
They will likely bring in their train a professionalism lacking in our past .
Barr is sometimes considered the second most libertarian oriented member of any recent congress .
Perhaps this scenario is within the realm of possibility .
He has announced himself as being willing to listen to long time members of the LP , to engage in dialogue with them .
Hey , stranger things have happened !
But , since there is no evidence of this actually occurring , at least as of yet , let us at least consider some less optimistic scenarios .
2 . Barr does not become any more libertarian than he now is ; old dogs , new tricks .
He gets 1— 3 % of the vote , and leaves in disgust .
Not so bad .
We can then have our party back .
More , this would serve as a warning to other professional invaders of the LP : libertarianism is not transferable to non-libertarians .
We have already seen an analogous demonstration of this .
After Ron Paul had such great success with his money " bombs , " other Republican candidates ( e.g. , Fred Thompson ) tried to emulate him .
Instead of the millions raised by Dr. Paul , these pale carbon copies attracted only a few pitiful thousands of dollars .
3 . Barr ’s ideology does not move in our direction , and he gets 5 — 10 % of the vote .
Then , we will have lost our party .
Here , we have the model of the Conservative and Liberal Parties of New York .
They cannot win an election , but the Republican and Democratic Parties have great difficulty in succeeding without their support .
The LP would then be turned into a king maker , e.g. , have a veto over a Republican candidate who was not sufficiently similar to the Barr version of conservatism , that is , one with a libertarian emphasis .
Under this assumption , would it pay to start a new ( real ) libertarian party ?
Well , maybe .
The biggest asset of the LP is its ballot access .
If we succeed , again , with the Real Libertarian Party ( RLP ) would we not set ourselves up for another takeover by some future Barr ?
Maybe the RLP should be local in nature only , so as to not set up as tempting a target , as we were in 2008 .
My bottom line , at least for the moment , is one of wait and see .
The ball is now on Barr ’s side of the net .
Let us see in which direction he smacks it .
By all means , let us attempt to change his mind on issues of importance to us .
He won the election fair and square .
Well , sort of , what with all those Johnny - come - latelies to libertarianism .
At least he did so within the rules we ourselves had set up .
Let us give him a chance .
We need not demand ideological purity .
We would have been deliriously happy with Ron Paul as our LP candidate .
But , Ron ’s stances on immigration and abortion do not comply with that of most libertarians .
For my own views on the first of these two contentious issues , see here , here , here and here .
For the second , see here , here , here , and here .
We cannot expect more of Barr than Paul offers .
Heck , we ’ll take less , far less , and be content .
But , surely , if no congruency on at least foreign policy and the drug war emanate from Barr , then we cannot enthusiastically support him , in my opinion .
Whether we can support him at all remains to be determined , as I see matters .
In the meantime , I urge the strategy of calling / emailing the Barr campaign , offering reasons to end the war now , legalize all drugs , abolish the Fed , etc .
He says he is open to such communication ; let us test this hypothesis .
I wish to acknowledge the help of Michael Edelstein and Lew Rockwell in writing this essay .

Students walk for peace
Posted Wednesday , June 4 , 2008 10:56 am
Wednesday , June 4
WESTMINSTER -- Students from Bellows Falls Union High School got a lesson in American civics Tuesday as about 30 students staged a walkout to protest the Iraq War .
The protesters were met by about a dozen supporters of American policy in the Middle East .
And while administrators kept the two groups far apart , students from both sides made sure their voices were heard .
" This is nice but we all need to get involved in the political process , " said Brendan McPherson , 14 , who helped organize the walkout .
" We need to write our local newspapers and call our Congressmen .
There is so much to do .
This is a small step toward something greater . "
About 20 students from BFUHS got up and left their classes 30 minutes before the final period was scheduled to end .
They were joined by about 10 students from Compass School , which is across the street from the high school .
As the anti-war protesters gathered in front of the school , a small group of boys walked toward them shouting , " Support the war , " and " Let it go on . "
Josh Pratt , 16 , a sophomore , said he was planning to join the Marines .

" They do n't know what 's going on .
They 're all confused , " he said as his cohorts yelled at the protesters .
" They appreciate the benefits of this country and then they screw us over .
They should move to Canada . "
McPherson said he was encouraged by the turnout and also said he welcomed the opposition .
" The best way to end the war is by negotiating with both sides , " he said .
" It 's good they have a different opinion . "

BFUHS Principal Chris Hodsden knew the walkout was planned and he stood out in front of the school before the students appeared .
Hodsden , who served in the Navy , said he supported the students ' right to protest and respected their point of view , but he said he would have been happier to have them do it when school was over .
" We have final exams coming up and every moment in the classroom is precious , " Hodsden said .
" I am a big fan of all the freedoms that go along with being a citizen of this great country , and peaceful protest is part of that , but they could have done it at 2:45 just as easily as 2:15 . "
Hodsden declined to say if the students , on either side of the protest , would be receiving detentions for leaving class .
Angus Gunn , 16 , a student who was protesting the war , said it was important for the group to leave school to make their point .
" The Iraq War is more important than the last 30 minutes of class , " he said .
" The students put this together to show there are things more important than education .
The Iraq War is an important issue we need to address . "

The protesting group held signs that read " diplomacy now , " and " give peace a chance . "
As the afternoon wore on the group stood at one end of the sidewalk .
Buses showed up and some in the group congratulated each other on the action .
Mike McDougal , 16 , first thought about staging a walkout earlier in the year , and as the school year drew to close , he decided it was time to pull it off .
He sent out e-mail messages and spread the word , even sending press releases to area newspapers .
McDougal said when he talked to people at the school there seemed to be widespread support and was expecting a larger turnout , but he was still satisfied with the showing and with the statement they made .
" We have to stop the senseless slaughter .
Having the conversation is a success , " he said .
" I know more kids wanted to be here but maybe they chickened out .
It takes courage to stand up and walk out . "

In February , a B - 2 stealth bomber crashed in Guam .
Now we know why .
And we ’ve got video of the scene .
On takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base , the $ 1.4 billion plane abruptly " pitched up , rolled and yawed to the left before plunging to the ground , " the AP describes .
The reason why : " Water distorted preflight readings in three of the plane ’s 24 sensors , making the aircraft ’s control computer force the B - 2 to pitch up on takeoff , resulting in a stall and subsequent crash . "
Luckily , " both pilots ejected safely just after the left wing made contact with the ground in the first crash since the maiden B - 2 flights nearly 20 years ago . "
Check out the video , and you ’ll see just how fortunate the pilots were to make it out .
( Spotter : CA )
ALSO :
Ask any programmer what his favorite language is good for and he 'll yell , " Everything ! "
At least until his next favorite language comes along , which is also good for everything .
The truth is :
Any language that 's Turing Complete and supports enough language features can solve any problem .
The difference between languages and their usefulness is a matter of degrees of " yak shaving . "
" Yak shaving " is a programmer 's slang term for the distance between a task 's start and completion and the tangential tasks between you and the solution .
If you ever wanted to mail a letter , but could n't find a stamp , and had to drive your car to get the stamp , but also needed to refill the tank with gas , which then let you get to the post office where you could buy a stamp to mail your letter — then you 've done some yak shaving .
MORE ON PROS / CONS of DYNAMIC LANGUAGES
You used Python to Write What ?!
You used JavaScript to Write What ?!
PHP 's Enterprise Strengths and Weaknesses , Take 2
You used PHP to Write What ?!
You used Perl to Write What ?!
Some programming languages and some platforms ( I 'll make the distinction in a bit ) minimize yak shaving .
To create a simple language in Ruby , I have to find multiple undocumented libraries , install byzantine dependencies , track down build errors , find conflicts in things called " hoe " ( which needs rubyforge which needs rake which needs Ruby ) , verify which version of Ruby I 'm using , or try the undocumented lex and yacc integration , find out about Coco / R or other projects , install multiple non-Ruby packages , have the right libraries ( again ) , talk with various people in IRC who do n't want to talk to me — and then , after a few weeks , I might have just the harness done .
Conversely , using ANTLR , without much fuss I can prototype an entire new language in a weekend and deploy it to just about any computer .
It 's not completely effortless ; I can usually create a small parser for a protocol or mini-language in about a day or two using ANTLR and one book by Terrence Parr .
It 's this distance between problem and solution that makes one language more suitable than another for a given task .
Aside : Sure , for the ultrageek in us , these yak - shaving expeditions can be fun , depending on the platform .
I personally would n't do anything more complex than ant build on Java , but on Factor , Lua , Python or Ruby I 'd gladly spend a weekend hacking at something just to prove I could do it ( or to use it for something especially nerd powerful ) .
However , the platform is not the language .
A programming language can be divorced from the physical computer it runs on .
You can run multiple languages on virtual machines , such as the Sun Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) , Microsoft Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) , NekoVM and LLVM ; you can even host Forth in JavaScript in a browser .
The separation of the language used to describe computation from the actual computational device means that programmers can choose various languages for a task , yet IT management can keep deployment platforms standardized and cohesive .
Why is this relevant to Ruby ?
Recently , there 's been a huge push to take Ruby onto both the JVM and the CLR systems .
Ruby 's popularity means that companies like Sun , IBM and Microsoft want to add the language ( and others , such as Python ) to their platforms .
This keeps programmers writing code for the vendors ' platforms and keeps computers in the data center running their ( expensive ) software .
Based on the adoption of Ruby on Rails I 've seen for internal projects in 2008 , this is a smart move .
In Ruby 's case , the ability to host on multiple platforms means that whatever C , Java or C# can do , Ruby can do as well .
The same advantage applies to Groovy , Boo , Python , Scala and JavaScript .
What is left is a matter of style and reducing the number of yaks in the field you have to shave to get the job done .
What Ruby Makes Easy ... and Hard
The original Ruby is called Matz Ruby Interpreter ( MRI ) .
It is a classic interpreter , similar to Perl , but it does n't use any byte code as do Lua , Python and Java .
MRI is written mostly in C ( too much C for some ) and is the gold standard in the Ruby world .
With the MRI , some tasks are incredibly easy to do , and some are insanely difficult .
Systems scripting and automation .
Ruby has the same capabilities as does Perl for regular expression processing , file crunching and system automation .
Ruby has the added advantage in that its syntax is more impervious to obfuscation .
That 's not to say a rogue sysadmin could n't craft something heinous , but you have to try to do something evil in Ruby .
Perl developers have to try to write good , readable code .
MRI also starts up quickly and uses fewer resources than JRuby so it 's more suitable for short - lived cron jobs , long - running monitoring and other system - management tasks .
Web programming , sometimes .
Ruby on Rails ( RoR ) is the latest silver bullet for Web programming .
Hopefully , you know about RoR and are evaluating it for a future project .
RoR is potentially a huge cost - saving framework for developing Web applications .
Complex applications are measured in thousands of lines of code rather than 10 - or 100 - thousands of lines .
Advanced JavaScript libraries and hundreds of active developers building cohesive components also make it much easier to build low - to medium - complexity applications .
The caveat on Ruby for Web programming is that Rails is better suited for building Web applications .
I 've seen many projects attempt to create a WebDAV server or a content management system ( CMS ) with Rails and fail miserably .
While you can do a CMS in Rails , there are much more efficient technologies for the task , such as Drupal and Django .
( In fact , I 'd say if you 're looking at a Java Portal development effort , you should evaluate Drupal and Django for the task instead . )
Simplified APIs for nonexperts .
Ruby 's main strength is metaprogramming .
You can make little languages ( domain - specific languages , or DSLs ) that do n't look like Ruby .
In the hands of an expert , this can turn future problems into simple implementations .
( However , in the hands of an idiot , this can kill a project dead , so read my caveat against this later . )
Ruby on Rails is in fact built like this , as more a DSL for doing Web applications .
Gluing C APIs together .
MRI has a very good C binding API , and newer Ruby VMs like Rubinius will make this even easier .
I 've developed full wrappers to many complex C libraries in a few days .
These C bindings have an object - oriented design and handle garbage collection with little fuss .
It 's trivial to take parts of a Ruby application that do n't perform well and move them to a small C library , and using a system like Ruby2C or Ruby Inline , you can do this almost on the fly .
Prototyping network protocols .
Ruby is a " good enough " language for writing simple servers and clients because of its simple threads , multiple I/O event libraries and protocol libraries for network protocols , including HTTP , SSH , SMTP and many others .
It 's also relatively easy — thanks to Ruby 's very nice string handling — to create complete protocols in a short amount of time .
When combined with advanced parsers like Ragel , you can make the protocols very robust for the majority of use cases , and then switch to C or another language for the heavy lifting .
However , Ruby 's I/O , garbage collection ( GC ) and threads suffer from serious design flaws and performance problems .
Deploying Ruby in any IT department is also a painful experience because of its open - source nature , but see below for why that 's more of a social problem .
Web application testing .
Among Ruby 's strengths are the tools that help a development team make sure the software runs as designed .
Two Ruby libraries , Watir and Selenium , automate testing a site 's user interaction .
Combined with a test automation system like RSpec , Watir can produce complete reports of each test case and failure output , and write the tests in a nice readable format .
Telephony applications .
Jay Philips has a framework called Adhearsion that gives you an amazingly slick syntax for the Asterix telephony platform .
Using Adhearsion , you can write very complex yet clean telephone - based applications ; you also can connect them to Web applications , databases and anything else Ruby can talk to .
If you 're doing any telephone work , it 's worth the few days ' time to try out Asterix and Adhearsion .
JRuby : First , the Pluses
JRuby is another open - source version of Ruby that is sponsored by Sun Microsystems and runs on the JVM .
If you are an all - Java shop but want to try out the new hotness in languages , then JRuby is perfect for you .
It allows programmers to write code in Ruby , to dip seamlessly into Java where needed , to write the hard parts in Java for speed and then deploy to the same infrastructure as a Struts or JSP deployment would .
It even supports Swing .
Several libraries make Swing even easier ( one written by me ) .
In its current state , I 'd use JRuby for the following :
Breathing new life into tired old Java APIs .
JRuby 's tight integration with Java libraries is so seamless that you can code against a Java API in a way that looks and feels like Ruby .
It 's amazing how many times the same exact code — but done in Ruby with " less syntax " — seems easier to write .
Syntactically , a Java implementation would be almost identical , but the Ruby code is looser and more fun .
The Java purists will toss this as a " loser 's argument , " but sometimes letting tired , beaten Java programmers use a simple fun language to write their code can give the project a morale boost .
Gluing together Java libraries .
Java programmers love to combine various elements of a " stack " to create the perfect framework .
This usually results in a " Frankenstack " consisting of mostly off - the - shelf components , open - source libraries , lots of XML and some strange special sauce the star developer created ( just before she left ) .
Ruby can work as a better glue between all the stack components since its more friendly syntax and easier unit testing frameworks promote readability and ease of use .
However , even the worst Architecture Astronaut can turn Ruby into something horrible , as I 've witnessed on many " professional " Ruby on Rails projects .
Rapid prototyping and experimentation .
JRuby lets programmers prototype and interact with Java libraries dynamically , the same way they would in a scripting language .
It dynamically converts types and gives them the feel of " just talking to the computer . "
To find out if a solution is possible ( something we call a " spike " ) , JRuby can turn the test into a single - day job rather than a two - week trip to Frankenstack City .
It also means you can try out new APIs quickly to evaluate whether they 're worth using in a project ; that can help when you make purchasing decisions .
Enterprise application integration .
EAI is that constant dirty job somebody has to do , and it 's never been pretty , ever .
When you do most EAI tasks in a strict language like Java , you end up with monumental crystal palaces nobody can maintain .
If you do them in a dirty , loose language like Perl , you end up with giant balls of duct - taped twine nobody can maintain .
With JRuby , the parts that are best done with strict processing can be done in Java ( or even just Java style ) , and the parts that are dirty and require regex wizardry can be done in Ruby .
You get the best of both platforms ' network libraries , string processing , file handling and design philosophies when you try to make multiple different systems talk .
Web programming but with the Java platform .
You can host Ruby on Rails applications in standard Java application servers like Tomcat , Jetty , Glassfish or Resin .
Rails applications simply need to be packaged into Web application archives ( WARs ) and hooked in , using a simple set of libraries from the Goldspike or Warbler projects .
Since Ruby has no legacy notion of complex ( and useless ) Java technologies like JNDI , JMX , JTA , servlets , application servers or session migration , you do n't need to purchase insanely expensive products that do n't meet your needs .
Simply start with Tomcat .
And , when you absolutely need it , buy ( or use open - source versions of ) the components you need .
Swing or SWT GUI development .
Traditionally , developing a Swing or SWT application was a painful experience , involving gigantic books detailing every arbitrary bit of trivia about library specifics that were mostly legacy cruft .
With JRuby 's metaprogramming and dynamic nature , it 's possible to build full complete professional user interfaces using SWT or Swing in a very short time .
The results are usually the same in performance , and any parts that are n't fast enough can be redone in Java where needed .
There are also several libraries like Profligacy ( mine ) and Cheri .
But that 's just the advantages ...
And on the Downside ...
I do n't recommend you use either JRuby or Ruby for :

Bugliosi Would Seek Death Penalty for Bush
22 Corporate Crime Reporter 22 , May 30 , 2008
If Vincent Bugliosi were prosecuting George W. Bush for the murder of the more than 4,000 American soldiers who have died in Iraq , he would seek the death penalty .
“ If I were the prosecutor , there is no question I would seek the death penalty , ” Bugliosi told Corporate Crime Reporter in a wide - ranging interview .
Bugliosi is the author of the just published book The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder ( Vanguard Press , 2008 ) .
“ I ’m urging here that an American jury try George Bush for first degree murder .
I want to see him on trial for murder before an American jury .
And if they convict him , it will be up to the jury to decide what his punishment is .
One of the options would be the imposition of the death penalty .
If I were prosecuting him , absolutely I would seek the death penalty .
As Governor of Texas , George Bush signed death warrants – 152 out of 152 – most of them for people who only committed one murder . ”
Bugliosi said he is sending a copy of his book to all fifty state Attorneys General , offering his assistance in prosecuting Bush for homicide .
“ I ’m herein enclosing a copy of my book The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , ” Bugliosi writes in the letter to the Attorneys General .
“ I hope you will find the time to read it and that you will agree with its essential conclusion – that George W. Bush is guilty of murder for the deaths of over 4,000 American soldiers who have died fighting his war in Iraq . ”
Bugliosi said he ’s also meeting with a high profile California District Attorney to urge him to bring the case .
“ I am going to meet here soon with a very prominent DA , ” Bugliosi said .
“ I do n’t think he is going to do it .
But I do think he will give me some ideas as to who would be likely to do it .
I ’m going ask him to do it .
My guess is he is not going to do it .
But he attends DA conventions .
And he may very well know someone .
There may be a case where a DA or an AG lost a son over in Iraq . ”
“ I offer my services to help out in any way that they see fit , ” Bugliosi said .
“ But I want to convey the thought that this is a serious thing .
This is not a fanciful reverie .
At my age , I do n’t have time for fanciful reveries .
If I had to guess what the probabilities are , my guess is that there is not a high probability of it .
But I think there is a very substantial probability that George Bush , as a direct result of this book , will end up in an American courtroom being tried for murder .
And the main reason that I say that is because of the great number of American prosecutors that I ’ve established jurisdiction for . ”
Bugliosi said that the homicide prosecution against Bush can be brought by the U.S. Attorney General , any of the U.S. Attorneys , any of the 50 state Attorneys General , or any of the hundreds of district attorneys – if a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq is from their districts .
Bugliosi says that even if the prosecution of Bush does n’t come about for a number of years , he wants to plant in the President ’s mind the idea that such a prosecution is possible .
“ The least I can do is put that thought in his mind until he goes to his grave , ” Bugliosi said .
“ That ’s the least I can do for the thousands of American soldiers who came back in an aluminum box or came back as a jar of ashes .
And the parents are told – do n’t open the box , it is unviewable .
They are getting back limbs and body parts .
And this – I do n’t want to use a cuss word here – this small , horrible human being – while young men who never had a chance to live out their dreams , being blown to pieces by roadside bombs – and this guy is having a ball dancing .
I want to put the thought in his mind that in any time in the future , five years from now , ten years from now , some aide is going to tap him on the shoulder and say – Mr. President , there is this prosecutor , I do n’t know how to pronounce his name , he ’s up in Fargo , and he ’s charging you with murder sir , and we are due for an arraignment next Wednesday in Fargo , sir . ”
“ Bush will never know whether that will happen .
They went after ( former Chilean strongman Augusto ) Pinochet for murder 33 years later .
I want to put that thought in Bush ’s mind .
This guy has been enjoying himself throughout this entire war .
And the suffering and the horror and blood is unbelievable .
And he has enjoyed himself throughout this whole thing . ”
At the center of Bugliosi ’s indictment of Bush is a October 7 , 2002 speech to the nation in which Bush claims that Saddam Hussein was a great danger to this nation either by attacking us with his weapons of mass destruction , or giving these weapons to some terrorist group .
“ And he said – the attack could happen on any given day – meaning the threat was imminent , ” Bugliosi says .
“ The only problem for George Bush – and if he were prosecuted , there is no way he could get around this – is that on October 1 , 2002 , six days earlier , the CIA sent George Bush its 2002 National Intelligence Estimate , a classified top secret report .
Page eight clearly and unequivocally says that Saddam Hussein was not an imminent threat to the security of this country .
In fact , the report says that Hussein would only use whatever weapons of mass destruction he had against us if he feared that America was about to attack him . ”

Does the fact that Barack Hussein Obama 's last name rhymes with that of the al Qaeda leader mean that he loves terrorists ?
Or how about that dangerous middle name ?
Should all women who wear head scarves be searched for weapons by airport security ?
Do we " know , " as some allege , what terrorists look like ?
The fear surrounding what makes a Muslim , from appearances to beliefs , has been defined in recent years as Islamophobia , an issue permeating politics , pop culture and even the price of gas .
A group of professors and academics from around the nation are gathered this weekend at UC Berkeley to discuss what it means .
At what is believed to be the first academic conference focused on Islamophobia as a concept , the professors aim to study and understand how a religious identity of 1.2 billion people around the world has become fused with a monolithic set of beliefs and racial category .
Under this dynamic , the beliefs of a Muslim engineer in Silicon Valley are rendered the same as those of a shopkeeper in Baghdad or a Hamas politician .
The " Muslim " racial category can be defined by a woman with a head scarf or a brown - skinned man with a beard .
In reality , adherent Muslims include Chinese people , African Americans , whites and Latinos , as well as women who do not wear head scarves .
Just as black people , Jews and colonized groups have historically been defined as exceptionally dangerous " others , " Muslims are today , conference participants said .
The professors hope to foster a new field of academic research .
While Islam has been examined as a religion , and Muslim nations have been scrutinized in political science departments , it has not been placed within the context of ethnic studies .
Those departments often focus on gender issues as well as specific ethnic groups , like African Americans , Asian Americans and Latinos .
Contentious issues
Placing Islamophobia within the context of ethnic studies would allow researchers to look more broadly at the confluence of race , culture , ethnicity and religion that define the American Muslim experience today .
That 's no trifling issue .
Islamophobia entails " some of the most contentious issues in the United States or worldwide , " said Professor Evelyn Nakano Glenn , director of UC Berkeley 's Center for Race and Gender , which sponsored the conference .
Friday 's panels touched on issues ranging from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. immigration to European anti-Semitism and the legacies of colonialism .
For some , the importance of studying Islamophobia also was a matter of more intimate concern .
Glenn said that her own family paid the price for how its group was defined as " the other " in a past era of the United States and subjected to persecution .
During World War II , she said roughly 30 family members were " incarcerated " in internment camps due to perceptions about Japanese American beliefs .
Those camps also interned Italian Americans and German Americans .
" I have a personal interest in this particular topic , " Glenn said .
UC Berkeley lecturer Hatem Bazian defined Islamophobia as " unfounded hostility toward Muslims and therefore fear or dislike of all or most Muslims . "
As a result , Muslims are painted as monolithic , unable to adapt to modernity and dissimilar to other major faiths .
Islamophobes present Muslims as inferior to the West , archaic , barbaric and irrational , Bazian said .
Organizers also hope that the creation of such a field would allow them to more systematically document the phenomenon , one that has gained momentum in the presidential race and the candidacy of Obama , a Christian .
Pundits and politicians have referred to the Illinois senator as " Osama , " mockingly connecting him to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
Others , like Rush Limbaugh , refer to him by his middle name .
When Obama wore Somali garb on a visit to Kenya , the country of his ancestors , it was proof for others of purportedly insidious beliefs .
Yet , in the numerous paradoxes of race and religion , aspersions that " construct " Obama into a " Muslim " are often put forth by the same people who criticize Obama 's house of worship , a Christian church .
" Whether Obama is a Muslim or not can increase or decrease his election chances , depending on who is asking and who is responding to it , " said Bazian , a conference organizer .
" This is part of public discourse . "
Panelists at the conference traced the roots of Islamophobia well before Sept. 11 , 2001 : They include slavery , colonialism and the Spanish Inquisition against Jews and Muslims beginning in 1492 .
Cultural phenomenon
Marquette University Professor Louise Cainkar presented a paper about hate crimes against those of Arab origin , a category that includes Christians but is often conflated with Muslims in post - Sept. 11 pop culture .
In analyzing patterns in the Chicago area , she found that hate crimes were fewest in African American neighborhoods in the South Side , despite the high prevalence of Arab shopkeepers .
But anti-Arab hate crimes were highest in " white flight " suburbs .
A mosque in a southwestern suburb of Chicago came under a " three - day siege " by neighbors after the Sept. 11 attacks and had to be protected by more than 100 police officers in riot gear , Cainkar said .
Cainkar believes the results showed , in part , that Islamophobia is a cultural phenomenon .
The black neighborhoods had a history of community organizing around concepts of race and did not buy into treating Arabs as " the other . "
" Islamophobia can be defeated through work at the local level , " she said .

A schematic rendering of the first graphene layer ( G ) grown on the ruthenium substrate ( Ru ) .

Graphene , a sheet of carbon just one atom thick , has many potential uses in the electronics industry , but producing these ideal two - dimensional carbon sheets is very difficult and , as a result , their use has been stifled so far .
But scientists from Brookhaven National Laboratory may have finally found a way around the issue , devising a method to yield high - quality graphene sheets .
The current methods of isolating graphene each have problems .
The most common , known as micromechanical cleavage , in which sheets are sheared off of a larger crystal , does n't reliably produce graphene samples that are large enough for applications .
Another method , in which the atomic structure of a substrate is used to seed the growth of the graphene , known as epitaxial growth , does n't yield a sample with a uniform thickness of graphene layers , and bonding between the bottom graphene layer and the substrate may affect the properties of the carbon layers .
The Brookhaven group based their technique on this second method , except that they were able to grow the graphene in a controlled , layer - by - layer manner .
The substrate they chose is the rare metal ruthenium , and while the bottom graphene layer does interact strongly with it , the next layer up is almost completely detached , only weakly electrically coupled to it , and behaves much like free - standing graphene .
“ This second layer retains the inherent electronic structure of graphene , ” Brookhaven physicist Peter Sutter , who led the work , told PhysOrg.com .
“ Thus , our findings may represent a long - sought route toward rational graphene synthesis and the creation of high - quality graphene for applications in electronic devices and sensors . ”
Graphene has several properties that make it desirable for electronics , including its very high carrier mobility — that is , electrons in graphene can roam rather freely .
Graphene can respond to a single gas molecule , making it very attractive as a detector material for sensors .
The Brookaven group 's growth process takes place at high temperatures .
To start , the researchers caused carbon atoms to become absorbed within the ruthenium by heating the entire sample to 1150 degrees Celsius ( ºC ) .
The sample was then cooled to about 850 ºC , which caused large amounts of the absorbed carbon to rise to the surface of the ruthenium .
The carbon formed single - layer lens - shaped islands about 100 micrometers ( millionths of a meter ) in width , dotting the entire substrate surface .
Eventually , the islands grew into a complete first graphene layer .
And at about 80 percent coverage , the growth of the second layer began .
Sutter and his group observed the growth and studied the graphene 's properties using various instruments , including a scanning electron microscope and a low - energy electron microscope .

I bring this up because in but that sort of assertion seemed really dumb and reinforces the perception that economists do n't know jack .
After all , we have a good idea of the distribution of
Reading economic history I notice all sorts of glosses and oversimplifications when it comes to cultural details .
I do n't mind that too much ; I do n't read Maddison 's work for his analysis or even his often tenuous causal claims , but rather for his copious data sets .
Nevertheless , when it comes to something like inferring economic conditions from biological data one can work out objections from the armchair without reading historical works .
The extrapolation does though require taking non-economic dynamics and conditions seriously , which Clark presumably does .
Note :
The estimates below are for 14 AD .
I bring this up because in Farewell to Alms Greg Clark used the distribution of lactose tolerance to imply that northern Europe had always been very wealthy , since after all milk was produced from cows which indicated a relatively high standard of living where land could be given over to husbandry .
Now , Clark is obviously a smart guy , smart enough that Brad DeLong seems to have creamed himself with praise over his book , After all , we have a good idea of the distribution of lactose tolerance and the nature of its evolution , and it seems that ecological constraints and possibly path dependence is very critical in conditioning whether this trait will emerge .
In fact , as I note above scholars of the Roman period assume that the lands of Germany were relatively sparsely populated and poor if material data are any evidence ( Hitler was irritated with Himmler for funding archaeological digs in Germany and Scandinavia because he felt it just made the ancestors look primitive ) .
Gaul was wealthier and more densely populated .
That serves to explain why it remained occupied after being gutted for the glory of Julius Caesar , while the campaigns of Germanicus served mainly to buttress the popularity of his insane son the emperor Gaius ( Caligula ) .
Reading economic history I notice all sorts of glosses and oversimplifications when it comes to cultural details .
I do n't mind that too much ; I do n't read Maddison 's work for his analysis or even his often tenuous causal claims , but rather for his copious data sets .
Nevertheless , when it comes to something like inferring economic conditions from biological data one can work out objections from the armchair without reading historical works .
The extrapolation does though require taking non-economic dynamics and conditions seriously , which Clark presumably does .
The estimates below are for 14 AD .
During the height of the Roman Empire there was a NW - SE ( of course mostly west to east ) gradient in per capita income .
This is well known .
One of the reasons given for the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5h century in contrast to the persistence of the Eastern Empire is that the provinces of the latter were wealthier and so could afford initiatives such as bribing barbarian tribes to move on toward the west .
In Contours of the World Economy 1-2030 AD Angus Maddison confirms this ( table below the fold ) .
Additionally , in Peter Heather 's The Fall of the Roman Empire the argument is also made that expansion beyond the Rhine did not occur mostly because of the poverty of the lands ; the lack of tax base meaning that the conquest would n't have been self - supporting .
So as you go north there is an inversion of the east - west wealth gradient .
The main exception to this clinal geographic distribution of wealth is Italy , for obvious reasons .
But there are a few other data which Maddison alludes to which interest me in relation to per capita income .
He confirms that Germans were larger and more physically robust because they had more meat and milk in their diet ( better sources of protein ) .
Maddison also notes that Roman culinary science which reflected the needs and interests of the elites had a strong focus on condiments and sauces because even imported foods tended to go bad .
I know that the Dutch became wealthy in the early modern period in part by exporting salted herring , but these data seem to imply that the Roman trade in food was mostly in grain .
Unless curred or salted it seems that vegetables and meats would n't make it .
If there had been magic preservatives perhaps those in the wealthier provinces would have purchased milk & meat to shore up their nutritional intake ?
But decomposition constrained the possibilities for trade across long distances in such perishable food stuffs .

How many of you have older hardware ?
I know I ’ve got a few machines that I ca n’t take myself to throw away .
It ’s ok though because we all run Linux which is very kind to old hardware ( Do n’t throw away good hardware , use Ubuntu ! )
For those of us with even older hardware we might need to tone things down just a bit .
How do we do that ?
We ’ve got a few options , let me go over a few :
First , if we ’re using GNOME ( which is the default desktop manager ) we can tell it to tone things down a bit using gconf - editor .
Try the following and see how much difference it makes in your responsiveness :
ALT - F2 : gconf-editor
set " /apps/metacity/general/reduced_resources " to true
Or , if you ’re using KDE you ’ve got a few options as well .
note : in my experience KDE is the least hardware friendly ( as far as responsiveness and memory requirements ) .
You can try running ( or installing if it is n’t included ) a program that will allow you to reduce the eye - candy level of KDE :
kpersonalizer
Now for those of you that have hardware that served back in the war , or want to venture into some new desktop manager options you can install any of the following :
Xfce - sudo aptitude install xubuntu- desktop
Fluxbox - sudo aptitude install fluxbox
Enlightenment - sudo aptitude install enlightenment
Blackbox - sudo aptitude install blackbox
Openbox - sudo aptitude install openbox
Afterstep - sudo aptitude install afterstep
FVWM - sudo aptitude install fvwm
WindowMaker - sudo aptitude install wmaker
note : you ’ll also want to install a menu application that keeps the different Desktop Manager menus separate .
Install the package menu using your preferred method ( command line or Synaptic Package Manager ) and , after installation run :
sudo update - menus
Now you might be wondering how to switch between these new desktop managers .
It ’s really simple and you can very easily have any / all of these installed at any time and switch between them all .
Logout of your current desktop manager
On the Login screen find the “ Options ” button Select “ Sessions ” and select your newly installed desktop manager
It will ask you if you ’d like to switch to that manager just this time or if you ’d like to make it the default .
That is , of course , up to you .
If you ’d like like to give things a test - drive just use it for this session .
You can easily switch between any desktop manager using the same method .
So what are you waiting for ?
Check out some of the other available Desktop Managers and make your desktop completely unique to you !
Ooh and , of course , many of these alternates are MUCH more lightweight and work GREAT on older hardware !
The human brain does n’t always think logically .
College students ’ performance on logic problems is not a pretty sight .
Steven Pinker ( How The Mind Works , 1997 ) discusses the following student logic test :
There are some archeologists , biologists , and chess players in a room .
None of the archeologists are biologists .
All of the biologists are chess players .
What , if anything follows ?
A majority of students conclude that none of the archeologists are chess players , which is not valid .
None of them conclude that some of the chess players are not archeologists , which is valid .
In fact , one fifth claim that the premises allow no valid inferences .
Patrick Shaw ( Logic and its Limits , 1997 ) defines a logical argument as “ one which is sound ; a logical person is one who habitually uses sound arguments . ”
Sound arguments are essential for logical decision - making .
Sound arguments are progressively built , brick by brick , by assembling a string of premises that lead to a reasonable concludion .
The conclusions are increasingly valuable if they stand up to observation over time .
The logical argument building process often sounds like …
If ‘ X ’ is true , and ‘ Y ’ is also true , therefore ‘ Z ’ must then be true .
A sound argument can be very simple , such as :
Many animals build nests according to a pattern , which varies little within the species .
In some instances , the offspring have had no opportunity to learn from their parents .
There must , therefore , be at least some innate tendency controlling the activity .
( An argument from Boring , Langfeld , and Weld , Foundations of Psychology , 1948 . )
Premise 1 : Many animals build nests according to a pattern , which varies little within the species .
Premise 2 : In some instances the offspring have not been taught by their parents to build the characteristic nest .
Conclusion :
There is at least some innate tendency controlling the activity .
Another example of s simple logical argument :
All fish are cold - blooded , and no whales are cold - blooded ; so whales are not fish .
Premise 1 : All fish are cold - blooded .
Premise 2 : Whales are warm - blooded .
Conclusion : Whales are not fish .
Of course , not all logical arguments are so simple , and the task of assessing arguments – the validity of the premises and conclusions both– is a challenging one that is influenced not only by our capacity for logical thought , but also our beliefs and personal experience .
Simply because an argument is formatted as ‘ if … then … therefore ’ does not make it a sound argument .
Consider a slightly more vague argument :
Premise 1 : All vitamins are nutritious .
Premise 2 : Some nutritious things are not cheap .
Conclusion : Some vitamins are expensive .
Most people will hesitate to agree with this conclusion and even if it is accepted it is of marginal value due to the vagueness of both the premises and the conclusion .
If any of the premises are not true , then the conclusion will likely not be true– but the argument may remain sound from a purely logical point of view .
As Shaw points out : “ It must be stressed that to ask whether a conclusion follows is not the same as asking whether that conclusion is true .
From the point of view of logic , truth is not of immediate account .
A conclusion follows from the premises in this sense : if one grants the premises then one must , to be consistent , also accept the conclusion .
If the premises are true , then the conclusion must be true .
Which is not to say that the premises and conclusion are true : whether or not they are is a different problem . ”
For example :
Premise 1 : All students are teapots .
Premise 2 : Our dog is a student .
Conclusion :
Our dog is a teapot .
Obviously both premises are false and so is the conclusion .
Yet the argument is logically sound with the conclusion properly built upon the premises .
Anyone who accepts these premises would be logically committed to accept the conclusion .
The lack of concern with truth can seem strange at first , but limiting logical arguments to only the realm of known truths and current beliefs would limit the boundary of useful conclusions that might be examined .
Mathematics is filled with logical arguments .
You may remember from your school days such problems as this …
Bill is eight years older than John , and in two years time he will be twice as old as John .
How old is Bill ?
Conclusion sequence :
From premise 2 , it follows that x / 2 = 2y + 4
Subtracting two from each side we get x =
2y + 2
Since y + 8 and 2y + 2 both equal x , it follows that they equal each other : 2y + 2 = y + 8
Subtracting y + 2 from each side we get y = 6
John ’s age is 6 and Bill is 8 years older ; therefore Bill is 14 .
Mathematical logic demonstrates how a series of very trivial steps can eventually lead to an answer that is a considerable distance from the original problem .
In the history of science we often observe how scientists made many observations about the Earth , assembled them into premises , and were then able to make useful conclusions .
For example , because coal seams have been found in Antartica ( observation / premise ) , the climate there was once warmer than it is now ( sub- conclusion / new premise ) , therefore either the geographical location of the continents has shifted ( possible conclusion to test further ) or the whole earth was once warmer than it is now ( alterative conclusion to test ) .
The eventual theory of plate tectonics , certainly a beautifully logical argument widely accepted today , arose from building a series of useful premises based on field observations and testing alternative conclusions .
Logic and Truth … to be continued …

About a year and a half ago , an executive at Disney - owned ABC - TV talked about how the network was experimenting with ways to block people from fast forwarding through commercials .
The exec in question even claimed that commercial - skipping was n't even a very important feature for most DVR - owners .
Despite the widespread criticism of this statement , it appears that ABC is now preparing to test that theory .
In association with cable company Cox , it 's testing a new video - on - demand feature that wo n't let viewers fast forward through commercials .
We 'll be the first to say it : this is dumb .
While it may make a few more people watch commercials , it wo n't make them happy about it .
And , given just how many other options there are these days , the end result might be that people just choose not to watch such ABC programming at all , let alone the commercials .
Yet various ABC executives seem to think that by offering this product , they can stop people from buying DVRs .
Anne Sweeney , the president of the Disney - ABC television group , claims : " You do n't need TiVo if you have fast - forward - disabled video on demand .
It gives you the same opportunity to catch up to your favorite shows . "
Not quite .
First of all , you 're limited to shows on ABC .
Second , who knows if the additional features are as useful .
Finally , one of the nice things about TiVo ( oh , right ! ) is that it lets you watch a 30 - minute show in 22 - minutes , since you can skip the commercials ( whoops ) .
So , yes , many people will still want a TiVoABC is forcing the fast forward option to be disabled .
Then there 's Ray Cole , who owns some ABC affiliates .
He says : " As network and affiliates , we both have an interest in slowing down the explosive growth of DVRs .
This is about combating DVRs .
As we developed this at every stage , there was an agreement that however we put this together , disabling the fast - forward function was key . "
I 'm curious as to how Mr. Cole thinks offering a product that does much less and deliberately takes away a key feature will " slow down " the " explosive growth of DVRs . "
You do n't compete by offering a worse product .
You compete by offering a better product .
Taking away one of the key selling points of a product is not exactly a major selling point .

2008 witnesses the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in America .
Amidst the celebrations , what many people fail to realize is that slavery persists today in the modern world on an enormous scale .
In spite of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the UN in 1948 stating that “ slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms , ” the figures accompanying the modern slave trade seem inconceivable in a global society that prides itself upon its modern - day values and emphasis on human rights .
1 . There are more people in slavery now than at any other time in human history .
According to research carried out by the organization Free the Slaves , more people are enslaved worldwide than ever before .
In its 400 years , the transatlantic slave trade is estimated to have shipped up to 12 million Africans to various colonies in the West .
Free the Slaves estimates that the number of people in slavery today is at least 27 million .
The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center suggests that three out of four slavery victims are women and that half of all modern - day slaves are children .
‘ Countless other ’ people are in other forms of servitude which are not legally classified as slavery , according to the Anti-Slavery Society , described ambiguously by some as ‘ unfree labour ’ .
2 . The value of slaves has decreased .
A slave in 1850 in American South cost the equivalent of approximately $ 40,000 .
According to figures published by FST , the cost of a slave today averages around $ 90 , depending on the work they are forced to carry out .

A young adult male laborer in Mali might only fetch $ 40 , whereas an HIV - free female might attract a price of up to $ 1000 .
Expert Kevin Bales says that because modern slavery is so cheap , it is worse than that of the Atlantic slave trade .
People have become disposable and their living conditions are worse than ever before as a result of their value .
3. Slavery still exists in the US .
Estimates by the US State Department suggest up to 17,500 slaves are brought into the US every year , with 50,000 of those working as prostitutes , farm workers or domestic servants .
According to the CIA , more than 1,000,000 people are enslaved in the US today .
Thousands of cases go undetected each year and many are difficult to take to court as it can be difficult to prove force or legal coercion .
4.Slavery is hidden behind many other names , thus disguising it from society .
These names are chattel slavery ( the traditional meaning of slavery ) , bonded labor , trafficking , forced labor , and forced marriage , amongst others .
Photo by saibotregeel
5 . The least known method of slavery is the most widely used .
Bonded Labor occurs when labor is demanded in order to repay a debt or loan and the cyclical nature of debt and work can enslave the person for the rest of their life .
Some conditions are so controlled that slaves are surrounded by armed guards while they work , many of whom are slaves themselves .
This has been found in Brazil .
It is estimated that there are 20 million bonded labourers in the world .
6 . Human trafficking has recently been described as “ the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world . ”
This shocking claim was made by former Secretary of State , Madeleine Albright .
The UN estimates trafficked human cargo generates around $ 7 billion dollars a year .

7 . To buy all bonded laborers out of slavery could cost as little as $ 40 per family .
The $ 40 figure was provided by the Center for Global Education , New York .
Kevin Bales compares the total cost of ending all slavery with one ’s week ’s cost of the war on Iraq .
8 . Free the Slaves believe it is possible to end all slavery within 25 years .
Ending slavery wo n’t be easy , but humanity is up to the challenge .
9 . Many slave - produced goods might reach your home without you realizing their origin .
Industries where slave labor is often highly suspected include cocoa , cotton , steel , oriental rugs , diamonds and silk .
Currently the only way to ensure the products you buy are slave - free is to buy Fair Trade certified goods .
Photo by saibotregeel
10 . Your actions affect global slavery .
By buying fair trade , learning more about modern slavery , spreading the word , and joining a movement such as Free the Slaves , Anti-Slavery International , or the American Anti-slavery group , you as an individual can help abolish slavery completely .
With the number of slaves rising due to increasing economic returns , a universal lack of awareness and anti-slavery laws not being enforced , the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center believes “ efforts to combat slavery will have only limited effectiveness ” unless something is done on a larger scale .
The bicentennial of the abolition of the slave trade would be better commemorated by every individual taking meaningful action to help end the exploitation of human labor once and for all .

American consumers , battered by falling home prices and soaring gasoline prices , are at their gloomiest in decades , raising fears they might cut back on spending later this year and tip the economy into a recession .
Consumer confidence plunged in June to its lowest level since 1992 , and home - price declines accelerated in April , according to data released Tuesday .
The renewed signs of economic weakness underscored why Federal Reserve policy makers , who wrap up a two - day meeting Wednesday , are likely to hold the target for their ...
If anything , the Saudi summit meeting made plain the limited options available to push prices down .
For King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , who called for the meeting just two weeks ago , it was an opportunity to show that his oil - rich kingdom was aware of growing anger and frustration caused by surging prices in oil - importing countries .
It also reflected some alarm by the Saudis that the price inflation was causing consumer nations to look far more seriously at energy alternatives , which eventually could hurt the price of oil .
The crisis is also becoming a central issue in the American presidential race , where arguments over who is to blame for high oil prices echoed some of what was heard at the Saudi summit meeting .
President Bush has supported calls by Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , to allow for more drilling off the coast of the United States .
Senator Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee , opposes more offshore drilling and has called for a crackdown on market speculators , whom he blamed for pushing up prices .
The question of whether speculators are influencing prices is expected to get closer scrutiny this week in Washington , where a Senate committee led by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , the Connecticut independent and former Democrat who supports Mr. McCain , will hold hearings on the price swings in the crude oil market .
The oil summit meeting here was attended by energy ministers from 35 nations , who convened in a vast ballroom and listened as King Abdullah said he understood the pain that $ 140 oil was causing .
But King Abdullah and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain , who walked into the high - ceilinged hall together as a military band played , soon offered totally different perspectives on the problem .
The king spoke of the “ selfish interests “ of speculators as a primary reason and urged the gathered ministers to “ rule out biased rumors “ and to “ reach the real causes for the increase in price . “
Ransomware , although somewhat appropriately nicknamed , as it takes your data hostage demanding money for its release , has always implied an unnecessary emotional component .
It is unforgivably insensitive to compare this to any type of real world ransom regarding human life .
Furthermore , there are no " proof of life " concepts , such as sending back a " pinky " of data or letting you briefly see that your data is being safely kept in a Linux environment .
These psychological discrepancies require an understanding of the true definition for this type of cyber crime : a reversible denial - of - resource cryptoviral extortion attack .
As insidious as it sounds , it is just the technical terminology of what is commonly referred to as ransomware .
Perhaps a semantic dissection will provide some clarification and comprehension .
Denial of service attacks , if successful , result in the failure to provide a service , such as a serving up a webpage in response to a user 's http request .
A denial - of - resource attack prevents access to a resource , such as a specific document or file .
Traditionally one targets valued resources and obstructs its availability to the user .
Typically , this involves removing a user 's ability to read , write , and copy the most valued and sensitive files on their machine .
However , if true to their word , this process is reversible , with full access returned upon meeting the payment demands of the hacker .
This oppressive attack is clearly an instance of financial extortion .
Frequently , this occurs in the real world by demanding payment to prevent the release of damaging information , although in this case the extortionist requires payment in order to allow the release of captive data .
The remaining part requiring explanation is the most interesting aspect of this attack ( not so interesting if you 're the victim ) -- its use of cryptovirology .
Combining cryptography with virology is a classic example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts .
This has been employed by malware to enhance obfuscation and prevent reverse engineering .
Viral propagation continues to be a pervasive and effective means of malware dissemination .
Despite security advances in protective mechanisms and defensive measures , viral threats remain problematic due to evolving sophistication in their methods of AV evasion .
Utilizing mutation engines , polymorphic and metamorphic malware have demonstrated the ability to frequently avoiding detection by creating self - altering and reorganizing encrypted code .
The incorporation of encryption into this type of extortion attack amplifies its malicious intensity .
The technology designed to secure and protect sensitive information , encryption , can be equally damaging in the absence of its intended use .
This concept can be easily understood with the example of door locks used in the real world .
If a room contains valuable property , the first step towards security is to install a door which provides visual privacy to the casual passersby .
The next step towards effective security , to keep other individuals from accessing the room , would be the installation of a door lock .
However , if this step is ignored , then it is possible that someone else could place their own lock on the door , thus restricting access from the legitimate owner .
This principal holds true for encryption and is enhanced by its significant underutilization .
In this attack scenario , the valued data essentially becomes locked inside of a mathematical vault , which cannot be opened , despite residing on the user 's pc .
The alphanumeric key required to open the vault -- decrypting the data -- becomes a valuable item possessed by the extortionist .
The media coverage related to the recent occurrence of this attack stems from its cryptographic strength , not its novelty .
While a theoretical discussion of cryptoviral extortion attacks was presented at the 1996 IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy , it was n't until 2004 did one actually occur .
The Trojan .
Pgpcoder was one of the first public instances affecting end users .
Fortunately its weak custom encryption scheme allowed it to be easily reverse engineered .
Soon to follow was the Cryzip Trojan , which used a password protected zip encryption which could be brute forced .
In mid-2006 , the Archiveus - A Trojan emerged , which oddly requested the purchase of pharmaceuticals from a Russian website , as opposed to direct monetary demands for file decryption .
Following file concatenation and consolidation , access attempts generated a dialog box requesting a complex 30 character password .
Although the Archiveus Trojan 's reverse engineering was facilitated by the fact that it kept the password stored in the binary as plain text .
Following the historic trend of blackmailing viruses , the Gpcode Trojan first appeared in 2004 , rapidly evolved in 2005 and then went dormant after apparently topping out in 2006 .
First targeting businesses , the number of victims grew with the code 's developing sophistication and potency .
In January of 2006 , Gpcode.ac had adopted use of the secure RSA public encryption algorithm .
After the author 's initial RSA implementation led to failure from using a 56 bit key , its complexity quickly matured .
In 2006 , during a six month period , Gpcode variants appeared with escalating key lengths .
Gpcode.ad 67 - bit RSA key Gpcode.ae 260-bit RSA key Gpcode.af 330-bit RSA key Gpcode.ag 660 - bit RSA key
Two years later , we find ourselves facing Gpcode.ak using 1024 - bit RSA encryption .
There have been varying estimations concerning the raw computing power and mathematical cycling efficiency needed to crack encryption of this strength .
However , regardless of the source , it is agreed that this task would be one of significant difficulty .
The end result of this situation is a real security concern .
Presently , the security community 's best inoculative efforts have been requests for collaborative help and attempts at file restoration using photo recovery software .
This is disturbing at best .
Perhaps we should disband distributed computing projects ( goodbye SETI ) and cease supercomputing chess matches ( that 's right Deep Blue , Deep Thought , and Hydra ) and dedicate these resources to cryptographic file recovery .
To everyone affected by this devastating attack , I leave you with two words -- backup drive .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Gasoline is costing U.S. drivers a record $ 4.10 per gallon on average , but pump prices may be at a peak and could start to come down , an industry analyst said on Sunday .
That optimism is linked to a pledge by Saudi Arabia to pump more oil in response to consumer countries ’ requests , according to Trilby Lundberg , editor of the nationwide Lundberg survey of about 7,000 gas stations .
“ I suspect that oil prices have peaked and will flip further because of this news and the physical addition of more oil on the market in July , ” Lundberg said .
“ This gives a strong chance that pump prices are peaking now , or may already have done so . ”
A barrel of oil has doubled in price over the past year , stoking inflation , triggering protests from Asia to Europe , and compounding the financial pain of U.S. consumers already grappling with a sagging housing market , job uncertainty and soaring food costs .
Top officials , policy makers and oil company executives met on Sunday in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , for emergency talks on how to bring prices down .
“ Crude oil prices may spike at any moment from existing trouble in areas including Nigeria , or from some unforeseen hit to global supply , ” Lundberg said .
“ This may sound optimistic , ( but ) it seems likely at this moment as the meeting in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia is being concluded , that oil prices may have peaked and may drift down . ”
One common reason cited for the rise of oil prices is soaring demand from developing economies such as India and China , whose emerging middle classes are gobbling up more oil .

Lundberg said it was unclear whether other countries with fuel subsidies would follow China ’s lead and cut them in efforts to cap demand .
Demand in the United States has fallen about 1 percent year - to - date , though it is closer to 2 percent lower in recent weeks , Lundberg said .
Prices at the pump vary across the country .
The luckiest drivers live in Tulsa , Oklahoma , where the city average was $ 3.76 per gallon , the nation ’s lowest .
At the other end , Los Angeles and Fresno , California , were tied for the nation ’s most expensive gasoline , with the city averages reaching $ 4.59 per gallon of regular grade gasoline .
On June 20 , U.S. crude closed at $ 134.71 per barrel , up from $ 68.19 a year ago .
Do any atheists go to church ?
If so , why ?
The idea of atheists attending church services seems contradictory .
Does n't that require belief in God ?
Does n't a person have to believe in a religion in order to attend it 's worship services ?
Is n't freedom on Sunday morning one of the benefits of atheism ?
Although most atheists do n't count themselves as part of religions which require regular attendance at churches or other houses of worship , you can still find some who do attend such services from time to time or even regularly .
Reasons Atheists Attend Church
The reasons for such attendance are varied .
Some atheists do count themselves as members of religious groups which encourage attendance at Sunday morning meetings or services .
Being an atheist means not believing in any gods — it does n't mean not being religious in any fashion .
Most religions are theistic and so atheists wo n't be adherents of those faiths , but it is n't true that all religions are theistic .
In the United States , there are several groups which count themselves as religious but either do n't require belief in any gods or actually discourage belief in the traditional god of orthodox Christianity .
These groups include Ethical Culture , the Unitarian - Universalist Church , and a variety of Religious Humanist organizations .
Many , many atheists are members of these groups and regularly attend meetings or services on Sunday mornings ( or at some other time during the week ) .
Such examples may be obvious exceptions to the tendency of atheists not to go to church , but there are also atheists who can be found at the Friday , Saturday , or Sunday services of even traditional , theistic religious faiths .
Some enjoy the music .
Some attend for the sake of harmony and unity within their families .
Others appreciate the chance to take time out of their hectic schedules in the context of something that challenges them to think differently about some of life 's more enduring mysteries .
Granted , they do n't actually agree with many of the premises and conclusions offered during the sermons , but that does n't stop them from being able to appreciate the positions described and from finding interesting insights into human nature and life 's journey .
Of course , not every church will provide such a safe place to explore deep questions involving religion , spirituality , and life itself .
A fire - and - brimstone fundamentalist church would make even the most tolerant and open - minded atheist a bit uncomfortable .
On the other hand , an extremely liberal and wishy - washy church might not provide enough interesting food for thought .
For an atheist to find the right sort of church would require quite a bit of research and testing .
Gain First Hand Knowledge
This brings us to another reason why an atheist might attend religious services : to learn , first hand , what members of different religious faiths really believe and how they express those beliefs .
You can learn quite a lot from books and magazines , but in the end , you can miss a lot if you do n't try to develop at least some first - hand experiences .
An atheist seeking to learn more probably wo n't be involved with regular attendance at a particular church ; instead , they are more likely to be involved with attending a number of churches , mosques , temples , and such on an irregular basis in order to find out what they are like at different times of the year .
This does n't mean that they are considering abandoning their skepticism or critical stance vis-a - vis religion and theism ; it just means that they are curious about what others believe and think that they might be able to learn something , even from those they disagree with quite strongly .
How many religious theists can say the same ?
How many religious theists take the time to attend religious services at other denominations and groups within their own faith tradition — Catholics going to Quaker services or white Episcopalians attending a black Baptist church ?
How many go outside their tradition — Christians going to a mosque on Friday or Jews going to Hindu ashram ?
How many people from any of these groups attend meetings of skeptics or services at a Unitarian church that hosts primarily humanist atheists ?
Closet Atheists
Finally , there is the fact that some atheists may simply not be able to " come out of the closet " and tell people that they are atheists .
If they are part of a family or community where attendance at religious worship services is an expected norm , a person cannot avoid attending without signaling to everyone that their beliefs are no longer in sync with everyone 's else 's .
At the very least , their adherence to the traditional faith has changed ; in some cases , that may be perceived as enough to be treated as a form of betrayal or scandal .
If the person reveals that they are in fact an atheist , it might be too much for some to accept .
Rather than deal with so much drama and conflict , some atheists just continue to pretend that they believe and keep up appearances .
What does this say about religion if it forces people to lie about themselves in this way ?

But with the looming possibility of a US invasion of Iraq , recent pronouncements by President George Bush 's domestic security chief , Tom Ridge , and an official with the US Civil Rights Commission should fire concerns that these powers could be employed or a de facto drift into their deployment could occur .
On July 20 the Detroit Free Press ran a story entitled " Arabs in US could be held , official warns " .
The story referred to a member of the US Civil Rights Commission who foresaw the possibility of internment camps for Arab Americans .
FEMA has practised for such an occasion .
FEMA , whose main role is disaster response , is also responsible for handling US domestic unrest .
From 1982 - 84 Colonel Oliver North assisted FEMA in drafting its civil defence preparations .
Details of these plans emerged during the 1987 Iran - Contra scandal .
They included executive orders providing for suspension of the constitution , the imposition of martial law , internment camps , and the turning over of government to the president and FEMA .
A Miami Herald article on July 5 , 1987 , reported that the former FEMA director Louis Guiffrida 's deputy , John Brinkerhoff , handled the martial law portion of the planning .
The plan was said to be similar to one Mr Giuffrida had developed earlier to combat " a national uprising by black militants " .
It provided for the detention " of at least 21 million American Negroes " ' in " assembly centres or relocation camps " .
Today Mr Brinkerhoff is with the highly influential Anser Institute for Homeland Security .
Following a request by the Pentagon in January that the US military be allowed the option of deploying troops on American streets , the institute in February published a paper by Mr Brinkerhoff arguing the legality of this .
He alleged that the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , which has long been accepted as prohibiting such deployments , had simply been misunderstood and misapplied .
The preface to the article also provided the revelation that the national plan he had worked on , under Mr Giuffrida , was " approved by Reagan , and actions were taken to implement it " .
By April , the US military had created a Northern Command to aid Homeland defence .
Reuters reported that the command is " mainly expected to play a supporting role to local authorities " .
However , Mr Ridge , the Director of Homeland Security , has just advocated a review of US law regarding the use of the military for law enforcement duties .
Disturbingly , the full facts and final contents of Mr Reagan 's national plan remain uncertain .
This is in part because President Bush took the unusual step of sealing the Reagan presidential papers last November .
However , many of the key figures of the Reagan era are part of the present administration , including John Poindexter , to whom Oliver North later reported .
At the time of the Reagan initiatives , the then attorney - general , William French Smith , wrote to the national security adviser , Robert McFarlane : " I believe that the role assigned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the revised Executive Order exceeds its proper function as a co-ordinating agency for emergency preparedness ... this department and others have repeatedly raised serious policy and legal objections to an ' emergency czar ' role for FEMA . "
Criticism of the Bush Administration 's response to September11 echoes Mr Smith 's warning .
On June 7 the former presidential counsel John Dean spoke of America 's sliding into a " constitutional dictatorship " and martial law .
Ritt Goldstein is an investigative journalist and a former leader in the movement for US law enforcement accountability .
He revealed exclusively in the Herald last week the Bush Administration 's plans for a domestic spying system more pervasive than the Stasi network in East Germany .
A new theory that a fire in a coal bunker on the liner RMS Titanic contributed to its sinking has been put forward , as the fate of the liner remains a subject of debate ahead of the 96th anniversary of the disaster later this week .
Ray Boston , who has devoted 20 years to researching the subject , said the reason Titanic was travelling so quickly through dangerous waters was because of an " uncontrollable " coal fire on board which began during speed trials in Belfast 10 days before it left Southampton .
The fire was still burning when the liner set off , creating a floating time bomb which had the potential to cause " serious explosions " below decks before it reached New York .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Boston cites the testimony of Bruce Ismay , the managing director of the White Star Line , which owned Titanic , to an inquiry into the catastrophe in which he told investigators he was forced by John Pierpont Morgan , the ultimate owner of the ship , to instruct the crew to cross the Atlantic at full speed .
" Morgan thought it was necessary , in order to justify his gamble , that they should reach New York and unload all the passengers before the inevitable explosions occurred , " he said .
Fireman J Dilley , a stoker aboard Titanic who survived to give evidence to the inquiry , added weight to the suggestion of an uncontrollable fire in coal bunker six of the ship .
" We did n't get that fire out and among the stokers there was talk that we'd have to empty the big coal bunkers after we'd put the passengers off in New York and then call on the fireboats there to help us put out the fire , " he said .
" But we did n't need such help .
It was right under bunker number six that the iceberg tore the biggest hole in the Titanic . "
At 11.40 pm on April 14 , 1912 Titanic struck an iceberg while travelling at high speed through the icy waters of the Atlantic , and by 2.20 am she had sunk beneath the waves with the loss of nearly 1,500 passengers and crew .
Just 711 people were saved .
An inquiry into the disaster , presented to Parliament in the summer of 1912 , described the ship as travelling at " high speed " through the dangerous ice - filled waters , giving the crew little opportunity to avoid a fatal collision with an iceberg .

The inquiry found that Titanic 's speed , of about 22 knots , was " excessive " considering where it was , off the coast of Newfoundland , and that additional look - outs should have been posted on all sides of the liner rather than just in the crow 's nest .
When the look - out spotted the approaching iceberg , he sounded the warning and the vessel was immediately turned hard to starboard and the engines put into full reverse , but it was already too late to avoid disaster .
Mr Boston said it was clear that Morgan was aware of the fire before the ship set sail but that the news was hushed up so as not to alarm passengers .
It was , perhaps , for this reason that Morgan quietly cancelled his ticket on the maiden voyage the day before the ship set sail , said Mr Boston .
" The crew , who had been sworn to silence , knew very well he was not [ on board ] because they had watched him , late on the night before his ship was due to sail ... carrying his own luggage down to his Rolls - Royce on the quayside , " he said .
" Why ?
Because he knew there was an uncontrollable fire down in coal bunker number six . "
But not all experts on the disaster agree with Mr Boston 's assessment .
Geoff Pattison , a member of the American and British Titanic Societies and lecturer at Northumbria University , is sceptical .
" The Diana inquiry took 10 years and millions of pounds to decide that it was an accident , and this is how I view the Titanic , " he said .
" I think this is a case of conspiracy after the fact , like the Kennedy assassination .
It was just a simple twist of fate . "
Prince is renowned for his high - octane concert performances
Prince - of pop music 's biggest stars - is celebrating his 50th birthday .
Use our interactive timeline to find out more about the ups and downs of his careers .
Full name : Prince Rogers Nelson Born : 7 June 1958 , Minneapolis , Minnesota , USA
Also known as : The Kid , The Purple Perv , The Minneapolis Midget , Alexander Nevermind , Christopher Tracy , The Artist Formerly Known As Prince .
Biggest hits : Little Red Corvette , Purple Rain , Raspberry Beret , Kiss , The Most Beautiful Girl In The World .
Quotes : " Sex on a stick " ( Kylie Minogue ) .
" A dwarf who 's been dipped in a bucket of pubic hair " ( Boy George ) .
1958 - WHAT'S MY NAME ?
Prince is named after the jazz band - the Prince Rogers Trio - of his father , John .
But his parents drift apart and separate when he is two years old , and the youngster chooses to live with his father .
But he is thrown out of his family home aged 12 after allegedly being caught in bed with an older girl .
He moves in with the family of his school friend , and future band member , Andre Anderson .
1978 - DEBUT ALBUM
Prince records his solo debut album , For You , for Warner Brothers .
Despite a popular single , Soft And Wet , it only makes the lower end of the Billboard 200 album chart .
1980 - 82 - DIRTY MIND Dirty Mind included songs such as When You Were Mine and Uptown Third album Dirty Mind , containing songs about oral sex and incest , is a critical success but a commercial flop .
Fans include The Rolling Stones , who ask Prince to open two shows in Los Angeles for them .
But the crowd do not appreciate the moustachioed musician 's sexually ambiguous look and boo him off stage .
A year later , in 1982 , he scores his first mainstream success with ambitious double album 1999 .
It sells three million copies in the US , and sets the template for the Minneapolis sound - buzzing synths and funky drum machines wed together in a lascivious funk groove .
1984 - PURPLE RAIN
The Purple Rain album and tour were performed with Prince 's band , The Revolution Purple Rain finally establishes Prince as a bona fide star , and sits at number one in the US for a staggering 24 weeks .
The accompanying film - part - concert movie , part - autobiography - takes nearly $ 100 m ( £ 50.8 m ) at the box office .
Lyrically , the album is unusually restrained for the sex - obsessed singer .
But the erotic fantasy of one song , Darling Nikki , enrages one mother , Tipper Gore , to such an extent that she forms the Parents Music Resource Center and gets explicit albums branded with " parental advisory " stickers .
1985/86 - UNDER THE CHERRY MOON
The faux - psychedelia of seventh album Around The World In A Day disappoints , with the exception of pop classic Raspberry Beret .
The 1986 follow - up , Parade , is more successful but the star 's new film , Under The Cherry Moon , bombs .
" For all those out there who ca n't get enough of Prince , Under The Cherry Moon may be just the antidote , " says the New York Times .
1987 - SIGN O' THE TIMES Sign O' The Times featured Prince singing in a sped - up voice with vocals credited to " Camille " Compiled from the debris of three abandoned albums ( Crystal Ball , Dream Factory and the untitled " Camille project " ) , Sign O The Times is hailed as Prince 's masterpiece .
Trailed by the sparse blues - funk of the title track , the album spans every genre in popular music including rock ( I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man ) , funk ( Housequake ) , soul ( Slow Love ) and pop ( U Got The Look ) .
Rolling Stone says it is " the most complete example of his artistry 's breadth , and arguably the finest album of the 1980s " .
1988 - THE BLACK ALBUM
The Lovesexy tour in 1988 was Prince 's most ambitious show to date Prince scraps his next project , The Black Album , days before release , calling it " dark and immoral " ( it 's also pretty bad ) .
The star says he reached the decision following " a spiritual epiphany " , which some reports suggest was the result of an early experience with the drug ecstasy .
The Black Album 's replacement , Lovesexy , and follow - up Batman ( recorded in just six weeks ) keep Prince 's profile high , but receive mixed reviews .
1990 -92 - NOTHING COMPARES
Diamonds and Pearls featured the hits Cream and Gett Off Despite another dire film ( Graffiti Bridge ) , Prince 's fortunes are on the rise , thanks in no small part to Sinead O'Connor 's cover of Nothing Compares 2 U. Prince responds with two of his most commercial and accessible albums in years - Diamonds and Pearls and Symbol .
The only downside is his attempt to embrace hip - hop by enlisting the services of Tony M - a rapper who can't rap .
1993 - SLAVE
With his star back on the rise , Prince releases a greatest hits album , announces his retirement , and changes his name to an unpronounceable symbol .
It turns out that he is embroiled in a legal dispute with Warner Brothers over his music .
His independently - released single , Most Beautiful Girl In The World , gives him his first UK number one .
Negotiations with Warner Brothers stall , and Prince takes to writing the word " slave " on his face in eyeliner .
The public is not impressed .
1996 - FAMILY TRAGEDY
Prince 's newborn son , Gregory , dies of Pfeiffer syndrome , a condition which causes the bones of the skull to fuse too early .
The musician splits from his wife , Mayte Garcia , in 1999 .
Unsurprisingly , his musical output during this period lacks its usual fire and inspiration .
Critics are particularly harsh about his album , The Rainbow Children , which features the advocacy of Jehovah 's Witness dogma ( Prince had been converted to the religion earlier that year ) .
2004 - MUSICOLOGY
Prince and Beyonce performed Purple Rain and Crazy In Love at the Grammys Musicology , Prince 's 22nd studio album , is hailed as a return to form , and sees him back in the top five on both sides of the Atlantic .
In the same year , he duets with Beyonce at the Grammys , is inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , and puts on the most profitable US tour of the year .
Having embraced the internet as a way to release music as and when he wants , Prince wins a Webby Award in 2006 .
But , three weeks later , his site is shut down with no warning .
2007 - 21 NIGHTS
Prince 's Super Bowl performance won rave reviews
After a dazzling performance at the Super Bowl ( in which the rain actually turns purple )
Prince shocks the music industry by announcing he will give away his latest album , Planet Earth , on the cover of a newspaper .
He also plays a wildly successful 21 - night residency at London 's O2 arena , with guests including Amy Winehouse and Elton John .

Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutierrez has declared a commercial fishery failure for the West Coast salmon fishery due to historically low salmon returns .
Hundreds of thousands of fall Chinook salmon typically return to the Sacramento River every year to spawn .
This year , scientists estimate that fewer than 60,000 adult Chinook will make it back to the Sacramento River .
“ The unprecedented collapse of the salmon population will hit fishermen , their families , and fishing communities hard , and that is why we have moved quickly to declare a fishery disaster , ” Gutierrez said .
“ Our scientists are working to better understand the effects that ocean changes have on salmon populations .
We are also working closely with fishing communities to improve salmon habitat in river systems to support sustainable fishing . ”
” This is far below what is needed to sustain the population and we have decided to shut down the commercial ocean salmon fishery for all of California and most of Oregon to aid their recovery , ” said Jim Balsiger , NOAA ’s Fisheries Service acting assistant administrator .
“ It ’s a tough decision , but the condition of the salmon fishery forces us to close most of it to ensure healthy runs of this valuable fish in the future . ”
NOAA ’s Fisheries Service issued regulations to close or severely limit recreational and commercial salmon fishing in the area .
Although the reasons for the sudden decline of the fishery are not completely understood , NOAA scientists suggest that changes in ocean conditions , including unfavorable shifts in ocean temperature and food sources for juvenile salmon , likely caused poor survival of salmon that would have comprised this year ’s fishery .
Loss of freshwater habitat for salmon spawning , rearing , and migration to the ocean is a chronic problem that has made salmon populations more susceptible to the occasional poor ocean conditions .
NOAA will undertake a thorough examination of the causes .
Coho salmon stocks off Washington and northern Oregon , while in slightly better shape , are still far below normal , and there will be substantially curtailed commercial fishing off those areas as well .
A small recreational fishery off Oregon ’s northern coast and targeted on hatchery - produced coho salmon will be allowed .
The disaster declaration opens the door for Congress to appropriate money towards alleviating the financial hardship caused by the fishery disaster .
If the students who heard Barack Obama 's commencement speech this last weekend at Connecticut 's Wesleyan University were typical of their cohorts nationwide , his listeners were an overwhelmingly friendly audience .
A recent poll of college students conducted for the Panetta Institute for Public Policy found , not surprisingly , that support for Obama far outstrips that for Hillary Clinton or John McCain .
Among those identifying themselves as Democratic primary voters , Obama was backed by 66 % , Clinton 20 % .
And among all students surveyed -- 1,004 -- Obama led McCain , 59 % to 27 % , while Clinton had a much narrower advantage , 46 % to 39 % .
" I do n't think we 've seen a generational difference like this since the Vietnam era , " said the institute 's director , Leon Panetta , a former California congressman and onetime White House chief of staff for President Clinton .
" Clearly , students are excited by the Obama candidacy .
The question now is how many of these young people will remain motivated to get out and vote . "
Most told the pollsters they would -- of the 79 % who said they were registered to vote , 81 % said they definitely would be casting a ballot .
By comparison , in spring 2004 a comparable survey found 73 % of students saying they were registered intended to vote in that year 's general election .
Here 's a really eye - popping difference between then and now , though .
Four years ago , 22 % of college students said they were paying a lot of attention to the evolving campaign between President Bush and Democrat John F. Kerry .
The figure for this year : 82 % .
The entire poll , which also gauged student attitudes about the U.S. economy ( bleak ) and Bush ( none too good ) can be perused here .

Perception .
Computational models of facial attractiveness judgments .
Strikingly , both models produced estimates of facial attractiveness that were indistinguishable from human ratings .
The image factors that the model discovered correspond to two of the main contemporary hypotheses of averageness judgments : facial attractiveness and sexual dimorphism .
This provides novel evidence for the importance of averageness and sexual dimorphism , but not symmetry , in human judgments of facial attractiveness .
Very related : Computer taught to recognize female attractiveness 2008;37(1) :126-42 .
Related ArticlesBronstad PM , Langlois JH , Russell R.We designed two computational models to replicate human facial attractiveness ratings .
The primary model used partial least squares ( PLS ) to identify image factors associated with facial attractiveness from facial images and attractiveness ratings of those images .
For comparison we also made a model similar to previous models of facial attractiveness , in that it used manually derived measurements between features as inputs , though we took the additional step of dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis ( PCA ) and weighting of PCA dimensions via a perceptron .
Because PLS extracts a small number of image factors from the facial images that covary with attractiveness ratings of the images , it is possible to determine the information used by the model .
In contrast , facial symmetry was not important to the model , and an explicit feature - based measurement of symmetry was not correlated with human judgments of facial attractiveness .

Psst , wanna free £ 5 notes ?
That 's the experiment that Tim Moss of loan price comparison website moneysupermarket.com ran in England one day .
Surprisingly , he found that most people actually could n't be bothered to claim free money !
Representatives from price comparison website , www.moneysupermarket.com wandered the streets this morning wearing sandwich boards offering a free £ 5 note to anyone who asked .
Despite encountering over 1800 people , only 28 passers by bothered to take advantage of the offer .
The experiment also found a stark difference in the attitudes of men and women .
On the streets of London and Manchester , all but 7 of the people who claimed the free cash were men and the research backed this up further .
In a poll of 2000 people almost two thirds of women ( 64 per cent ) said they would not claim the free fiver , compared to 41 per cent of money - shy men .
Additionally , the experiment found that Londoners were more reserved than their Manchester counterparts .
Whilst just 1.2 per cent of people took advantage of the offer in London , this figure increased to 3.1 per cent on the streets of Manchester .
The research also found that the older the person , the less likely they would be to act on the free offer .
Whilst some two thirds of under - twenties say they would claim the free cash , this steadily drops the older we get , declining to only a third ( 35 per cent ) of over 70s who claim they would ask for a free fiver .
Rebound Rates
The Celtics ’ demolition of the Lakers reminds me that the sport announcers would do well to put more emphasis on “ rebound rates . ”
Like putt probabilities , the rebound rate basically tells you the probability that a team will get the next rebound .
Can you answer a fairly simple question :
In the NBA if a team misses a shot , what is the probability that it will get the ( offensive ) rebound ?
Most people I ’ve asked think the probability is 10 percent or less .
But it ’s closer to 30 percent .
Game six was extraordinary not just because the Lakers had only two offensive rebounds , but because they shot so poorly ( 42.2 ) — so there were plenty of misses to rebound — and had only two offensive rebounds .
As the great John Hollinger summed up :
[ F ] or the game [ Los Angeles ] had only two compared to 34 defensive boards for Boston .
That ’s a 6 percent rebound rate if you ’re scoring at home ; normally the offensive team gets around 30 percent .
One question that occurs to me is whether Lakers ’ low number of offensive rebounds was just a matter of bad luck .
If you have a 34 draws and if each draw has a 30 percent chance of success , then just by chance you might only have 2 successes .
But a little analysis ( using the same methodology that I used here to analyze political polls ) suggests that we can reject the bad - luck hypotheses .
The observed rebound rate of 6 percent is more than 3 standard deviations away from 30 percent — so there is less than a 1 percent chance that it would have occurred by chance .
Of course , just as the putting probability turns on the place on the green , the expected rebound probability turns on where the shot is taken and other factors .
The website 82 games.com gives a strategy for making the rebound probability turn on additional factors .
But even simple rebound rates can let us see things about the game for the first time .
1 . This season Philadelphia had the highest probability of rebounding one of its own misses ( 31.8 percent ) , while Miami had a league last probability of 22.1 percent .
Almost a 10 percent difference in getting the ball back when you miss can have a huge impact on games .
2. Rebound rates give you a better sense of who are the best individual rebounders .
During the playoffs , Tim Duncan had the most defensive rebounds per game :
But Marcus Camby had a much higher probability of grabbing a defensive rebound .
Camby himself grabbed more than a third of the other team ’s misses :
3 . Finally , rebound rates show that the art of the offensive rebound is distinctly different than the art of the defensive rebound .
Camby and Duncan , for example , rank only 35th and 21st among players in the playoffs in terms of offensive rebound probabilities .
Who has a high offensive rebound rate ?
Dwight Howard had the best playoff probability ( 16.9 percent ) , but the Celtics ’ Leon Powe is close behind grabbing 15.2 percent of the Celtics ’ misses .
Of course , readers of this blog should n’t be surprised at Powe ’s success .

Clearly in a country like Saudi Arabia it 's important to have a Big List of Things Women Are n't Allowed To Do , but .... working in lingerie shops ??
All over the world , one finds saleswomen at lingerie shops .
In our country — where officials are trying to introduce regulations granting women their rights — women are prohibited from working in lingerie shops .
I wish this would change .
Women are not at ease with salesmen at lingerie shops .
Women do not have privacy when they are out shopping , they deal cautiously and hesitantly with strange men who try selling them underwear and evening clothes .
This is especially the case when they look for a particular size or a certain shape , color or material .
The issue of saleswomen working in lingerie shops has become a crucial one .
The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Commerce must work quickly to solve this problem .
Having an all women lingerie boutique inside shopping centers would not be as awkward as asking a strange man for your underwear size .
Adolescents attending college six months after completing high school are significantly less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than those who do not go to college , according to the first study to directly compare the two groups .
The University of Washington study , recently published in the Journal of Adolescent Health , also compared risky sexual behavior of teens living at home and those who established their own residences and found no significant differences between the groups , said Jennifer Bailey , a research scientist with the UW 's Social Development Research Group and lead author of the paper .
" No one has compared typical teens before , because we stop being so concerned about their sexual behavior after they leave high school , " said Bailey .
" But it is important that we know what they are doing because late adolescence and the early 20s are the peak times for acquiring a sexually transmitted infection .
" HIV is a big risk .
Chlamydia can affect fertility .
The prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia are increasing .
And some forms of human papillomavirus are related to cervical and other cancers .
So it is important that we know what puts young people at risk for these sexually transmitted infections and what social structures may help protect them . "
The study found that college students were more likely to always use a condom and less likely to engage in casual sex or high - risk sex than teens who did not attend a two - or four - year college .
For this study , casual sex was defined as having sex with someone not considered to be a boyfriend or girlfriend , having sex with someone they had known for less than two weeks or having more than one sexual partner in the previous month .
Criteria for high - risk sex included casual sex and inconsistent condom use , as well as having sex with a man who had sex with other men or having sex with a partner who was HIV positive or who was an intravenous drug user .

Overall , the study showed that :
23 percent of the college students reported inconsistent condom use compared to 35 percent of the non-college subjects .
15 percent of the college students engaged in casual sex vs. 29 percent of the others .
5 percent of the college students had high - risk sex vs. 16 percent of the others .
53 percent of the college students engaged in sex in the previous month vs. 70 percent of the others .
The finding that living at home did not confer defense against risky sexual behavior was unexpected .
" It was surprising to us that there was n't a protective effect of living at home for risky sexual behavior , " said Bailey .
" Overall , adolescents who live with parents are less likely to be sexually active , but those who are having sex are just as likely to engage in risky sexual behavior .
" Generally what students do six months after graduation is what they did in high school .
The kids who were doing risky sexual behavior in high school are continuing to do it .
And the kids who were engaging in that behavior in high school generally are less likely to go to college , " she said .
While the study focused on the differences between college and non-college attendees , data showed drug and alcohol use in high school was an important contributor to risky sexual behavior .
Those who used drugs , alcohol or marijuana in high school were six times as likely to engage in casual sex and four times as likely to engage in high - risk sex behavior as non-users .
Bailey said the findings emphasize the need for continuing efforts for HIV and sexually transmitted disease prevention programs in high school and beyond .
" We need these programs because those people who are reporting more risky sexual behavior are those who are at the highest risk for sexually transmitted diseases .
There is an easy way to reach the kids who go to college and there are all kinds of resources there for them , " she said .
" The others are harder to reach with a prevention message once they are out of high school .
Thirty - five percent of the teenagers in our study who were n't in college reported inconsistent condom use .
That 's important .
We need to continue to try to reach young people who put themselves at risk . "
The National Institute on Drug Abuse funded the research .
Co-authors of the study are Charles Fleming , Jessica Henson , Richard Catalano and Kevin Haggerty .
All are affiliated with the Social Development Research Group , which is part of the UW 's School of Social Work .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks tanked Friday , with the Dow industrials shedding 395 points , after oil prices spiked more than $ 11 a barrel and the May jobs report showed a big jump in the unemployment rate .
Bond prices surged , as investors sought safety in government debt , while the dollar tumbled versus the yen and euro .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) lost 395 points , or 3.1 % , its biggest one - day decline on both a point and percentage basis since February of 2007 , at the start of the subprime mortgage crisis .
The broader Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index lost 3.1 % , while the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) lost 3 % .
Both saw their biggest one - day declines on both a point and a percentage basis in more than four months .
The unemployment rate shot up to 5.5 % in May from 5.0 % in April , the government reported , marking the biggest one - month surge in over 20 years .
The report was a clear indication that the economy could be in a recession after all , despite some recent bets that one could be narrowly avoided .
As rattling as the unemployment number was , the stock market was even more spooked by the spike in oil prices , said Bill Stone , chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management .
" I think more than anything , it 's the shock of oil prices being up this substantially two days in a row , " Stone said .
Crude jumped more than $ 16 in two sessions , with prices settling up $ 10.75 to $ 138.54 a barrel Friday on the weak dollar and in response to a Morgan Stanley note that said oil could hit $ 150 a barrel by July 4 .
The spike exacerbated worries about consumer spending , already stretched as gas prices near a national average of $ 4 a gallon .
" You 're definitely seeing the fear trade today , with the dollar down , commodity prices up and bonds rallying , " Stone said .
Stocks could be vulnerable to further declines in the week ahead , after the S&P 500 closed below a key technical level that has previously given a floor to the selling .
Traders said stocks could be in danger of moving back to the lows of March and January , which were seen as something of a bottom after months of stock declines .
Jobs market deteriorates :
The unemployment rate surged to 5.5 % from 5.0 % , beating forecasts for a rise to 5.1 % and showing the biggest one - month jump since 1986 .
The spike really caught people by surprise , said Stuart Hoffman , chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group .
He said the report makes it clear that at least for so - called Main Street and the labor market , " we are in a recession , regardless of how we economists define it . "
He was referring to the fact that GDP has been limping higher and the economy has not been officially declared to be in a recession by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
However , with non -farm payrolls dropping for a fifth consecutive month , it feels to many people like it's a recession , he said .
Employers cut 49,000 from their payrolls , the report showed , versus forecasts for a decline of 60,000 .
Dollar falls , oil spikes :
The dollar continued its slide versus the euro on the weak jobs report and comments Thursday that the European Central Bank could potentially raise interest rates .
The dollar also tanked versus the yen .
The dollar 's decline contributed to a rally in dollar - traded commodity prices , with U.S. light crude oil for July delivery settling at $ 138.54 a barrel , a jump of $ 10.75 .
The increase was the biggest single - day price gain since record - keeping began in 1983 - taking out the previous session 's record .
Oil prices spiked to a record trading high of $ 139.12 after the close , before pulling back a bit .
Gold and other commodities rallied too .
COMEX gold for August delivery rose $ 23.50 to settle at $ 899 an ounce .
Gas backs off record :
The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas fell to $ 3.986 from the previous day 's record of $ 3.989 , AAA reported .
Gas prices had set new records for 28 of the previous 29 days .
Other markets :
Treasury prices rallied , lowering the yield on the 10 - year note to 3.93 % from 4.05 % late Thursday .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
On the move : Stock declines were broad based , with all 30 Dow issues falling .
The Dow 's financial components were hit the hardest , with American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) both down 5 % , and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) down more than 4 % .
AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) slumped more than 7 % on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether the insurer overstated the value of contracts connected to subprime markets , something AIG denies .
Additionally , it was reported that federal prosecutors have asked the SEC for material related to the investigation .
Other big blue - chip losers included General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , down nearly 5 % , and Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) , down 5.4 % .
Intel ( INTC , Fortune 500 ) , Oracle ( ORCL , Fortune 500 ) , Cisco ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) and Qualcomm ( QCOM , Fortune 500 ) were among the biggest technology decliners .
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , losers beat winners by over 4 to 1 on 1.48 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , decliners topped advancers by nearly 4 to 1 on volume of 2.20 billion shares .
Stocks spiked Thursday on a surprise dip in weekly jobless claims , stronger - than - expected May retail sales and a merger in the telecom sector .
But the advance was short - lived as Friday 's barrage of discouraging economic news and spiking oil prices brought out the sellers .

If you type the phrase " concentration camps " into your Internet search engine , you will find page after page of references to martial law and the construction of concentration camps in the United States on behalf of the Department of Defense , the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .
A close examination reveals that many of these references lack sufficient facts to support their conclusions ; however , taken as a whole , there is an abundance of factual information showing an alarming trend in the deployment of federal and military forces to restrain and detain American citizens .
Among the Internet sites are those listing between 600 and 800 locations in the United States where the government is establishing " concentration camps . "
Many of these are former or active military bases ; however , several provide detailed information about their location and improvements , including maps , utube videos , and satellite photographs :
A former Amtrak facility located in Beech Grove , Indiana , is featured in a widely - viewed video on utube .
From the audio description and video images , it is easy to imagine that the site could be used as a detention facility ; however , a telephone call to the desk officer of the Beech Grove Police Department reveals that much of the evidence , including helicopter landing facilities and radio towers , actually belong to the police department that is located adjacent to the now largely abandoned facility .
The desk officer , who also happens to be a local city councilman , was unaware of any federal involvement at the location .
" It ’s a straight facility , " he said .
There are a number of photographs depicting a site in northern Michigan with a double row of chainlink fencing topped with barb wire and elevated guard towers .
The area is part of Camp Grayling , the largest installation of the Michigan National Guard , which deploys several military police commands and trains more than 100 law enforcement agencies from Northern Michigan .
The photographs clearly show an outdoor detention facility , and recent comments by an undercover observer confirm that it is currently maintained .
However , there is an e-mail on the Internet dated January 20 , 1999 from a base Deputy Public Affairs Officer who said : " The ‘ camps ’ you are referring to are used by our Military Police for training .
One of their war - time missions is to process and care for prisoners of war ( POWs ) .
The photos you saw are of that training site . "
Perhaps the most disturbing images show a Department of Homeland facility known as Swift Luck Green located in Central Wyoming .
The five satellite photographs are labeled as having been taken on January 23 and March 24 , 2006 by DigitalGlobe and are annotated as " DHS Facility ( SLG ) . "
Labels include : prisoner housing , restaurant for DHS personnel ; 3 - story dormitory for prisoners ; guard towers ; and prison cells .
Various blogs further identify the location as a closed coal mine near Hanna , Wyoming in Carbon County .
There is nothing comparable to the photographs visible on GoogleEarth at the listed coordinates , and desk officers at the local sheriff ’s office and the police department are unaware of any local DHS or FEMA facilities .
An e-mail to DigitalGlobe ’s media relations contact about the photographs received this reply : " they were in a report called ‘ the hidden gulag , ’ a report on secret nk [ North Korean ] prison camps . "
The report and original photographs can be viewed at the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea ’s website , www.hrnk.org.
This is what fear has wrought .
First , our own government has done everything in its power to make us fearful so we will support its illegal and unconstitutional activities , and then in our fear , we have come to distrust everything our government says and does – for good reason .
These facts are undisputed :
Commencing in the late Sixties , following urban riots in Los Angeles , Detroit , Newark , Cleveland , Seattle , Cincinnati and Milwaukee , and in response to a recommendation of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders , the U.S. military initiated plans to assist local and state civil authorities during urban unrest .
Collectively , the response was known as " Operation Garden Plot , " and each military branch established its own plans , which have evolved over the years .
In 1984 , a military " Disturbance Plan " defined its targets as " disruptive elements , extremists or dissidents perpetrating civil disorder , " which in turn is defined as " riot , acts of violence , insurrections , unlawful obstructions or assemblages , or other disorders prejudicial to public law and order . "
It concludes , " spontaneous civil disturbances which involve large numbers of persons and / or which continue for a considerable period of time , may exceed the capacity of local civil law enforcement agencies to suppress .
Although this type of activity can arise without warning as a result of sudden , unanticipated popular unrest ... it may result from more prolonged dissidence ....
This would most likely be the outgrowth of serious social , political or economic issues which divide segments of the American population .
Such factionalism could manifest itself through repeated demonstrations , protest marches and other forms of legitimate opposition but which would have the potential for erupting into spontaneous violence with little or no warning . "
Dated November 1985 , a United States Army field manual entitled , " Civil Disturbances , " says " if there are more detainees than civil detention facilities can handle , civil authorities may ask the [ military ] control forces to set up and operate temporary facilities ....
These temporary facilities are set up on the nearest military installation or on suitable property under federal control ... supervised and controlled by MP officers and NCOs trained and experienced in Army correctional operations . "
At the same time as these plans and manuals were being developed and issued , President Reagan authorized a secret program for the imposition of martial law and massive detentions .
First revealed by Oliver North during his congressional testimony , the plan was known as Readiness Exercise 1984 , or REX 84 .
The program was originally intended to confront a " mass exodus " of illegal aliens across the Mexican - U.S. border , and to provide confinement facilities where they could be locked up by FEMA .
Otherwise known as a continuity of government plan , REX 84 involved an actual civil readiness exercise in April 1984 by FEMA in association with 34 other federal agencies .
In a combined exercise with the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Night Train 84 involved multi-emergency scenarios at play inside and outside the U.S. Confronted with civil disturbances , major demonstrations and labor strikes that would affect continuity of government and / or resource mobilization , and to fight subversive activities , the military was authorized to arrest as many as 400,000 people and to move them to military facilities for confinement .
In 1985 , FEMA ’s director was Louis Giuffrida , who in 1970 had called for the imposition of martial law in case of a national uprising by black militants .
He envisioned " assembly centers or relocation camps " for at least 21 million " American Negroes . "
Regarding martial law , he later wrote , " No constitution , no statute or ordinance can authorize Marital Rule ....
The significance of Martial Rule in civil disorders is that it shifts control from civilians and to the military completely and without the necessity of a declaration , proclamation or other form of public manifestation ....
Martial Rule is limited only by the principle of necessary force . "
As reported by the Miami Herald on July 5 , 1987 , " These camps are to be operated by FEMA should martial law need to be implemented in the United States and all it would take is a presidential signature on a proclamation and the attorney general ’s signature on a warrant to which a list of names is attached .

There is silence and blackness .
Then , slowly , the words " Not long ago , in a supermarket not so far away " scroll across the screen , blue letters against the black background ; a large shopping trolley moves across the screen , chasing a small basket filled with vegetables and firing red laser beams .
Then two characters appear : Cuke Skywalker , a cucumber in a blond wig , and Obi Wan Granoly ( who looks like a stick of Peperami , but that can't be intentional ) .
The traditional ways of the " farm " , explains Obi Wan Granoly , are under threat from " an empire of pollution and pesticides " .
Cuke must team up with Ham Solo and Chew Broccoli to rescue Princess Lettuce and defeat Darth Tater , who is " more chemical than vegetable " .
No , this is n't a new offering by film parodists Adam and Joe , or the latest weirdness from YouTube ; this is Star Wars according to organic vegetables .
Renamed " Store Wars " , the film can be found on green.tv , the first broadband channel devoted to environmental films .
The channel went live in 2006 with seven channels covering air , land , water , climate change , people , species and technologies ; films are sourced from around the globe produced by non-governmental organisations , community film - makers , public - sector bodies and other companies , as well as user - generated content .
Each channel has a feature , a children 's film and a news story .
" Store Wars is one of our best films , " says Ade Thomas , the chief executive of green.tv .
" It addresses serious issues in a playful way , which is the kind of thing I wanted for the channel . "

Thomas had the idea for green.tv while sitting on the sofa at home three years ago .
" It was a real eureka moment , " he says .
" I 've always been interested in broadcast journalism and passionate about environmental issues , and green.tv is a way of combining those things . "
Thomas searched the internet for a suitable domain name and found that " green.tv " was still up for grabs .
" At that moment I knew I had a major new project on my hands and that my life would go in a completely different direction . "
Thomas 's interest in technology helps , although he admits it weakens his case for being , as he describes himself , a " hardcore environmentalist " .
" I am a little bit of a hypocrite when it comes to technology and it's not easy to reconcile those two parts of my life .
I just tell myself that all the most interesting people have contradictory lines of thought .
And it 's impossible to be completely and utterly green .
" Also , I do think that we need some kind of big technological solution to climate change – some über piece of science to suck the CO2 out of the atmosphere – because it's up there , and we 've got to get it back out . "
Thomas first awoke seriously to the idea of climate change while he was studying Social and Political Science at Cambridge University ; during his course he wrote a paper , which combined the subjects of military history and environmentalism .
" That was at a time when climate change was still hotly debated and no one questioned the fact that most of the scientists who contested climate change were on the payroll of oil companies . "
After his MA in Media Studies , Thomas worked for the Radio 4 environmental issues programme Costing the Earth , but was disillusioned with the BBC 's partiality .
" I had to toe the BBC journalistic party line , which was to question climate change . "
In search of more editorial freedom , Thomas found himself at 27 making films for the World Wild Fund for Nature .
" Every three weeks I went off to make a film and I got to be impartial and tell the story the way I saw it , which was great . "
Watch ' Store Wars ' from green .

But back to that sofa .
Thomas 's big idea took a year of work to realise , before its debut on the inauspicious - sounding date of 1 April 2006 at the Cannes TV Festival .
" Our biggest problem was to convince people , back then , that videos would be widely watched on the internet .
It was extremely boring selling the idea to people because the first three - quarters of any conversation was me going , ' No , no seriously – people really will watch video on the internet ' and then the last quarter describing what the site was going to look like and how we would organise it . "
Once the ball was rolling , however , green.tv went from strength to strength : Thomas convinced the United Nations Environment Programme to be a partner to the channel , and Greenpeace International followed shortly after .
Green.tv is also syndicated via iTunes ; the channel is regularly splashed on a banner on the iTunes homepage and green.tv podcasts have made it into the top 100 most popular podcasts in the UK .
MySpace has given green.tv its own branded channel and green.tv provides all of Tiscali 's environmental content .
The channel 's viewing figures are 800,000 page impressions and 220,000 unique visits a month .
Not as much as , say , YouTube , but not bad for a small channel with no budget for PR or marketing .
Ah yes , money .
" I would say that our largest continuing problem is financing , " says Thomas , who sold his house in order to fund the channel .
" It just about runs along . "
The channel is also buoyed up by money generated by Large Blue , Thomas 's production company .
Happily , the channel has just found a sponsor in the shape of Ecover , but advertisers have not exactly been banging its door down , a status quo Thomas hopes will change .
" Online video is still a relatively young industry and advertisers are still lagging behind a bit .
So media buyers and planners do n't immediately turn to online video , but they 're used to print , radio and broadcast so there still is n't really an industry to deliver online video advertising . "
Despite that , the future looks bright for green.tv .
It will shortly be launching a new online platform , which will include advanced technology to make the channel more interactive .
" The aim is and has always been to combine the emotive power of television with the interactive possibilities of the internet .
Our strapline is " Watch , Engage , Act " – and that 's what we want people to do : watch the films , engage with them and then use the internet to buy the right stuff and sign up to the right things . "
It is also hoping to expand into the US , looking at establishing a base in California .
" It 's important that we all make changes to the way that we live our lives ; I think things need to change on a fundamental technological level .
I think that on an ideological and cultural level , green.tv is part of that solution . "

A new bill sponsored by Rep. Anthony D. Weiner ( D - N.Y. ) would move foreign fashion models into a less - competitive visa category .
Weiner bill looks out for models
Comprehensive immigration reform may have eluded the 110th Congress , but House Democrats are still hoping to help two groups of workers — fashion models and computer geeks — who are usually linked only in implausible online fantasies .
Under current immigration policy , models coming to the United States for a photo shoot or an event — regardless of how short the stay — compete with high - tech workers for precious H - 1B visas .
But under a bill that cleared the Judiciary Committee last week , the models would be moved into a separate immigration category , freeing up more H - 1B slots for the much - needed nerds .

The models and the high - tech workers were hastily lumped together in a 1991 immigration package .
Back then , it did n’t much matter :
The number of available H - 1B visas was greater than the number of qualified applicants seeking them .
But those days are gone .
In recent years , there have been as many as 165,000 applicants annually for the category ’s 85,000 possible spots .
As the competition for the visas has stiffened , the models have been squeezed out .
According to the committee report accompanying the bill , the government issued between 614 and 790 visas to models in each year between 2000 and 2005 .
But the number began falling after that , and it was all the way down to 349 in fiscal year 2007 .
A shortage of models ?
Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - N.Y. ) , who introduced a bill that would create 1,000 new visa slots for them , said it ’s a problem in Manhattan but also in his Brooklyn district , which feels the impact in terms of the loss of “ ancillary benefits ” such as jobs in the industry or increased business .
Weiner ’s bill moves models into a new P - 4 visa category , one associated with entertainers and athletes .
The bill ’s language requires that the visiting model be “ of distinguished merit and ability ” and that the event or photo shoot have a “ distinguished reputation . ”
Failing that , a model may be sponsored by “ an organization or establishment that has a distinguished reputation for , or a record of , utilizing prominent modeling talent . ”
The committee report makes the case for the new visa category .
The current visa structure , it says , “ hurts American commercial interests ” and “ undermines our nation ’s leadership role in the international fashion , publishing and advertising industries . ”
But wo n’t letting in more foreign models hurt American models looking for work ?
The committee report says no .
“ When advertisers and marketers cannot get the particular fashion model they want into the United States for their ‘ shoot , ’ they have an easy solution : namely , to move the location of the shoot offshore . ”
Weiner noted that some modeling agencies have begun simply Photoshopping a backdrop of New York City into a picture of a model in Eastern Europe .
Microsoft ’s Bill Gates and other computer industry impresarios have long lobbied Congress to expand the high - tech visa category , complaining that U.S. tech companies lose valuable talent to other nations .
The Judiciary Committee says losing models — a beauty drain ? — can have a negative effect on the U.S. economy , too .
“ Taxes that would be paid by foreign fashion models for working in the United States are lost to federal and state governments ; firms that manage fashion models in the United States lose commissions to foreign firms ; American fashion models who might be included in ensemble shoots are displaced by local talent in the offshore location ; advertising agencies and other media firms in the United States lose business to their foreign counterparts ; American fashion photographers lose business to foreign photographers ; and workers who support fashion shoots — hair and makeup artists , fashion stylists , prop stylists , photographic printers , retouchers [ and ] assistants — lose employment opportunities . ”
In the Senate , Judiciary Committee members Orrin G. Hatch ( R - Utah ) and Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif . ) said this week that they could get behind Weiner ’s model bill , although both said their primary concerns — high - tech workers and agriculture workers — were elsewhere .
But with swimsuit season upon us , there may not be enough days left on the calendar to get Weiner ’s bill through the Senate this session .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) has n’t exactly made the model fix a top priority yet .
“ I know about a lot of things , ” he said this week , “ but I do n’t know anything about that . ”
Weiner worries that there will be little chance of it moving through the Senate this year .
“ It ’s a little bit of nibbling at the edge ” of immigration reform , he said .
“ It ’ll probably have to wait for comprehensive reform . ”
Catastrophic Fire Guts Texas Governor 's Mansion ( Photos )
Texas Gov. Rick Perry and First Lady Anita Perry are traveling in Europe and have been notified that a catastrophic fire has heavily damaged the Greek Revival Governor 's Mansion .
The residence was once home to President George W. Bush and his family , during his tenure as Texas governor .
Arson is suspected .
The 152 year old structure was under renovation at the time of the blaze , which was first reported to Austin Fire Department early Sunday morning .
Department of Public Safety security officers , who reportedly patrol the property around the clock , saw flames at the front of the house at 1:45 a.m. and called for help .
More than 100 firefighters battled the four - alarm blaze with hot spots still reported six hours later .
The residence has been under renovation since last September .
All of the artwork , furniture and historical artifacts had been removed for the project , which included the removal of asbestos and the installation of all new plumbing .
The governor 's press secretary Robert Black said :
" It will be close to catastrophic .
It 's an extraordinary amount of loss .
We do not know how it started . "
A complete investigation will take place to determine the origin of the blaze .
Building engineers were hampered in their inspection process by fire officials who are concerned about a possible roof collapse .
Later in the day , Texas Fire Marshal Paul Maldonado said :
We have some evidence that indicates that we do have an intentionally set fire , so we believe that we may be looking at a criminal act here . "
The federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms was sending in a team to help investigate according to Maldonado .
He did not give details on how the fire may have been set or whether there was a suspect , but said there were security cameras on the premises .
Governor Perry and his wife are in Stockhom , Sweden with a Texas delegation to attend an American Chamber of Commerce event on wind energy .
That event is planned for Tuesday .
They have decided to continue their trip as planned and return later next week .

I 'm in the Fort Worth area and was on probation so I had to take repeated polygraphs .
I took about 10 over a number of years with just about everyone on this area :
Wood 's being the largest , but 3 - 4 others as well over the years .
The first few times I had no problem at all .
I was scared of every question and I told the truth , so they came out correctly .
THEN I failed one but I was n't lying .
Over repeated exposure I had realized that the " control " questions ( I did n't know they were control questions , I thought they were throw away questions ) did n't matter .
Then I started showing no response to them .
By not being afraid of what I considered throw - away questions I failed .
And , when you fail a polygraph it 's a REAL PROBLEM .
I was n't lying , but any stress at all on a " relevant " question vs no response on a " throw away " question = a big fat failure .
So I retook and AND FAILED AGAIN .
Now I was in serious trouble .
I was so upset the 2nd time that I talked the polygrapher into reviewing the test .
When I called him a couple days later he said I cleared it - even though he showed the scores and I had failed miserable .
He was using computers to score the test .
So , what did I do ?
I came here .
I read the guide and I put it into practice .
After that I passed the next one with flying colors .
But here 's where it goes sideways - since I knew I could pass any polygraph I did n't have to worry about the conditions of my probation anymore .
I left the county without permission and did other things that were n't illegal but were n't allowed by my terms of probation .
I passed every polygraph for the next 4 years lying , or at least being willing to lie if a question came up on the test I could n't answer truthfully .
And I was maniplating EVERY test question whether I needed to lie or not .
The final test used a butt sensor thing , but I just tensed different muscles and was careful .
THE FIRST PROBLEM - was that the polys I failed were totally inaccurate .
So , I had to do something to enhance my results .
THE SECOND PROBLEM - was that once I learned how to beat the machine I had no quams with cheating on my probation requirements .
I was committed to trusting the " professionals " and the " science " behind polygraphs .
It worked some , but when they fail - which is totally unpredictable since polygraphs are based on lies and deception at least , and human error and manipulation as well - then the consequences to ANYONE whether your on probation , trying to get a job , trying to prove your innocence , etc. are DIRE !!
Add to that the fact that they are so EASILY BEATEN .
I did it OVER AND OVER AGAIN while on probation with multiple polygraphers in the Fort Worth / Tarrant County area .
And you have a recipe for disaster on both fronts .
So , there 's my story .
-----------
I know a lot of people on here are getting into law enforcement .
I think the lesson here is to use your judgement and do your job .
Do n't count on BS lie detectors to give you anything useful .
I did my best to follow all my rules for years - until I failed this test .
Then I did n't have to try so hard .
I completed all the conditions of my probation and have n't been in any trouble ( or done anything illegal ) since .
But , it was very disappointing and terrifying when I failed TWO polys by being truthful .
And it 's sad that lying and cheating was the answer to the problem .
The fantasy / fantasy adventure genre has long enjoyed a lot of fanfare in books , but movies are a little bit harder to come by .
While the trend is changing , I wanted to make a list of the top ten fantasy adventure movies .
There are bound to be a pile of films that you would like to see on this list – so please feel free to suggest them – and give reasons for why you think it should be added .
As a note : fantasy adventure means there has to be something beyond the human realm ( so sorry to fans of Princess Bride and the 13th Warrior , but there just was n’t enough to make that jump ) .
So here ’s the list of the top ten fantasy adventure movies .
10 The Wizard of Oz
It ’s the original .
A wizard , good and bad witches , flying monkeys , this movie has it all .
A classic story and a classic film , this movie is way beyond classic : it ’s an inherent part of the culture .
My favorite story about this film was when my grandfather as a boy watched it in the theatre , and was so amazed when it switched to color that he stayed for a second show …and was grounded the moment he came out to see his father who had been waiting over two hours for him .
9 The Dark Crystal
A lot of people know and love this movie , and there is a large number of people who have never heard of this film .
This film is done with Muppets ( though not the famous ones ) and is actually a really incredible fantasy story that will grip you as you watch it .
If you liked Labyrinth but missed this one , then you need to track down a copy right away !
It ’s the classic hero trying to save a nearly doomed world , and you ’ll be surprised by how good it is .
8 Labyrinth
This great 1986 film has a strong cult following , and though it is most famous for having David Bowie as the villain , this is a quality movie that is heavily beloved by many “ children of the eighties . ”
With strange Muppets , a fascinating world , and interesting plot , this movie is a winner .
It was also the last full length movie directed by Jim Henson before his death .
7 Pirates of the Caribbean
This may be one of the best films on the list , the main reason it is lower is because of arguments over whether it is really a fantasy film , or a historic supernatural , horror , etc .
But there is magic , there are skeletons , there ’s a curse , so what is n’t there to like ?
Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are unforgettable , and while this might not feel “ fantasy , ” there ’s enough here to put this memorable trilogy on the list .
6 Krull
Krull is a 1983 heroic fantasy film with a strong cult following .
Directed by Peter Yates , this movie is renowned for its strong soundtrack by James Horner , and is a great answer to trivia as this film also starred now famous actors Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane in bit roles .
A strange surreal movie with fantastic scenes and fun action sequences , this one remains a cult classic .
5 Pan ’s Labyrinth
This 2006 film threw a lot of people , because unlike most fantasy movies , this was not aimed at a younger audience .
This movie had some extreme scenes of violence that threw off a lot of people who were n’t expecting this from a fantasy movie .
The direction was incredible , the story dark and intense , and the combination is fantastic !
This is n’t a movie for the weak stomached or someone looking for a pleasant easy fantasy film , but it is a fantastic work , as indicated by the fact that it ranks as the # 54 movie all time on IMDB .
4 The Never Ending Story
This is one of the all time classics of the fantasy movie genre .
I remember as a kid watching this over and over again , following Atreyu through his quests , along with Falkor , the luck dragon , maybe one of the most beloved characters ever , as they try to find a cure for what ails the princess .
Sebastian reads this book , and is transformed into their world .
As a kid I never got sick of this movie , and it ’s one of those rare gems that is worth watching again and again .
3 Princess Mononoke
This is an incredible anime fantasy movie that starts around Ashitaka , a prince trying to make peace between the human settlement and the forest .
Wild gods , spirits , and creatures all abound in this incredible movie , whose artwork is extraordinary .
At the time , this was the most expensive animation ever made , as both hand drawn animation and computer 3 - D images were used in combination to make this truly unique and incredible film .
2 Willow
Val Kilmer as a lone swordsman , Warwick Davis as a reluctant Halfling hero with the potential to be a sorcerer .
Filled with magic , adventure , and prophecy , this is a fantastic action film that aside from being heart warming and touching , also has moments of great humor , and a few pretty top notch battle scenes to boot .
This is fantastic movie with unlikely heroes triumphing over evil , and while it was ground breaking twenty years ago , the special effects and story still hold up to this day .
This is a fun quality movie .
1 Lord of the Rings Trilogy
While an argument could be made that all three movies would be on a top ten list , I decided to put them together to allow more quality movies on the list .
All three of these films were rated over an 8.0 on IMDB , and it seems appropriate that the trilogy of books that grandfathered popular fantasy adventure would spawn three movies that became wild world wide successes .

Unixwiz.net - Software Consulting Central " No Dashes Or Spaces " Hall of Shame
Though I have a tolerably good handle on e-commerce software , I 've not written much of it myself .
In this respect , I 'm not one to know what 's going on under the hood at any given site : maybe there is a reason why something works the odd way it does .
But I 've observed one technique that has been nearly universal : the practice of refusing to allow spaces or dashes in credit card number entry fields ( this example from The Teaching Company ) :
Credit card numbers are always printed and read aloud in groups of ( usually ) four digits , and when verifying a number after entry ( which involves looking back and forth between the card and the web form ) one uses the spacing to resynchronize .
If there were some security or integrity reason for disallowing these characters , I guess I 'd buy it , but I 've not found a single good reason for it .
The consensus among those that I 've spoken to is that it 's nothing but lazy , sloppy programming .
I completely agree .
It turns out that sometimes one can clean up the spaces and dashes in the same amount of code as the instruction not to ( this example in perl ) :
$ ccnum =~ s/[-\s]//g ; # ( No dashes or spaces )
Credit card validation should never be done exclusively on the client side , and since the server does it anyway , I just can't find any good reason for this sloppy practice .
Those who believe otherwise are very much encouraged to contact me with the reasoning .
Some sites cleverly avoid the " no spaces or dashes " shame by limiting the credit card entry to 16 characters : this has the same effect .
It 's just lame .
The shameful
This is the list of websites we 've been collecting since mid-2003 , and new entries are added at the top .
We invite submissions from others , though only those which can be verified will be added .
Likewise , those who 've cleaned up their acts will be noted here as well .

Money Morning / The Money Map Report
Congress is talking about going after oil speculators in an effort to lower prices by limiting the amount of money flowing into oil contracts .
We realize that they 're upset , but they 're going about this the wrong way .
What 's more , they 're demonstrating a near complete ignorance as to how financial markets actually work .
It does n't help that they 've got energy analysts from some of the top firms telling them the price of oil could drop as low as $ 65 to $ 75 per barrel , bringing gas down to around $ 2 per gallon within 30 days of legislation that puts limits on speculation .
While we normally would n't give a darn about the ignorance of elected officials , the bad news is that , judging from the solutions on the table , Congress is just crazy enough , and the vast majority of American people just angry and uninformed enough , that any legislation passed in haste could actually drive oil prices far higher rather than lower as intended .
Of course , that would create an entirely new set of profit opportunities for savvy investors in the process , but what 's a few trillion dollars of excess oil profits among friends ?
Seriously .
While we applaud the fact that our leaders are angry enough about soaring fuel costs that they feel they have to do something about high oil prices , the danger is that they might actually succeed .
Here 's why .
One of the first things any licensed professional trader learns – particularly those holding the Series 3 like I did – is that in order for markets to function properly , they need a constant mix of buyers and sellers .
Together , those buyers and sellers agree on a price and make their trade .
If there are more buyers than sellers , prices rise as demand outruns supply .
If there are more sellers than buyers , prices fall as supply overwhelms demand .
It 's a very simple equation .
When it comes to commodities such as oil , admittedly it gets a little more complicated because of geopolitical concerns and the whole peak oil argument .
But not by much .
The commodities industry not only thinks about buyers and sellers , but also groups them into two segments : hedgers and speculators .
The trick is that the commodities industry does not use these terms the way congress does , which is part of the flap here and , ironically , what demonstrates their naiveté .
Hedgers include companies or individuals that have commodities for sale or companies for whom the future of a given commodity presents financial risk .
Examples include oil producers who may have to price their oil reserves years in advance and airline companies who are getting zapped now because they did n't .
Speculators are typically companies and traders who assume immediate price risk in businesses that are subject to price changes .
Examples include processors and refineries , as well as bankers who lend money ( which is actually a financial commodity ) at fixed rates .
It 's important to note that speculators are not gamblers .
In contrast to gamblers who simply place bets for monetary gain , speculators trade economic goods like oil for profit based on their utility and scarceness .
They also absorb risk and provide liquidity .
Not only does the presence of speculators help the markets function properly , but also they actually help keep prices down because their presence ensures that the markets are " liquid , " meaning traders can get in and out of positions easily .
If speculators were taken out of the markets like some Congressional leaders are proposing , the net effect would be an artificial reduction in liquidity .
And history shows beyond any shadow of a doubt that illiquid markets are more difficult to trade , tend to produce worse pricing and , when demand is increasing , far higher prices .
And then there 's the potential for hoarding and panic buying – both of which could also drive prices far higher in a real hurry .
So , the real danger is not that Congress wants to dampen future hikes , but that it may inadvertently cause price increases by eliminating one part of the equation that has historically helped hold prices down .
What about the related proposals that reference the introduction of higher margin requirements and increased financial transparency for foreign exchanges ?
Again , those ideas are great in theory but each could have unintended consequences if not enacted in exquisite detail with tremendous forethought .
For instance , one of the proposals at hand includes increasing the amount of margin traders need to buy and sell oil contracts .
While that could be seen as a limiting factor , the net effect is that it 's going to raise the cost of doing business for people who need the futures markets the most – big oil companies , refineries , airlines and trucking companies just to name a few .
And in the process , those businesses will pass along the new costs to already stressed consumers in the form of higher fuel taxes , fuel surcharges , and simply higher prices .
Another bill being sponsored would increase disclosure rules associated with global energy trading .
While this could be great in terms of knowing who 's actively trading the markets on any given day , it could quickly drive oil markets offshore to less regulated , less transparent exchanges .
The net effect of which would be that we would know less , rather than more , about who is trading what – which kind of defeats the purpose .
And that brings us to the profit opportunities .
If this plays out the way we think it 's going to , here 's what to do about it .
First , grab onto a piece of the Middle East and the so - called Frontier Markets .
Many are literally awash in excess petro-profits and their markets will reflect that in the years ahead .
Of course , they 're coming up a very low base so they are going to be really volatile , but we think the ride will be worth it over the long haul .
Second , follow an energy - centric " picks and shovels " strategy with an emphasis on drillers , shippers and refiners .
A well - balanced blend of the three could really pay off no matter which way Congress takes things .
Third , follow the Sovereign Wealth Funds , many of which are profiting from high oil prices .
These " Global Cash Barons " are investing their money around the world in businesses poised to profit from emerging consumerism and , big surprise , high oil prices .
And they do n't like to lose , which is why newly established positions in China , the former Soviet Union and even Africa have all the upside in the world .

Ah , the good old TSA .
When faced with a minute * number of citizens asserting their rights , they simply take those rights away .
And what ’s worse ?
They do n’t even take the rights away from everyone , only the loudmouths like us cantankerous civil libertarians :
Passengers who refuse to show ID , citing a constitutional right to fly without ID will be refused passage beyond the checkpoints .
Passengers who say they have left their ID at home , will be searched , and then permitted to board their flights .
While TSA ’s announcement stated that the goal of the change was to “ increase safety , ” this blogger disagrees .
The change of rules seems to be a pretty obvious case of security theater .
Real terrorists do not refuse to show ID .
They claim to have lost their ID , or they use a fake .
TSA ’s new rules only protect us from a non-existent breed of terrorists who are unable to lie .
Do n’t you feel safer ?

I ’ve often considered trying the “ refuse to show ID ” thing myself , but have n’t wanted to see my business travel delayed and jeopardize my own job simply to thumb my nose at the TSA .

La tv fatta da chi guarda , ecco di cosa parlerà Al Gore in Cattolica , a Milano , il prossimo 9 maggio durante la tavola rotonda ( con Aldo Grasso e Parsi , ) ” La Tv capovolta .
Current : il nuovo corso dell ’ informazione ” .
Al Gore dovrebbe spiegarci cos’è questa tv crossmediale ( un tempo si parlava di intermedialità , ma devo essere rimasta indietro ! ) in arrivo al canale 130 di Sky
Current , al suo sbarco in Italia come primo
Paese non di lingua inglese , manderà in onda informazioni e intrattenimento ventiquattr ’ore su ventiquattro .
Il palinsesto è una play list di brevi video , chiamati “ Pod ” , – piccole pillole di informazione dai 2 agli 8 minuti di durata – raccolti in fasce di programmazione tematica di facile e veloce fruizione .
Oltre ai Pod realizzati dalla redazione italiana , sul canale sarà visibile il meglio dei contenuti provenienti da tutto il mondo , doppiati o sottotitolati .
Gli spettatori diventano veri e propri collaboratori del canale e saranno principalmente giovani tra i 18 e i 35 anni .
Ma veniamo alla parte interessante :
Tutti i “ pod ” che andranno in onda saranno ricompensati con cifre tra i 200 e i 1000 euro : il 30 % del palinsesto farà affidamento proprio a questi ragazzi .
Personalmente Al Gore e il suo nobel non mi convincono , il tema è stato più volte motivo di discussione tra la sottoscritta e il Signore delle tempeste , ma l’iniziativa mi pare interessante e ogni tentativo di Tv dal basso , o al contrario è come minimo degna di attenzione !
Anche perchè leggo che i contributi consistono in :
brevi documentari raccolti su internet da una tribù di giovani video maker : informazioni , notizie , curiosità , intrattenimento , tendenze , mode , costumi , stili di vita , musica , arte , ambiente … da ogni angolo del pianeta .
In America la nuova Tv ha legato il suo nome allo scoop dell ’uragano Katrina ..
Infatti a quanto pare le uniche immagini A TERRA sono state girate da un filmaker che poi le ha mandate on line !
Anche se l’iniziativa viene colta sulla piattaforma di quel magnate che non solo si è pigliato il Wall Street Journal , non solo ha mandato a pescare il direttore , ma si è anche piccato di scrivere un editoriale di suo pugno !!
Mi aspetto che anche lui si butti in politica o che il nostro Presidente del consiglio in pectore si cimenti in editoriali dalle pagine dei suoi giornali o delle sue tv .. mah !
Mi auguro solo che il Signore delle Tempeste , fan del mancato presidente e assiduo frequentatore dei chiostri dell ’università , non si perda l ’evento perchè mandato a lavorare altrove !
Visti GLI ARGOMENTI di cui parliamo sul nostro blog e per smorzare un pò la seriosità di questo post vi linko un video .
The syphilis bacterium , Treponema pallidum , has no nervous system or brain , no consciousness with which to plot an attack .
But it has an ability that is even better : it can reproduce at a rate that leaves us in the evolutionary dust .
For any S.T.D. , making the host more likely to have sex will benefit the pathogen that causes it .
And syphilis may be a case in point .
Detailed records of syphilis infection start appearing in Europe from 1495 , and a fearsome disease it was .
Smallpox was called smallpox to distinguish it from the great pox , syphilis , which evoked this description from Ulrich von Hutten in 1519 : “ Boils that stood out like Acorns , from whence issued such filthy stinking Matter , that whosoever came within the Scent , believed himself infected .
The Colour of these was of a dark Green and the very Aspect as shocking as the pain itself , which yet was as if the Sick had laid upon a fire . ”
Two points are noteworthy about this vivid account .
First , it contrasts markedly with modern experiences with the disease .
Although serious in its overall effects  which can include heart problems , brain damage and infertility  the rash and other overt symptoms of syphilis are now much more muted , and the disease may go undetected for some time , which helps explain why it is so hard to control .
Second , it is reasonable to suppose that a sufferer of the symptoms von Hutten describes would be unlikely to get a lot of dates .
These two observations led Rob Knell , a scientist at Queen Mary University in London , to propose ( in a 2004 paper in The Proceedings of the Royal Society of London ) that they were connected .
If a syphilis - ridden individual were less likely to have sex , and hence spread the disease , it would behoove the disease organism to evolve a less acute effect on its hosts .
Syphilis became less severe , he argued , because it was transmitted more readily if victims were still attractive to the opposite sex .
And while these changes were too rapid to be attributed to humans ’ evolving resistance to the disease , he continued , for the syphilis bacteria , even a few years represents many thousands of generations .
So we have syphilis itself to thank for the lessening of its symptoms .
The disease is still serious , of course .
But the rapid evolutionary change is striking .

* Dow enters bear market territory
* Record oil prices stir inflation , spending worry
* Moody ’s may cut Morgan Stanley debt
By Cal Mankowski
NEW YORK , June 27 ( Reuters ) - Stocks fell sharply on Friday , as concerns about the impact of record oil prices on the economy and fears of more credit losses in the bank sector rattled investors .
The drop in the Dow had pushed it down in afternoon trading more than 20 percent below its October 2007 peak , a decline that Wall Street calls a bear market .
The bear market designation is not considered official unless there is a market close at 20 percent below an index ’s most recent closing high .
Selling gathered steam in afternoon trading after Moody 's Investors Service said it may cut the credit ratings of Morgan Stanley MS.N .
Friday ’s decline followed a rout on Thursday that had the Dow down 358 points .
“ In this kind of a market , people are looking for any reason to sell , ” said Chris Orndorff , managing principal and head of equity strategy at Payden & Rygel .
“ It ’s the opposite of a bull market when people take small positives and run with it .
Now people are taking small negatives and running for the hills . ”
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI tumbled 69.21 points , or 0.60 percent , to 11,384.21 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX dipped 1.08 points , or 0.08 percent , to 1,282.07 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 5.64 points , or 0.24 percent , to 2,315.73 .
U.S. crude climbed to a record for a second straight day , jumping as high as $ 142.99 a barrel and adding to concerns about the toll of higher energy costs on consumers and the outlook for earnings .
Analysts gave more gloomy predictions about the outlook for banks , which have been reeling from the credit crisis .
Lehman Brothers predicted rival Merrill Lynch MER.N would write down another $ 5.4 billion in the second quarter and slashed its price target for the stock .
For details , see [ ID : nBNG192536 ] .
Merrill shares slipped 0.8 percent to $ 32.79 while Morgan Stanley shares were off 0.1 percent at $ 36.79 .
Besides selling bank shares , investors also sold shares of companies whose fortunes are closely tied to economic cycles and are heavily energy reliant , including U.S. plane maker Boeing BA.N , which fell 1.8 percent to $ 66.94 .
Technology was not spared , with BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd RIMM.ORIM .TO falling 2.6 percent to $ 120.25 .
Home builders ' shares tumbled after KB Home KBH.N , the No. 5 U.S. home builder , posted a wider - than - expected quarterly loss .
The stock fell 3.5 percent to $ 17.49 on the NYSE .

1897 : Karl Elsener legally registers his " soldiers ' knife " for use by the Swiss army .
In an age when nationalism was fashionable , Elsener , a Swiss manufacturer of surgical instruments and cutlery , was a very fashionable man indeed .
So he was less than thrilled to learn that the Swiss army was importing Solingen blades from neighboring Germany .
Elsener set out to develop a homegrown multifunctional tool worthy of being carried by his local Alpine troops .
His prototype of what became known as the Swiss army knife appeared in 1891 .
The original – made with a wooden handle – included a blade , a screwdriver and a can opener .
But Elsener was not happy with it and tinkered endlessly , adding a second blade using a revolutionary spring mechanism , and strengthening the housing .
The addition of a second blade necessitated extra space for the spring , which also opened up more room for other tools .
Elsener created a company , which he named Victoria after his mother , and opened a cutlery factory in Ibach , at the foot of the Alps .
After switching to stainless steel blades in 1921 , the company – which remains a family - run concern to this day – was renamed Victorinox , " inox " truncated from the French word inoxydable for stainless .
Today , in addition to its signature army knife , the company manufactures other precision instruments , especially watches .
The classic Swiss army knife bears the Swiss national symbol , a white cross in the center of a red shield , outlined in white against the red handle .
More than 34,000 Swiss
Army knives are manufactured every day , and small wonder .
This remarkably versatile tool is standard equipment for everyone from Boy Scouts to building contractors to mountaineers .
It is even carried into space aboard the space shuttle .
Oh , and every recruit in the Swiss army still receives a knife upon entering the service .
Victorinox supplies the army with about 50,000 knives each year .
Many variations are available , from relatively simple to jaw - droppingly complex .
The SwissChamp model , for example , which sells for around 88 bucks , boasts ( take a deep breath ) : a large blade , small blade , can opener with small screwdriver , bottle opener with large screwdriver and wire stripper , scissors , pliers with wire cutter , wood saw , fish scaler with hook disgorger and ruler , metal saw with metal file and nail file , magnifying glass , reamer with sewing eye , Phillips screwdriver , corkscrew , hook , wood chisel , fine screwdriver , mini- screwdriver , ballpoint pen , straight pin , tweezers , key ring and … a toothpick .
A commemorative knife known as The Giant ( it 's 9 inches thick ) , contains 85 devices allowing for 110 functions .
It 's yours for around $ 1,200 .
Other models reflect advances in technology and include features such as a laser pointer , USB flash drive and even an MP3 player .

Believe it or not , many people love their jobs , but it 's the location of where they must do their job that can make the job unpleasant .
Cubicles , claustrophobic offices , dark libraries , rooms with no windows and dull lighting , next to dried up plants , or surrounded by stale air can drive the sanest worker insane .
A little daylight , fresh air , and greenery would do wonders to a workers mentality and perhaps even increase work productivity .
What if there was a way to combine work , fresh air and sunshine ?
You could grab a laptop , step outside , find a wide tree , sit down and place your laptop on your lap .
It will work .
It 's uncomfortable , but it will work , unless of course you run out of batteries and then you 're uncomfortable and out of power .
Or you can take a seat at this solar powered outdoor workspace created by Mathias Schnyder .
The solar powered outdoor workspace is basically a chair with solar roof that retains and converts solar energy .
The energy is then delivered to an outlet in the middle of a round table in front of the chair .
The seat has circular segment , allowing people to sit across from each other or right next to each other without funky edges or corners getting in the way .
This also helps to reduce wind and sun exposure .
In other words , a group of these chairs can be placed around one of these tables .
I found no information on whether the table is expandable or if it has more than one outlet available for everyone that uses it at one time .
There is also no information on the price or the availability of this solar powered outdoor workspace .

One of America 's most powerful businessmen has been indicted on multiple counts of using prostitutes , drug abuse and massive financial fraud , in the latest boardroom scandal to hit the US courts .
Henry T Nicholas III , the billionaire founder of the technology company Broadcom , was charged on Thursday with a litany of offences related to a high - flying lifestyle that prosecutors say saw him create a secret underground drugs lair at his home , and invite strippers to parties at a private warehouse stocked with cocaine and ecstasy .
In an 18 - page indictment unsealed in Los Angeles on Thursday , Mr Nicholas , 48 , was accused of buying and distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of drugs over several years .
He allegedly spiked the drinks of fellow executives with ecstasy , hired prostitutes for himself , his employees and his customers , and once smoked so much marijuana on his private jet to Las Vegas that the pilot was required to " put on an oxygen mask " .

A separate indictment accused Mr Nicholas of conspiracy and securities fraud in an alleged scheme to illegally backdate stock options which last year forced Broadcom , which makes semiconductors for mobile phones , to write off $ 2.2 bn ( £ 1.1bn ) .
His former finance chief , William Ruehle , was also charged in connection to the alleged fraud , which could see both men sentenced to a total of 370 years in prison .
The former corporate whizz - kids deny all charges and their cases will be heard by a jury later this year .
Mr Nicholas did not enter a plea during his court appearance on Thursday in Santa Ana , and was released on $ 3.3 m bail to attend a private drug treatment clinic in Malibu .
Mr Ruehle , 66 , who is not charged with the drug offences , was released on $ 2.6 m bail .
Although the fraud charges carry longer sentences , it is the extraordinary nature of the drug allegations against Mr Nicholas that have dominated the headlines .
An imposing , 6ft 6in tycoon with a PHD in electrical engineering , his estimated wealth , according to Forbes , is $ 2.3bn .
The indictment claims that between 1998 and 2003 , Mr Nicholas kept four properties in Orange County and Las Vegas , including a warehouse in Laguna Niguel , California , for the storage and distribution of cocaine , metamphetamine and ecstasy .
He later added rooms containing art and electronics , where he is said to have held parties at which drugs and prostitutes were provided for employees and customers .
On several occasions , Mr Nicholas allegedly spiked the drinks of fellow executives .
In 1999 , he is said to have slipped an ecstasy pill into a colleague 's drink in New York State ; in 2000 , he is reported to have committed a similar transgression .
In a detail that resembles something from a Hollywood gangster movie , the indictment claims Mr Nicholas required drug suppliers to submit formal invoices using " various code words including , without limitation , ' supplies ' , ' party favours ' , ' refreshments ' , and ' E ' . "
Payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars were authorised from his bank accounts .
The charges come five years after Mr Nicholas resigned from Broadcom , claiming he needed to save his marriage .
His attorney , Gregory Craig , said he was innocent of all charges .
" This is a kitchen - sink attack .
They are trying to throw everything at him from eight years ago , " he said .
A statement from Mr Ruehle 's lawyer , Richard Marmaro , said : " Bill Ruehle is innocent of the charges , and he looks forward to the opportunity to clear his good name in a court of law . "

Former prosecutors challenge White House immunity claim
Marisa Taylor | McClatchy Newspapers

WASHINGTON – Twenty former U.S. attorneys , both Republicans and Democrats , urged a federal judge Thursday to intervene in a constitutional battle over whether two White House officials should be forced to testify before Congress about the firings of nine U.S. attorneys .
The former top prosecutors , including two who served under President Bush , argue in court papers that the judge should reject the Bush administration ’s assertion of blanket immunity for presidential chief of staff Joshua Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers in the congressional investigation .
Democrats in the House of Representatives say they were forced to sue in March , more than a year after they launched the probe , because the administration has refused to allow Miers and Bolten to provide crucial information about the reasons the prosecutors were fired .
The case also could determine how former presidential adviser Karl Rove responds to a subpoena in a related congressional investigation .
The lawsuit accuses administration officials of injecting partisan considerations into the firing decisions and making “ questionable or outright false statements ” in subsequent explanations to Congress .
The prosecutors acknowledged that the administration could have legitimate legal reasons for not allowing Bolten and Miers to testify .
However , they called on U.S. District Judge John D. Bates to weigh Congress ’ arguments carefully because of the serious nature of the allegations .
“ This congressional inquiry involves the possible subversion of principles at the core of Constitutional government , ” they wrote .
“ It is a matter of the utmost importance for Congress to conduct a complete investigation to determine whether White House officials have injected , or attempted to inject , partisan considerations into a process that must be rigorously insulated from such considerations . ”
The administration has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that Congress has no compelling interest to review White House deliberations on the matter .
The prosecutors who voiced support for Congress ’ position include officials who served under presidents Johnson , Nixon , Carter , Reagan , Clinton and both President Bush and his father , former president George H.W. Bush .
Alan Bersin , a former U.S. attorney under Clinton , and William Braniff , a former U.S. attorney under George H.W. Bush , both served as the top federal prosecutor in San Diego , where the Bush administration later fired then - U.S. attorney Carol Lam .
Former New Mexico U.S. Attorney David Iglesias , who was among the ousted prosecutors , and Matthew Orwig , a former U.S. attorney under Bush in Beaumont , Texas , also signed the brief .
“ This brief is apolitical and legally sound , ” said Orwig , who was described in internal Justice Department documents that came out during the controversy as a “ loyal Bushie . ”
“ It was clear as this controversy unfolded that the reasons given for the firings were fabricated .
It also became clear that the congressional investigation was being impeded . ”
Four legal and watchdog organizations also filed briefs in support of Congress : the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law , the Rutherford Institute , Judicial Watch , and Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington .
The congressional investigation into the firings of the U.S. attorneys produced suspicions but no proof that the prosecutors were targeted because they ’d rebuffed Republican demands that they bring weak voter - fraud cases against Democrats or because they ’d mounted corruption investigations of Republicans .
Although White House and Justice Department officials have acknowledged the firings were handled badly , they ’ve insisted the ousters were n’t orchestrated to hinder or encourage certain prosecutions .
A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the latest developments in the lawsuit .
As human rights groups demanded the release of a report on a long - running investigation of the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in the unlawful interrogations of detainees in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Guantánamo Bay , new torture claims were leveled at two U.S. military contractors by a former Abu Ghraib " ghost " detainee who was wrongly imprisoned and later released without charge .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) filed a Freedom of Information Act request this week with the Departments of Justice and Defense demanding release of a report by the Justice Department ’s Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) , which the group says has been completed for months but blocked by the Defense Department .
The OIG investigation was initiated in 2005 after the ACLU obtained documents in which FBI agents described interrogations that they had witnessed at Guantánamo Bay .
While the documents were most notable for their description of illegal interrogation methods used by military interrogators , they also raised serious questions about the FBI ’s participation in abusive interrogations , the actions of FBI personnel who witnessed abusive interrogations , and the response of FBI officials to reports of abuse .
Testifying before a congressional committee last week , FBI Director Robert Mueller denied that the FBI participated in any of the interrogations .
The Defense Department has said the OIG ’s report must be reviewed and redacted to eliminate classified information before it can be made public .
The OIG report and all documents related to this investigation is part of a broader effort to uncover information about the George W. Bush administration ’s torture policies .
To date , more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU ’s lawsuit enforcing the request  including the Bush administration ’s 2003 " torture memo " written by John Yoo when he was a deputy at the DOJ ’s Office of Legal Counsel .
This week ,
Yoo  under threat of subpoena  agreed to testify voluntarily before a congressional committee investigating the legal basis used to justify the Bush administration ’s torture policies .
Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU ’s National Security Project , told IPS , " The inspector general completed this report many months ago .
The problem is with the Defense Department , which is using its classification review as a pretext for delaying the report ’s release .
In this case as in many others , the Defense Department is misusing its classification authority to suppress information about the abuse and torture of prisoners . "
" There ’s no good reason why the report should be withheld from the public , " Jaffer said .
" It ’s being withheld not for legitimate security reasons , but in order to protect high - level government officials from embarrassment , criticism , and possibly even criminal prosecution . "
In related developments , the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , an advocacy group , leveled new torture claims against two U.S. military contractors by a former Abu Ghraib " ghost " detainee , and labeled as " wholly inadequate " a single page unclassified summary of the OIG ’s report released on the case of Maher Arar , the Canadian rendition victim " rendered " by U.S. authorities to be tortured in Syria for 10 months more than five years ago .
In a letter to the OIG , CCR lawyers contrasted the one - page summary with the Canadian public inquiry , which released two public reports after a two - year investigation .
The Canadian Government issued a formal apology to Arar and paid him $ 10 million .
It was the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that provided U.S. authorities with information that Arar was a suspected terrorist .
Arar attempted to sue the U.S. government , but his case was dismissed after the government invoked the so - called " state secrets privilege , " which bars from the courts information that would compromise national security .
The letter charges that the delay of the OIG report ’s release has been reportedly " due to efforts by very senior Department of Justice ( DOJ ) officials to suppress it " because it would expose " serious misconduct . "
It added that " the continued delay in releasing report calls into serious question the independence of the DHS OIG . "
Arar said , " By suppressing the report and issuing one page of publicly available information , this U.S. administration adds insult to injury .
This ‘ summary ’ raises more questions than answers about the government ’s behavior , and does not answer the central question  why I was sent to Syria to be tortured . "
The suit against the contractors , filed last week in Los Angeles federal court on behalf of Emad al - Janabi , a 43 - year - old Iraqi blacksmith , alleges that Janabi was wrongly imprisoned , beaten , and forced from his home by people in U.S. military uniforms and civilian clothing in September 2003 .
He was released from Abu Ghraib without charge in July 2004 .
The defendants are contractors CACI International Inc. and CACI Premier Technology Inc. , of Arlington , Va. ; L - 3 Communications Titan Corporation , of San Diego , Calif . ; and former CACI contractor Steven Stefanowicz , a Los Angeles resident known at Abu Ghraib as " Big Steve . "
The suit charges that the contractors subjected Janabi to physical and mental torture in sessions where the defendants acted as interrogators and translators .
It alleges the contractors transported him to a detainee site in a wooden box and covered with a hood ; scarred his face when his eyes were clawed by an interrogator ; exposed him to a mock execution of his brother and nephew ; hung him upside down with his feet chained to the steel slats of a bunk bed until he lost consciousness ; and repeatedly deprived him of food and sleep and threatened him with dogs .
In October 2003 , during a surprise inspection of Abu Ghraib , the International Committee of the Red Cross discovered Janabi naked , chained , and bruised in a cell in the " hard site " of the prison .
He was a so - called " ghost detainee " who was intentionally hidden from the Red Cross on subsequent inspections and held without appearing on the prisoner lists .
The lawsuit  which alleges multiple violations of U.S. law , including torture , war crimes , and civil conspiracy  notes that CACI provided interrogators used at Abu Ghraib and that L - 3 employed all translators used there .
Stefanowicz was linked to Abu Ghraib abuses in military court martial proceedings and was said to have directed low - level U.S. military personnel in detainee interrogations .
The lawsuit also alleges that a newly published book , Our Good Name , by CACI Chairman J.P. ( Jack ) London , reveals that CACI ’s internal investigation failed to include any interviews of detainees or of a former employee whistleblower .
According to the lawsuit , " CACI has repeatedly made , and continues to make , knowingly false statements to the effect that none of its employees was involved in torturing prisoners . "
In fact , co-conspirators have admitted that Big Steve and several other corporate employees " were involved in the torture , " and at least one publicly released Abu Ghraib photograph shows a former CACI employee interrogating a prisoner in a dangerous and harmful stress position not authorized by relevant military regulations governing interrogation .
In the U.S. Congress , the Senate Intelligence Committee voted last week to limit Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) interrogators to techniques approved by the military , which would effectively bar them from waterboarding prisoners , congressional officials said .
The vote on an amendment by Sen. Diane Feinstein , a Democrat from California , taken behind closed doors as the committee debated legislation to authorize money for intelligence operations in 2009 , marks at least the second attempt by intelligence overseers in Congress to regulate CIA questioning of detainees .
President Bush vetoed the 2008 intelligence authorization bill in March because it included the same curbs on questioning techniques .
This interrogation provision , if passed by the full Senate and House , would likely face the same fate .

Levon " Bo " Jones Fifth Innocent Death Row Inmate Freed In Past 11 Months And 129th Since 1973
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2582 or 2666 ; media@aclu.org
KENANSVILLE , NC – An innocent man who spent 14 years on North Carolina 's death row after being wrongfully convicted for a 1987 murder will be released from prison today .
Jones has been represented by American Civil Liberties Union Capital Punishment Project lawyers Cassandra Stubbs and Brian Stull , along with North Carolina attorney Ernest " Buddy " Connor .
Levon " Bo " Jones , an African - American man who has always maintained his innocence , was sentenced to death in 1993 for the murder of Leamon Grady , a white man .
Jones is the fifth innocent death row inmate to be exonerated in the United States in the past 11 months , and the third innocent North Carolina death row inmate to be granted release in the past six months .
He is the 129th death row exoneree since 1973 .
" We never had any doubt about Bo Jones ' innocence , " said Connor .
" We knew when we started the case that there were serious holes in the evidence .
After we began seriously investigating the case , it completely unraveled . "
A federal judge ordered Jones off death row in 2006 and overturned his conviction , declaring that the defense provided by Jones ' initial defense attorneys was so poor that they missed critical evidence pointing to his innocence .
After keeping him imprisoned in anticipation of a retrial , the Duplin County , N.C. District Attorney announced Thursday that the state was dropping all charges and Jones would be released .
The sole witness accusing Jones of the murder , Lovely Lorden , admitted in an affidavit filed last month that she " was certain that Bo did not have anything to do with Mr. Grady 's murder " and that she did not know what happened the night Grady was murdered .
A new trial had been set to begin May 12 .
Jones ' exoneration and release comes two weeks after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Baze v. Rees upholding the three drug lethal injection method of capital punishment used in Kentucky .
Other states have begun to lift a de facto national moratorium on the use of the death penalty .
" This case highlights the serious and rampant flaws inherent in the death penalty , " Stubbs said .
" A system that can't protect the innocent from conviction should n't gamble with life and death .
This case – and those of the many other innocent exonerees – should give states pause about lifting moratoriums after the Baze decision . "
Stull said there is a direct link between Jones ' 14 years on death row and the quality of his first trial counsel .
" This case points out the problems with capital counsel in many parts of the country , " he said .
" Bo Jones 's first trial lawyer never bothered to get the many conflicting statements of Lovely Lorden , let alone do the kind of investigation necessary in a first degree murder case .
We will never know if Lorden would have admitted the truth earlier had the case been investigated and had she been adequately cross-examined . "
Jones was represented in post - conviction by the North Carolina Center for Death Penalty Litigation , which persuaded the federal court to grant him a new trial .
Larry Lamb , a codefendant of Jones who has also always maintained his innocence , remains behind bars , serving a life sentence .
Lamb turned down a plea offer of a six year sentence and was also convicted based on the testimony of Lorden .
He plans to ask the newly formed North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission to review his case .
Also , every question about Clinton was curiously positive , Coghlan recalls .
The caller said things like , if you knew that Sen .
Clinton believed the country had a serious home mortgage problem and had made proposals to ....
But a few minutes into the conversation Ed says he noticed a strange pattern developing to the questions .
First of all , the " pollster " was only asking about four candidates , three Democrats -- Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama and John Edwards , who was still in the race at the time -- and one Republican -- John McCain .
Ed , who 's a former news director for a local TV station , was curious .
He said , " Sure , go ahead . "
Ed Coghlan was just starting to prepare his dinner in the northern San Fernando Valley the other night when the phone rang .
The caller was very friendly .
He identified himself as a pollster who wanted to ask registered independents like Coghlan a few questions about the presidential race and all the candidates for Super Tuesday 's California primary .
freeze mortgage rates and save families from foreclosure , would you be more likely or less likely to vote for her ?
Ed said , of course , more likely .
Every question about the other candidates was negative .
If Ed knew , for instance , that as a state senator Obama had voted " present " 43 times instead of taking a yes or no stand " for what he believed , " would Ed be more or less likely to vote for him ?
" That 's when I caught on , " said Coghlan .
He realized then that he was being push - polled .
That malicious political virus that is designed not to elicit answers but to spread positive information about one candidate and negative information about all others under the guise of an honest poll had arrived in Southern California within days of the important election .
It could become an issue in the closing hours of the campaign .
Someone who obviously favors Hillary Clinton is paying an unidentified company to spread this material phone call by phone call among independent voters , who can , according to California party rules , opt to vote in the Democratic but not the Republican primary on Feb.
5 , when nearly two dozen states will choose a large chunk of the delegates to the parties ' national conventions next summer .
Coghlan said he was offended by such underhanded tactics and knew he was going to get out a warning about this dirty trick , but he said he played along for the full 20 - minute " poll . "
" The guy was very slick , very personable , " Coghlan told the Ticket .
" He never fell out of character as a pollster the entire time .
He seemed interested in my answers and just kept going through his list of questions as if he was noting my answers .
He was very good , very smooth . "
For instance , the caller inquired , had Ed watched a recent Democratic debate ?
Ed said yes .
And who did Ed think had won the debate ?
the pollster inquired .
Coghlan replied , honestly , that he thought Edwards had won because he was calmer and more reasoned did n't get involved in all the petty arguing and finger - pointing like the other two .
Now , the pollster said , if Ed knew that most people believed John Edwards could not get elected in a general election , would Ed be more or less likely to vote for him ?
Ed said , oh , well then , less , of course .
And the caller appeared to make a note of that .
" He was not pushy at all , " Coghlan said .
" And at the end he thanked me for giving him my opinions . "
Phil Singer , the spokesman for the Clinton campaign .
was contacted by e-mail last night .
He answered that he was there .
He was asked if the Clinton campaign was behind the push - poll , knew who was behind it or had any other information on it .
That was at 5:27 p.m. Pacific time Saturday .
As of this item 's posting time , exactly eight hours later , no reply had been received .

Definitely a good way to look at it :
Fear , in other words , is a tax , and al - Qaeda and its ilk have done better at extracting it from Americans than the Internal Revenue Service .
Think about the extra half - hour millions of airline passengers waste standing in security lines ; the annual cost in lost work hours runs into the billions .
Add to that the freight delays at borders , ports and airports , the cost of checking money transfers as well as goods in transit , the wages for beefed - up security forces around the world .
And that does n’t even attempt to put a price tag on the compression of civil liberties or the loss of human dignity from being groped in full public view by Transportation Security Administration personnel at the airport or from having to walk barefoot through the metal detector , holding up your beltless pants .
This global transaction tax represents the most significant victory of Terror International to date .
The new fear tax falls most heavily on the United States .
Last November , the Commerce Department reported a 17 percent decline in overseas travel to the United States between Sept. 11 , 2001 , and 2006 .
( There are no firm figures for 2007 yet , but there seems to have been an uptick . )
That slump has cost the country $ 94 billion in lost tourist spending , nearly 200,000 jobs and $ 16 billion in forgone tax revenue — and all while the dollar has kept dropping .
Why ?
The journal Tourism Economics gives the predictable answer : “ The perception that U.S. visa and entry policies do not welcome international visitors is the largest factor in the decline of overseas travelers . ”
Two - thirds of survey respondents worried about being detained for hours because of a misstatement to immigration officials .
And here is the ultimate irony : “ More respondents were worried about U.S. immigration officials ( 70 percent ) than about crime or terrorism ( 54 percent ) when considering a trip to the country . ”
Police arrested a Mesa man after they say he assaulted and threatened to kill a man he found in bed with his wife Thursday afternoon .
The incident occurred around 3 p.m. in the 100 block of South Roosevelt Road near West Main Street and South Dobson Road .
After Eugene Quizar Terrazas Jr. came home to find his wife engaged in sexual intercourse with her boyfriend , Terrazas became enraged and grabbed the boyfriend and threw him into a computer , police said .
While the boyfriend was running out of the apartment naked , Terrazas threw a chair at him and a yellow lamp out the window , police said .
Terrazas then grabbed his wife by her hair and arms and dragged her out of the apartment .
According to the police report , while the boyfriend was putting his clothes on Terrazas approached him with a knife and told him that if he ever came back he would kill him .
Terrazas returned inside the apartment and put the knife in the dishwasher and threw his wife 's clothes out the window .
While tossing her clothes out , Terrazas threw a shoe that hit her in the face , police said .
Terrazas and his wife have been married for three years , but his wife has been living at different half - way homes for two years of the marriage , police said .
What ’s it like on the other side of the car rental counter ?
The answer may surprise you .
I ’ve been corresponding with a former car rental employee , and he ’s shared some remarkable insights into the business that might help you make a more informed decision the next time you rent a car .
The first thing you need to understand , he says , is that agency employees are n’t in the customer service business .
They ’re salespeople .
Elliott Advocacy is underwritten by Southwest Airlines .
The mission of Southwest Airlines is dedication to the highest quality of Customer Service delivered with a sense of warmth , friendliness , individual pride , and Company Spirit .
We are committed to provide our Employees a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth .

We are committed to provide our Employees a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth .
I ’m judged almost solely on a number .
It ’s determined by the number of times I sell our products per given opportunity .
Every customer who walks up is an opportunity to sell a number of different services .
For me , I can sell the damage waiver — that ’s the most popular — liability insurance , personal accident and effects coverage , and the pre-pay fuel option .
Upon returning a customer ’s vehicle , I can charge a fee if the tank is not filled up to the level it was rented at .
For customers who have reservations , I can upgrade them to a better vehicle .
That ’s six different opportunities to sell to each customer .
As a car rental employee , your goal is to sell “ every one of these products to every customer , ” he adds .
And if he can ’t ?
Then that all - important number by which every car rental employee is judged is lowered .
So even though you may sell , for instance , the liability insurance , you have failed to sell four to five other services and thus your number will be docked .
This number is very important because we get paid a commission on it according to a pay scale and the dollar amount we ’ve brought in each month and quarter .
There is a floor and ceiling to this pay scale .
If your number is below a certain level you are n’t eligible for a commission .
If our numbers remain consistently high , we can be considered for promotion .
If our numbers are low , we hear about it from umpteen different managers in e-mails , by phone , and in person .
The numbers game is played at the highest level .
Managers are judged based on their location ’s cumulative number — an aggregate of all employee numbers — so they ’re likely to encourage more aggressive sales strategies .
“ I saw all kinds of tactics to increase these numbers , ” he says .
“ Some higher managers turned a blind eye to questionable and unethical methods . ”
How does this affect you ?
Keep in mind that you ’re dealing with overworked , stressed - out employees from the moment you walk up to the counter to the moment you return your vehicle .
At one point , this ex-employee was working 12 - hour shifts without a break .
Also , remember that they see dollar signs the moment you walk through the door .
So they will do anything in their power to sell you insurance , a fuel purchase option or an upgrade .
How to get around this racket ?
Here are six tips from my insider .
1 . Always inspect the car you are renting with an employee before signing anything .
Car rental offices should have a vehicle inspection form that ’s signed by you before the car leaves the lot .
This limits the possibility that you ’ll get blamed for damage that you did n’t cause .
“ Unfortunately , from my experience , many customers were blamed for damage they did not cause , ” he says .
“ As a tired and busy employee , the last thing I want to do is walk around the car with you and make notations about the small scratches on the rear bumper .
I could care less .
But you should be adamant that this is done before you sign for anything . ”
2 . Off - airport locations are often cheaper than airport locations .
The vehicles at airport locations typically cost more because of airport fees , which cover the car rental agency ’s rental and transportation costs .
“ The cost difference can be great , ” he says .
“ You may want to reserve a car at a location nearby the airport .
You should see a difference . ”
3 . Make multiple reservations and play the system .
Most reservations can be canceled without penalty .
My insider suggests making multiple reservations .
“ Look at rates online or call in for them , ” he says .
“ If you ’re not too picky , make a reservation for one of the small , cheap cars .
Make another for a nicer car that you might like to rent .
When you show up , use the reservation for the smaller car .
Ask the rep how much it costs to upgrade to the nicer car you want to rent .
If they rate ends up being less than what you reserved the higher - class car at , then do it .
If not , use the other reservation .
They have to honor reservation rates . ”
4. Negotiate your upgrade .
Upgrade rates do n’t exist .
They ’re made up by salespeople .
“ If you come in with a Ford Focus reservation and were interested in a larger car , I ’ll charge an upgrade for you to get into a Ford Escape , ” he says .
“ If you have a Ford Escape reservation and are looking for something more fuel - efficient , I ’ll charge you an upgrade to a Ford Focus .
This actually happens ! ”
The “ fee ” is entirely at the salesperson ’s discretion , and is entirely negotiable .
5 . Timing is everything .
The largest expense incurred by a car rental company is depreciation .
Basically , these companies are leasing all the cars in their fleet .
They ’re charged different rates for different types of cars .
“ It is very important for car rental companies to have as many cars on the road as possible , as any cars that are sitting are not making money , and are actually costing the company money in depreciation fees . ”
A customer who shows up after a busy holiday weekend can more or less name the price for a rental car .
“ They should be begging for you to take cars off their lot , ” he adds .
6. Complain and you shall receive .
Car rental companies often go to great lengths to make a customer happy — even when their grievances are not legit .
“ Like most companies , we want you to use again — and again and again , ” says the insider .
“ Even some of the most ridiculous complaints that I ’ve seen have been resolved by one of my managers .
They offered a full refund and a free rental to a customer I knew was full of it .
But we want you back so much that an occasional hit is fine . ”

We have learnt quite a lot about Windows 7 this week , and one of the things was that Windows 7 would not get a new kernel .
The call for a new kernel has been made a few times on the internet , but anyone with a bit more insight into Windows ’ kernel knows that there is absolutely no need to write a new kernel for Windows – the problems with Windows lie in userland , not kernelland .
While the authenticity of the Shipping Seven blog is not undisputed , the blogger makes some very excellent points regarding the kernel matter .
I have written numerous times that there is nothing wrong with the Windows NT kernel currently powering about 90 % of the world ’s desktops .
It provides advanced security features , it ’s extremely stable , very portable , and supports just about any piece of hardware in the x86 desktop and server markets .
“ In conclusion , scrapping Windows NT would be a pointless exercise .
It is a mature , stable , and , yes , secure system by design . ”
I wrote a year ago , “ Do not make the mistake of thinking that simply because Microsoft refused to enforce proper security policies from the get - go , that NT is an insecure system by design . ”
The Shipping Seven blog seems to agree with this position .
“ The 2000 / XP / Vista / Windows 7 kernel has evolved quite nicely over the years , and ( in my opinion ) is one of the best bits of code we have , ” the blogger writes , “ You do not , and should not , do a total rewrite of a kernel in a widely - used OS between releases . ”
He makes a valid point : how often , exactly , has the Linux kernel been rewritten ?
It also seems as if a lot of people are confused by the concept of MinWin , introduced by Eric Traut in October last year .
MinWin is not a new kernel .
It is not a ground - up rewrite of the Windows NT kernel .
MinWin is just as he described it : the Windows NT kernel stripped of a lot of things .
Nothing new , nothing fancy .
Traut also specifically mentioned that MinWin would not become a product in and of itself .
The Shipping Seven blogger reiterates that you already more or less have MinWin ; theoretically , you could strip Windows Vista down to just the NT kernel using the command line .
Personally , I have no idea how you would go about that , but the authors of vLite do .
Sadly , this tool is unsupported by Microsoft .
I agree with the comments on the blog post : Microsoft should provide a tool similar to vLite for Windows Vista – in fact , Microsoft could even buy out the vLite people , seeing as the company has done so before with other tools they found useful .
Bless the tool , help improve it , and give us the ability to control every aspect of Windows .
If it ’s already so componetised as they say , what ’s the big deal ?
Mr Salmond officially opened the biomass plant
Enlarge Image
Steven 's Croft - owned and operated by E.ON - is the largest wood - fired facility of its kind in the UK .
Mr Salmond toured the site and then switched on a meter which measures megawatts , carbon dioxide and the number of homes receiving energy .
Mr Salmond said the power station would help to put Lockerbie on " Scotland 's renewable energy map " .
He said the facility would have a major impact nationwide .
Scotland 's renewable potential is immense - enough to meet our energy requirements many times over
Alex Salmond
First minister
" At a stroke , Steven 's Croft more than doubles Scotland 's biomass electricity generating capacity from 39 to 83 megawatts , " he said .
" It is proof that not only can we generate power from materials previously seen as waste , we can create good quality jobs and improve the sustainable management of our forests .
" The power plant will produce enough green energy , from the surrounding forests , to supply up to 70,000 homes - more than 17 times the population of Lockerbie . "
Mr Salmond said it could be part of moves to make the country self - sufficient in green energy .
" Scotland 's renewable potential is immense - enough to meet our energy requirements many times over , " he added .
The plant converts waste from the wood industry into energy
" Biomass is a growing component of the mix .
" Steven 's Croft power station is a great showcase for the role biomass can play in a cleaner , greener Scotland . "
E.ON climate and renewables chief executive Frank Mastiaux said he was pleased the first minister had opened the " pioneering project " .
" We need a mix of energy sources such as biomass if we 're going to succeed in ensuring a secure supply of electricity to keep the lights on while reducing carbon emissions , " he said .
" That 's why we 're taking the lead and building projects like Steven 's Croft , which represents part of a billion pound investment that we 're making in the development of renewable energy in the UK over the next five years . "
' Great news '
The Conservative MP for the area , David Mundell , has also welcomed the official opening .
He said : " It is great to see this area once again leading at the forefront of power technology - just as Chapelcross did 50 years ago .
" With the closure of Chapelcross , I am delighted that we still have energy production in the region and all the expertise that brings with it .
" This site is creating 50 jobs at Steven 's Croft and is supporting 250 more and it is great news that the timber is being sourced locally . "

One day in May 2005 , a 16 - year - old hacker named SoBe opened his front door to find a swarm of FBI agents descending on his family 's three - story house in Boca Raton , Florida .
With an arm and leg in casts from a recent motorcycle accident , one agent grabbed his good arm while others seized thousands of dollars worth of computers , video game consoles and other electronics .
His parents looked on .
At that moment , some 2,700 miles away , in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey , California , the FBI was serving a separate search warrant on Jeanson James Ancheta , SoBe 's 20 - year - old employer and hacking mentor .
It was the second time in six months Ancheta had been raided by the FBI - a clear sign , had either bothered to notice , that their year - long botnet spree was unravelling .
SoBe , a few weeks before the raid
But instead of abandoning the venture after the first raid , or at least laying low for a while , SoBe and Ancheta , according to court documents , continued hijacking hundreds of thousands of PCs that they would then corral into massive networks and infect with adware .
So great was SoBe 's sense of impunity he continued the scheme even after Ancheta was arrested a few months later and charged with 17 felonies related to the hijacking of almost 400,000 PCs , some of them belonging to the US Department of Defense .
" That 's why I love this age , its all computers heh , " SoBe wrote in early December 2005 , a month after Ancheta 's arrest , during an online chat .
" All these companys have websites , etc .
Its just funny going somewhere like Target , or Sprint then coming home and rooting there servers out of boredom .
Makes some people feel like they can do anything . "
( Misspellings and grammatical errors are his . )
SoBe 's adrenalin - fueled days of fast money were slowly coming to an end .
His downfall started shortly after he and Ancheta launched their botnet venture , when some clumsy mistakes attracted the attention of federal investigators .
It continued as their homes were raided , and shortly after that , when the feds seized more than $ 38,000 earmarked as SoBe 's cut of the botnet profits .
Then in May 2006 , SoBe was shocked when he learned Ancheta received 57 months in prison after pleading guilty to four counts of fraud related to the scheme .
His undoing was completed in February , seven months after SoBe turned 18 , when he pleaded guilty to two counts of juvenile delinquency related to his use of botnets .
SoBe - who also went under the names SoBe Owns , PwnZ0r , SerlissMc and vapidz - admitted to infecting computers belonging to the Defense Information Security Agency and Sandia National Laboratories .
He was sentenced today in a closed - door hearing .
Although the actual sentence is confidential because SoBe was a juvenile at time of the crimes , his plea agreement contemplated a prison term of 12 to 18 months .
Notes from the Internet Underground
In November , 2005 , just a few days after Ancheta was indicted , SoBe began an internet correspondence with me that continued until a few weeks before he pleaded guilty .
The result was more than 80 pages of single - spaced transcripts that provided a sometimes - candid , behind - the - scenes account of his botnet caper and the investigation that ultimately shut it down .
The conversations revealed a youth of above - average intelligence who nonetheless quit school after the eighth grade .
With an abundance of time on his hands and little adult supervision , he thrived on the excitement of a life dominated by World of Warcraft , fast motorcycles and computer hacking .
The Register is not identifying him because his crimes took place while he was a minor .

As we reported last week , the next major release of Mac OS X will be called Snow Leopard .
While developers attending WWDC will get details from Bertrand Serlet , Apple 's senior vice president of Software Engineering , during the State of Mac OS X session today , we do have some details to share with you now .
The update is scheduled to ship in about a year , and will focus mainly on under - the - hood changes aimed at future - proofing and bettering the performance of Mac OS X .
" We have delivered more than a thousand new features to OS X in just seven years and Snow Leopard lays the foundation for thousands more , " Serlet said in a statement released today .
" In our continued effort to deliver the best user experience , we hit the pause button on new features to focus on perfecting the world ’s most advanced operating system . "
Snow Leopard will add a technology called Grand Central that will allows developers to more easily take advantage of the processing resources in multicore Macs .
It will also include support for Open Computing Language ( OpenCL — not to be confused with OpenCL the cryptography library ) which is designed to harness the processing power of GPUs for nongraphics tasks .
And , Snow Leopard will be capable of addressing a theoretical limit of 16TB of system RAM .
In addition , Snow Leopard will include QuickTime X , a new version of the multimedia framework optimized for extremely efficient playback , a result of engineering work done for the iPhone .
Also , we 'll finally see full , native support of Microsoft Exchange in Mail , Address Book , and iChat .
It 's also hinted that Safari will be included with the super - fast Squirrel Fish JavaScript engine .
Though it may not include any whiz - bang features like Time Machine or Exposé that previous version had , these underlying improvements should enable some serious performance out of current and future hardware .
Whether you ’re typing a paper for school , a document for work , or a fun project in your personal time , we all spend a massive amount of time typing .
Even if you ’re one of the world ’s fastest typers , clicking away at 216 words per minute , using the same old keyboard can get a little boring after a while .
So why not find something a bit more fun ?
Here are five cool keyboards you need to check out if you ’re serious about your typing .
1. Qwerkywriter S
The average mechanical keyboard feels pretty satisfying .
But when push comes to shove , there ’s nothing quite as satisfying as the click and clack of an old - school typewriter .

NEW YORK , June 19 ( Reuters ) - Moody 's Investors Service on Thursday stripped the insurance arms of Ambac Financial Group ABK.N and MBIA Inc MBI.N of their Aaa " ratings , citing their impaired ability to raise capital and write new business .
Moody ’s said earlier this month it was likely to cut the ratings of Ambac Assurance Corp and MBIA Insurance Corp as plunging share prices and the high cost of accessing the debt markets made it challenging for the two largest bond insurers to raise new capital .
Demand for their insurance wraps has also effectively dried up on concerns over losses the companies will take from insuring risky residential mortgage - backed debt .
Standard & Poor ’s stripped both insurance arms of their top ratings on June 5 .
Moody ’s cut Ambac Assurance three notches to “ Aa3 , ” the fourth highest investment grade , and downgraded Ambac Financial three notches to “ A3 , ” the seventh highest investment grade , from “ Aa3 . ”
MBIA Insurance was cut five notches to “ A2 , ” the sixth highest investment grade , and MBIA Inc was cut five notches to “ Baa1 , ” three steps above junk , from “ Aa2 . ”
The outlook for all companies is negative , due to uncertainty of their ongoing business plans .
A negative outlook indicates an additional downgrade is more likely over the next 12 - to - 18 months .
Ambac has said it wants to launch a new top-rated bond insurer , called Connie Lee , and MBIA has said it retained at the holding company level $ 900 million in capital that had been previously earmarked for its bond insurance arm as it reevaluates its options .
Age seems to be no obstacle when it comes to starting a business .
That 's the case with 14 - year - old Anshul Samar , CEO of Alchemist Empire , Inc. , who invented a trading card game , " Elementeo , " that aims to teach chemistry to students in a fun , unusual way .
At the 235th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans , Samar will present his inventive card game .
While other 14 - year olds play on their Xbox , this precocious CEO hopes to secure $ 500,000 in funding so his Silicon Valley - based startup can begin mass producing the game .
" I have always wanted to show the world that the youth can start a business and have fun at the same time , " says Samar .
Like other popular trading card games , Elementeo casts two players against each other in card - based fantasy combat .
But unlike " Pokemon " or " Magic : the Gathering , " Samar says that Elementeo educates just as much as it entertains .
The game is based on a 121 - card deck of chemical elements , compounds and catalysts .
Every card has an explanation of the element or compound 's uses and chemical properties .
For example , the Oxygen card can rust neighboring metal cards and the Copper Conductor card can shock any metals .
The oxidation state of an element is used as its attack power , and its physical state determines its movement on the board .
The goal of the game is to reduce the opponents electrons to zero through strategic use of each card 's chemical properties .
" Our aim is to combine fun , excitement , education , and chemistry , all in one grand concoction , " says Samar .
" We do n't want to create a fantasy wizard world or create a boring education textbook world , but combine the two where fun and learning come together without clashing ! "
Samar received $ 500 in seed money from the California Association of the Gifted ( CAG ) to develop a prototype of Elementeo .
Now , after stealing the show at the entrepreneur conference TiECON in mid-2007 , Samar hopes to get the financial backing he needs to mass produce Elementeo .
" You are not a geek or a nerd if you like chemistry , " says Samar .
" If people do end up calling you a geek because you love chemistry , do n't worry , those people are going to end up working for you at the end ! "

The going rate for a “ thought ” — a probe into the thinking of another — was once quite a bargain .
Today , more than four centuries since the phrase “ A penny for your thoughts ? ” was first recorded , inflationary accounting makes that ancient penny worth more than $ 40 .
Even with the sliding value of the dollar , this still seems quite the bargain .
Of course , times have n’t changed much in one sense , considering the buyer still ca n’t be sure of the veracity of his purchase .
How much would you pay to know what thoughts are swimming around in someone else ’s head ?
And if you could really know their truthfulness how much more would you pay ?
Such fantastical questions have long been the bread and butter of fiction .
From the Twilight Zone to Minority Report , the idea of reading minds — of seeing the private intentions of another , and the possibility of intervening in those plans — has always been highly attractive .
Not long ago science was satisfied with outlining the areas of the brain responsible for various functions and the processing of sensations : frontal lobe for “ higher thought , ” optic lobe for vision , etc .
Not so today .
As Martha J. Farah , director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania , puts it , “ For the first time it may be possible to breach the privacy of the human mind , and judge people not only by their actions , but also by their thoughts and predilections ” .
Penalizing and controlling those once private thoughts may eventually become de rigueur .
Science fiction writer Michael Crichton imagined more than 35 years ago that understanding the neural origin of our thoughts and motivations will water the seeds of our desire to intervene .
At first interventions will be for medical reasons , to control seizures and epileptic “ brainstorms ” that incapacitate their victims .
In Terminal Man ( 1972 ) , Crichton presaged this concept as a computer “ that will monitor electrical activity of the brain , and when it sees an attack starting , will transmit a shock to the correct brain area .
This computer is about the size of a postage stamp and weighs a tenth of an ounce .
It will be implanted in the skin of the patient ’s neck . ”
In Crichton ’s story , Benson , a brain - damaged accident victim , suffers blackouts during which he becomes violently psychotic .
Certainly this seems a humanitarian reason to intervene , but it evolves into the sort of “ could we , should we ” question that is the foundation of many of Crichton ’s novels .
The conclusion is not surprising .
The feedback loop between computer and brain becomes positive rather than negative .
The stimulus pathway that was meant to negate the deviant thoughts becomes the pathway to encourage those actions .
The sensation created within Benson ’s brain becomes pleasurable ; more violence is fed with more pleasure .
“ ‘ It feels so good , ’ Benson said , still smiling .
‘ That feeling , it feels so good .
Nothing feels as good as that .
I could just swim in that feeling forever and ever . ’ ”
In electronically countering Benson ’s seizure , the computer ’s input has been reinterpreted as a positive ; a good feeling is perceived .
This experience drives the seizure forward and , as the story continues , drives Benson to greater and more frequent bouts of violence .
His brain molds itself to the new conditions created by the computer ’s sensory input .
In a no longer unusual case of fiction becoming fact , Crichton was writing of neural plasticity 35 years ago .
With penetrating insight he mused :
“ Our brains were the sum total of past experiences — long after the experiences were gone .
That meant that cause and cure were n’t the same thing .
. . .
As the Development people said , ‘ A match may start a fire , but once the fire is burning , putting out the match wo n’t stop it .
The problem is no longer the match .
It ’s the fire . ’ ”
“ As for Benson , he had had more than twenty - four hours of intense stimulation by his implanted computer .
That stimulation had affected his brain by providing new experiences and new expectations .
A new environment was being incorporated .
Pretty soon , it would be impossible to predict how the brain would react .
Because it was n’t Benson ’s old brain anymore — it was a new brain , the product of new experiences . ”
In light of recent news concerning remarkable ways to image and bloodlessly dissect the human brain , much of Terminal Man seems medically quaint and naïve .
Still , knowledge about the mind is a terrible thing to waste .
As the linked articles below bear out , with every passing day we are learning more about the brain and how to manipulate and stimulate it .
This is all meant to be for the good ; neurologists are not aiming at mind control .
Clearly , however , as Crichton writes above , new experiences create new expectations .
New feedback loops come into existence ; new stimuli bring about new responses .
A penny for your thoughts ?
Toshiba has been touting its Cell - based SpursEngine graphics chip for some time now , but it looks like its finally starting to get a bit more specific about when we can expect to see it in actual products .
According to Register Hardware , Toshiba will begin offering the chip in some of its multimedia - oriented notebooks sometime this year , with TVs and DVD players set to get it by the fall of 2009 .
The chip itself , for those not up to speed , uses its Cell - based technology ( specifically , four of the Cell 's Synergistic Processing Element cores ) to handle some heavy - duty graphics processing , including upscaling standard definition content to high - def levels , something Toshiba has apparently taken to calling " super-resolution . "
Now word on what sort of premium ( if any ) we can expect to pay for such wonders , but Toshiba is apparently betting pretty heavily on the technology as part of its post HD DVD strategy .
A man in New Zealand has been charged with using a hedgehog as a weapon , the New Zealand Herald has reported .
Police said William Singalargh , 27 , had hurled the hedgehog about 5 m ( 16ft ) at a 15 - year - old boy .
" It hit the victim in the leg , causing a large , red welt and several puncture marks , " said Senior Sgt Bruce Jenkins , in the North Island town of Whakatane .
It was unclear whether the hedgehog was still alive when it was thrown , though it was dead when collected as evidence .
The police spokesman said the suspect was arrested " for assault with a weapon , namely the hedgehog . "
Mr Singalargh is due to appear in court on 17 April .
If convicted , he faces up to five years in prison .

Ozone protects us when it sits high in the atmosphere blocking UV rays , but is a health risk when we breathe the stuff in .
So a report showing illegally high ozone levels on some US flights suggests that all aircraft should be fitted with ozone converters .
William Nazaroff of the University of California at Berkeley in the US and colleagues monitored ozone levels on 76 international and domestic flights .
On four domestic flights , ozone levels exceeded federal limits of 100 parts per billion .
Breathing ozone can cause headaches and respiratory illness , and has even been linked to cancer .
Advertisement
Reports of high levels of ozone in flight cabins in the 1960s and 1970s prompted the US Federal Aviation Administration to impose a limit on the amount of ozone airline companies could legally allow in their cabins .
Since the 1980s , however , there have not been any studies carried out to monitor ozone levels in airplanes .
Storm stirring
Nazaroff ’s team found that on average domestic flights had lower levels of ozone than international flights , because the international flight paths often pass through greater ozone concentrations at high latitudes .
The researchers also found that the flights with the highest levels of ozone coincided with large storms , which mix up atmospheric layers .
Ozone is most concentrated in the stratosphere , around 15 kilometres ( 9.3 miles ) above ground .
Storms can bring some of that ozone down to the altitudes at which aeroplanes fly .
They also found that flights full of passengers are likely to have less ozone .
Previous research shows that the gas reacts with skin oils , reducing ambient levels of the gas .
It has been suggested that the by - products of these reactions may themselves pose health risks .
Nazaroff points out that if flights were all equipped with ozone converters , it would eliminate this concern .
The research presents a case for fitting ozone converters on all aircraft .
No domestic flights with converters had ozone levels above 10 parts per billion , and while international flights – which all carry converters – had higher levels , none got anywhere near federal limits .

A studentat the University of Mississippi will leap into the final frontier of the legal systemSaturday when he receives the first - ever space law certificate in the United States .
MichaelDodge of Long Beach , Miss. , earned the special distinction along with his law degreethrough the National Center for Remote Sensing , Air and Space Law at the university ? slaw school .
? Theprofessors and personnel here are the highest quality that can be found anywherein the world , and I have learned from them the necessary skills I will need toeffectively practice space law , ?
Dodge said in a statement .
?
Ole Miss is , simply put , the space law expert , and anyone wishing practice in this fieldshould get their legal education here .?
Any futurespace lawyer might have to deal with issues ranging from the fallout over satelliteshoot - downs to legal disputes between astronauts onboard the International SpaceStation .
The expanding privatization of the space sector may also pose newlegal challenges .
Dodge ' sinterest in space law grew from an early fascination with space explorationthat was based mostly on science and history .
? Once Icame to the law school , I read that there was an attorney here that specializedin space law , ?
Dodge said .
?
After that , I became curious as to why space neededregulation , and how legal regimes could be constructed to govern such anexpanse . "
That led toa meeting with Joanne Gabrynowicz , director of the University of Mississippi 's space law center .
? Studentsin this program have unparalleled opportunities to participate in the Manfred LachsSpace Law Moot Court competition , the Journal of SpaceLaw , center conferences and events , and internships that strengthen theirfuture employment options , ?
Gabrynowicz said .
Theuniversity offers the only dedicated aerospace law curriculum in the nationfrom an American Bar Association - accredited law school , and requires courses onU.S. space and aviation law , international space and aviation law , and remotesensing ; participation in the publication of the Journal of Space Law ; andindependent research .
The National Center for Remote Sensing , Air and SpaceLaw was founding in 1999 .
? We areparticularly proud to be offering these space law certificates for the firsttime , since ours is the only program of its kind in the U.S. and only one oftwo in North America , " said Samuel Davis , law dean at the University of Mississippi .
How I hacked Digg
Two weeks ago I filed a bug report on Digg.com , explaining several XSS vulnerabilities and bugs I found .
Some of these were ( and some still are ! ) very critical .
A day later , I got an automated response to my report :
We ’ve contacted our development team who are investigating the issue , and will fix it as soon as possible .
All well and good I thought , but when a few days ago all vulnerabilities were still there , I decided to exploit one of them .

style= " z - index:999999 ; position : absolute ; top:0 ; left :0 ; font - size : 200 pt ; text - decoration : none ; "
Note the text - decoration : none ; – this allowed me to enter something like as the link description , resulting in an invisible layer floating above all the content .
My Javascript code was executed as soon as someone visits the page .
Perfect !

An Exploit : The Autodigger ™
So , what did I do with this evil exploit at hand ?
Steal user cookies ?
Narr , too mean .
Write a worm ?
Mhh… sounds like fun , but it was n’t worth the three months of community service .
Writing something that automatically digged a story of mine was far more compelling and also a lot easier !
I just had to get the users diggcheck – a unique token stored in the session on Digg ’s servers , to verify that the request comes indeed from within the Digg.com domain .
After that , I needed to send an HTTP POST to actually Digg the story .
Luckily , Digg relies heavily on Javascript , so I already had an Ajax library at hand .
I got the diggcheck token by loading a “ Digg This ” button into an iframe and then posted the request through a library function .
I also could have just submitted the form in the “ Digg This ” iframe , but that would have forwarded the user to the actual story – not very secretive .
My final code looked something like this ( cleaned up for readability – I had to spread this code across three links , because Digg only allowed 255 chars per link ) :
var AjaxCode = ' Ajax .
Request (' + '" / diginfull " , ' + ' {' + ' method : " post " , ' + ' parameters : " id=6830157&row=1&type=s&pagetype=4&digcheck= " ' + '+this.contentWindow.document.forms.f1.digcheck.value , ' + ' onSuccess :( window.opener?window.close:null ) ' + ' } ' + ') ;' ; document . body .
innerHTML += + ' \u003 Ciframe height=0 ' + ' src=\'/tools/diggthis.php?u=http%3A//www.phoboslab.org/log/2008/04/asaph-1-0\'' + ' onload= \ '' +
AjaxCode + '\' \\u003E\\u003C/iframe\\u003E ' ;
My code was working nicely , so now I only needed some users to visit my profile page .
I clicked around and added about everyone as a friend – resulting in lots of hits on my profile page and diggs on my story .
Apologies to everyone I annoyed with this !
In the end , my story had about 180 diggs , yet it did not make it to the front page – Digg had fixed the bug !
One done , some more to go …
Even more XSS
In the hope that Digg would now listen , I sent them a second email .
Only to be answered by an auto responder :
Thanks for getting in touch with us regarding this issue .
We ’re working hard to correct it and apologize for any inconvenience you ’ve experienced .
A third email remained completely unanswered .
So , here ’s a list of the remaining issues I found .
Let ’s hope they wo n’t ignore it again .
Titles of non existing pages are not escaped in the API Wiki
Really stupid behavior – and as it seems , not even Digg ’s fault , as this is a commercial Wiki application .
This demo will render your current Internet Explorer session unusable : " Click at your own Risk !
Here ’s a screenshot .
Quotes are not escaped on the “ Create an Account ” page
To see this bug , go the Digg signup form and insert " style = " border : 80 px solid # f0 f ; as the username .
This only works , when the user is not logged in .
Furthermore , the form only accepts POST data – however there ’s nothing stopping anyone from sending cross domain post requests .
Quotes are not escaped on the “ Search for Friends ” page
This is a huge security hole .
If I know someones username and send him a link , I can basically exploit it the same way as I did with my Autodigger™ .
Here ’s a simple proof of concept ( exchange USERNAME with your actual Digg account name ) :
http://digg.com/users/USERNAME/friends/add/search?needle=%22+style%3D%22position%3Aabsolute%3Bz-index%3A999999%3Btop%3A0%3Bleft%3A0%3Bwidth%3A1500px%3Bheight%3A1500px%3B%22+onmouseover%3D%22alert%28%27exploited%21%27%29%3B
Again , here ’s a screenshot .
Bugs , Bugs , Bugs …
There are even more bugs on Digg .
Nothing that I could exploit , but still annoying stuff .
Their overall decision to use PHPs strip_tags over htmlSpecialChars in just about every user input field is a very poor one .
Firstly because input like “ I really < 3 this story ” is truncated to “ I really ” and secondly , because quotation marks and ampersands are not escaped at all .
This made many of the vulnerabilities listed here possible in the first place .
Then there are input fields which are presumably filtered through stripSlashes twice .
The About Me textfield for instance suffers from this .
Text like “ Yeah \o / ” becomes “ Yeah o / ” .
Newlines (
) are not escaped in any search forms I found on Digg .
This can trigger Javasrcipt errors and is possibly even exploitable .
See here : http://digg.com/search?s=asdf%0Aasdf
I could go on …
Conclusion
Digg is a huge website .
I do n’t blame them for having a few bugs , as it gets harder and harder to stop exploits when new browser technology comes around on a monthly basis .
However , I do blame them for not listening to bug reports and emails .
All this stuff could have been fixed weeks ago .
Do they wait for every vulnerability to be exploited before they even consider fixing them , or did my mails simply get lost somewhere ?
I really do n’t know , but I hope they will fix these issues now .
Update :
Both , Digg and PBWiki , have now fixed all critical bugs .
I was surprised to see how open they discussed this issue .
I expected way more secrecy from them after all my previous mails remained unanswered ( albeit unintended , how I learned ) .
I also had a brief email conversation with Digg ’s Joe Stump .
He explained , that they ’re planning to switch all input sanitization to htmlSpecialChars ( ) soon .
Still , my Digg story about all of this was hindered from reaching the front page even after all critical bugs were fixed .
This is understandable , but of course very unfortunate for me .
RIVERSIDE , Calif . - Physicists at UC Riverside have made an accidental discovery in the lab that has potential to change how information in computers can be transported or stored .
Dependent on the " spin " of electrons , a property electrons possess that makes them behave like tiny magnets , the discovery could help in the development of spin - based semiconductor technology such as ultrahigh - speed computers .
The researchers were experimenting with ferromagnet / semiconductor ( FM / SC ) structures , which are key building blocks for semiconductor spintronic devices ( microelectronic devices that perform logic operations using the spin of electrons ) .
The FM / SC structure is sandwich - like in appearance , with the ferromagnet and semiconductor serving as microscopically thin slices between which lies a thinner still insulator made of a few atomic layers of magnesium oxide ( MgO ) .
The researchers found that by simply altering the thickness of the MgO interface they were able to control which kinds of electrons , identified by spin , traveled from the semiconductor , through the interface , to the ferromagnet .
Study results appear in the June 13 issue of Physical Review Letters .
Experimental results :
The spin of an electron is represented by a vector , pointing up for an Earth - like west - to - east spin ; and down for an east - to - west spin .
In the researchers ' experiment with the FM / SC structures , both spin up and spin down electrons were allowed to travel from the semiconductor to the ferromagnet .
The researchers found that when the structure 's MgO interface is very thin ( less than two atomic layers ) , spin down electrons pass through to the ferromagnet , while spin up electrons are reflected back , leaving only spin up electrons in the semiconductor .
They also found that when the interface is thicker than six atomic layers , both spin up and spin down electrons are reflected back , leaving electrons with zero net spin in the semiconductor .
But the surprising result for the researchers was that at an intermediate thickness , ranging from two to six atomic layers , the selectivity of the interface completely changes .
" We see a dramatic and complete reversal in the spin of electrons that pass through the interface , " said Roland Kawakami , an assistant professor of physics who led the research team .
" This time , spin up electrons pass through while spin down electrons are reflected back to the semiconductor .
In other words , the thickness of the MgO interface determines whether spin up or spin down electrons are allowed to pass through it . "
According to his research team , such a " spin reversal " can be used to control current flow .
Significance of the discovery :
" Electron spins are oriented at random in an ordinary electric circuit , and , therefore , do not affect current flow , " explained Yan Li , the first author of the research paper , who made the discovery .
" But if spin is polarized , that is , aligned in one direction , you can manipulate the flow of current and the transport of information - a feature that would be of great interest to the semiconductor industry .
What is amazing is that only a couple of atomic layers of MgO can completely reverse the spin selection of the interface .
This is unexpected because MgO is not a magnetic material . "
Li , a graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy working toward her doctorate in physics , said the research team will work next on making electronic devices based on the spin reversal .
" This will not only test its feasibility for applications , but also help determine the cause of the spin reversal , which is still unclear , " she said .
Kawakami's lab is one of very few labs in the world that perform both the advanced material synthesis and pulsed laser measurements needed for experiments with FM / SC structures .
" Without the strong interplay between the materials development and optical measurements , the type of discovery we made probably would not have been possible , " Kawakami said .
A new area of research , spintronics already has helped develop disk - drive read heads and non-volatile memory chips .
Researchers believe spintronics also will make " instant - on " computers one day , as well as chips that can store and process data .
###
Kawakami , who also is a member of UCR's Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering , and Li were joined by UCR's Y. Chye , Y.F. Chiang , K. Pi and W. H. Wang ; and UC Santa Barbara's J.M. Stephens , S. Mack and D.D. Awschalom .
Grants from the Office of Naval Research , the National Science Foundation and the Center for Nanoscience Innovation for Defense supported the two - year study .
The University of California , Riverside is a doctoral research university , a living laboratory for groundbreaking exploration of issues critical to Inland Southern California , the state and communities around the world .
Reflecting California 's diverse culture , UCR 's enrollment of about 17,000 is projected to grow to 21,000 students by 2010 .
The campus is planning a medical school and already has reached the heart of the Coachella Valley by way of the UCR Palm Desert Graduate Center .

The Incredible Shrinking Republican Base
Discussions of the current political situation and comparisons between the 2008 election and earlier contests frequently overlook a crucial fact .
As a result of changes in American society , today 's electorate is very different from the electorate of twenty , thirty , or forty years ago .
Three long - term trends have been especially significant in this regard : increasing racial diversity , declining rates of marriage , and changes in religious beliefs .
As a result of these trends , today 's voters are less likely to be white , less likely to be married , and less likely to consider themselves Christians than voters of just a few decades ago .
The combined impact of these trends on the composition of the electorate has been dramatic .
Married white Christians now make up less than half of all voters in the United States and less than one fifth of voters under the age of 30 .
The declining proportion of married white Christians in the electorate has important political implications because in recent years married white Christians have been among the most loyal supporters of the Republican Party .
In American politics today , whether you are a married white Christian is a much stronger predictor of your political preferences than your gender or your class -- the two demographic characteristics that dominate much of the debate on contemporary American politics .
Figure 1 displays the trends in the proportions of whites , married persons , and Christian identifiers in the U.S. electorate over the past half century according to data from the American National Election Studies .
Between the middle of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century , the proportion of whites has fallen by about 15 percentage points , the proportion of married persons has fallen by about 25 percentage points , and the proportion of Christian identifiers has fallen by about 10 percentage points .
Married individuals still make up a large majority of the electorate , whites are still close to 80 percent of the electorate , and Christians are still over 80 percent of the electorate .
However , the combined impact of the changes illustrated in Figure 1 has been enormous .
Married white Christians have gone from close to 80 percent of the electorate in the 1950s to just over 40 percent of the electorate in the first decade of the 21st century .
Moreover , the data displayed in Figure 2 show that the decline in married white Christians has been even more drastic among younger Americans .
The proportion of married white Christians among voters under the age of 30 has plummeted from almost 80 percent in the 1950s to less than 20 percent in the first decade of the 21st century .
These changes in the social composition of the American electorate are politically significant because married white Christians now constitute the core of the Republican electoral coalition .
Not only are married white Christians more likely to support the GOP than other Americans , but , as the data displayed in Figure 3 show , the gap between these two groups has widened from less than 10 percentage points in the 1950s to 25 percentage points in the first decade of the 21st century .
Even though married white Christians have been shrinking as a proportion of the American electorate , the Republican Party has been able to maintain and even slightly increase its share of the electorate since the 1960s by steadily increasing its support among married white Christians .
The data in Figure 3 show that between the 1950s and the first decade of the 21st century , Republican identification among married white Christians increased by more than 20 percentage points , going from about 40 percent to over 60 percent .
However , the ability of the GOP to continue to offset the diminishing size of its married white Christian base by making further gains among this group is questionable .
Republican gains among married white Christians have occurred almost entirely among self - identified conservatives .
Between the 1970s and the first decade of the 21st century , Republican identification among conservative married white Christians increased by 26 points , going from 64 percent to 90 percent , according to NES data .
During the same time period , Republican identification among moderate married white Christians increased by only five points , going from 38 percent to 43 percent and Republican identification among liberal married white Christians actually declined by 10 points , falling from 23 percent to 13 percent .
These results suggest that the potential for additional Republican gains among married white Christians may be limited .
Conservative married white Christians already overwhelmingly identify with the GOP and the party has had little success in increasing its support among moderate - to - liberal married white Christians .
The danger posed to the Republican Party by the declining size of its married white Christian base was clearly illustrated by the results of the 2006 midterm election .
According to the 2006 national exit poll , married white Christians made up just under half of the midterm electorate and they voted for Republican House candidates over Democratic House candidates by a decisive 62 to 38 percent margin .
However , voters who were not married white Christians made up just over half of the electorate and they voted for Democratic House candidates over Republican House candidates by an even more decisive 68 to 32 percent margin .
The result was a big win for the Democrats in the midterm election .
In addition to the large gains made by Democrats in the House and Senate elections , another striking feature of the 2006 results was the presence of a fairly large generation gap within the electorate .
As the data displayed in Table 1 show , voters under the age of 30 were considerably more likely to identify with the Democratic Party and vote for Democratic candidates than older voters .
While the youth vote was not solely responsible for the Democratic victory in 2006 , the party 's 22 point advantage among voters under the age of 30 clearly contributed to the magnitude of that victory .
An important question about the generation gap in the 2006 election is whether it was based mainly on short - term factors such as discontent with the war in Iraq , or whether it reflected long - term trends in the demographic make - up of the American electorate .
We have already seen that the decline in the proportion of married white Christians since the 1950s has been much more dramatic among younger voters than among older voters and the results of this long - term trend were clearly reflected in the social characteristics of the 2006 electorate .
According to the national exit poll data , only 17 percent of voters under the age of 30 were married white Christians compared with just over half of older voters .
In order to determine whether long - term demographic changes were responsible for the generation gap in voting behavior , I compared the preferences of younger and older voters in the 2006 House elections while controlling for their demographic characteristics .
The results displayed in Table 2 show that married white Christians under the age of 30 were just as likely to vote for a Republican House candidate as married white Christians over the age of 30 .
Similarly , voters over the age of 30 who were not married white Christians were just as likely to vote for a Democratic House candidate as voters under the age of 30 who were not married white Christians .
Thus , the current generation gap in voting behavior appears to be completely explained by the difference between the proportions of married white Christians in these two groups .
The reason that voters under the age of 30 are now significantly more Democratic than older voters is that they are much less likely to be married , white , and Christian .
In addition to age , two other demographic characteristics that have received a great deal of attention in commentary on the 2008 election are gender and class .
In recent weeks there has been endless speculation about the relative abilities of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to appeal to two groups whose support is widely considered to be critical to Democratic chances in November : lower income whites and white women .
The assumption here is that class and gender play important roles in shaping voter preferences in the contemporary electorate .
However , the evidence from the 2006 national exit poll shows that whether someone was a married white Christian was a much stronger predictor of his or her political preferences than either gender or class .
According to the evidence displayed in Table 3 , after controlling for whether or not a voter was a married white Christian , neither gender nor income had much influence on voters ' preferences .
Women who were married white Christians voted overwhelmingly for Republican candidates and men who were not married white Christians voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates .
Similarly , lower income individuals who were married white Christians voted overwhelmingly for Republican candidates and upper income individuals who were not married white Christians voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates .
The decline in the proportion of married white Christians in the American electorate has been going on for a long time .
Moreover , the large generational difference in the prevalence of married white Christians in the contemporary electorate suggests that this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future .
What can not be predicted as confidently is how party leaders will respond to this trend .
Right now , Democrats appear likely to benefit from a continued decline in the proportion of married white Christians in the electorate because this group has strongly supported Republican candidates in recent elections while voters who are not married white Christians have strongly supported Democratic candidates .
Since the potential for additional Republican gains among married white Christians appears to be limited , Republican leaders will need to find ways to reduce the Democratic advantage among voters who are not married white Christians in order to maintain the party 's competitive position .
However , given the generally liberal views of this group , this will not be easy .
In 2006 , according to data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study , 57 percent of these voters supported a woman 's right to choose an abortion under any circumstances , 66 percent opposed a constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage , and 71 percent favored a single - payer health care system .
Any attempt by Republican leaders to significantly increase their party 's support among voters who are not married white Christians would therefore require changes in some of the party 's longstanding policy commitments -- changes that would clearly upset a large segment of the current Republican base .

If you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you .
Roland Martin says that whether candidates wear a flag lapel pin should n't be a political issue .
( CNN ) --
When is the last time you watched a mindless movie that had no redeeming value for you intellectually , but all it did was make you laugh ?
That perfectly describes the raging debate among voters and the rabid television and radio talk show hosts who love to yell and scream from the top of their lungs , " I 'm an American , and by golly , you better show as much appreciation for this country as I do ! "
But once you finish listening to these high - minded bloviators -- and yes , that includes the voters who have bought into this nonsensical issue -- ask yourself :
Does it really have anything to do with anything ?
I 've watched this debate reach the levels of absurdity this year because journalists and commentators have raised the question to Sen.
Barack Obama , " Why do n't you wear a flag lapel pin ? "
I really got a kick out of that one during the ABC debate last month because not one person on stage -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Obama , along with moderators Charlie Gibson and George Stephanopoulos -- bothered to accessorize their attire with a flag lapel pin .
Sen .
John McCain has been traveling the globe as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , and this former Navy pilot often does n't wear a flag lapel pin .
It has become sort of like bird watching as I 've surveyed elected officials on the local and national levels and looked them over like a hen - pecked mother or a foaming - at - the - mouth military drill sergeant , studying their attire and deeming them insufficiently American because of their lack of decency and respect by refusing to adorn themselves appropriately with a lapel pin .
So , after listening to radio callers and the folks that e-mail various TV shows , maybe we ought to expand this need to express our Americanism even further .
Should n't we insist that our politicians all begin to sport red , white and blue socks in order to feel good knowing that they are walking as Americans ?
How about asking officeholders to sport the American colors as undergarments to show that their undying love for the country is so important , they want the flag pressed against their skin ?

There have been times when the candidates -- especially McCain , who has beaten back skin cancer -- have worn hats on the campaign trail .
I want to know , datgummit , why the people running for the highest office in the land did n't cover their head with an American flag baseball cap to express to the nation their love and affection for the U.S. of A .
Since it is clear that our nation is paralyzed and so not able to close our borders , feed the homeless , develop businesses in the inner cities and save people from having their homes taken by foreclosure due to ruthless mortgage companies , all because some folks do n't wear a flag lapel pin , we need to lead a national movement to demand that Congress and the states make requiring officeholders to wear a flag lapel pin the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
See , if it is so important , then take it all the way .
Do n't make it optional .
Do n't leave it up to someone to choose to wear a flag lapel pin .
Let 's really show those politicians that nothing is more important to us than seeing them with the U.S. flag on our chest .
That 's what zealots do .
They take something so simple , so personal , so voluntary , and absolutely lose their mind , trying to force someone else to do as them , and everyone else be damned .
Folks , the first year I ever cast a ballot for political office was in 1988 .
And in the last 20 years , whether it was mayoral , school board , city council , or a statewide , congressional or presidential campaign , the thought of what was on a politician 's lapel never entered into the equation as to whether they are worthy of office .
Those who will criticize me will say , " Well , Roland , if it 's no big deal , then why not wear one ? "
And the reply is the same : " If it 's no big deal , then why do you make it a big deal ? "
Let me tell you something :
When I'm on the golf course and I slip my wedding ring into my golf bag , the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin is still my wife .
When we shoot hoops and I remove my Texas A&M University ring from my right hand , I still love my school .
The fact that I can no longer wear my 1987 class ring from Houston 's Jack Yates High School does n't mean I do n't cherish the crimson and gold .
And I may not be able to fit into the shirt I pledged in , but I will be a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. until the day I die .
I am an unapologetic Christian , but you wo n't see a cross dangling from my neck or a James Avery charm bracelet on my wrist .
Why ?
Because my love of Jesus Christ is in my heart .
This debate is useless , tiresome and distracting .
Why ?
Because if there are members of Congress who wear a flag lapel pin but refuse to shore up our borders , do n't do enough to stop the flow of drugs into our neighborhoods , or do n't help to eradicate the gaps between the haves and have nots , then are they truly fighting for the concerns of Americans , or playing on the emotions of people by what 's on their lapel ?
We 're better than that .
We 're smarter than that .
It 's time that we make decisions based on substance , which is what we say we actually care about .
But maybe we 're just lying to ourselves about that , too .

China says several plots have already been foiled
There is a " real possibility " that the Beijing Olympics will be attacked by terrorists , the head of global police body Interpol has warned .
Speaking in Beijing , Ronald Noble said the Games could give " easy cover " to groups such as al - Qaeda .
He also warned that protesters who have disrupted the Olympic torch relay might also target this summer 's Games .
China claims to have foiled several plots to attack the Olympics by Muslim separatists from Xinjiang province .
Mr Noble told a security conference in the Chinese capital : " Based on reports of thwarted plots in the Chinese media , including an attempt to bring down an airliner headed to Beijing , it seems clear that the threat has increased . "
Global platform
He said the unrest in Tibet , and the protests that have followed , had given rise to " additional complications " for the organisers of the Games .
" When thwarted attacks are coupled with the recent violent protests viewed by us all worldwide , prudence requires us to recognise the real possibility that groups and individuals could carry on their protests at the actual Games , " he said .
" These activities could range from disruptive behaviour , like blocking major transportation routes or infrastructure or interfering with competitions , to more violent acts like assaulting Olympic officials or athletes or destroying property . "
He also said security services must be prepared " for the possibility that al - Qaeda or some other terrorist group will attempt to launch a deadly terrorist attack at these Olympics " .
He said the influx of foreigners and the world 's media could provide " easy cover " for terrorists and ensure any attack would get global coverage .
Mr Noble added that an Interpol team would be training Chinese officers in crisis management and major event operations before the Games .

What are these ?
Squatting in the cold drizzle Tuesday morning , Dan Suarez fingered a little shoot of a plant that has managed , somehow , to rise for a second season from a tiny green patch of his parents ’ backyard in Park Slope , Brooklyn .
By the end of the summer , he declared , he will be drinking the flower cone of that plant .
“ The king of herbs , ” he said .
“ The hop . ”
Dan Suarez grows hops in the backyard and brews beer in the basement .
He experiments with beer - infused ice cream  malt walnut instead of maple walnut , for instance .
When he had a job in one of the city ’s premier cheese stores , he spent many hours musing on which brew would go best with the goat cheese ( white beers , he says ) or blue cheese ( sweet stout , “ a great mix of flavors , the salt and sweet like honey - roasted peanuts ” ) .
“ Beer is pretty much food , ” he said .
Now , Mr. Suarez , 23 , is in the running for one of the world ’s most exotic summer internships : assistant to the chief beer officer for a major hotel chain .
In a piece called " Hip - hop is no longer cooler than me , " Salon ’s Paul Kix argues that the once - forward - thinking genre has lost its way in a maze of dance steps and oversimplified production :
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
We are witnessing nothing less than the Macarena - zation of a genre .
Because of Soulja Boy ’s success , industry execs now demand that newartists have dances at the ready to accompany their albums .
The danceshelp drive up sales , that fast - disappearing commodity .
And so theairwaves and Interwebs are still filthy with song - and - dance numbers ,
like Pop It Off Boyz’ " Crank Dat Batman " and last year ’s " Chicken Noodle Soup " song , which accomplishes the impossible by being dumber than it sounds but remains great fun for 50 - year - olds in middle management
… Look , I ’m not confused or annoyed by hip - hop , like older rock fans areby , say , Fall Out Boy .
More than anything I ’m embarrassed .
Since whendid young black men , heretofore the arbiters of pop culture , become solame ?
And since when did the citizens of that culture not know thedifference ?
A friend of mine who has been the editor of at least one major musicmagazine once told me hip - hop was the only form of music he still cared about , because nothing else was making any kind of significant forward progress .
However , he agreed with Kix that it ’s running out of steam .
I can’t agree with anyone who says musical progress is over , because that ’s as ludicrous as the claim made in the early part of last century that the US Patent Office should be closed because everything had been discovered .
As far as popular music goes , hip - hop has offered a rare combination of innovation and popularity lacking in other genres , but …
What do you think ?

Middle school issues ban on intentional flatulence
Posted on by null and void
CAMDEN ( Feb 1 ) : The Merriam Webster Dictionary definition for flatulence is brief : " flatus expelled through the anus . "
And while it 's a natural bodily function , it seems some Camden - Rockport Middle School eighth - grade boys are taking it to new heights and making a game of seeing who can expel the loudest and grossest flatus .
Advertisement
According to this week 's Fire Cracker school newsletter though , the joke 's on the boys as the penalty for " intentional farting " is now a detention .
" Strange , but true , thanks to a bunch of 8th grade boys , intentional farting has been banned from CRMS , " the newsletter said .
" It started out as a funny joke and eventually turned into a game .
This is the first rule at CRMS that prevents the use of natural bodily functions .
The penalty for intentional farting is a detention , so keep it to yourself ! "
According to a group of seventh - grade students milling around downtown following Friday 's storm - related early release , the eighth - graders ' escapades are well known in the school .
" They would do it in science class and other places , " said Jordan Tyler .
" It 's a natural occurrence and we all do it 16 times a day . "
When questioned where he learned that information , Tyler and the other students all said it was true , though they could n't remember where they heard it .
One of the other students , Kyle Ruger , said the act by the boys was funny , but he had mixed feelings about whether it was appropriate .
Jordan Knowlton minced no words when she expressed how she felt , saying , " It 's gross . "
Remy LeVine said he was in the class when CRMS science teacher Brad LaRoche talked to all the eighth - grade boys about the issue , as well as the consequences .
Attempts to reach CRMS Principal Maria Libby Friday afternoon were unsuccessful and school Superintendent Patricia Hopkins said she had not heard anything about the issue or the alleged suspected result , though she did get a good chuckle out of the news .

Now you too can tell a machine what you want and watch as it appears before your eyes .
The technology goes by many names — 3 - D printer ; rapid prototyper ; fabber — but the concept is the same :
Feed a device with blueprints for a solid object of your choosing , then let the machine build it for you from plastic or other simple materials .
Industrial designers have had access for years to fabbers that use powerful lasers to fuse plastic powder — great for mocking up jet turbines or architectural plans — but with a price tag of tens of thousands of dollars , 3 - D printing has been out of reach for most of us .
Now all that has started to change , as do - it - yourself types and imaginative engineers have found ways to bring the technology to the people .
Here are five ways that you can harness the power of fabbing .

A new report from Perth 's Telethon Institute for Child Health Research has found a strong link between childhood ear infections and exposure to tobacco smoke .
The families of 100 Aboriginal children and 180 non-Aboriginal children participated in the Kalgoorlie Otitis Media Research Project , allowing the collection of social , demographic , environmental and biological data to investigate the causes of otitis media ( middle ear infections ) .
The children had regular ear examinations from birth until 2 years of age .
Chief Investigator Dr Deborah Lehmann , who heads the Institute 's infectious diseases research , said ear infections were the most common reason that young children see a doctor and can cause life - long problems .
" Up to 20 per cent of children have more than three ear infections between 1 and 2 years of age .
If their hearing is damaged , it can seriously affect their educational outcomes and social circumstances in adulthood , " Dr Lehmann said .
" In Aboriginal children , these ear infections typically start at a younger age , are much more common and more likely to result in hearing loss . "
Key findings from the project include :
Otitis media was diagnosed at least once in 74 % of Aboriginal children and 45 % of non-Aboriginal children .
64 % of Aboriginal children and 40 % of non-Aboriginal children were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke .
If we eliminated exposure to tobacco smoke we estimate that we could reduce ear infections by 27 % in Aboriginal children and 16 % in non-Aboriginal children
The impact of passive smoking in the home on ear infections was reduced if the children also attended day care .
Dr Lehmann said there is evidence that passive smoking can increase the adherence of bacteria in the respiratory passages and depress the immune system .
" These results highlight the importance of reducing children 's exposure to passive smoking , and this is particularly important for Aboriginal people where the rates of both smoking and otitis media are high , " she said .
" Few Aboriginal children have access to formal childcare despite studies showing that it is an effective way to improve early development and educational outcomes for disadvantaged children .
The fact that it could also reduce the burden of ear infections in Aboriginal children adds weight to calls for appropriate childcare facilities to be provided . "
The results are published in the latest edition of the Medical Journal of Australia .
Do you need to stock up the bunker ?
By Brendan O'Neill
Britain is not without the threat of natural disasters
In the 1950s and 1960s , bunkers were a feature of many American suburban homes , populated by families fearful of the prospect of nuclear war .
That threat has subsided , but now many reasonable people are stocking up on essential supplies in preparation for a new cataclysm .
When you hear the word " survivalist " , what image comes to mind ?
Perhaps you think of a gun-toting loner in Mid-West America , who lives in a shack surrounded by tinned food and emergency water supplies .
Or maybe you think of end - of - the - world religionists retreating to a fortified camp with enough food and drink to last them until Judgement Day .
But today there is a new breed of survivalist  and they 're well - heeled , well - educated and more likely to wear an immaculately pressed suit than a camouflage flak jacket .
Civilisation breakdown Barton M
Biggs is about as far as you can get from the old John Rambo - style survivalist .
Forget long , unkempt hair and a sweat - stained vest .
Mr Biggs is a former chief global strategist for Morgan Stanley , who now runs the hedge fund Traxis Partners in New York .
Yet in his latest book , Wealth , War and Wisdom , he suggests that all right - minded people should " assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilised infrastructure " .
Many bunkers were decommissioned after the Cold War " The four horsemen of the apocalypse ride out every two generations , and they come in different disguises , " he says .
" We are due to see the horsemen again some time in the next 10 to 20 years  and the prudent person with wealth should take out an insurance policy against them . "
The four horsemen in this instance could be any one of a plethora of threats .
It 's not been in the news for a while but there are scientists who believe that bird flu could shift so it could pass from human to human , resulting in a global pandemic that could kill 50 million people .
But there are threats that seem more immediate .
The price of food is rising dramatically and oil is at record prices .
Even brief periods of crisis can have severe consequences .
Blackout looting Mr Biggs cites the massive power outages that struck north - eastern and mid-western America and parts of Canada in 2003  also known as The Northeastern Blackout  when for a few hours an estimated 50 million people were without electricity .
The outage led to massive problems with water supply as pumps were starved of electrical power .
Many forms of transportation came to a standstill - electricity - driven trams and trains stopped working , and small airports had to shut down because they could no longer carry out effective passenger screening .
Any kind of bunker is going to cost a fair bit of money
The outage is estimated to have caused financial losses of $ 6bn .
Looting episodes were reported in Ottawa , Ontario and Brooklyn .
" That was a fairly brief blackout , " says Mr Biggs .
" Imagine if the next outage lasted for four or five days ... there would be a mass exodus from cities . "
The impact of a bird flu pandemic would be even worse , he says .
It would put a " huge strain " on national health systems and leave a gaping hole in the economy as great numbers of people became too sick to work .
Then of course there are natural disasters , something that the US is more used to than the UK , which is largely immune from the more serious earthquakes and hurricanes .
Oil shortage
And yet last year 's floods in Gloucestershire left 140,000 homes without running water for nearly two weeks .
A major global economic crisis or a dramatic oil shortage are also on Biggs 's mind .
If you want to make it through the breakdown , he says , you should build a " safe haven " which is " self - sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food " .
A wide variety of tinned food is recommended Well - off people are advised by Biggs to invest 5 % of their income into creating a safe haven , which should be " well - stocked with seed , fertiliser , canned food , medicine , clothes , etc " .
He labels this plan " sensible " rather than " survivalist " .
In a world in which people and systems are increasingly " interconnected " , the potential for infrastructure to collapse is great , he says .
Political disturbances in Kenya , drought in Australia or crop disease in South America can quickly affect food prices in the UK .
And globally , everything from modern mass agriculture to transport and industry is dependent on the availability of oil .
" I 'm just suggesting , " says Mr Biggs , " that if you can afford it you should invest in a bolthole .
A farm , perhaps , where you could live for a month and survive . "
" I am talking Swiss Family Robinson , " he says , referring to the famous 1812 novel about a Swiss family that survives after being shipwrecked in the East Indies .
" You should have food , water , medicine , clothes .
And possibly AK47s to fire over the heads of any guys , depending on how bad things become . "
New survivalists do not look like Rambo
The safe haven should be set up so that you can live it in comfortably for one month , he says .
" Given the kind of crises I am talking about , a month should be enough for people and systems to recover . "
Biggs is not alone .
New self - help books with titles such as Dare to Prepare ! and When All Hell Breaks Loose advise readers on how to survive system breakdowns .
Alex Steffen , a journalist and editor based in Seattle , is one of those " daring to prepare " for a coming " tiny apocalypse " .
" The systems we rely on are brittle and facing strain , " he says .
" Here in Seattle we are vulnerable to earthquakes and I also live near a big volcano .
Climate change is causing more extreme weather events .
There could be a global bird flu outbreak or some other pandemic . "
For these reasons , Steffen and his girlfriend have stocked six weeks ' worth of food in their basement and have invested in a water - purifying kit .
" We are taking precautions , " he says , referring to himself as an " urban liberal survivalist " .
Peak everything Lloyd Alter , a Toronto - based sustainable architect and writer for the green website Treehugger.com , has a " little cabin in the woods " where he can retreat if need be .
He believes the world could be rattled by a variety of crises .
" There is the problem of peak oil , peak gas , peak food , peak corn , peak everything , " he says .
In some green discussion circles , those concerned about " peak " problems  that is , the potential for the production of things such as oil and food to peak and then to start declining  are now referred to as " Peakniks " .
What would happen if bottled water stockpiles ran out ?
But there are plenty of experts who are dismissive of the Peakniks , particularly the fear that peak oil has already been reached .
They point out that new oil reserves are being discovered frequently .
For example , at the end of last year , the Brazilian government announced the existence of a brand new offshore field that could provide eight billion barrels of oil .
Frank Furedi , the British - based author of The Culture of Fear , says people should calm down .
For all the talk of a global bird flu pandemic , in the past five years there have been 200 human deaths from bird flu .
In the same period more than six million people have died from diarrhoeal diseases and more than five million in road accidents  these would seem to be more pressing , practical problems to solve .
" What 's interesting about the ' new survivalism ' is that its focus is everything , " says Prof Furedi .
" Unlike previous alarmist responses to a crisis which focused on one main threat  for example , nuclear war  today 's survivalism is driven by an unbounded imagination of anxiety . "
" The new survivalism can also be seen as a highly ritualised affectation , " says Prof Furedi .
" Through self - imposed restraint and expressions of concern for the future of humanity , the individual sends out signals about his own responsible behaviour .
" The affectation of survivalism is one of the most interesting features of our ' culture of fear ' today . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
How pointless .
The starving , thirsty masses will come and find Biggs and the other bunker dwellers , and after all their ammunition is exhausted , will flush them out steal all the food .
There is no hiding place in little Britain .
Better to work now on the prevention before it happens .
Ben , London
After the panic and stupidity of some people here after the flooding , fighting over food in shops , hoarding water ?
That was a real wake up call for me .
Not overdoing it , but have a few tins put by now ...
Sandra , Gloucester Humans have had a macabre fascination with the breakdown in order for a very long time .
St John of Patmos encapsulated all this in Revelations thousands of years ago .
In our lifetime , the great dream of apocalypse was centred around the Cold War .
The last few years has seen compelling drama centred around global annihilation by meteors , the greenhouse effect , floods , the much - mooted " Millenium Bug " , viral plagues , and so on .
Each is essentially the same fantasy : what happens when ( to quote the book ) All Hell Breaks Loose , and how we 'd regroup as a species .
The fact is that , even in times of world war , the rudimentary fabric of societies ( no matter how politically wrong these may be ) have not broken down .
My suggestion is not to build bunkers , but to build relationships and find effective ways to minimise economic and sociological risk on a national and international scale .
Mr Biggs should , in my opinion , spend his money in promoting effective sociological policy , rather than stockpiling beans and assault rifles .
J Mann , London Being that we live on the Gulf Coast of the US , my wife and I are very well prepared for hurricanes etc .
In the past , I 've dealt with having the roof from my house torn off by a tornado and have gone without electricity for weeks in the middle of summer .
This has translated into being very well prepared as an adult and I suggest that everybody have some supplies and a plan .
I do feel sorry for those of you whose government has denied your right to self defence .
It will be difficult when only the criminals have weapons .
Mike L. , Houston , TX
The comment about the 2003 power outages in Canada and the US causing havoc is absurd .
I lived in Toronto during the blackout and nowhere was there any sense of panic at all .
My memories of the blackout were candle - lit pubs on the street where throngs enjoyed lukewarm beer , where ice cream vendors gave away ice cream for free , and where people took time out to enjoy the unique experience .
Panic ?
Hardly .
Mike , London , England I think it 's important to say to anyone who a ) is n't a hedge fund manager and b ) does n't have loads of cash to put into creating a " safe " haven that having lots of " stuff " in an emergency means also being prey to any less well off , hungry people that do n't have it .
But a basic skill like first aid or being able to grow vegetables etc can't be taken off you , and if it 's a long term thing like an economic collapse or war , it 's a much better investment , and probably a pleasant hobby in the meantime .
Alejandro , Bristol , UK Another example of the rich taking the " I 'm alright Jack " attitude .
Instead of using their wealth and influence to prevent world problems , they just want to stick their heads ( and the rest of their bodies ) in the sand ( or in this case nuclear - proof self - contained survival pods ) while the poorer people of society suffer the consequences brought about by the greed of the rich .
PS , Newcastle , England Its irresponsible to play down the the potential effects of a global bird flu pandemic .
The 1918 pandemic killed in the region of 20 to 100 million people .
And a repeat is considered by many to be overdue .
Ian Worthington , Southampton
As the Trotters pointed out in Only Fools and Horses , a retreat is only as good as your ability to make it there .
Unless you spend your entire existence only a few yards from your bolt hole , chances are ( a ) you wo n't be able to make it there in time due to the masses also trying to escape and ( b ) if you do get there in time , you 'll probably find someone else has already beaten you to it and barricaded themselves inside .
TS , Bromley , England " Given the kind of crises I am talking about , a month should be enough for people and systems to recover . "
How exactly will they recover if we are shut up in bolt - holes and eating cold beans in the middle of nowhere ?
Our society has been created by people mucking in , getting their hands dirty and struggling against adversity .
If we all sat in a bunker and waited for things to blow over , nothing would ever get done .

What are these ?
Above is another outstanding video just posted by local pro-immigrant activist Dennis Gilman .
The occasion : a Joe Arpaio booksigning at the Barnes and Noble in Goodyear this past Saturday , May 31 , 2008 .
As the video mentions , that date came close to making it almost 12 years to the day that Scott Norberg suffocated to death in one of Sheriff Joe 's infamous , Amnesty International - denounced restraint chairs .
With the help of tort titan Mike Manning , the Norberg family sued the Sheriff , and won an $ 8.25 million settlement against Arpaio .
As my colleague Sarah Fenske wrote in her story Money Shot ,
" [ Norberg ] was in Arpaio 's jail just 15 hours before he was handcuffed by guards , kicked , stomped on , and then strapped into a restraint chair .
There , guards held a towel over his head , literally suffocating him .
Medical records later revealed that he had been shot with a stun gun at least 14 times and beaten so badly that his larynx cracked . "
These deadly restraint chairs were finally abandoned by the county in 2006 , in large part because of such lawsuits .
When the local activist in the video approaches Joe and asks him to sign his book , he sneakily starts off by asking Joe to make it out to " Scott . "
The activist waits till Joe 's scribbling , then lets fly the name , " Norberg . "
The expression on Joe 's face is priceless , a momentary mix of pants - shitting - fear and deer - in - the - high beams shock .
The guy follows up with a question about Honduras , then he 's quickly ushered out by Arpaio 's bodyguards .
I 'm just sorry I did n't get to see it in person .
I arrived a few moments later , and ended up sitting next to Joe for about an hour or so , lobbing Qs at him .
For a full report on what happened , the other person who got led away , and the protest on the street outside the bookstore , check this week 's Bird column , which should be up Wednesday night .
I should also mention , for the record , that though Gilman put the video together , and added the ominous Tibetan chanting by the Dalai Lama , there was a different activist involved in actually shooting the video and confronting Arpaio .
Joe 's camp is notoriously paranoid , and were especially so on this day .
But this was a peaceful , lawful protest .
The activist even bought the book , for crying out loud .
You can watch more of Dennis Gilman 's videos , here .
Keep making them , Dennis .
Each one helps peel back the scab on this sucker , and shows him for who he really is ...
Daniel Dennett's Dangerous Idea
Law Professor
University of California , Berkeley
This review of Darwin's Dangerous Idea , by Daniel Dennett , was published in The New Criterion ( October , 1995 )
Daniel Dennett 's fertile imagination is captivated by the very dangerous idea that the neo-Darwinian theory of biological evolution should become the basis for what amounts to an established state religion of scientific materialism .
Dennett takes the scientific part of his thesis from the inner circle of contemporary Darwinian theorists : William Hamilton , John Maynard Smith , George C. Williams , and the brilliant popularizer Richard Dawkins .
When Dennett describes the big idea emanating from this circle as dangerous , he does not mean that it is dangerous only to religious fundamentalists .
The persons whom he accuses of flinching when faced with the full implications of Darwinism are scientists and philosophers of the highest standing : Noam Chomsky , Roger Penrose , Jerry Fodor , John Searle , and especially Stephen Jay Gould .
Each one of these very secular thinkers supposedly tries , as the simple religious folk do , to limit the all - embracing logic of Darwinism .
Dennett describes Darwinism as a " universal acid ; it eats through just about every traditional concept and leaves in its wake a revolutionized world - view . "
One thinker after another has tried unsuccessfully to find some way to contain this universal acid , to protect something from its corrosive power .
Why ?
First let 's see what the idea is .
Dennett begins the account with John Locke 's late seventeenth - century Essay Concerning Human Understanding , where Locke answers the question , " Which came first , mind or matter ? "
Locke 's answer was that mind had to come first , because " it is impossible to conceive that ever bare incogitative matter should produce a thinking intelligent Being . "
David Hume mounted some powerful skeptical arguments against this mind - first principle , but in the end he could n't come up with a solid alternative .
Darwin did not set out to overturn the mind - first picture of reality , but to do something much more modest : to explain the origin of biological species , and the wonderful adaptations that enable those species to survive and reproduce in diverse ways .
The answer Darwin came up with was that these adaptations , which had seemed to be intelligently designed , are actually products of a mindless process called natural selection .
Dennett says that what Darwin offered the world , in philosophical terms , was " a scheme for creating Design out of Chaos without the aid of Mind . "
When the Darwinian outlook became accepted throughout the scientific world , the stage was set for a much broader philosophical revolution .
Dennett explains that
Darwin's idea had been born as an answer to questions in biology , but it threatened to leak out , offering answers -- welcome or not -- to questions in cosmology ( going in one direction ) and psychology ( going in the other direction ) .
If [ the cause of design in biology ] could be a mindless , algorithmic process of evolution , why could n't that whole process itself be the product of evolution , and so forth all the way down ?
And if mindless evolution could account for the breathtakingly clever artifacts of the biosphere , how could the products of our own " real " minds be exempt from an evolutionary explanation ?
Darwin's idea thus also threatened to spread all the way up , dissolving the illusion of our own authorship , our own divine spark of creativity and understanding .
The metaphysical reversal was so complete that it soon became as unthinkable within science to credit any biological feature to a designer as it had previously been unthinkable to do without the designer .
Whenever seemingly insuperable problems were encountered -- the genetic mechanism , the human mind , the ultimate origin of life -- biologists were confident that a solution of the Darwinian kind would be found .
To be sure , the cause of materialist reductionism was sometimes set back by " greedy reductionists " like the behaviorist B.F. Skinner , who tried to explain human behavior as a direct consequence of material forces .
The catchy metaphor Dennett employs to describe the difference between the greedy and good kinds of reductionism is " cranes , not skyhooks . "
The origin of ( say ) the human mind must be attributed to some process firmly anchored on the solid ground of materialism and natural selection ( a crane ) , and not to a mystery or miracle ( skyhook ) , but this does not mean that human behavior or mental activity can be understood directly on the basis of material concepts like stimulus and response or natural selection .
Although many aspects of evolutionary theory remain controversial , Dennett asserts confidently that the overall success of Darwinism - in - principle has been so smashing that the basic program -- all the way up and all the way down -- is established beyond question .
Any yet the resistance continues .
Some of it comes from religious people , who want to preserve some role for a creator .
Dennett just brushes aside the outright creationists , but takes more pains to refute those who would say that God is the author of the laws of nature , including that marvelous evolutionary process that does all the designing .
The Darwinian alternative to a Lawgiver at the beginning of the universe is to postpone the beginning indefinitely by hypothesizing something like an eternal system of evolution at the level of universes .
For example , the physicist Lee Smolin has proposed that black holes are in effect the birthplaces of offspring universes , in which the fundamental physical constants would differ slightly from those in the parent universe .
Since those universes that happened to have the most black holes would leave the most " offspring , " the basic Darwinian concepts of mutation and differential reproduction could be extended to cosmology .
Dennett contends that whether this or any other model is testable , at least cosmic Darwinism relies on the same kind of thinking that has been successful in scientific fields like biology where testing is possible , and that is enough to make it preferable to an alternative that brings in a skyhook .
He does not attempt to explain the origin of the cosmic evolutionary process .
It 's just mutating universes all the way down .
Much of the resistance to Darwinism " all the way up " comes from scientists and philosophers who deny the capacity of natural selection to produce specifically human mental qualities like the capacity for language .
Foremost among these is Noam Chomsky , founder of modern linguistics , who describes a complex language program seemingly " hard - wired " into the human brain , which has no real analogy in the animal world and for which there is no very plausible story of step - by - step evolution through adaptive intermediate forms .
Chomsky readily accepts evolutionary naturalism in principle , but ( supported by Stephen Jay Gould ) he regards Darwinian selection as no more than a place holder for a true explanation of the human language capacity which has not yet been found .
To true - believing Darwinists like Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett , all such objections are fundamentally misconceived .
The more intricately " designed " a feature appears to be , the more certain it is to have been constructed by natural selection -- because there is no alternative way of producing design without resorting to impossible skyhooks .
Even in the toughest cases , where plausible Darwinian hypotheses are hard to imagine and impossible to confirm , a Darwinian solution simply has to be out there waiting to be found .
The alternative to natural selection is either God or chance .
The former is outside of science , and also apparently outside the contemplation of Gould or Chomsky ; the latter is no solution at all .
Once you understand the dimensions of the problem , and the philosophical constraints within which it must be solved , Darwinism is practically true by definition -- regardless of the evidence .
I call this a very interesting situation .
Within science the Darwinian viewpoint clearly occupies the high ground , because nobody has come up with an alternative for explaining Design that does not invoke an unacceptable pre-existing Mind .
( Dennett easily refutes such hype - induced notions as that a physics of self - organizing systems from the Santa Fe Institute is in the process of replacing Darwinism . )
But the rulers of this impregnable citadel are worried because not everybody believes that their citadel is impregnable .
They are troubled not only by polls showing that the American public still overwhelmingly favors some version of supernatural creation , but also by the tendency of prominent scientists to accept Darwinism - in - principle , but to dispute the applicability of the theory to specific problems , usually the problems about which they are best qualified to speak .
Dennett thinks that the dissenters either fail to understandthe logic of Darwinism or shrink from embracing its full metaphysical implications .
I prefer another explanation : Darwinism is a lot stronger as philosophy than it is as empirical science .
If you are n't willing to challenge the underlying premise of scientific materialism , you are stuck with Darwinism - in - principle as a creation story until you find something better , and it does n't seem that there is anything better .
Once you get past the uncontroversial examples of microevolution , however , such as finch beak variations , peppered moth coloring , and selective breeding , all certainty dissolves in speculation and controversy .
Nobody really knows how life originated , where the animal phyla came from , or how natural selection could have produced the qualities of the human mind .
Ingenious hypothetical scenarios for the evolution of complex adaptations are presented to the public virtually as fact , but skeptics within science derisively call them " just - so " stories , because they can neither be tested experimentally nor supported by fossil histories .
Many scientists who swear fealty to Darwinism on philosophical grounds put it aside when they get down to scientific practice .
A good example is Niles Eldredge , a paleontologist who collaborated with Stephen Jay Gould in the famous papers advocating that evolution proceeds by " punctuated equilibria , " meaning long changeless periods which are occasionally interrupted by the abrupt appearance of new forms .
" Punk eek " was widely interpreted at first as an implied endorsement of a macromutational alternative to Darwinian gradualism , a misunderstanding that led scornful Darwinists to dismiss the idea as " evolution by jerks , " but both Gould and Eldredge insisted that the unseen process of change was Darwinian .
Eldredge in particular is so determined to wash away the taint of heresy that he has taken to describing himself as a " knee - jerk neo - Darwinian , " a label that seems both to protest too much and to imply a willingness to overlook disconfirming evidence .
On the other hand , Eldredge rejects what he calls " ultra - Darwinism , " the position of Dawkins and Dennett , on grounds that obscurely imply rejection of the very factor that makes Darwin 's idea dangerous , the claim that natural selection has sufficient creative power to account for design .
For example , he writes in his 1994 book Reinventing Darwin that ultra-Darwinians are guilty of " physics envy " because they " seek to transform natural selection from a simple form of record keeping ... to a more dynamic , active force that molds and shapes organic form as time goes by . "
Eldredge has no philosophical problem with atheistic materialism ; his ambivalence stems entirely from the embarrassingly un-Darwinian fossil record , as described in this typical paragraph :
No wonder paleontologists shied away from evolution for so long .
It never seems to happen .
Assiduous collecting up cliff faces yields zigzags , minor oscillations , and the very occasional slight accumulation of change -- over millions of years , at a rate too slow to account for all the prodigious change that has occurred in evolutionary history .
When we do see the introduction of evolutionary novelty , it usually shows up with a bang , and often with no firm evidence that the fossils did not evolve elsewhere !
Evolution cannot forever be going on somewhere else .
Yet that 's how the fossil record has struck many a forlorn paleontologist looking to learn something about evolution .
Whatever is motivating Eldredge to give all that fervent lip - service to Darwinism , it obviously is not anything he has discovered as a paleontologist .
In fact the real problem is understood by everyone , although it has to be discussed in guarded terms .
What paleontologists fear is not the scientific consequences of disowning Darwinism but the political consequences .
They fear it might lead to a takeover of government by religious fundamentalists who would shut off the funding .
There are paleontologists who are more supportive of Darwinism than Eldredge , just as there are other eminent scientists who are more explicit in insisting that the neo- Darwinian variety of evolution is valid only at the " micro " level .
Regardless of the number or status of the skeptics , the usual scientific practice is to retain a paradigm , however shaky , until somebody provides a better one .
I will assume arguendo that this " best we 've got " policy is justifiable within science itself .
The question I want to pursue is whether non-scientists have some legal , moral , or intellectual obligation to accept Darwinism as absolutely true , especially when the theory is encountering so many difficulties with the evidence .
The issue comes up in many important contexts ; here are two examples .
First , consider the situation of Christian parents , not necessarily fundamentalists , who suspect that the term " evolution " drips with atheistic implications .
The whole point of Dennett 's thesis is that the parents are dead right about the implications , and that science educators who deny this are either misinformed or lying .
Do parents then have a right to protect their children from indoctrination in atheism , and even to insist that the public schools include in the science curriculum a fair review of the arguments against the atheistic claim that unintelligent natural processes are our true creator ?
Dennett cannot be accused of avoiding the religious liberty issue , or of burying it in tactful circumlocutions .
He proposes that theistic religion should continue to exist only in " cultural zoos , " and he says this directly to religious parents :
If you insist on teaching your children falsehoods -- that the earth is flat , that " Man " is not a product of evolution by natural selection -- then you must expect , at the very least , that those of us who have freedom of speech will feel free to describe your teachings as the spreading of falsehoods , and will attempt to demonstrate this to your children at our earliest opportunity .
Our future well - being -- the well - being of all of us on the planet -- depends on the education of our descendants .
Of course it is not freedom of speech that worries the parents , but the power of atheistic materialists to use public education for indoctrination , while excluding any other view as " religion . "
If you want to know how such threats sound to Christian parents , try imagining what would happen if some prominent Christian fundamentalist addressed similar language to Jewish parents .
Would we think the Jewish parents unreasonable if they interpreted " at the very least " to imply that young children may be forcibly removed from the homes of recalcitrant parents , and that those metaphorical cultural zoos may one day be enclosed by real barbed wire ?
Strong measures might seem justified if the well - being of everyone on the planet depends upon protecting children from the falsehoods their parents want to tell them .
I will pass over the legal issues raised by this program of forced religious conversion because the intellectual issues are even more interesting .
Granted that Darwinism is the reigning paradigm in biology , is there some rule in the academic world which requires non-scientists to accept Darwinian principles when they write about , say , philosophy or ethics ?
My Berkeley colleague John Searle thinks so .
In the first chapter of his recent book on The Construction of Social Reality , Searle states that it is necessary " to make some substantive presuppositions about how the world is in fact in order that we can even pose the questions we are trying to answer ( about how other aspects of reality are socially constructed ) . "
According to Searle , " two features of our conception of reality are not up for grabs .
They are not , so to speak , optional for us as citizens of the late twentieth and early twenty - first century . "
The two compulsory theories are that the world consists entirely of the entities that physicists call particles , and that living systems ( including humans and their minds ) evolved by natural selection .
I think that Searle undermines his whole project by virtually ordering his readers not to notice that scientific materialism and Darwinism are themselves socially constructed doctrines rather than objective facts .
Scientists assume materialism because they define their enterprise as a search for the best materialist theories , and this culturally - driven methodological choice is not even evidence , let alone proof , that the world really does consist only of particles .
As an explanation for design in biology , Darwinism is perfectly secure when it is regarded as a deduction from materialism , but remarkably insecure when it is subjected to empirical testing .
Given that what we most respect about science is its fidelity to the principle that empirical testing is what really matters , why should philosophers allow scientists to tell them that they must accept assumptions that do n't pass the empirical test ?
Searle is a particularly poignant example , because he is famous for defending the independence of the mind against the onslaught of the materialist " strong AI " program , and also for defending traditional academic standards against the corrosive relativism of the fact / value distinction .
He is so skillful in argument that he almost holds his own even after leaping gratuitously into a pool of universal acid , but why accept the disadvantage ?
Searle could seize the high ground if he began by proposing that any true metaphysical theory must account for two essential truths which materialism cannot accommodate : first , that mind is more than matter ; and second , that such things as truth , beauty , and goodness really do exist even if most people do not know how to recognize them .
Scientific materialists would answer that they proved long ago , or are going to prove at some time in the future , that materialism is true .
They are bluffing .
Science is a wonderful thing in its place .
Because science is so successful in its own territory , however , scientists and their allied philosophers sometimes get bemused by dreams of world conquest .
Paul Feyerabend put it best : " Scientists are not content with running their own playpens in accordance with what they regard as the rules of the scientific method , they want to universalize those rules , they want them to become part of society at large , and they use every means at their disposal -- argument , propaganda , pressure tactics , intimidation , lobbying -- to achieve their aims . "
Samuel Johnson gave the best answer to this absurd imperialism .
" A cow is a very good animal in the field ; but we turn her out of a garden . "

Scientists working at NASA have spotted the smallest black hole ever discovered .
Its mass is less that four times the mass of the Sun and has the size of a large city .
Scientists dubbed the little black hole J1650 .
Despite its small size and mass , the hole is still very strong .
" This black hole is really pushing the limits .
For many years astronomers have wanted to know the smallest possible size of a black hole , and this little guy is a big step toward answering that question , " stated Nikolai Shaposhnikov , who works at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .
Scientists consider that the small black hole can be even stronger than bigger holes located in the middle of our galaxies .
Shaposhnikov mentioned that the gravity of the hole is able to " stretch your body into a strand of spaghetti . "
Just like all the other black holes in the universe J1650 was created by a star that has shut down due to the fact that it ran out of fuel and it disintegrated because of its own gravity .
Together with his colleague Lev Titarchuk , Nikolai Shaposhnikov in his research used Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite and applied a new way to calculate the size of the black hole , which was discovered in a system located in the southern constellation Ara , found in our Milky Way Galaxy .
The new method of black hole size estimation calculates the oscillation of hot gas that amassed near the black hole as it absorbs matter .
The method applied by the researchers was mentioned at the meeting of American Astronomical Society High - Energy Astrophysics Division held in Los Angeles .
According to scientists the mass of J1650 is of 3.8 Suns and it would be about 15 mile across .
" This makes the black hole one of the smallest objects ever discovered outside our solar system , " concluded Shaposhnikov .
" Amazingly , equations from Albert Einstein predict that a black hole with 3.8 times the mass of our Sun would be only 15 miles across - the size of a city , " stated NASA 's representatives .
According to scientists a star that would collapse having a much smaller parameters than J1650 , would probably form a neutron star rather than a black hole .
Advances in science are starting to give us a glimpse of where we stand in the universe .
The technical orchestra of computer parts , satellite images and the vast archive of human knowlege work together to improve our understanding .
Imagine the information flow is like streaming music to our scientific ears .

Let us impact the material world
Dear Community I am in Columbia .
Drinking local coffee ( yes Paola your coffee is the best in the world ) and thinking with the early morning clarity only those blessed with jag - lag can understand .
Yesterday was an amazing day .
After a morning walk around the government buildings and many beautiful museums of Bogota , we went up into the mountainous region of Monserrate .
To get to the top of this cityscape icon and pilgrimage destination you have three choices :
A gravity defying train , a somewhat stable cable car , or climbing .
Pilgrims prefer the latter ; but , perhaps due to the long delays of FreeRunner , my sense of urgency even here was overwhelming , I chose the cable car .
For almost two years now I have told the story of Openmoko .
Ascending that mountain provided me with a brief moment where , like my new view of Bogota , I was able to look at things from the outside .
A moment long enough to rethink the way in which I told our story .
I realized that evangelizing the impact of digital technologies is not enough .
We must take charge of them .
The story of Openmoko needs to be a story of us changing our " open source reality " .
For this is the opportunity presented to us now .
Think :
The collapse of so many hi tech companies on our stock exchanges has humbled many .
Creators within the digital world -- no matter how novel and exciting -- will have no value unless they impact the material world directly .
So this is my call to all of us today .
Our work must begin to impact the material world .
We have the tools .
We have the knowledge .
We must use our knowledge to transcend the digital world .
People use heroes as touchstones to help them surmount their challenges .
John Maeda has been a hero of mine ever since I first discovered my love for combining art and computers .
I encourage you all to learn more about this incredibly creative person .
His " Laws of Simplicity " would be a good place to start .
For projects like ours , these are indeed guiding lights .
Let me share one of his " laws " with you today ; it 's the tenth one : " Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious , and adding the meaningful . "
Hardly a day goes by for me without thinking about this elegant idea .
The smart phone has become too complex .
Our challenge is to make it simple and wise .
Yes I am well aware of the distance between us and this goal .
The complexity of our system pains me as much as I 'm sure it pains you .
But starting today , I hope we can become more conscious and more focused on simplicity and wisdom .
We have been hard at work subtracting the obvious from our current architectures .
Our new framework initiative ( http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/OpenmokoFramework), is all about simplicity achieved through a complexity of thought and design .
But Maeda insists that we must add meaning .
Removing the obvious is not enough .
So then , what meaningful for a smart phone ?
What exactly can we add that has n't been added before ?
Today let me share two concepts .
The first stems from a genre of design called " reactive graphics " .
Pressed to come up with an explanation of how this differs from interactive graphics , I would say the following : Reactive design engages the viewer at an almost instinctual level , rather than just the communication level found in interactive designs .
This has a profound effect on how an individual views technology .
" Reactivity " is , in my opinion , the key ingredient for making computers feel more human .
All living organisms react .
When our Neos begin to react to the environment around them , they will feel more alive to normal people .
This is comforting .
This is a simple way for us to impact the material world .
Meeting interesting people with creative ideas is perhaps the most rewarding part of my job .
Last night , while fighting off the less - than - helpful side of jet - lag , I had an great conversation with my new Columbian friend , Offray , about how Openmoko can better impact our daily lives .
The Neo , to him , is a social cognition node -- an artifact -- where we can balance the power of the individual with that of the group within the mobile world .
Here comes the second concept : Artifacts , he explained , have values embedded within , but sometimes they are not explicit .
Our challenge , he said , is how to make this explicit .
Start with things people are familiar with and find new ways to make them more qualitative , says Offray .
Take SMS , he continues , instead of just plain text , why not send special compressed messages , readable only by Neos .
We can use these as enablers to change mobile ecosystems .
Hack their network to embed more freedoms for normal people .
Add more meaning .
Transform our Neo into an artifact .
These are only two concepts .
Many more exist .
Together , we must start a conscious exploration of simple ways to impact the material world around us .
Exactly where this will lead us is unclear .
But we must begin .
Whenever I talk publicly about Openmoko , or so it seems , the following question is asked :
How can you compete again the giants of this industry ?
For most of us , I 'd like to think , the answer is obvious .
Instead of answering , I usually return their question :
How can they compete against us ?
Openmoko is the collective creation of amateurs working on exactly what we love .
They are professions , some doing what they love , most working towards the next paycheck .
At certain times , the amateur has a distinct advantage over the professional .
A professional knows what they can deliver , and rarely goes beyond it .
An amateur has no concept of their limitations and usually goes well beyond them .
Experience teaches us our limits .
When we have learned that and become complacent , we are finished , because our work can be calculated and measured .
Our work ceases to be a weapon .
Now is such a time .
Let us ignore limitations .
Let us create new technologies that breed new ways of thinking .
Let us impact the material world .
Thousands of FreeRunners have been loaded into planes and fired around the world .
Many of our distributors have already begun shipping .
In about another week , Steve and Harry will announce the opening of our own webshop .
I plan to start a new blog , sharing stories of how our Neos impact the material world .
If you have something you would like to share , please email me directly .
I would love to weave your ideas in our collective story .
Thank you , from the the bottom of my heart , for all your incredible support and patience .
I know the delays have been long .
But now we are ready .
Let us run free and impact the material world .
Sincerely , Sean ( one very excited amateur )

Back
Encounter
We were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn .
A red wing rose in the darkness .
And suddenly a hare ran across the road .
One of us pointed to it with his hand .
That was long ago .
Today neither of them is alive ,
Not the hare , nor the man who made the gesture .
O my love , where are they , where are they going
The flash of a hand , streak of movement , rustle of pebbles .
I ask not out of sorrow , but in wonder .
Wilno , 1936

What the hell is wrong with Metallica ?
I had some empathy about the whole Napster snafu in 2000 , when the band complained about copyright violations and being ripped off for royalties when Napster was a free file - sharing site .
Metallica won a settlement from Napster ( now a pay site ) , and alienated a lot of fans in the process .
I was one of them .
See , you ca n’t stop bootlegs .
Metallica , of all bands , should know that -- their initial fan base was built upon bootleg copies of tapes that metal fans traded and passed along .
I ’d never heard of Metallica until a friend gave me a taped copy ( yes , a copy ) of the band ’s 1986 album , Master of Puppets .
That bootleg copy led me to purchase all of Metallica ’s albums , several T - shirts , and tickets to their shows when they came to town .
Of course , that was before Metallica made the “ One ” video in 1989 and became MTV darlings .
Ever since the band got the corporate culture machine behind them , they ’ve vehemently turned their backs on the old school , grassroots metal community that helped put them where they are today .
Now , it seems they ’re taking their prima donna behavior a step further .
Last Wednesday , Metallica invited several bloggers to a “ listening party ” in London for its upcoming album .
Now , “ listening parties ” are public relations stunts .
Anybody who ’s been in this business for longer than a week knows that PR companies hold listening parties for the purpose of generating pre-release press and hype .
Listening parties can be expensive and time - consuming , and so they are generally not done just for fun .
Metallica uber alles .
But when bloggers wrote reviews of what they ’d heard at the listening party , Metallica went ballistic , demanding that the reviews be taken down .
One site in particular , The Quietus , has reported that the band ’s management asked the site to remove the blog about the new album , even though Metallica ’s management did not ask the blogger to sign a non-disclosure agreement ( which would have legally prevented attendees from writing about the listening party or the six songs they ’d heard previewed there ) .
Other publications whose reporters attended the listening party and wrote reviews – including Kerrang ! , Metal Hammer , and Rock Sound – were reportedly asked to remove their reviews , as well .
Ironically , none of the now - removed reviews were negative .
The least glowing review was that on The Quietus , and Quietus editor Luke Turner told Blinded By Hype that “ if you were lucky enough to read [ the review ] before it was taken down , was full of praise about a return to form . ”
Metallica ’s management has refused to comment on the matter .
But in this case , the band ’s behavior is comment enough .

Zimbabwe : Africa ’s Political Basket Case
Mugabe ’s Failed State
The Stench Of Vote Rigging Is Everywhere But Mugabe Appears Unperturbed
An Essay By Michael D. Roberts
Maybe Zimbabwe will go the way of Kenya and chalk up a new African nation in crisis and chaos .
And if sketchy reports coming from Harare are anything to go by it looks a vintage Robert Mugabe all over again .
There are reports of controlled , state - sponsored violence in the countryside and other provocations around the country mainly by Mugabe ’s loyal ZANU - PF members who have everything to lose if the 85 - year old president should have to demit office .
In fact , this election is by far the most crucial in Mugabe ’s political career since any loss of power will undoubtedly provoke a wave of political revenge by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) no matter what it says to the contrary .
And Mr. Mugabe ’s cronies , close inner circle , and members of his ruling ZANU - PF know that their very class interests are at stake and that the octogenarian president ’s retention of political power is in their best interests .
Until recently , Mr. Mugabe had always been able to stifle political opposition .
His ZANU - PF party had still dominated what is virtually a one party state occupying 147 out of the country 's 150 parliamentary seats .
But growing discontent over the country 's failing economy with inflation and unemployment soaring to record levels are starting to threaten his authority .
Already the ZANU - PF must be having some anxious moments since the writing was on the proverbial political wall when it lost the parliamentary elections to the MDC .
That caused Mr. Mugabe to convene a hasty session of the party ’s Politburo who spun the yarn about a pending recount .
When that did not work Mr. Mugabe had his henchmen arrest about seven members of Zimbabwe ’s Election Commission accusing them of rigging the elections for the MDC .
Meanwhile , the wily Mr. Mugabe fell back on a tried and tested tactic : white farms and black destituteness .
To date , some 60 white farmers and at least two black farmers are said to have been evicted from their land in this new round of tensions .
Four foreign journalists have also been arrested , including New York Times correspondent Barry Bearak .
The Zimbabwean military has released the names of 200 high - ranking officers who it said were leading gangs of thugs in the guise of war veterans in attacks on government opponents .
Unemployed youths are reportedly being recruited to join government - backed gangs .
Correspondingly , armed gangs are said to be hunting down opponents of ZANU - PF , burning houses and beating people .
We have seen these political chess moves and shenanigans before – when President Mugabe wants to cling to power at all costs .
While all this is going on the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission is yet to release the vote count for the presidential elections even as ZANU - PF is saying that Mr. Mugabe is ready for a new run off .
Nobody in the world should be surprised by Mr. Mugabe ’s antics .
After all the rigging of elections in Zimbabwe are now routine and standard operating procedures for ZANU - PF .
For example , in 2002 amid great fanfare and lofty talk about transparency and fairness some of the MDC ’s supporters were abducted , beaten , intimidated , threatened and murdered .
Anybody who dared to even suggest that Mr. Mugabe was literally getting away with murder was arrested .
Then like now electoral roles and registers were padded with phantom names and the ZEC kept changing and making up the rules at it went along to suppress voter turnout in areas where the MDC was perceived as too strong and popular .
Local journalists were kidnapped and killed for writing articles critical of the electoral process and of the conduct of the president .
Government food aid to drought - stricken areas was used as a means of buying votes .
It is the same playbook that Mr. Mugabe uses today and now like then the situation is tense and thousands of people are fleeing the country for fear of reprisals by the security forces that remain fanatically loyal to the president and ZANU - PF .
Perhaps the only page left in his playbook that ’s not been used yet is the internal ethnic cleansing that he used in May 2005 .
Back then Mr. Mugabe ordered the demolition of shanty towns in “ Operation Murambatsvina , ” which means “ clear out the trash ” in Shona .
Poor residents were loaded onto trucks and driven into the countryside where they were dumped without any means of livelihood or even basic sanitation .

AT&T Wireless , Apple 's exclusive iPhone provider in the United States , is now listing a second model of the iPhone in its device database called " iPhone Black , " AppleInsider has been informed .
The finding , discovered by a reader on Sunday and confirmed by AppleInsider on Monday , is interesting if nothing else in that it may add a bit of support to ongoing rumors that Apple 's second - generation 3G iPhone would sport a black plastic shell as opposed to an aluminum one .
The option to select an " iPhone Black " model is visible alongside the traditional " iPhone " for existing AT&T Wireless customers who are logged into their account on the carrier 's website , and who choose to select or update their handset model .
Impeachment resolution gains co-sponsor Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday June 10 , 2008

Print This Email This Stalwart liberal Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) became the first member of Congress to co-sponsor Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's resolution calling for President Bush 's impeachment .
" President Bush deliberately created a massive propaganda campaign to sell the war in Iraq to the American people and the charges detailed in this impeachment resolution indicate an unprecedented abuse of executive power , " Wexler said in a news release .
" A decision by Congress to pursue impeachment is not an option , it is a sworn duty .
It is time for Congress to stand up and defend the Constitution against the blatant violations and illegalities of this Administration .
Our Founding Fathers bestowed upon Congress the power of impeachment , and it is now time that we use it to defend the rule of law from this corrupt Administration . "
Kucinich introduced 35 articles of impeachment Monday night , and the House is expected to vote on them Tuesday .
The former Democratic presidential candidate accused Bush of high crimes and misdemeanors , including misleading the country into war and authorizing war crimes , and he said impeachment may be the only way to avoid another unnecessary war with Iran .
Wexler was one of two - dozen co-sponsors of an earlier Kucinich effort to begin impeachment proceedings against Vice President Dick Cheney .
That resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee last November , where it has languished since .
The Bush impeachment measure is almost certain to go nowhere in the House .
Before taking over as Speaker last year , Nancy Pelosi declared that impeachment proceedings would remain " off the table . "
She 's not budged from that position since , as the president strolls through his last half - year in office .
On several occasions Monday night , Kucinich referenced RAW STORY and its noted investigative news chief , Larisa Alexandrovna , as source material for the articles .
Two of the RAW STORY pieces Kucinich mentioned are viewable here and here .
The House was expected to formally vote to refer the Bush impeachment articles to the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday , although some Democrats feared Kucinich would delay the chamber 's other business by insisting on another reading of all 35 articles , according to Roll Call ( subscription only ) .
House business may move at a snails pace Tuesday afternoon if Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) requests a full reading of his resolution calling for the impeachment of President Bush , a task that took nearly five hours on Monday .
...
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) said the House will take up the resolution about 1 p.m. and that it must be read in full by the Clerk unless Kucinich waives that right , which is possible since the bill was already read into the record on Monday night .
But it looks like the Ohio House Member , who ran for president , is standing firm .
" There seems to be a number of people who want that [ the reading ] to happen , " Kucinich said on Tuesday afternoon .
" I expect it will . "
Back in his Cleveland - area district , Kucinich is facing criticism from his Republican opponent for pursuing the quixotic impeachment campaign .
" This just shows that political games and not real policy discussion is the agenda of Clevelands congressman , " GOP candidate Jim Trakas said in a press release .
" While we suffer from skyrocketing food and fuel prices , due in large part to bad policies from Washington , and higher than tolerable unemployment , Congressman Kucinich pursues a bizarre political agenda with no chance of passage and that in no way solves our very real problems . "
Kucinich 's 10th Congressional District seat is rated safe Democrat by CQ Politics , meaning it is highly unlikely Kucinich will be defeated in the fall .
The six - term Congressman did face four challengers in this year 's Democratic primary and waited to introduce the Bush impeachment measure until after he had secured his hold on the nomination in Ohio 's primary .
On the two - year anniversary of its eruption , international scientists say they are almost certain a mud volcano that displaced tens of thousands of villagers in central Indonesia was caused by faulty drilling of a gas exploration well - not an earthquake as claimed by the gas company .
" We are more certain than ever that the Lusi mud volcano is an unnatural disaster and was triggered by drilling " said Richard Davies , lead author of a study published this week in the academic journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters .
Two years ago now , on 28 May 2006 , gas company PT Lapindo Brantas exploring for gas in Sidoarjo , in East Java , Indonesia , drilled a borehole .
At 5 AM , a secondary stage of drilling began and the drill string went about 9,300 feet down , after which the first small eruption of water , steam and a small amount of gas occurred at a location just southwest of the well .
Several other eruptions followed over the next few days .
The flow of hot mud has not ceased since .
Fourteen people have been killed and 30,000 people have been evacuated from the area .
At least a dozen villages , with more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed while schools , offices and factories have also been wiped out and a major impact on the wider marine and coastal environment is expected .

A gang of six teens decided to take Grand Theft Auto IV from the television screens to the streets of Long Island , with a two - hour crime spree meant to copy the game ’s violent hero , cops said .
The game - crazed youth ’s real - life robbery romp featured such staples of the mega - popular game as a mugging , several break - ins and an attempted car - jacking at an intersection in tony Garden City , police said .
“ They decided they were going to go out to commit robberies and emulate the [ lead ] character Nico Belic in the particularly violent video game Grand Theft Auto , ’ said Nassau County Police Detective Lt. Raymond Cote .
“ These teens have difficulty separating fact from fiction , fantasy from reality . . .
It was quite alarming . ’
The rampage started at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday , when four of the teenagers – Brandon Cruz , 15 , Gurnoor Singh , 14 , Samuel Philip , 16 , and Jaspreet Singh , 17 , – were sitting in Memorial Park in New Hyde Park looking for something to do , cops said .
Cops said that they decided to act out the game , in which players live out the life a Belic , an Eastern European criminal who uses murder and robbery to rise to the top of the underworld in “ Liberty City , ’ which bears a close similarity of New York City .
“ They were bored and they decided this was a good idea , ’ Cote said .
According to cops , the boys first mugged a man at a bus stop near the park , beat him and knocked out some teeth .
They then broke into some sheds and garages , stole some bats and crowbars and met up with a few more teens to continue the spree .
The six then attempted to stage some carjackings in Garden City .
But it was game over when one of their would - be victims – a 23 - year - old woman in a 2008 BMW – called the cops , who quickly arrested them .
All four of the original teen plotters were arrested , along with the two youths who joined them , Stephen Attard , 18 , of New Hyde Park and Dylan Laird , 17 , who was visiting Long Island from Southborough , Mass .
They were all charged with first - degree robbery , except for Jaspreet Singh , who was charged with possession of stolen property .
The other charges were pending .
Police would not say specifically how they knew that the teens crimes were motivated by Grand Theft Auto , and not by some other motive .
They said they discovered it during their investigation .
O.K. , let ’s talk about the reality .
Is speculation playing a role in high oil prices ?
It ’s not out of the question .
Economists were right to scoff at Mr. Masters  buying a futures contract does n’t directly reduce the supply of oil to consumers  but under some circumstances , speculation in the oil futures market can indirectly raise prices , encouraging producers and other players to hoard oil rather than making it available for use .
Whether that ’s happening now is a subject of highly technical dispute .
( Readers who want to wonk themselves out can go to my blog , krugman.blogs.nytimes.com , and follow the links . )
Suffice it to say that some economists , myself included , make much of the fact that the usual telltale signs of a speculative price boom are missing .
But other economists argue , in effect , that absence of evidence is n’t solid evidence of absence .
What about those who argue that speculative excess is the only way to explain the speed with which oil prices have risen ?
Well , I have two words for them : iron ore .
You see , iron ore is n’t traded on a global exchange ; its price is set in direct deals between producers and consumers .
So there ’s no easy way to speculate on ore prices .
Yet the price of iron ore , like that of oil , has surged over the past year .
In particular , the price Chinese steel makers pay to Australian mines has just jumped 96 percent .
This suggests that growing demand from emerging economies , not speculation , is the real story behind rising prices of raw materials , oil included .
In any case , one thing is clear : the hyperventilation over oil - market speculation is distracting us from the real issues .
Regulating futures markets more tightly is n’t a bad idea , but it wo n’t bring back the days of cheap oil .
Nothing will .
Oil prices will fluctuate in the coming years 
I would n’t be surprised if they slip for a while as consumers drive less , switch to more fuel - efficient cars , and so on  but the long - term trend is surely up .
It looks like the War Party is victorious , at least according to Philip Giraldi writing on The American Conservative blog :
“ There is considerable speculation and buzz in Washington today suggesting that the National Security Council has agreed in principle to proceed with plans to attack an Iranian al - Quds - run camp that is believed to be training Iraqi militants .
The camp that will be targeted is one of several located near Tehran .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was the only senior official urging delay in taking any offensive action . ”
Alarm bells ought to be going off across the nation .
The presidential candidates ought to be debating whether or not this is the right course .
Obama , the “ antiwar ” candidate , ought to be speaking out .
Instead , what we hear is silence .
If ever there was a scoop , then this is a major one .
Yet not a word is being spoken about it in the “ mainstream ” media .
So much for the supposedly highly competitive nature of the news business .
While I ’m a very big fan of The American Conservative  hey , they made me an associate editor !
 one has to wonder : why do we have to read this on their blog and nowhere else ?
Of course , the reason could be because it ’s not true , but my sources are telling me that this is n’t just “ speculation and buzz ”  it ’s for real .
War is imminent .
The markets sense it , too , which is why the price of oil keeps climbing to record levels .
Giraldi has more :
“ The White House contacted the Iranian government directly yesterday through a channel provided by the leadership of the Kurdish region in Iraq , which has traditionally had close ties to Tehran .
The U.S. demanded that Iran admit that it has been interfering in Iraq and also commit itself to taking steps to end the support of various militant groups .
There was also a warning about interfering in Lebanon .
The Iranian government reportedly responded quickly , restating its position that it would not discuss the matter until the U.S. ceases its own meddling employing Iranian dissident groups .
The perceived Iranian intransigence coupled with the Lebanese situation convinced the White House that some sort of unambiguous signal has to be sent to the Iranian leadership , presumably in the form of cruise missiles . ”
A decision to go to war , sub rosa back - and - forth between Washington and Tehran using the Kurds ( probably the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , which has close ties to Iran ) as intermediaries , missile strikes near Tehran , the dissent of Robert Gates : all of this is very big news .
Yet not a word is reaching the general public .
The same pattern that characterized the run-up to war with Iraq is being employed in the case of Iran .
We ’re acting on intelligence that is so overcooked the stench is overpowering .
There is no evidence these alleged training camps even exist , or , if they do , that their purpose is to train Iraqi “ militants . ”
Indeed , all efforts to show the media hard evidence for this phantom threat seem to have evaporated into thin air : these charges are the intelligence community ’s equivalent of “ vaporware . ”
The irony is that this “ training camp ” tale is coming a bit late , because the Iranians did train , equip , and otherwise succor Iraqi “ militants ” all through the 1980s and ’90s  such as the militants of the Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( now known simply as the Islamic Council ) , which is today the biggest of the parties in Baghdad ’s governing Shi’ite coalition .
This is also true of the second largest component of the coalition , the Da’wa party  whose most prominent member is Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
Virtually all the present leaders of the government U.S. soldiers are laying down their lives for , including Maliki , lived in Iran for years , where they were given sanctuary and sustenance by the mullahs .
On the other hand , the Mahdi Army of Moqtada al - Sadr , which is presently taking on the government ’s armed forces , is anti-Iranian and vehemently nationalist , the only viable counterweight to Tehran ’s all - pervasive influence in postwar Iraq .
Yet we are providing air support to the Iraqi army and police units battling them in the streets of Sadr City .
What sparked the decision to strike Iran was n’t anything happening on the ground in Iraq , however .
It ’s all about Lebanon .
As Giraldi puts it :
“ The decision to go ahead with plans to attack Iran is the direct result of concerns being expressed over the deteriorating situation in Lebanon , where Iranian ally Hezbollah appears to have gained the upper hand against government forces and might be able to dominate the fractious political situation . ”
Translation :
The Israelis are demanding war with Iran , and the national security bureaucracy  thoroughly riddled with and corrupted by the neocons  has capitulated .
The Israeli failure to dislodge Hezbollah from its Lebanese fortress and subvert their growing political dominance  a direct result of the 2006 war  has Tel Aviv in a tizzy .
The whole point of their “ Clean Break ” strategy , the linchpin of the American neocons ’ decade - long drive to embroil us in Iraq , has been compromised and even reversed by Hezbollah ’s continuing defiance .
Tel Aviv wants them taken out  by the U.S. , which alone has the firepower to do it .
This has been the real purpose of the “ surge ” all along  to prepare the ground for the final assault on Israel ’s deadliest enemy in the region , which is Iran .
This is why Israel ’s lobby in the U.S. has made ratcheting - up tensions with Tehran their number - one priority , and clearly their relentless campaign is succeeding .
Once again , the prime directive of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East stands revealed for all with eyes to see : it ’s all about Israel .
It is surely not in our interests to go after Tehran : ideologically , the Shi’ite mullahs are a necessary counterweight to the Sunni fanatics who are swelling the ranks of al - Qaeda .
Yet we are actively encouraging and even funding similar groups , such as Jundallah , an Iranian Sunni terrorist group that apes al - Qaeda ’s tactics , such as beheading its victims .
As Seymour Hersh has reported , the same crazy covert operation is being carried out in Lebanon .
None of this makes any sense , until and unless one realizes that the purpose of the Great Middle Eastern War has nothing to do with the pursuit of American interests and everything to do with Israeli interests .
Our foreign policy has been hijacked and placed at the disposal of a foreign power , one with a very powerful American lobby  so powerful that no U.S. politician dares defy it , including the sainted Obama .
In the early years of the war hysteria that enveloped the U.S. after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , I was met with a large degree of skepticism when I maintained that the main force behind the U.S. attack on Iraq was the Israel lobby ’s influence .
Even my fellow anti-interventionists , including many on the Left , viewed this focus as an unreasonable and quite possibly unhealthy fixation , an exaggeration of a partial truth , rooted in a special animus for Israel .
Perhaps , they thought , it was even evidence of anti-Semitism .
Yet as the years wear on and the facts pointing to the validity of my thesis accumulate , the reality can no longer be ignored .
Why , in the name of all that ’s holy , are we expanding a war that has proven to be such a monumental failure ?
Why are our leaders ignoring the evaluation of our own National Intelligence Estimate on the question of Iran ’s nuclear program  which shows that they abandoned their nascent nukes , just as Saddam did  and insisting that Tehran will soon wield a nuclear sword , perhaps against Israel ?
Why are American politicians defying their own war - weary people and launching a conflict that will doubtless prove even less popular than the one in which we are currently engaged ?
None of this makes any sense unless we accept the hijacking thesis : U.S. policy is the captive of foreign interests , specifically Israeli interests .
We are , all of us , held hostage by the Israel lobby , which has a stranglehold on the political establishment in this country .
That ’s not a “ conspiracy theory , ” because it ’s no secret : the effort to mold U.S. policy to suit Israeli interests is open to the point of brazenness .
That ’s why Hillary Clinton can get away with threatening to “ obliterate ” an entire country 
Iran , of course  in the name of “ protecting ” nuclear - armed Israel .
And that ’s why Obama is silent on this issue , except to take Hillary to task for voting in favor of the Kyl - Lieberman resolution .
That resolution  passed overwhelmingly in both the House and the Senate  designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guards a “ terrorist ” organization and gave the president advance permission to bomb those “ training camps , ” i.e. , Iranian military installations on Iranian territory .
“ The decision to proceed with plans for an attack is not final , ” Giraldi writes .
“ The president will still have to give the order to launch after all preparations are made . ”
If it ’s down to George W. Bush , who reportedly fears that Iran ’s acquisition of nukes will be his lasting legacy , then we ’re really in trouble .
An attack on Iran before his term is up seems a veritable certainty .
Where is the antiwar movement ?
Where are the supposedly “ antiwar ” politicians of the Democratic Party ?
These folks are nowhere to be seen , and certainly they are not being heard .
The reason ?
They ’re cowards , who are  to a man and woman  beholden to the Lobby .
MoveOn.org , for example , is running ads against a war that is already five years old and widely abhorred , but is silent when it comes to the next war , which could break out at any moment .
The antiwar movement , such as it is , had better get up off its collective ass .
Because we do n’t have much time .
As the sand in the hourglass rapidly diminishes , the war cries of the neocons and their allies in both parties are getting louder and more insistent .
It ’s time to start making some noise of our own  before it ’s too late .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
One aspect of the Internet that has changed writing as an art is the matter of length .
In the world of dead - tree publishing , it was almost impossible to find a venue for a 7,000 - word essay like “ Mishima : Paleocon as Samurai , ” my latest essay to appear in Taki ’s Magazine .
It was simply too expensive to put out .
Today , it ’s all very different .
At any rate , Mishima is one of my favorite writers , and I had great fun with this piece , so go check it out .
The pools are more popular in Austria , where a company called Biotop has been designing them for residential and public use since 1986 and now installs about 50 a year , according to Peter Petrich , Biotop ’s owner and the person credited with inventing the concept .
Mr. Petrich said he and his colleagues have given much consideration to why natural pools have n’t caught on in the United States and have concluded that “ perhaps in Europe people have more contact with nature and life is not so clinical . ”
Toni Schneeweiss of Biotop said that private pools in Austria , unlike those in the United States , generally do not require building permits , which can be harder to obtain for projects using unfamiliar technology .
But it is also true that natural pools are not well known in the United States , and that it is hard to find people to build them .
For builders like Mr. Hilleary and Mr. Morse , natural pools are a side business , and mainstream pool contractors do n’t seem to offer them at all .
Penny Johnson , the chairwoman of the Association of Pool & Spa Professionals , an industry trade group , said she had never heard of the concept until she was asked about it for this article .
She expressed skepticism about the technology .
“ I do n’t know how plants could filter the water for bathing use , ” she said , adding that in her experience outdoor pools have to be “ shocked ” with chemicals to kill bacteria .
Asked about safety concerns , Mr. Petrich said that the water in the natural pools his company builds meets European Union standards for bacteria levels and that the risk of swimmers becoming sick is “ very low . ”
One American homeowner who has such a pool , Jim Smith , a 45 - year - old computer programmer who lives in a suburb of Wichita , Kan. , said he learned about the pools in a sales pitch given by Mr. Hilleary at a home show in 2002 .
Mr. Smith and his wife , Susie , who is an avid gardener , decided to build a natural pool with a miniature waterfall , plants like hornwort and anacharis and a 40 - foot recirculating stream that would run past their living room windows .
( Mr. Smith said he spent about $ 50,000 on the pool , or $ 20,000 more than he estimates a standard pool would have cost ; he attributed the higher cost in part to elaborate landscaping . )
The couple , who have two daughters , had a chlorinated pool at a previous home , and Mr. Smith said the transition was difficult .
“ It took us the first year to learn how to deal with the water , ” he said , referring to the way natural pools can become overgrown with algae .
“ In a regular pool , you just put chlorine in and shock it . ”
The New York Times , the historically credible newspaper that sold its soul to Team Bush fascism and helped lie and cheerlead this nation into an illegal occupation of a non-threatening country , has apparently noticed that America 's laws about the cannabis plant ( known to most ignorant people as " marijuana " , a racist term tagged to the plant back in the early days of reefer madness and an age - old example of using brown - skinned people to cause dumb informationally - challenged Americans to fear , has now called for the elimination of a law that bars petty drug possession offenses from college aid .
I guess once in awhile the NYT has an editor whose face is n't buried up Team Bush 's dirty ass .
Anything that keeps ex-offenders from attending college makes it more likely that they will be caught in the revolving door that leads to prison .
Tens of thousands of people have been pushed in that direction since the 1990s when Congress passed a law that barred even minor drug offenders from receiving federal education aid .
The law applies even to offenses so minor that they are normally punished by probation , a small fine or community service .
Typical of drug war propaganda , the word " drugs " is used as much as possible so that the specific drugs are not part of the discussion .
The word is intended to mean " bad things " and is specifically overused to cover up the fact that 90 % of all " anti-drug " efforts in the country are focused on cannabis , the plant many folks want relegalized .
People have been working hard for relegalization in this country and the overview of that history tells a story we know all - too - well today : the GOP does what it wants and the Democratic party plays right along , fabulously unconcerned about you or me .
There have been Dems who try to fix this issue , Barny Frank and Dennis Kucinish among them , but they wield little power and too many Dems are still stuck in the Nixon - era propaganda talking points about this useful plant .
So people have worked hard to get issues on ballots and usually when the issue gets on the ballot , it passes .
Not always , but it's got a better batting average than Barry Bonds and has achieved it solely by following the rules of this country .
Just recently , people in Denver Colorado sent the message to the city : Denver Voters Again Tell Police To Back Off On Pot .
This recent vote is the second time they have sent this message to city leaders , who are invariably reefer - mad adherents to this arcane law .
The vote was the third marijuana initiative sponsored by Safer Alternative for Enjoyable Recreation and its outspoken leader , Mason Tvert .
He noted the initiative passed despite opposition from editorials in The Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News as well as from city officials .
" Everyone said vote ' no ' and the people of this city still voted ' yes , " ' Tvert said .
" I think that sends a clear message that people want change . "
More from The Denver Post
More than half of Denver voters appeared to favor an initiative making marijuana the city 's lowest law enforcement priority , according to early ballot returns .
If the result holds , the mayor must now appoint a panel to monitor how marijuana cases are handled by the police and city prosecutors and issue a report .
****
Tvert says the measure was motivated by what he says are overzealous police who continue to cite adults for possessing under an ounce of marijuana despite a law that allows simple pot possession in Denver .
Denver police and prosecutors say possessing marijuana still violates state and federal law .
Police , Prosecutors and Republicans are the super - powerful minority that still cling desperately to the old reefer madness fictions , partly because some of them really are dumber than a bag of hammers and they actually believe all the propaganda .
It 's a shame , too .
Many of the people in this sad demographic are wealthy , well - educated and politically powerful , but where reality - based knowledge about the cannabis should be there 's nothing but ignorance , bullshit , and superstitious thinking .
And that 's a giant part of why cannabis is still illegal in this country .
Other countries have a better relationship with reality
Elsewhere in the world , the Netherlands is extending their medical marijuana program another 5 years :
AMSTERDAM , Netherlands :
The Dutch Health Ministry announced plans Wednesday to extend its experimental medical marijuana program for five years , despite setbacks .
Under the program , launched in 2003 , standardized marijuana is grown by government - licensed growers under controlled conditions and sold by prescription in pharmacies .
ut few patients , even armed with a doctor 's prescription , bought the regulated weed since they could buy it at a third of the price in " coffee shops , " where it remains illegal but tolerated if sold in small amounts .
The medical marijuana plan was meant to allow the growers licensed by the ministry 's Bureau for Medical Cannabis to build a customer base and eventually take over production from illegal growers .
It also would give companies a chance to develop and register cannabis - based prescription drugs .
My .... how advanced .
Working WITH Big Pharma to HELP it develop MEDICINES from cannabis , versus the mouth - breathing , knuckle - dragging abject stupidity of our " system " where the cops and DEA act as profit enforcers for Big Pharma , a gigantic contributor to the GOP .
They fight medical marijuana laws tooth and nail .
The DEA routinely draws weapons on sick people who are struggling to adhere to medical marijuana aws that already exist in this country .
The GOP holds reefer madness dearly close to its heart .
The Democrats job is to make sure the GOP gets what it wants and they have performed beautifully .
They have turned into to stellar supporters for the GOP 's anti-America agenda .
( Some of our Democratic leaders are so supportive of the GOP I await THEIR homosexual bathroom scandals . )
Wo n't legalizing marijuana cause an explosion of crime ?
Some informationally - challenged Americans ask this question : " What happens when marijuana is legal ?
Will their be an explosion of crime ? "
No , folks , there wo n't be " an explosion of crime " .
Not that I expect the informationally - challenged to grasp this , but quite the opposite will occur .
But here goes , anyway .....
Marijuana prohibition CAUSES and CREATES the crime that the propagandists report as caused by the plant itself .
Why ?
It 's simple .
Making pot illegal makes it worth a LOT of money .
The harsher the enforcement of the laws , the more money there is to be made in trafficking .
The higher the profits the worse the character of those who want to make them .
Like this school bus driver who appears to have been dealing weed from her friggin' bus !
A school - bus driver who was hailed as a hero six years ago when she saved the lives of 22 children after a traffic accident was arrested Tuesday afternoon after authorities said they found marijuana and a loaded handgun on her bus .
Cheryl Mooring , 52 , of Spanaway , was arrested just before picking up children at the end of the school day , said Pierce County sheriff 's spokesman Ed Troyer .
He said her blood - alcohol content was above the state 's legal limit of .08 percent .
****
Deputies found a loaded .40 - caliber handgun underneath Mooring 's seat and several packaged baggies of marijuana stashed in the bus first - aid kit , Troyer said .
The arrest came from an " anonymous tip " .
If cannabis was legal and regulated - as the far more dangerous and addictive tobacco and alcohol are - then this lady would not likely be exposing herself to such stiff penaties .
The profit from selling marijuana and other illegal drugs is the attraction to this activity .
The harsher the enforcement the riskier the trafficking and the higher the profits .
And it encourages real criminals to get involved when there is serious money to be made .
I will be interested to learn the outcome of this investigation , to see what was the motivation for her to carry weed and a huge handgun on a bus filled with children .
Tobacco far worse for teens than cannabis smoking
Where is the outrage about teen tobacco use ?
Why are n't people turning 20 shades of purple about teen - aged tobacco smoking ?
Because they have not been trained to .
There is no similar effort to dissuade teens from somking tobacco .
There 's some , but it is in no way comparable to reefer madness .
The informationally - challenged have been trained via years of reefer mad propaganda ( which they accept without question , thus my pejorative term " informationally - challenged ) raise the whine " What about the Childrennnnnnnnn ? " .
It 's such a shrill whine , but let 's play along .
Not that science matters in America anymore , but , according to a recent study , Cigarettes are More of a Drag on Teens than Marijuana .
This is reported in the Scientific American , for what that 's worth :
Reefer madness ?
Apparently not , according to a new Swiss survey of students that concludes teenagers who smoke pot function better than those who also use tobacco .
In addition , researchers at the University of Lausanne report in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , teens who only use marijuana are apparently more socially driven and have no more psychosocial problems than those who neither smoke nor toke .
Oh .. that stupid " Gateway Theory " championed by many , many informationally - challenged people as well as those with a vested interest in maintaining the propaganda meme , gets smashed again , not that it matters :
" The gateway theory hypothesizes that the use of legal drugs ( tobacco and alcohol ) is the previous step to cannabis consumption , " the authors wrote .
" However , recent research also indicates that cannabis use may precede or be simultaneous to tobacco use and that , in fact , its use may reinforce cigarette smoking or lead to nicotine addiction independently of smoking status . "
Again we see tobacco as far more of a concern than cannabis , which is Reality .
There 's no " cause and effect " to suggest that pot smoking leads to dying in an alley with a dirty needle in one 's arm , the hallmark of the Gateway Theory proponents .
But it does appear that cannabis smoking can be precipitated by and further encourage tobacco smoking .
Here 's another report on the same study
The authors of the study are quick to point out that the study is not meant to trivialize the use of marijuana among teens .
However , some of the stereotypical behaviors associated with marijuana use among teens could not be validated in this study .
" Stereotypical " has to men " those reported in the propaganda literature " .
They could not replicate any of the things all the scare - mongering asserts will happen .
Continuing :
Dr. J.C. Suris and colleagues at the University of Lausanne Switzerland analyzed Swiss students aged 16 to 20 years .
A total of 5,263 students were included in the study , including 455 who smoked marijuana only , 1,703 who smoked both tobacco and marijuana and 3,105 who abstained from both substances .
The study found that students who smoked marijuana only tended to be male , play sports , live with both parents and have good grades .
They also were less likely to have been drunk in the past 30 days and most had not smoked marijuana more than once during the past 30 days .
Teens who smoke both marijuana and tobacco were shown to be at higher risk for behavioral problems pointing to a strong need for prevention and intervention .
Adolescents who smoked tobacco were more aggressive , more hyperactive , and tended to have more conduct problems upon entering the study than the adolescents who did not smoke .
Of course , this is Swiss society , not America .
American values are a tad different than those of the Swiss .
I my work with adolescents , I have had the good fortune to interact with a couple non-American teens , including one from Denmark who lamented the " immaturity " of American teens and frequently asked me " what 's wrong with them ? " .
The bottom line is that relegalization and regulation - making cannabis available just like tobacco and alcohol - is the only real choice in dealing with the cannabis plant .
Arresting 800,000
Americans per year and clogging our courts and prisons with non-violent and otherwise law - abiding Americans is fit for ridicule , if it was n't such a travesty of justice and such an affront to basic common sense .
Education is the key
From tobacco to heroin and unsafe sex , the answers to such issues lay in adequate and effective education .
To me there is no real excuse for people to start smoking something addictive like tobacco or using heroin .
Both create disease for the body .
Period .
Not enough has been done to educate people about tobacco or heroin .
In both cases the US government has a vested interest in continuing to hook young people onto these substances .
Above - board , the US Federal Government has historically been deeply invested in tobacco profits .
Under the radar the CIA is known to have trafficked heroin to create clandestine monies for God Only Knows What .
I am all for damaging all these business investments and increasing the overall health of the nation .
The new , emerging Democratic Party should be too .
Update [ 2007 - 11-8 15:55:19 by xxdr zombiexx ] :
This is big , too .

CBS : Critics say Drew Carey 's career wo n't go up in smoke due to pot campaign
When Bob Barker was hosting the venerable television game show The Price is Right , he would end each program by encouraging viewers to make sure their pets were spayed or neutered .
Now , CBS reports , the show 's new host , comedian Drew Carey , has taken up a somewhat more controversial cause -- medical marijuana .
" People that need it should be able to get it , " Carey argues in a video produced by the libertarian Reason Foundation .
In the video , Carey tours a California pharmacy that dispenses neatly packaged medical marijuana .
" Ah. Smell that smell ?
It 's the smell of freedom , " says Carey as he enters the pharmacy .
However , the marijuana is available by prescription only , and Carey himself does not actually smoke any in the video .
Carey 's efforts on behalf of medical marijuana are not expected to cause any problems for his relationship with The Price is Right .
" Most of the audience sort of believes that most of the entertainers are a little bit out there and wacky anyway , the fact that he 's advocating medical marijuana is actually a fairly reasonable stance that people in the medical community would be in favor of , " said CBS entertainment contributor Jess Cagle .
" wacky " but reasonable .
Only in America , eh ?
The Smell of Freedom
Update [ 2007 - 11-9 7:51:12 by xxdr zombiexx ] : I was surprised to see this still in the rec list today - the next day ( 11/9/07 ) .
It 's very clear this is a vibrant issue that enjoys far more support than one would ever imagine .
The naysayers and other unsupportive , negative perspectives are a small minority .
This can be done .
It can be done easily if they will just do it .
I saw yesterday that the Congress " too busy to waste time on cannabis reform " had plenty of time to draft a resolution on a friggin ' baseball game .
They have time to do something more important .
More to come .
Peace out , my Friends !
Sure , I could be like the rest of the blogosphere and comment upon Microsoft ’s attempted slurping up of Yahoo !
If it goes through , it no doubt has ramifications for every single man , woman and child with a computer that accesses the internets .
But that ’s not important right now .
What is important is that NASA has decided — for the first time ever — to beam a song into space .
And even more important : they ’ve chosen the wrong song .
Whatever will the aliens think ?
So here ’s the deal :
On Monday , NASA will beam The Beatles ’ “ Across the Universe ” into the heavens , using its Deep Space Network of antennas , which is ordinarily dedicated to functions such as radioastronomy observations , or communicating with distant interplanetary probes .
There are so many things wrong with this , I do n’t even know where to begin .
So let ’s start with the song .
Not only is “ Across The Universe , ” like , the 352nd best Beatles song , it ’s not even about outer space !
If you want to be charitable , you can say that it ’s about the calming effects of mediation , but I know John Lennon acid lyrics when I hear them .
Nope , this is like the widespread appropriation of songs like “ The One I Love ” as love songs just because of the title .
I guess that it makes sense for folks to use songs like that at weddings , but NASA is supposed to be smarter .
Especially when they can google the lyrics just like I did .
Hey NASA , there is this technology called the “ internets ” — use it to read the goddamn lyrics of the songs you are using to make your big gestures !!
What really sucks about this is that there is a song which is a contemporary of “ Across The Universe ” which is absolutely perfect for being beamed via NASAs Deep Space Nine ( or whatever its called ) .
That song is , of course , the transplendent “ C.T.A. - 102 ” by The Byrds .
Check out the lyrics : :
C.T.A. 102 year over year receiving you
Signals tell us that you ’re there
We can hear them loud and clear
We just want to let you know
That we ’re ready for to go
Out into the universe , we do n’t care who ’s been there first
On a radio telescope
Science tells us that there ’s hope
Life on other planets might exist
PERFECT !
And not only is it all done up with the jangly guitar and block harmonies that made The Byrds the best band to come from 1960 ’s California ( oh yes they were ) , but the end of the song actually has the aliens listening to that exact song !!
And liking it , of course .
That ’s right : all of the jokes and scenarios that people are imagining for this were already thought of and recorded over four decades ago .
This is just the latest in a long series of indignities that The Byrds have suffered at the hands of the Beatles , which began with George Harrison stealing their guitar sound for “ A Hard Days Night ” and obviously continues to this day .
I will concede , of course , that The Beatles were in every way the superior band , and obviously one of the major cultural forces of the 20th Century — and therefore a perfect choice for a publicity stunt like this — while The Byrds — well , The Byrds wrote “ Eight Miles High , ” which is better than any single Beatles song .
Even “ She Said , She Said ” ( though just barely . )
In the end , it comes down to a single question — the one that Roger McGuinn answered when he wrote “ CTA - 102 ” : will the aliens like the song we beam to them ?
In the case of “ Across The Universe , ” that answer is an emphatic hell no !!
They ’ll be laughing at it .
They ’ll realize that it ’s just a metaphor in a situation when specifics are very much called for .
My guess is that the aliens will wonder what the frack we were thinking using an obvious drug song .
Maybe they ’ll think that we ’re all on drugs and therefore easier to conquer !
Not because we ’re all on drugs , but we used such a wussy - assed drug song for first contact !
I mean , if we are going to use a drug song from a 60s band ( because anything later would be right out , of course , since nothing musically good every happened after the 1960s ) , why not something like “ Tomorrow Never Knows , ” or “ White Light / White Heat ? ”
At least those songs might scare the aliens off .
All of that is why “ Across The Universe ” is in every way a sucky choice for the first song to be beamed into outer space , and I call upon NASA to reconsider and use “ CTA - 102 ” instead .
Either that , or “ Hey , Mr. Spaceman . ”
Bob Barr ’s Libertarian presidential campaign is poised to play a serious role in this year ’s elections , with early polls showing him taking away enough votes from Sen.
John McCain to give Democrats a chance to win states that should be safely Republican .
Polls in Georgia and North Carolina over the last two weeks show Mr. Barr winning 8 percent and 6 percent respectively of the presidential vote , and in both cases helping keep likely Democratic presidential nominee Sen.
Barack Obama within striking distance of Mr. McCain in those states — which , taken together , account for more electoral votes than Florida , Pennsylvania or Ohio .
“ Barr does throw a monkeywrench in Republican plans in states people otherwise take for granted as Republican states , ” said Matt Towery , a former political adviser to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and CEO of InsiderAdvantage , an Atlanta - based polling and political analysis firm that conducted the Georgia poll .
Mr. Towery said North Carolina and Georgia are exactly the places that Mr. Barr could put in play : both have high African - American populations that Mr. Obama can tap to boost his turnout numbers , and have conservative - leaning voters whose dissatisfaction with President Bush could lead them to a third - party candidate .
The Georgia poll , taken just before Mr. Barr secured the Libertarian nomination , gave Mr. McCain 45 percent support , Mr. Obama 35 percent and Mr. Barr 8 percent .
In North Carolina a Public Policy Polling survey released Monday found Mr. McCain at 43 percent , Mr. Obama at 40 percent and Mr. Barr at 6 percent .
The poll ’s authors said Mr. Barr ’s support appeared to come particularly from independents who previously had broken for Mr. McCain .
“ It ’s a long way until the election but the early indication is that Bob Barr ’s presence on the ballot could be a good sign for whoever ends up as the Democratic nominee , ” said Dean Debnam , president of the poll .
“ He ’s likely to siphon off more voters who would otherwise be inclined to vote for McCain than he is from Clinton or Obama . ”
Mr. Barr is a former Republican congressman from Georgia who switched to the Libertarian Party in 2006 .
He collected his new party ’s presidential nomination on the sixth ballot on May 25 .

' Wide World of Sports ' Host Dead at 86 Jim McKay , host of ABC's " Wide World of Sports " and 12 Olympics has died .
June 7 , 2008  -- Jim McKay , 86 , a longtime television sports journalist , has died of natural causes in Maryland , according to a statement from the McKay family .
McKay is best known for hosting " ABC's Wide World of Sports " and 12 Olympic Games .
McKay won numerous awards for journalism , including the George Polk Memorial Award and two Emmys -- one for his sports coverage , the other for his news reporting -- for his work at the 1972 Munich Olympics , which were tragically affected by the Black September terrorists ' attack on the Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village .
" Jim was a regular guy who wrote and spoke like a poet , " Bob Iger , president and chief executive of The Walt Disney Company , said in a statement .
" He loved sports .
To him , sports defined life -- full of drama , adventure , accomplishment and disappointment .
The thrill of victory for some , the agony of defeat for others . "
ESPN and ABC Sports president George Bodenheimer said there are " no superlatives that can adequately honor Jim McKay . "
" He meant so much to so many people , " Bodenheimer said in a statement .
" He was a founding father of sports television , one of the most respected commentators in the history of broadcasting and journalism .
" For more than 60 years he brought sports into the homes of Americans on Wide World of Sports , the Olympics and many other programs that captured the essence of the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat .
" Jim was the ultimate colleague , having helped generations of people who have now taken his mantle .
He was also a warm and devoted family man .
My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Margaret , Sean and Mary for their loss .
And I know that countless people , around the world , have been touched by this great man .
We will miss him . "
In 1968 , McKay won the first of his 13 Emmy Awards , becoming the first sports commentator to receive that honor .
His 12th Emmy , in 1988 , was not for his talents as a broadcaster but as the writer of the openings for ABC Sports ' coverage of the 1987 Indianapolis 500 , the British Open and the Kentucky Derby .
He is the only broadcaster to have won Emmys for sports and news broadcasting and for writing .
In 1990 he was the recipient of the first - ever Lifetime Achievement in Sports award from the Academy .
In 1992 he was the recipient of an Emmy Award in the Individual Achievement category for the ABC Sports special , " Athletes and Addiction : It 's Not a Game . "
In 1989 McKay received the Peabody Award , which is presented annually to recognize the most distinguished and meritorious public service programming rendered each year on radio and television .
McKay was the first American network sports commentator to visit mainland China .
In 1991 , he visited Cuba to interview Fidel Castro .
McKay was with " ABC's Wide World of Sports " since its inception in April 1961 .
Jim McManus ( McKay 's real name ) was born in Philadelphia on September 24 , 1921 , and moved to Baltimore when he was 15 .
He graduated from Loyola College there , then entered the United States Navy as an officer during World War II .
At the war 's conclusion , he was captain of a minesweeper .

“ Obviously you will get the archetypal geek in the basement , which I suppose is the popular image in America , but really there is a much more diverse collection of people in terms of age and professional background who play this game , and really most games , than the cultural stereotypes would suggest , ” Ms. Wheeler said .
“ And you really see that represented on this council . ”

As could perhaps be expected , European and American players arrived on the council with different concepts of how a democratically elected group should operate .
CCP mostly allowed the players to establish their own methods of procedure and publicity .
While the Europeans were largely in favor of allowing the committee to deliberate in private before announcing recommendations , the Americans favored full and total disclosure  a reflection of the different political cultures on either side of the Atlantic .
“ I do n’t think there is any question that my idea of democracy is very different from a European person ’s idea of democracy , ” said Sean Conover , a 30 - year - old computer forensics analyst from Cranford , N.J. , who as the character Darius Johnson is the leader of a powerful military alliance of more than 5,000 players called Goonswarm .
“ I think Europeans are more used to the idea that their political elites operate by different rules than everyone else , and that government officers need to be able to huddle somewhere in a private room so they can say things to each other that are different from what they say in public .
What we ’ve had to explain is that Americans have a very strong sense of fair play .
We do n’t abide things like that , and we want everything to be open .
So , yes , there has been some conflict on that level . ”
To help bridge the gap , CCP took the council on a field trip to Thingvellir , the birthplace of Icelandic democracy , where ancient tribal leaders convened to settle differences .
Making an analogy that amused the players to no end , Eyjolfur Gudmundsson , CCP ’s lead economist , declared that the players on the council had become “ the chieftains of the Internet . ”
Yet the council members came not only from different real - world cultural backgrounds but also from different political factions within the game .
Eve is much deeper than some other “ massively - multiplayer ” online games , in that players compete with one another not only in virtual combat , but also as industrialists , traders , propagandists , mercenaries and political leaders .
Niall Dologhan , for instance , a 34 - year - old public relations executive from London , plays a character named Hardin who helps lead an alliance that supports the interests of a theocratic , slave - holding race called the Amarr .
In the game world he would usually have little to do with Ankhesentapemkah , the character played by Eva Jobse , a 24 - year - old student from Zeist , the Netherlands , or with Serenity Steele , an alter ego of Shayne Smart , a 36 - year - old Internet strategy consultant from Amsterdam .
For a lot of people , the first exposure to the arguments over fair use came through a content mashup like The Grey Album .
Certainly , the availability of easily - copied digital media has raised the stakes for content owners .
But the fight over fair use has been going on for over 15 years in what 's usually considered a genteel setting : higher education .
The New York Times is reporting that a group of publishers are suing Georgia State University over the digital distribution of class reading materials in a case that may help define the fair use of digital materials .
The three publishers involved , Cambridge University Press , Oxford University Press and Sage Publications , target the academic audience .
As such , they might be considered the least likely to take on a university ; campuses supply most of the authors they publish , and their products are typically sold to the academic world .
Of course , this would n't be the first case of a group suing their audience over fair use .
The Times article points out that cases that defined fair use of classroom material date back to the early '90s , where the means of infringement was the photocopier .
Back then , private entities that prepared material for university courses were found to have infringed the copyright of publishers in duplicating their material .
A key feature of these cases , however , is that the infringers were private businesses that charged for their copying services ; many universities are not - for - profit entities .
The ease of creating and distributing digital media has also radically changed the role not only of universities , but nearly everyone involved in the process of distributing classroom materials .
Instead of farming out the creation of " course pack " material to a business , most campuses now provide server space for the material and leave it up to their faculty to decide what gets uploaded .
Many faculty simply assume that any material used in teaching constitutes fair use .
Those faculty that take copyright issues seriously have to evaluate materials through a process that can be intimidating .
One set of guidelines we found came in at 3,500 words — and that was only to determine whether faculty needed to read additional material .
Other schools have a more orderly process for identifying and paying for copyrighted material , but still may not be able to police everything distributed by their faculty .
These differences highlight a general problem that copyright holders face in the academic world : every university is distinct , and the solutions crafted during previous disputes can be hard to apply generally .
Two other trends are making the boundaries of fair use harder to determine .
Some faculty are making it difficult to draw a line between classroom and copyrighted material by using their lectures as the basis for a copyrighted work .
The second issue relates to the skyrocketing cost of textbooks and tuition .
Faculty face serious ethical issues when they need to decide whether to compel their students to spend $ 100 simply to have access to a few chapters of a large text .
It 's entirely possible that this case will never be decided , as many previous scuffles between publishers and universities have been settled before trials .
Assuming it does make it through a trial , however , it may provide a significant opportunity for courts to weigh in on the general principles of fair use .
Further reading :
The Library Journal provides a discussion of prior legal wrangling between universities and publishers .
WASHINGTON  After months of wrangling , Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress struck a deal on Thursday to overhaul the rules on the government ’s wiretapping powers and provide what amounts to legal immunity to the phone companies that took part in President Bush ’s warrantless eavesdropping program after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The deal , expanding the government ’s powers in some key respects , would allow intelligence officials to use broad warrants to eavesdrop on foreign targets and conduct emergency wiretaps without court orders on American targets for a week if it is determined important national security information would be lost otherwise .
If approved , as appears likely , it would be the most significant revision of surveillance law in 30 years .
The agreement would settle one of the thorniest issues in dispute by providing immunity to the phone companies in the Sept. 11 program as long as a federal district court determines that they received legitimate requests from the government directing their participation in the warrantless wiretapping operation .
With some AT&T and other telecommunications companies now facing some 40 lawsuits over their reported participation in the wiretapping program , Republican leaders described this narrow court review on the immunity question as a mere “ formality . ”
All these photographs will be showcased in a major exhibition at the National Theatre 's Lyttelton foyer on London 's South Bank which finishes on Sunday 1st September .
This year we received just over 12,500 entries , an almost fifty percent increase on 2011 , and our distinguished jury made their edit of 150 of the best news and sports photographs taken in 2011 & 2012 .
Our aim is to demonstrate once again that even in an age of rolling television news , internet and satellite communication , the traditional still image burns the keenest , fastest impression on the public conscience and is the most effective way to show the world the world as it really is .
From the desk of John Hodgman
Look , I understand where you ’re coming from .
You are a person of your time : an incurious age when action and certainty ( what we in scientific circles call “ jockism ” ) seem to outvalue nerdish doubt and curiosity .
I myself am author of a book of COMPLETE WORLD KNOWLEDGE , entitled The Areas of My Expertise .
As the resident expert on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart , there is little left out there in the dark that puzzles me , from nuclear weapons to lice .
And while I am not actually a human supercomputer / mentat , I do play one on television , and I understand the temptation to believe that you have all the answers .
But consider William Thomson , the First Baron Kelvin .
In 1900 , most thinkers agreed that almost every mystery of the physical world had been more or less revealed .
The small questions that remained , primarily the properties of light and black - body radiation , were described by Kelvin as twin clouds in the otherwise clear sky of knowledge – perhaps unfathomable , ultimately trivial , and if you looked at them the right way , shaped like fluffy white kittens .
Of course , when acted upon by more curious minds , those clouds would gather into thunderheads .
Solving the mysteries of light ’s behavior led to relativity , and understanding radiation pointed the way to quantum mechanics .
Not even Lord Kelvin , sequestered as always in his protective , absolute - zero chamber , would be safe from the resulting tempest of progress and wrenching change .
Now it is 106 years later , and how much more we know still !
We would be like gods to the supposed wise men of Lord Kelvin ’s age , as I learned the hard way during my time travels .
I lived among those savage “ scientists , ” with their beastly monocles , and allowed them to fetch me grapes and build statues in my likeness .
And I quickly became what most people and societies become when they believe they know everything : incurious , self - satisfied , flabby , and prone to wearing tunics and lounging on grassy lawns while watching those idiot scientists fight with knives for my amusement .
Now , I agree that sounds awesome , but in reality it was terrible .
For one , all the scientists wanted to talk about was those Mac ads .
For two , I came to suspect they were planning to eat me .
And also , I became less human .
Because in a world where there are no more grails or dragons ( thanks a lot , hippies ) , it is questing after big answers that defines and propels us as a species .
Included in this issue are just some of the koanlike brain busters that continue to vex even our most advanced thinkers and maga - zine writers , mysteries such as …
How does life arise from nonlife ?
What is sleep and why do we do it ?
What is the universe made of ?
Why is time different from other dimensions ?
And that old saw , what is Earth ’s core made of ?
( Hint : It ’s only partially nougat , smarty - pants . )
Later , I will give you the rest of the answers in a special BIG ANSWERS issue I am compiling that will be printed upside down and released at the end of the world .
For while there may be legitimate , eternal mysteries out there that are beyond our comprehension , history , in fact , shows us that if we do ask questions , we are likely to find the answers eventually – which is perhaps more frightening than ignorance .
As Lord Kelvin learned the hard way , it ’s the answers to big questions that will redraw our vision of the world , elevate us in it , or even erase us .
And that is why , despite what they tell you , being curious is the bravest human act , aside from skydiving .
But otherwise I agree with you :
The new fonts are awesome .

The Big Questions
What ’s at Earth ’s Core ?
We know that at the center of the planet , about 4,000 miles down , sits a solid ball of iron the size of the moon .
We also know that we ’re standing on about 1,800 miles of rock , which forms Earth ’s crust and mantle .
But what ’s in between the mantle and the iron ball ?
A churning ocean of liquid of some sort , but scientists are n’t certain what it ’s made of or how it reacts to the stuff around it .
We ’re confident there ’s a lot of iron in this ocean .
But what else ?
Based on what researchers understand about the pressure , temperature , and density of materials down there , some maintain that the core also contains lots of hydrogen and sulfur .
Raymond Jeanloz of UC
Berkeley believes that another component is oxygen , which comes from rocks in the part of the mantle that borders the liquid core .
Knowing more about the molten concoction would give scientists clues about how Earth formed and how heat and convection affect plate tectonics .
More information could help solve another mystery , too : whether , as many researchers suspect , the inner core is growing .
If so , it could eventually overtake the molten metal surrounding it , throwing off Earth ’s magnetic field .

Is time an illusion ?
Plato argued that time is constant – it ’s life that ’s the illusion .
Galileo shrugged over the philos - ophy of time and figured out how to plot it on a graph so he could get on with the important physics .
Albert Einstein said that time is just another dimension , a fourth one to go along with the up - down , side - side , forward - back we move through every day .
Our understanding of time , Einstein said , is based on its relationship to our environment .
Weirdly , the faster you travel , the slower time moves .
The most radical interpretation of his theory : Past , present , and future are merely figments of our imagination , constructs built by our brains so that everything does n’t seem to happen at once .
Einstein ’s conception of unified spacetime works better on graph paper than in the real world .
Time is n’t like those other dimensions – for one thing , we move only one way within it .
“ What ’s needed is not to make the notion of time and general relativity work or to go back to the notion of absolute time , but to invent something radically new , ” says Lee Smolin , a physicist at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo , Ontario .
Somebody is going to get it right eventually .
It ’ll just take time .

How does a fertilized egg become a human ?
Imagine that you place a 1 - inch - wide black cube in an empty field .
Suddenly the cube makes copies of itself – two , four , eight , 16 .
The proliferating cubes begin to form structures – enclosures , arches , walls , tubes .
Some of the tubes turn into wires , PVC pipes , structural steel , wooden studs .
Sheets of cubes become wallboard and wood paneling , carpet and plate - glass windows .
The wires begin connecting themselves into a network of immense complexity .
Eventually , a 100 - story skyscraper stands in the field .
That ’s basically the process a fertilized cell undergoes beginning with the moment of conception .
How did that cube know how to make a skyscraper ?
How does a cell know how to make a human ( or any other mammal ) ?
Biologists used to think that the cellular proteins somehow carried the instructions .
But now proteins look more like pieces of brick and stone – useless without a building plan and a mason .
The instructions for how to build an organism must be written in a cell ’s DNA , but no one has figured out exactly how to read them .

What happened to the Neanderthals ?
They were our cousins , our hominid cousins .
They looked like us , they walked like us , they may have even thought like us .
So why did the Neanderthals disappear , while we Homo sapiens dug in and stayed ?
Ever since the first Neanderthal bones were discovered 150 years ago in Germany ’s Neander Valley , paleoanthropologists have sought to understand what could possibly have destroyed the once - thriving and widely dispersed species of prehistoric human .
By most measures , the Neanderthals were the equal of our direct ancestors , the fully modern out - of - Africa characters often called Cro-Magnons , with whom the Neanderthals coexisted for thousands of years .
Like our forebears , Neanderthals were supple sojourners , happily colonizing parts of Africa , Europe , and Asia .
They stood upright , skillfully sculpted and wielded stone tools , and buried their dead with pomp and hope .
They were slightly larger and more muscular than their Cro-Magnon counterparts , and their brains were bigger , too .
Yet by about 30,000 years ago , the Neanderthals had vanished , leaving Cro-Magnons as the sole survivors of the tangled Hominina tribe .
Moreover , while Neanderthals may well have been capable of interbreeding with Cro-Magnons , recent DNA analysis has revealed no signs that such Stone Age Capulet - Montague mergers occurred .
Some scientists have attributed the Neanderthals ’ demise to chronic disease , pointing out that many Neanderthal skeletal remains show signs of arthritis and other bone disorders .
Other people have wondered whether genocide was to blame .
Perhaps the Cro-Magnons systematically exterminated their competitors , just as chimpanzees have been observed hunting down and killing every last member of a neighboring chimp troupe .
Another , more recent , hypothesis is that Homo sapiens outcompeted Homo neanderthalensis because of a difference in their economic systems .
Reporting in the December issue of Current Anthropology , Steven Kuhn and Mary Stiner of the University of Arizona wrote that the archaeological record suggests all Neanderthals – male , female , adult , child – focused their efforts on “ obtaining large terrestrial game . ”
In other words , they were all hunters .
The Cro-Magnons , by contrast , appear to have divided labor along more or less sexual lines , with men doing most of the big - game killing , women and children gathering tubers and other plant foods , and everybody sharing the flesh and fruits of their efforts .
By adopting this sort of specialization of labor , the researchers speculate , Homo sapiens likely proved more efficient and flexible than Neanderthals and were able to expand their population more rapidly .
In other words , at least according to this new theory put forward by Stiner and Kuhn , the Neanderthals were n’t felled by a pathogen or a primordial Slobodan Milosevic .
They were done in by the bedrock family values of Fred and Wilma Flintstone .

Why do we sleep ?
It ’s a catchy phrase :
You snooze , you lose .
But cutting out those 40 winks would be a bad idea .
All mammals sleep , and if they ’re deprived of shut - eye they die [ PDF ] – faster than if they ’re denied food .
But no one really knows why .
Obviously , sleep rests the body .
But watching TV does that , too .
The answer must lie in the noggin .
One leading theory says that while we ’re awake , a substance builds up in the brain ( or gets depleted ) and sleep removes ( or replenishes ) it .
That makes sense .
For part of the night , the brain idles in an energy - conserving state called slow - wave sleep .
Freed from the duties of consciousness , it can focus on cleanup .
The problem with this idea is that another portion of each night , about a quarter , is given to REM sleep [ PDF ] , during which the brain is anything but idle .
REM stands for rapid eye movement , and it corresponds with vivid dreams , suggesting that it plays a role in consolidating memories .
But there ’s probably more to it :
Though antidepressants suppress REM sleep , patients taking them suffer no memory impairment .
In any case , it ’s clear that pillow time serves a critical purpose .
Bad things – like some 100,000 traffic accidents a year , not to mention uncounted instances of calling your spouse by your ex’s name – happen when we do n’t get enough z’s .
At some point , someone ’s going to have to dream up a reason .

Where did life come from ?
Natural selection explains how organisms that already exist evolve in response to changes in their environment .
But Darwin ’s theory is silent on how organisms came into being in the first place , which he considered a deep mystery .
What creates life out of the inanimate compounds that make up living things ?
No one knows .
How were the first organisms assembled ?
Nature has n’t given us the slightest hint .
If anything , the mystery has deepened over time .
After all , if life began unaided under primordial conditions in a natural system containing zero knowledge , then it should be possible – it should be easy – to create life in a laboratory today .
But determined attempts have failed .
International fame , a likely Nobel Prize , and $ 1 million from the Gene Emergence Project await the researcher who makes life on a lab bench .
Still , no one has come close .
Experiments have created some basic materials of life .
Famously , in 1952 Harold Urey and Stanley Miller mixed the elements thought to exist in Earth ’s primordial atmosphere , exposed them to electricity to simulate lightning , and found that amino acids self - assembled in the researchers ’ test tubes .
Amino acids are essential to life .
But the ones in the 1952 experiment did not come to life .
Building - block compounds have been shown to result from many natural processes ; they even float in huge clouds in space .
But no test has given any indication of how they begin to live – or how , in early tentative forms , they could have resisted being frozen or fried by Earth ’s harsh prehistoric conditions .
Some researchers have backed the hypothesis that an unknown primordial “ soup ” of naturally occurring chemicals was able to self - organize and become animate through a natural mechanism that no longer exists .
Some advance the “ RNA first ” idea , which holds that RNA formed and lived on its own before DNA – but that does n’t explain where the RNA came from .
Others suppose life began around hot deep - sea vents , where very high temperatures and pressures cause a chemical maelstrom .
Still others have proposed that some as - yet - unknown natural law causes complexity – and that when this natural law is discovered , the origin of life will become imaginable .
Did God or some other higher being create life ?
Did it begin on another world , to be transported later to ours ?
Until such time as a wholly natural origin of life is found , these questions have power .
We ’re improbable , we ’re here , and we have no idea why .
Or how .

How can observation affect the outcome of an experiment ?
Paging Captain Obvious :
To perform a legitimate experiment , scientists must observe the results of a system in motion without influencing those results .
Turns out that ’s harder than it sounds .
In 1927 , German physicist Werner Heisenberg discovered that in the Wonderland - like subatomic realm , it is impossible to measure position and momentum simultaneously .
“ In an attempt to observe an electron or other subatomic particle using light , very short wavelengths of light are required , ” says David Cassidy , a science historian and Heisenberg expert at Hofstra University .
“ But when that light hits the electron , it knocks it all over the place like a billiard ball . ”
This can become a serious issue when you ’re working with the kind of focused , high - intensity beams found in , say , particle accelerators .
“ The more precise the momentum of the beam particles , ” Cassidy says , “ the more difficult it becomes to focus the beam . ”
The real problem , though , is what this so - called observer effect does to reality .
Do an experiment to find the fundamental unit of light and you find particles called photons .
But change the conditions of the experiment and you get waves .
Physicists have no problem with the cognitive dissonance of this “ wave - particle duality . ”
But … so … what ’s light made out of , really ?
The dichotomy raises the mind - boggling prospect that unless we observe an event or thing , it has n’t really happened , that all possible futures are quantum probability functions waiting for someone to notice them – trees falling unheard in a forest .
Maybe this article was n’t even here until you turned to this page .

How do entangled particles communicate ?
One of the zanier notions in the plenty zany world of quantum mechanics is that a pair of subatomic particles can sometimes become “ entangled . ”
This means the fate of one instantly affects the other , no matter how far apart they are .
It ’s such a bizarre phenomenon that Einstein dissed the idea in the 1930s as “ spooky action at a distance , ” saying it showed that the developing model of the atomic world needed rethinking .
But it turns out that the universe is spooky after all .
In 1997 , scientists separated a pair of entangled photons by shooting them through fiber - optic cables to two villages 6 miles apart .
Tipping one into a particular quantum state forced the other into the opposite state less than five - trillionths of a second later , or nearly 7 million times faster than light could travel between the two .
Of course , according to relativity , nothing travels faster than the speed of light – not even information between particles .
Even the best theories to explain how entanglement gets around this problem seem preposterous .
One , for example , speculates that signals are shot back through time .
Ultimately , the answer is bound to be unnerving : According to a famous doctrine called Bell ’s Inequality , for entanglement to square with relativity , either we have no free will or reality is an illusion .
Some choice .

Why do placebos work ?
Tor Wager makes his living inflicting pain .
As a psychologist at Columbia University , he zaps people with brief electric surges in order to study the placebo effect , one of the most mysterious phenomena in modern medicine .
In one recent experiment , Wager and a group of colleagues delivered harsh shocks to the wrists of 24 test subjects .
Then the researchers rubbed an inert cream on the subjects ’ wrists but told them it contained an analgesic .
When the scientists delivered the next set of shocks , eight of the subjects reported experiencing significantly less pain .
The idea that an innocuous lotion could ease the agony of an electric shock seems remarkable .
Yet placebos can be as powerful as the best modern medicine .
Studies show that between 30 and 40 percent of patients report feeling better after taking dummy pills for conditions ranging from depression to high blood pressure to Parkinson’s .
Even sham surgery can work marvels .
In a recent study , doctors at Houston ’s Veterans Affairs Medical Center performed arthroscopic knee surgery on one group of patients with arthritis , scraping and rinsing their knee joints .
On another group , the doctors made small cuts in the patients ’ knees to mimic the incisions of a real operation and then bandaged them up .
The pain relief reported by the two groups was identical .
“ As far as I know , the placebo effect has never raised the dead , ” says Howard Brody , a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch and author of a book on the subject .
“ But the vast majority of medical conditions respond to placebo at least to some degree . ”
How do placebos have such an effect ?
Nobody knows .
Studies have shown that our brains can release chemicals that mimic the activity of morphine when we ’re treated with placebo analgesics .
But only lately have researchers begun to pin down the underlying physiological mechanisms .
In his groundbreaking electrical - shock experiment , Wager used functional MRI to examine images of the brain activity of his subjects .
When a person knew a painful stimulus was imminent , the brain lit up in the prefrontal cortex , the region used for high - level thinking .
When the researchers applied the placebo cream , the prefrontal cortex lit up even brighter , suggesting the subject might be anticipating relief .
Then , when the shock came , patients showed decreased activity in areas of the brain where many pain - sensitive neurons lead .
One day , this sort of research could point toward new treatments that harness the mind to help the body .
Until then , doctors are divided on the ethics of knowingly prescribing placebos .
Some think it ’s shady to perform mock surgery or offer a patient pills that contain no active ingredients .
Yet the best doctors have always employed one form of placebo : Studies show that empathy from an authoritative yet caring physician can be deeply therapeutic .
Maybe handing out the occasional sugar pill is n’t such a bad idea .

What is the universe made of ?
Astronomers scouring the heavens with powerful telescopes can see objects that are billions of trillions of miles away .
These observations have proven essential to piecing together a fairly refined picture of the history and evolution of the cosmos .
Nevertheless , a gaping hole remains in our understanding of a basic question :
What is the universe made of ?
For more than 100 years we ’ve known about atoms , and over the past century or so we ’ve gone further and identified atomic constituents like electrons and quarks , as well as their exotic cousins – neutrinos , muons , and the like .
But there is now convincing evidence that these ingredients are a cosmic afterthought .
Current data shows that if you weighed everything in existence , these familiar particles would amount to about 5 percent of the total .
Most of the universe is composed of other stuff , which , with all of science ’s deep insights , we ’ve yet to identify .
How do we know this ?
Well , over the course of many decades , astronomers studied the motion of galaxies and the stars within them , and found that the gravity exerted by this luminous matter was insufficient to account for the way these heavenly bodies moved .
Only by positing large amounts of additional matter that does n’t give off light ( visible , x- ray , infrared , or any other kind ) and is thus invisible to telescopes , could the data be explained .
Through detailed cosmological measurements , scientists also discovered that this so - called dark matter could n’t be made of the same electrons , protons , and neutrons that make up everything with which we are familiar .
Then , in the late 1990s , two groups of astronomers , one led by Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , the other by Brian Schmidt of the Australian National University , found something even stranger .
Through observation of distant supernovas , these astronomers measured how the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time .
Because of gravity ’s relentless pull , most everyone expected that the expansion would be slowing .
But the data from both groups showed the opposite .
The expansion of the universe is speeding up .
Something must be pushing outward , and luckily Einstein 's general theory of relativity provides a ready - made candidate : A uniform , diffuse energy spread throughout space can act as an antigravity force .
Since this energy gives off no light , it ’s called dark energy .
Collectively , the observations establish that about 23 percent of the universe is dark matter and about 72 percent is dark energy .
Everything else is squeezed into the remaining few percent .
Several experiments are now under way to identify dark matter .
Scientists are searching for what they suspect is an exotic species of particle .
Some studies are looking for clues by analyzing particles bombarding Earth from space ; others , like the Large Hadron Collider , will analyze collisions between extremely fast - moving protons that have the potential to create dark matter in the lab .
We are guardedly optimistic that we ’ll be able to identify dark matter soon .
By contrast , the question of dark energy is wide open .
What is its origin ?
What determined its quantity ?
Does the amount stay constant or vary ?
These are critical questions .
Calculations show that if the amount of dark energy had been slightly larger , the universe would have blown apart so quickly that life as we know it could not exist .

What is the purpose of noncoding DNA ?
A typical human cell contains more than 6 feet of tightly cornrowed DNA .
But only about an inch of that carries the codes needed to make proteins , the day laborers of biology .
What ’s the other 71 inches ?
It ’s junk , Nobelist Sydney Brenner said after it was discovered back in the 1970s .
The name stuck , but biologists have known for a while that the junk DNA must contain treasures .
If noncoding DNA were just along for the ride , it would rapidly incorporate mutations .
But long stretches of noncoding DNA have remained basically the same for many millions of years – they must be doing something .
Now scientists are starting to speculate that proteins , and the regular DNA that creates them , are just the nuts and bolts of the system .
“ They ’re like the parts for a 757 jet sitting on the floor of a factory , ” says University of Queensland geneticist John Mattick .
The noncoding DNA is likely “ the assembly plans and control systems . ”
Unfortunately , he concludes , because we ’ve spent 30 years thinking of it as junk , we ’re just now learning how to read it .

Will forests slow global warming – or speed it up ?
Everyone knows that forests are good for the environment .
By removing carbon dioxide – the principal cause of global warming – from the air , trees grow .
And the bigger and more plentiful the trees , the more CO 2 they sequester .
This makes forests a helpful bulwark against climate change .
But despite the best carbon - eating action of our flora , the planet is heating up .
This raises the specter of a future in which , paradoxically , forests do n’t reduce climate change but – as they are destroyed – make it worse .
We do n’t know which way it will go , because we know so little about forests themselves .
Scientists estimate that up to 50 percent of all species live in forest canopies – three - dimensional labyrinths largely invisible from the ground – but virtually no one can tell you what lives in any given cubic meter of canopy , at any height , anywhere in the world .
We do n’t even have names for the most common species of trees in the Amazon .
But scientists can readily foresee the way in which these carbon killers instead become dangerous carbon spewers .
As the climate warms , many forests will become drier , putting the trees under stress .
Typically , this sets the stage for huge outbreaks of insects , which can strip trees of their leaves , killing large numbers of them .
Once dead , trees release their carbon into the air – already roughly 25 percent of the greenhouse gases pouring into the atmosphere come from forests that are burned or cut down .
Further , if they no longer exist , forests can’t absorb CO 2 anymore , and the bare ground that is exposed heats up faster – forests are like giant swamp coolers for the planet .
Will this happen ?
Hard to say .
If we do n’t know which insects are eating the leaves now , we ca n’t gauge how global warming will affect them or how they in turn might affect forests .
“ You ca n’t possibly answer more general questions about forests until you at least know what lives there , ” says Margaret Lowman , canopy scientist at New College of Florida .
“ It ’s more than just giving names to things .
We need to know what ’s common and what ’s rare , and what these species are doing , before we can go to the next level , which is to try to see the interaction between forests and Earth ’s climate . ” – Richard Preston , author of the upcoming The Wild Trees

What happens to information in a black hole ?
Inside a black hole , gravity is so intense that neither matter nor energy can escape .
But in 1975 , Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking said that something does escape : random particles now known as “ Hawking radiation . ”
So if black holes eat organized matter – chock - full of information – and then spit out random noise , where does the information go ?
Hawking said it gets locked up inside as the black hole eventually evaporates , destroying the information in the process .
Which creates a paradox .
Because the rules of physics say information , like matter and energy , ca n’t be destroyed .
Hawking was confident .
He convinced his super - genius counterpart at Caltech , physicist Kip Thorne , that he was right – but Thorne ’s colleague John Preskill remained skeptical .
So they made a bet : Hawking and Thorne said the singularity at the heart of a black hole destroyed information ; Preskill said “ nuh -uh . ”
Then , in 2004 , Hawking reversed his position and decided that things that fall into a singularity are n’t lost ; their information does leak out , though no one , except maybe Hawking himself , can explain why or how .
He presented Preskill with a baseball encyclopedia from which , presumably , information can be retrieved at will .
Preskill accepted only grudgingly .
“ Even if you ’re Stephen Hawking , it ’s possible to be wrong twice , ” he says .

What causes ice ages ?
Scientists know that small - scale ice ages occur every 20,000 to 40,000 years and that massive ones happen every 100,000 years or so .
They just do n’t know why .
The current working theory – first proposed in 1920 by Serbian engineer Milutin Milankovitch – is that irregularities in Earth ’s orbit change how much solar energy it absorbs , resulting in sudden ( well , geologically speaking ) cooling .
While this neatly fits the timing of short - term events , there ’s still a big problem .
Over the past few decades , studies have shown that orbital fluctuations affect solar energy by 1 percent or less – far too little to produce massive climate shifts on their own .
“ The mystery is , what is the amplification factor ? ” says University of Michigan geologist and climatologist Henry Pollack .
“ What takes a small amount of solar energy change and produces a large amount of glaciation ? ”
Studies of ice and seabed cores reveal that temperature rise and fall is heavily correlated with changes in greenhouse - gas concentrations .
But it ’s a chicken - and - egg problem .
Are CO 2 rises and falls a cause of climate change or an effect ?
If they are a cause , what initiates the change ?
Figuring this out could tell us a great deal about the current global warming problem and how it might be solved .
But as Matthew Saltzman , a geologist at Ohio State puts it , “ We need to know why greenhouse gases fluctuated in prehuman times , and we just do n’t . ” – John Hockenberry , WIRED contributing editor

How does the brain calculate movement ?
All of science , it seems , wants to know how brains give animals complex motor skills .
Robotics , physics , neuro - physiology , and medicine are just a few of the disciplines studying the topic .
The paradox is that brains – even large human brains – are notoriously slow by processing standards :
Set your hand on a hot plate and it takes full milliseconds to feel the burn .
So how does the same gooey substance simultaneously acquire visual data , calculate positional information , and gauge trajectory to let a lizard ’s tongue snatch a fly , a dog ’s mouth catch a Frisbee , or a hand catch a falling glass ?
“ With the thousands of muscles in the body , the motor cortex clearly is n’t ‘ thinking ’ in any sense about movement , ” says UC San Diego neuroscientist Patricia Churchland .
According to Stanford University ’s Krishna Shenoy , the brain seems to create an internal model of the physical world , then , like some super - sophisticated neural joystick , traces intended movements onto this model .
“ But it ’s all in a code that science has yet to crack , ” he says .
Whatever that code is , it ’s not about size .
“ Even a cat ’s brain can modify the most complicated motions while executing them . ” – John Hockenberry

Why do the poles reverse ?
Almost 800,000 years ago , compasses would have pointed south .
A little further back , they would have pointed north .
Evidence for such reversals comes from lava flows and cracks in the ocean floor , places where newly formed rock makes a record of the magnetic polarity .
We know that as Earth spins , the liquid metal in its molten core churns , generating an electro - magnetic field .
We also know that shifts in the movement of the core can alter the polarity of that field and that it takes about 7,000 years for the orientation to flip - flop once the process of reversal begins – something that happens on average two or three times every million years .
But no one knows how it works .
Some scientists believe the poles migrate slowly from one end to the other ; some theorize that the magnetic field shuts down and then reemerges with opposite polarity .
As for what triggers the event , experts have suggested that a huge impact – say , a giant meteor – could create a disturbance in the core .
But research by Gary Glatzmaier , a planetary science professor at UC Santa Cruz , shows that a violent catalyst is n’t needed .
So why does pole reversal occur ?
“ That ’s like asking , why do hurricanes start ? ” he says .
“ Well , they ’re always trying to , and sometimes the conditions are just right . ” – Geoffrey Gagnon

How does the brain produce consciousness ?
That slab of meat in your skull – a 3 - pound walnut of wetware – somehow puts the you in you .
Nobody really knows how .
Philosophers since Plato have pondered the issue .
And probing the relationship between mind and body was the central goal of psychology until behaviorists closed the door on mind in the early 20th century and focused on observable actions .
But only recently have scientists tried to tackle consciousness , spurred by new tools like functional MRI and PET scans that can augment traditional clinical research by showing brain activity .
Already , however , these researchers find themselves haggling over familiar questions .
Is consciousness merely wakefulness ?
No , we ’re conscious when we dream .
Is it our sense of personal identity ?
Yes , but surely it ’s also the stream of words and images that runs through what William James called the “ extended present , ” the immediate workspace of our minds .
It ’s perception , but it ’s also reflection – summoning up visual and verbal constructions , imaginary or real .
It ’s simulation , mentally walking ourselves through situations before we face them , learning and practicing , hoping to avert pratfalls .
No surprise , then , given this confusion , that scientific theories on consciousness are all over the map .
Antonio Damasio , a neurologist and neuroscientist at the University of Southern California who studies brain - damaged patients , speculates that self - awareness evolved in humans as a regulatory mechanism , a way for the brain to understand what is going on with the body .
He calls “ the coming of the sense of self into the world of the mental ” a “ turning point in the long history of life . ”
Caltech ’s Christof Koch , who studies vision as the starting point for mind , believes that people have specific “ consciousness neurons . ”
And Bernard Baars of the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego suggests that consciousness is a controlling gateway to unconscious mechanisms such as working memory , word meanings , visual memory , and learning .
Some philosophers still argue that consciousness is too subjective to explain , or that it is the irreducible result of matter organized in a specific way .
That philosophic black - boxing is probably more nostalgic than scientific , a clinging to the idea of a spirit or soul .
Without that , after all , we ’re just organisms – more complex , but no less predictable , than dung beetles .
But scientists live to reduce the seemingly irreducible , and sentimentality is off - limits in the lab .
Understanding consciousness means finding the biophysical mechanisms that generate it .
Somewhere behind your eyes , that meat becomes the mind .

Why is fundamental physics so messy ?
When the job description calls for reverse - engineering the universe , the pool of successful applicants will naturally include enough self - impressed overachievers to make second - degree ego burn a hazard of the trade .
But even the leading researchers in theoretical particle physics , the most headstrong of the scientific elite , are humbled by their failure to figure out why the cosmos is such a mathematically elegant mess .
The equations themselves are lovely , describing how a baseball arcs parabolically between earth and sky or how an electron jumps around a nucleus or how a magnet pulls a pin .
The ugliness is in the details .
Why does the top quark weigh roughly 40 times as much as the bottom quark and , even worse , thousands of times more than the up quark and down quark combined ?
Maddeningly , the proton weighs almost , but not exactly , the same as its counterpart , the neutron .
And was n’t the electron enough ?
Did we really need its two fat cousins , the muon and the tau ?
It ’s as though some software engineer crafted a beautiful , bugless operating system – the laws of physics – and then fed it with random data , the output from a lava lamp , or moths bashing at a window screen .
Garbage in , garbage out , generating the weird , starry heap of a universe we call home .
Optimists hope the randomness is actually pseudo - random – complexity in disguise , with The Algorithm at the core of everything , churning out the details , demanding that things be what they be .
The bet is that this codex lies tangled somewhere inside superstring theory .
Deep within the quarks , face - to - face with the universal machine language , are tiny snippets of something – no one really knows what – called strings and branes .
They wiggle around in their 10 or so dimensions and conjure up the universe , this universe , with a spec sheet about as symmetrical as a bingo card .
Superstring theory turns out to be more complex than the universe it is supposed to simplify .
Research suggests there may be 10500 universes … or 10500 regions of this universe , each ruled by different laws .
The truths that Newton , Einstein , and dozens of lesser lights have uncovered would be no more funda-mental than the municipal code of Nairobi , Kenya , or Terre Haute , Indiana .
Physicists would just be geographers of some accidental terrain .
Things might look brighter next year , when the Large Hadron Collider – the biggest scientific project ever – should be running full blast , using superconducting magnets to smash matter hard enough to break through the floor of reality .
Physicists hope that down in the cellar they ’ll find the Higgs boson – skulking in the dark like a centipede , furtively giving the other particles their variety of masses .
Or maybe they ’ll just find more junk .
If so , the search will probably be over for now , placed on hold for the next civilization with the temerity to believe that people , pawns in the ultimate chess game , are smart enough to figure out the rules .

How doth human language evolve ?
Lots of animals make noise ; much of it even conveys information .
But for sheer complexity , for developed syntax and grammar , and for the ability to articulate abstract concepts , you ca n’t beat human speech .
MIT linguist Noam Chomsky and Harvard experimental psychologist Steven Pinker say it ’s genetic .
Pinker theorizes that language emerged about 200,000 years ago , when early humans who were efficient communicators were more likely to pass on their genes .
( Less - than - efficient communicators were more likely to scream incoherently – instead of imparting an escape plan – before being devoured by a saber - toothed tiger . )
A little more evidence : People with particular genetic defects have specific difficulties with speech and grammar .
Other scientists argue that spoken words are actually an outgrowth of other human skills , such as planning , memory , and logic .
“ There is no ‘ language gene , ’ ” says Luc Steels , a computer scientist at the Free University of Brussels in Belgium .
“ Language was a cultural breakthrough , like writing . ”
Steels built robots with a set of general intelligence traits but without a language module in their software , and they developed grammar and syntax systems similar to those of human language .
Blame neuroscientists for the controversy .
The parts of the brain thought to be responsible for language are as well – understood as the rest of the brain , which is to say : not so much .

Why ca n’t we predict the weather ?
A few years ago , weather forecasts were totally unreliable beyond a couple of days ; today better computer models make them accurate as far as a week out .
That ’s fine for figuring out how to pack for a business trip or whether you need to rent a big tent for the wedding reception .
The trouble starts when you want to build a computer model to predict the weather over decades or centuries .
In 1961 , a meteorologist named Edward Lorenz was running a computerized weather simulation and decided to round a few decimal places off one of the parameters .
The tiny tweak completely changed weather patterns .
This became known as the butterfly effect : A butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil sets off a tornado in Texas .
Lorenz ’s shortcut helped launch chaos theory and sparked an obsession among meteorologists with feeding as - perfect - as - possible data into their models in an attempt to lengthen their forecast window .
But even refining precision does n’t get us to long - term prediction .
For that , climatologists need to understand boundary conditions , like the interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans .
The goal , says Louis Uccellini , director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction , is to model Earth as a single climate system .
Then we can figure out what ’ll happen to it next .

Why do n’t we understand turbulence ?
An airplane ’s sudden loss of lift , liquid fuel igniting inside a rocket engine , blood clotting in an artificial heart valve – turbulence can be deadly .
When a liquid or gas moves smoothly , it ’s easy to go with the flow .
But change certain conditions – speed , viscosity , surrounding space – and the orderly current dissolves into whirling chaos .
If we could model the physics of turbulent flow in software , we could use the model ’s output to design safer , more - energy - efficient machines .
The trouble is complexity .
When a stream of water or air goes turbulent , groups of molecules form vortices of widely varying sizes that interact in seemingly random ways .
To determine the outcome , we ’d have to measure the initial conditions to an impractical degree of precision .
And in any case , tracking a zillion particles is beyond the reach of any conceivable computer .
If we ca n’t predict how a given turbulent system will behave , at least we can simplify it enough to zero in on statistical likelihoods .
The key is the transition zone : the precise spot where smooth flow breaks down .
Here , chaos theory describes the proliferation of whorls , while the science of cellular automata , which imposes a grid over reality , reduces complex interactions to a limited number of simple equations .
These mathematical tricks do n’t bring turbulence to heel , but they do get engineers close enough to make reasonably sure your plane touches down on time … and in one piece .

Is the universe actually made of information ?
Humans have talked about atoms since the time of the ancients , and ever - smaller fundamental particles of matter followed .
But no one even conceived of bits until the middle of the 20th century .
The bit is a fundamental particle , too , but of different stuff altogether : information .
It is not just tiny , it is abstract – a flip - flop , a yes - or - no .
Now that scientists are finally starting to understand information , they wonder whether it ’s more fundamental than matter itself .
Perhaps the bit is the irreducible kernel of existence ; if so , we have entered the information age in more ways than one .
The quantum pioneer John Archibald Wheeler , perhaps the last surviving collaborator of both Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr , poses this conundrum in oracular monosyllables : “ It from bit . ” For Wheeler , it is both an unanswered question and a working hypothesis , the idea that information gives rise , as he writes , to “ every it – every particle , every field of force , even the spacetime continuum itself . ”
This is another way of fathoming the role of the observer , the quantum discovery that the outcome of an experiment is affected , or even determined , when it is observed .
“ What we call reality , ” Wheeler writes coyly , “ arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes - no questions . ”
He adds , “ All things physical are information - theoretic in origin , and this is a participatory universe . ”
Earlier generations would not have been able to imagine information as so… meaty .
How could this abstract quality be substantial enough – enough of a thing – to be the substrate of all existence ?
Its newly powerful status began to emerge in 1948 , when Claude Shannon at Bell Labs invented information theory .
His scientific framework introduced the bit , defined concepts like signal and noise , and pointed the way to modems and compact discs , cell phones and cyberspace , Moore ’s law , Metcalfe ’s law , and a world of silicon valleys and alleys .
Now the whole universe is seen as a computer – a cosmic processor of information .
When photons and electrons and other particles interact , what are they really doing ?
Exchanging bits , transmitting quantum states .
Every burning star , every silent nebula , every particle leaving its ghostly trace in a cloud chamber is an information processor .
The universe computes its own destiny .
How much does it compute ?
How fast ?
How big is its total information capacity , its memory space ?
What is the link between energy and information – the energy cost of flipping a bit ?
These are hard questions , but they are not mystical or metaphorical .
Physicists and quantum – information theorists are using the bit to look anew at the mysteries of thermodynamic entropy and at those notorious information swallowers , black holes .
They ’re doing the math and producing tentative answers .
To the small questions , that is .
For Wheeler , the big question of which comes first , the material universe or information , is a way of posing an even bigger question : “ How come existence ? ”
How does something arise from nothing ?
And that , it ’s safe to say , is a question science cannot answer .

Why do some diseases turn into pandemics ?
A pandemic – a transnational outbreak of disease – is really just a pathogen on a hot streak .
After all , germs want what we all want , evolution - wise : to spread their genes .
Success in the germ world means infecting a whole lot of people , reproducing , then infecting a whole lot more .
The efficiency with which a microbe pulls that off depends on how the bug works and how the target – us – works .
HIV , for example , loves a promiscuous - but - prudish population ; human beings like to have sex but do n’t like to talk about condoms .
The Ebola virus , on the other hand , has n’t found victims who exchange fluids with enough other people before dying ( horribly ) .
So changes in culture like jet airplane travel can make a population more vulnerable to a previously contained disease .
And changes in a germ – say , if avian influenza H5N1 acquires the right genes from the human version – can be like spinach to Popeye .
But no one knows how to predict when either of those things might happen .
So do n’t forget to wash your hands .
A lot .

Can mathematicians prove the Riemann hypothesis ?
In the early 1900s , German mathematician David Hilbert said that if he awakened after 1,000 years of sleep , the first question he ’d ask would be : Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven ?
It ’s been only 100 years , but the answer so far is no .
Put forward by Bernhard Riemann in 1859 , the hypothesis would establish the distribution of zeroes on something called the Riemann zeta function .
That , in turn , correlates to the intervals between prime numbers .
Prime numbers ( numbers that can be divided only by 1 and themselves : 2 , 3 , 5 , et cetera ) are the building blocks of mathematics , because all other numbers can be arrived at by multiplying them together ( e.g. , 150 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 5 ) .
Understanding the primes sheds light on the entire landscape of numbers , and the greatest mystery concerning primes is their distribution .
Sometimes primes are neighbors ( 342,047 and 342,049 ) .
Other times a prime is followed by desert of nonprimes before the next one pops up ( 396,733 and 396,833 ) .
Making sense of this bizarre arrangement would offer a base from which to solve numerous other long - standing math problems and could affect related fields , like quantum physics .
Until they know whether it ’s true , though , mathematicians ca n’t use Riemann .
Princeton mathematician Peter Sarnak put it this way : “ Right now , when we tackle problems without knowing the truth of the Riemann hypothesis , it ’s as if we have a screwdriver .
But when we have it , it ’ll be more like a bulldozer . ”
Which is why the Riemann hypothesis has been named one of the Clay Millennium prize problems :
Whoever proves ( or disproves ) it gets $ 1 million .

Why do we die when we do ?
When asked why things die , physicists do n’t hesitate :
It ’s the second law of thermodynamics .
Everything , be it mineral , plant , or animal , a Lexus or a mitral valve or a protein in a cell wall , eventually breaks down .
What that looks like in humans – what exactly it is that makes us age – is a question for biologists .
It ’s DNA damage by free radicals , maybe , or shrinkage of the caps on chromosomes .
Telomeres , as they ’re called , get smaller with each cell division .
When they hit a certain length : apoptosis , or cell death .
But for the best explanation of the when of our mortality , you have to ask the ecologists .
They have a rough way of calculating life span .
Basically , the larger the species , the slower its energy - delivery systems ( all that internal tubing , all that complicated traffic ) ; the lower the metabolic rate , the longer the life .
Animals can live fast or burn slow .
“ If you ’ve ever picked up a little mouse , it ’s effectively vibrating , its heart is beating so fast , ” says Brian Enquist , an ecologist at the University of Arizona .
“ A blue whale ’s heart is like a slow metronome or the ringing of a church bell , a very slow bong … bong … bong . ”
Yet both get roughly the same number of beats – 100 million and change , spread over two years for the mouse and roughly 80 years for the whale .
“ There ’s this beautiful invariant :
All living creatures have about the same amount of energetic life , ” Enquist says .
Yet while many animals outmass us humans , few outlive us .
Why the long life for us lightweights ?
Like the hide of a rhinoceros or the claws of a tiger , human cleverness makes us tough to kill .
That means random longevity - enhancing genes have a pretty good shot at evading natural selection .
A bird that gets eaten in its second month of life never passes on whatever fluke mutation might have given it – and its progeny – an extra year or two .
As for the ecologists ’ neat mathematical equation , “ primates are a little different , ” Enquist concedes .
“ For the number of heartbeats we have in our lives , we live a little longer than we should , and it ’s a big mystery why that is . ”
He speculates that the difference for us outliers will be explained by brain size – or , rather , by how much time and energy humans spend growing their brains relative to the rest of their bodies .
Why lavishing that extra energy on brainmaking translates into disproportionately long lives , Enquist is n’t sure ( and at 37 , he has only about 36 more years to figure it out ) .
Luckily , the same biological aberration that allows people to contemplate their own mortality is responsible , albeit indirectly , for delaying it .

What causes gravity ?
Isaac Newton first figured out the fundamental nature of gravity in the late 1600s .
By unraveling the mysteries of planetary movement and Earth ’s pull on its inhabitants , he described modern physics .
But more than three centuries later , that ’s still all we have : an understanding of the effect , with almost no grasp of the cause .
Is gravity carried by an elementary particle ?
Is it some fundamental feature of spacetime we do n’t understand ?
Why ca n’t gravity be reconciled with the better - understood quantum forces ?
All these questions remain unanswered .
Many scientists think gravity must be generated by a massless particle , and have even dubbed it the graviton .
But experiments to detect this entity ( using a super - collider , for example ) ca n’t be performed with current technology .
“ To generate the energy required to investigate a gravity particle , we believe , would produce a black hole , ” says Harvard physicist Lisa Randall .
“ Space itself just breaks down . ”
Right now , mathematics is the best investigative tool for getting gravity to square with subatomic forces like electromagnetism .
But making the math work requires dealing with exotic string theory notions like invisible 10 - dimensional space .
“ We ’ve always understood that gravity was different , ” Randall says .
“ If we figure out why in the next 30 years , there will be another big , new question .
I guarantee it . ” – John Hockenberry

Why ca n’t we regrow body parts ?
Slice through your finger with a kitchen knife and it ’s bye - bye pinkie .
But lop a leg off a salamander and it ’ll grow a new one with little more fuss than we expend on a broken nail .
Scientists looking to reverse tissue damage caused by disease , injury , or aging want to know how the agile amphibians do it – and why we can’t .
When salamanders are wounded , skin , bone , muscle , and blood vessels at the site revert to their undifferentiated states , forming a spongy mass called a blastema .
It ’s as if the cells go back in time and then retrace their steps to assemble a new organ or limb .
We seem to have this same basic program written in our genes :
As embryos , we grew arms , legs , heart , lungs , and so on with no problem , and even as adults , one type of cell in our nervous system can dedifferentiate to repair damage .
Others in our liver show similar flexibility .
But for the most part , our regenerative pathway appears to be roadblocked .
The reason may be that the rapid cell division required to sprout a new limb looks to the body a lot like the unchecked growth of cancer .
Our longevity makes us vulnerable to accumulated DNA mutations , so we ’ve evolved molecular brakes to keep tumors at bay .
In order to unlock our regenerative capabilities , scientists will have to figure out how to override the stop signals without sparking a malignant rampage .

Why do we still have big questions ?
Information is expanding 10 times faster than any product on this planet – manufactured or natural .
According to Hal Varian , an economist at UC Berkeley and a consultant to Google , worldwide information is increasing at 66 percent per year – approaching the rate of Moore ’s law – while the most prolific manufactured stuff – paper , let ’s say , or steel – averages only as much as 7 percent annually .
By this rough metric , knowledge is growing exponentially .
Indeed , the current pace of discovery is accelerating so rapidly that it seems as if we ’re headed for that rapture of enlightenment known as the Singularity .
In fact , we may be nearly there .
A decade ago , author John Horgan interviewed prestigious scientists in many fields and concluded in his book The End of Science that all the big questions had been answered .
The world of science has been roughly mapped out – structure of atoms , nature of light , theories of relativity and evolution , and so on – and all that remains now is to color in the details .
So why do we still have so many unanswered questions ?
Take the current state of physics :
We do n’t know what 96 percent of the universe is made of .
We call it “ dark matter , ” a euphemism for our ignorance .
Yet it is also clear that we know far more about the universe than we did a century ago , and we have put this understanding to practical use – in consumer goods like GPS receivers and iPods , in medical devices like MRI scanners , and in engineered materials like photovoltaic cells and carbon nanotubes .
Our steady and beneficial progress in knowledge comes from steady and beneficial progress in tools and technology .
Telescopes , microscopes , fluoroscopes , and oscilloscopes allow us to see in new ways and to know more about the universe .
The paradox of science is that every answer breeds at least two new questions .
More answers mean even more questions , expanding not only what we know but also what we do n’t know .
Every new tool for looking farther or deeper or smaller allows us to spy into our ignorance .
Future technologies such as artificial intelligence , controlled fusion , and quantum computing ( to name a few on the near horizon ) will change the world – that means the biggest questions have yet to be asked .

You paraphrase Fermi’s Paradox , first posed by the physicist Enrico Fermi in 1950 over lunch with some colleagues .
During the same lunch , he also disproved the existence of UFOs , Sasquatch , fairies , God , and love .
After that , he generally ate alone .
But Fermi ’s apparent logic overlooked two important probabilities : ( 1 ) the aliens are very far away and do n’t believe we exist , and ( 2 ) Enrico Fermi was himself probably a space alien .
I mean : Look at him .

How much is all the tea in China actually worth ?
If you would n’t do something for all the tea in China , are you cheating yourself ?
China produces 855,190 metric tons of tea leaf annually .
At commodity prices of $ 1.86 per kilogram , you ’re missing out on at least $ 1,590,653,400 .
Feh .
Next time , tell ’em you do n’t get out of bed for less than all the coffee in Brazil – $ 6,645,461,089 .

Where are my keys ?
Most brains can handle only five to nine short - term memories at once .
Newer information – phone call !
ice cream !
– can bump a previous memory out of storage before it ’s committed to long - term recall .
Even worse , new memories tend to merge with permanent ones , muddying the recollection of ritual activities .
Michael “ Professor ” Solomon , author of How to Find Lost Objects , says it ’s easy to accidentally substitute one routine motion for another .
So look for your keys where you normally put your wallet .
If that fails , check the car , the sofa cushions , the door lock , and ( duh ) your pocket .
You ’re probably staring right at them .

Why do hot dogs come in packs of 10 while buns come in packs of 8 or 12 ?
Bakers tend to package their wares in dozens or in other multiples of three or four .
Meatpackers sell by the pound , and a standard hot dog is 0.1 pounds .
Oscar Mayer insists that only 10 consumers – or is it 12 ? – write in annually to complain .

Iris Robinson said gay people should seek counselling
The DUP's Iris Robinson has faced fresh criticism over remarks she made about gay people .
On Friday , the Strangford MP , said homosexuality was an abomination and urged gay people to seek counselling .
Sinn Féin's Martina Anderson said , " for a politician of her standing to come out and say what she had said , I think it is most unsuitable " .
Mrs Robinson went on the radio on Monday morning to insist that she had every right to express her views .
Ms Anderson went on to say that Mrs Robinson should reflect seriously on what she had said and should apologise .
" I think that such an outrageous comment from Mrs Robinson calls into question her suitability as chair of the Assembly health committee , " she said .
Police complaint
A complaint has been made to the police about Mrs Robinson 's comments .
John O'Doherty , a member of the South Belfast District Policing Partnership , said he has complained to police .
" People like Mrs Robinson need to learn that their comments have consequences , " he said .
This is the second complaint in relation to the Strangford MP 's remarks .
Mrs Robinson first made the comments on BBC Radio Ulster on Friday .
She said she would defend her right to express religious beliefs , while also condemning violence against the gay community .
Jeffrey Donaldson , the DUP's Lagan Valley MP , said Mrs Robinson was entitled to express her views .
" This is a country where people have freedom of speech , " he said .
" If someone has made a complaint then the matter will be investigated , I do n't believe that Iris has broken any law so I do n't believe the police investigation will lead to anything . "
Mr Donaldson , who is an executive junior minister responsible for equality , said that they would seek to ensure that no -one was discriminated against .

Some City workers may need to look for new jobs
It might be the start of the spring season , but many City workers are still feeling the winter chill .
Continuing turbulence in the banking sector , an economic slowdown , and profit falls and bonus cuts have led to increasing concerns over the future of the UK financial sector .
In times of such volatility , only one thing is guaranteed - some degree of job losses .
Forecasters such as the Centre for Economic Business Research ( CEBR ) are suggesting that the City could be facing up to 10,000 job losses this year - 50 % more than they were predicting just three months ago .
The next couple of months will be crucial
Belinda Walmsley , Joslin Rowe recruitment agency
And a new survey by the CBI and PricewaterhouseCoopers shows the financial sector is waking up to a harsh new reality as the credit crunch begins to bite .
The survey reports that the industry is facing its most negative employment outlook for five years .
Confidence has been sapped and most banks expect the problems to continue until the end of the year .
Spirit of fear Wandering through the Square Mile it is easy to see that all is not quite well .
People are n't out partying like they were last year
Mark , City worker
On an otherwise beautiful spring day in the City , I meet up with Chris in a local coffee shop .
Chris is a young city employee who works for a large private investment bank .
He tells me that people are worried on a daily basis .
" It 's not doomsday but no - one at this stage really knows the extent of the fallout .
It 's really playing on some people 's minds and is a real lingering problem that wo n't go away . "
Much of this fear has been generated by the rollercoaster events of the past few months .
Signs of the times Financial institutions may have to cut back on staff
First of all , as signs of the crisis multiplied , the FTSE 100 index slumped 5.5 % on January 21 , its worst one - day fall in more than six years .
In just a year the index has tumbled more than one thousand points .
And then there was Northern Rock , which had been unable to refinance its mortgages on money markets , and was finally nationalised in February .
Then came the collapse and subsequent takeover of Bear Stearns , the fifth largest investment bank in the US , which sent shock waves across the pond and brought with it a new wave of uncertainty and pessimism .
" We never thought a bank like Bear Stearns would go under .
The next couple of months will be crucial , " says Belinda Walmsley , communications manager of recruitment agency Joslin Rowe .
False rumours
Two weeks ago HBOS shares plunged 17 % amidst false rumours that the UK 's largest mortgage lender was in serious trouble .
Although the share price has since recovered , the episode promoted an investigation from the FSA , the City 's regulator .
Sarah Williams , manager of recruitment consultancy FSS City , says the outlook remains very uncertain .
" We 're finding that a lot of our clients are taking a ' wait and see ' approach , hoping that actions by the Fed in the US or the Bank of England here might make future prospects a little clearer , " says Ms Williams .
" As a result there are fewer jobs about and where recruitment is happening it is proceeding at a slower pace . "
Empty tables
As I continue on my journey through the City I cannot fail to notice the array of fine restaurants , bars , tailors and jewellery stores .
What really strikes me is that they are all empty .
I enter one of the famous clothes shops in the very heart of the City and speak with the shop assistant Nilesh .
" It 's been much slower than usual " , explains Nilesh .
" Especially since after Christmas where we 've seen a real difference .
We 've even had to change some of our promotions . "
Afterwards I meet with Mark , another City worker , and he explains the situation from his point of view .
" Bonuses will be a lot lower this year .
It 's also made harder by the fact that people do n't have the negotiating power they had last year and can't move to rival firms because of hiring freezes . "
Mark is however optimistic for the future , expecting the sector to return to a bull market within a couple of years .
" Most people realise that these things happen from time to time .
It 's the younger people who have n't been in the business for that long who are jittery . "
However he does concede that " people are n't out partying like they were last year " .
He also knows of people who have turned up to work only to immediately be shown the exit sign .
Belinda Walmsley at Josin Rowe says despite being a cautious and slower year , recruitment still remains high .
" The situation is very different from the late 1990s , where there was a knee - jerk reaction , resulting in big job losses , " she says .
" We 've been through this before and the markets recovered .
" The sector is n't in crisis .
There still remains more jobs available than people , although the gap is narrowing .
" The phones are still ringing . "

This conversation blew my mind : Me : Thanks for calling Barnes & Noble .
This is Morgan , how can I help you ?
Crazy Lady : I want to know if you have The Bible .
Me : Sure , but I need a little more information .
Which translation ( NIV , KJV , etc ) ?
Leatherbound or hardback ?
words of Christ in red ?
CL : No , I just want The Bible .
Me : Well , yes ... but there are several different versions .
CL : No , those are n't really THE BIBLE .
I want THE BIBLE .
Me : ummmmmCL : I 've seen this book and on the cover it says THE BIBLE .
Me : All of ours say The Bible on the cover .
Actually some say The Holy Bible but same thing .
CL : No , YOU DON " T UNDERSTAND .
I WANT THE BIBLE .
This conversation went on for about five minutes with me trying to make this woman understand how buying a bible works .
Finally she just hung up on me .
By this point there was another bookseller staring at me with a dumbfounded look on her face and a nearby customer actually said " I can't believe you just had that conversation with someone . "
Food Shortages , Rising Prices , Stagnant Wages :
Welcome to the 13th Century
This week 's theme : Survival + ( June 23 , 2008 )
Human history is not just a chaotic cacophony ; if we pay attention , we observe rhythms and structures .
The reason is as obvious as it is profound .
Like all species of life on earth , humanity has been structured / selected via complex adaptations to survive and reproduce within various ecological niches .
That our social structures and our histories share certain characteristics over historical time is common - sense .
History , like an individual , is unique even as it shares characteristics with previous eras .
Without studying history , we are prone to both arrogance and insecurity .
Unaware of the past , we proudly reckon we 've gone beyond the reach of cyclical history ; and then , when the cycle turns and we are adrift and fearful , then we feel inadequate to the task of righting the sinking ship .
History properly studied renders us humble about our ability to control nature and events , and confident that we too can survive bad times .
Which brings me once again to The Great Wave : Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History by historian David Hackett Fischer ( recommended by reader Cheryl A. , who kindly sent me a copy of the book . )
In Fischer 's well - documented view , there is a grand cycle of prices and wages which turn on the simple but profound law of supply and demand ; all else is detail .
As a people prosper and multiply , the demand for goods like food and energy outstrips supply , causing eras of rising prices .
Long periods of stable prices ( supply increases along with demand ) beget rising wages and widespread prosperity .
Once population and financial demand outstrip supply of food and energy - - a situation often triggered by a series of catastrophically poor harvests -- then the stability decays into instability as shortages develop and prices spike .
These junctures of great poverty , insecurity and unrest set the stage for wars , revolutions and pandemics .
It is remarkable indeed that the very conditions so troubling us now were also present in the price rises of the 13th , 16th and 18th centuries .
Unfortunately , those cycles did not have Disney endings : the turmoil of the 13th century brought war and a series of plagues which killed 40 % of Europe 's population ; the 16th century 's era of rising prices tilled fertile ground for war , and the 18th century 's violent revolutions and resultant wars can be traced directly to the unrest caused by spiking prices .
( The very day that prices for bread reached their peak in Paris , an angry mob tore down the Bastille prison , launching the French Revolution . )
After a gloriously long run of stable prices in the 19th century -- prices were essentially unchanged in Britain between 1820 and 1900 -- The 20th century was one of steadily increasing prices .
Fischer takes great pains to demolish the ideologically appealing notion that all inflation is monentary ; the supply of money ( gold and silver ) rose spectacularly in the 19th century but prices barely budged .
In a similar fashion , eras of rising prices have seen stable money supplies .
Yes , monentary expansion can play a part , but Fischer has done his homework , and population growth is a far stronger correlation than money supply .
Monentary inflation can lead to hyper- inflation , of course , but there are always mitigating factors in those circumstances .
The long wave is not one of hyper- inflation but of supply and demand imbalances undoing the social order .
Americans are inherently suspicious of anything which seems to threaten constraint of the American Will or Dream ; thus it is not surprising that cycles of history are largely unknown in the U.S. As Fischer explains :
This collective amnesia is partly the consequence of an attitude widely shared among decision - makers in America , that history is more or less irrelevant to the urgent problems before them .
Fischer notes that he describes not cycles but waves , which are more variable and less predictable .
( Surfers know to count waves , as they tend to arrive in sets . )
Is the sudden rise in the price of oil unique ?
Not at all .
Energy in 1300 was firewood , and as Fischer relates , the cost of energy skyrocketed then , too :
In England from 1261 to 1320 , the price of firewood and charcoal rose faster and farther than any other commodity .
Close behind the soaring cost of energy came price - rises for food - stuffs of various kinds -- particluarly for grain , meat and dairy products .
Talk about being ripped from the headlines : this describes our current situation remarkably well .
In response to this great rise in prices of essentials , both commoners and governments debased the currency .
In their day , this meant shaving the edges of coins , or debasing new coins with non-precious metals .
The debasement was an attempt to increase money to counteract the rise in prices , but it failed ( of course ) .
Every few decades , a new undebased coinage was released , and then the cycle of debasement began anew .
Just as insidiously , wages fell :
But as inflation continued in the mid-13th century , money wages began to lag behind .
By the late 13th and early 14th centuries real wages were dropping at a rapid rate .
Hmm -- sound familar ?
Now guess what happened next :
At the same time that wages fell , rents and interest rose sharply .
Returns to landowners generally kept pace with inflation or exceeded it .
This growing gap between returns to labor and capital was typical of price - revolutions in modern history .
So also was its social result : a rapid growth of inequality that appeared in the late stages of every long inflation .
And what happened to government expenditures ?
It 's deja vu all over again -- deficits :
Yet another set of cultural responses toinflation created disparities of a different kind : fiscal imbalances between public income and expenditures .
Governments fell deep into debt during the middle and later years of the 13th century .
Oh , and crime and illegitimacy also rose .
Fischer summarizes the end - game of the price - rise wave thusly :
In the late 13th century , the medieval price - revolution entered another stage , marked by growing instability .
Prices rose and fell in wild swings of increasing amplitude .
Inequality increased at a rapid rate .
Public deficits surged ever higher .
The economy of Western Europe became dangerously vulnerable to stresses it might have managed more easily in other eras .
And there you have our future , writ large in the 13th , 16th and 18th century price - revolution waves which preceded ours .
It is hubris in the extreme to think we have somehow morphed into some new kind of humanity far different from those people who tore down the Bastille in a great frustrated rage at prices for energy and bread they could no longer afford .
It is foolish to blame " speculators " for the rise in food and energy , when the human population has doubled in 40 years and the consumption of energy and food has exploded as a result .
Yes , technology in the form of the Green Revolution enabled vastly greater yields per acre ; and yields in many places can still be increased with fertilizers , improved seeds and so on .
But all of this was the result of cheap , easy - to - pump , readily available oil .
All the miracles resulted from cheap oil , and now that it 's gone -- yes , yes , there is more , but it 's not cheap or easy to pump -- then we have to replace it with some other energy source .
But petroleum and natural gas are wonderfully adaptable energy sources , handy for making fertilizer , plastics , and other chemicals as well as for fuel .
Both are readily stored and possess very high energy densities .
Yes , Lithium -ion batteries also have a high energy density , but it is n't a matter of drilling a hole and complex lithium - ion batteries gush out .
It takes tremendous energy and technology to fashion lithium - ion batteries , and as a result they 're expensive .
If the market responds to the oil price - revolution with sufficient verve , capital and innovation , perhaps a rich brew of petroleum replacements will appear in mass production .
But there is a peculiar feedback loop at work ; there has to be enough energy on hand to build this new infrastructure of solar - cell factories , algae - to - biofuel plants and all the rest .
If we consume all the cheap oil in a vain attempt to maintain the status quo , then the replacement becomes ever more costly .
And then we have a price - revolution on our hands which looks eerily like the ones which swept Europe in the 13th , 16th and 18th centuries .
So where does this leave us ?
In Dude , We Are So Doomed , I noted the intersection of four long - term cycles ( waves ) , which suggest that the era from the present ( 2008 ) to 2021 will be troubled indeed , and may result in a war , revolution or equivalent re-ordering of U.S. society and perhaps the world .
It does n't take much thought to anticipate the post - cheap - petroleum era might be fraught with risk and turmoil as the transition -- messy and unpredictable in some ways , but predictably messy in any event -- takes place .
Based on the history so painstakingly asembled by Fischer , we can anticipate : Ever higher prices for what I call the FEW Essentials : food , energy and water .
Ever larger government deficits which end in bankruptcy / repudiation of debts / new issue of currency .
Rising property / violent crime and illegitimacy .
Rising interest rates ( by a lot , not a little ) .
Rising income inequality in favor of capital over labor .
Continued debasement of the currency .
Rising volatility of prices .
Rising political unrest and turmoil ( see " Revolution " ) .
We 'll continue examining these all - important issues in this " Survival + " themed week .

US regulators on Monday announced fraud charges stemming indirectly from the merger of Time Warner and AOL , the largest union in US corporate history and a symbol of the dotcom boom and bust of the early part of this decade .
Eight former executives of the merged group were accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of participating in a scheme to inflate internet advertising revenues at the merged AOL Time Warner by more than $ 1bn .
The civil charges stem from claims that the eight artificially inflated online advertising as the dotcom boom evaporated , sustaining the internet company ’s returns in the months leading up to and after the deal with Time Warner .
The allegedly inflated earnings came at a time when investors , souring on the outlook for internet companies , were starting to question the wisdom of the merger , which handed AOL shareholders control of the more established traditional media group .
The charges , which include a complaint against John Michael Kelly , the former AOL chief financial officer who went on to hold the same position at the enlarged AOL Time Warner , are the first levelled against individuals over the affair .
The company itself agreed to a $ 300 m settlement in 2005 to settle related charges .
Four individuals , including Mr Kelly , will contest the charges filed on Monday .
In a separate lawsuit , four others settled charges with the SEC by agreeing to pay a total of more than $ 8 m , while neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing .
The SEC said on Monday that when the Time Warner merger was pending in mid-2000 , AOL faced a growing crisis with regard to its advertising revenue as the market for online advertising began to shrink .
In response , the SEC claims , the defendants participated in a scheme that led the company to inflate its advertising revenue through a series of “ round - trip ” transactions in which AOL “ effectively funded its own advertising revenue by giving its counterparties the means to purchase AOL online advertising that the counterparties did not need or want ” .
In addition to Mr Kelly , Steven E. Rindner , former senior executive in the company ’s business affairs unit , Joseph A. Ripp , former chief financial officer of the AOL division , and Mark Wovsaniker , former head of accounting policy , are contesting fraud - related charges .

For the Bilderberg uninitiated , Johnson also selected John Kerry ’s running mate John Edwards in 2004 after Edwards had impressed Bilderberg elitists Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller with a speech he gave at the globalist conflab in Italy that year , says Prison Planet .
“ It has been announced that Bilderberg luminary and top corporate elitist James A. Johnson will select Democratic candidate Barack Obama ’s running mate for the 2008 election and in turn potentially act as a kingmaker for America ’s future president . ” ( Paul Joseph Watson , Prison Planet , May 23 , 2008 ) .
Visit to Mrs. Clinton notwithstanding , Obama ’s in no position to play favours in the vice president department , the big boys will decide who fills that slot .
Although coming on like a freight train as the Messiah For Change , Barack Obama ’s just another poodle of the powerbrokers when it comes to who will be his Veep .
For all of their power , Bilderberg Pooh - bahs are just as vulnerable to political speeches as are their lessers known as John & Josephine Q. Public .
Bilderbergers pull the puppet strings of contemporary politicians .
While the media tends to present Bilderberger luminaries as bigwigs in pinstripe suits attending endless secret meetings , they ’re the global elitists pushing the envelope on one - world government .
“ In reality , the group is shaping some of the primary developments in the domestic and geopolitical arena today , particularly in the context of oil prices which continue to accelerate towards Bilderberg ’s target of $ 200 dollars a barrel . ” ( Prison Planet ) .
Some say it is the Bilderbergers behind all market trends .
Having to march along to the tunes of Bilderberg Blues Band makes Obama ’s promise for change something of a mirage .
In the opinion of Prison Planet , “ It also ridicules once again any notion that an Obama presidency would bring “ change ” to the status quo of America being ruled by an unelected corporate and military - industrial complex elite . ”
“ Former Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson has been asked by Senator Barack Obama on Thursday to start the search for a viable Vice Presidential candidate , ” reports Trans World News .
“ Johnson and Obama are starting the top - secret search as Obama edges closer to the Democratic nomination .
Johnson did the same job for Democratic nominees John Kerry in 2004 and Walter Mondale in 1984 . ”
“ The report lists Johnson as a member of “ American Friends of Bilderberg , ” which is an offshoot Bilderberg front group that has accepted donations from the Ford Foundation to fund Bilderberg meetings where lavish hotels are entirely booked up for three days , by no means an inexpensive feat .
The organization is basically a steering committee for the Bilderberg Group — a secretarial outpost through which Bilderberg conferences are organized .
“ Johnson has also directly attended Bilderberg meetings , therefore he can be classed as a Bilderberg luminary .
He attended last years ’s meeting in Istanbul , Turkey .
“ Johnson is also “ A vice chairman of the private banking firm Perseus LLC , a position he has held since 2001 .
He is also a board member at Goldman Sachs , Gannett Company Inc. , a media holding group , KB Home , a home construction firm , Target Corporation , Temple - Inland and UnitedHealth Group .
“ Predictably , he is also a member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations .
In 2004 it was reported that John Edwards ’ Goody Two Shoes performance in front of the Bilderberg big boys in Italy was a factor in his selection as John Kerry ’s Number Two .
Edwards was so in sync with the brass that attendees even dispensed with house rules to applaud him at the end of the speech he gave about American politics .
That time , Johnson himself selected Edwards in a last - minute change decision after it appeared as though Dick Gephardt was going to secure the position .
The New York Post even reported that Gephardt had been chosen and “ Kerry - Gephardt ” stickers were being placed on campaign vehicles before being removed when Edwards was announced as Kerry ’s handmaiden .
Kerry , of course went on to lose to what Prison Planet calls “ his fellow Skull and Bones member George W. Bush .
“ But with Obama enjoying an 8 - point lead over Republican candidate John McCain , this year ’s running mate decision is all the more important , with the individual selected likely to have a shot at becoming President in 2012 .
“ Bilderberg has a proven history of acting in a kingmaker capacity .
Both Bill Clinton and Tony Blair attended Bilderberg meetings in the early 90’s before becoming President and Prime Minister respectively . ”
History may record the Democrats bringing both the first black and first female president and vice president to the White House .
Barack Obama may look like the Messiah For Change when in reality he ’s just another Bildeberg Boy .
June 28 , 2008  --
Time is running out for Tracy Mosely .
A single mother of five , Mosely is on the brink of homelessness after the house she 's rented for a year fell into foreclosure and was sold at auction .
Mosely , a part - time restaurant hostess , came up with $ 500 for a security deposit on another place .
But she says all the landlords she 's contacted want $ 1,000 or more .
She does n't have it .
Lying on her bed in Florissant , Mo. , flipping through the newspaper , seeking a place to move her family , Mosely says she 's not sure if she has weeks or days before she 'll be evicted .
She may wind up , she says , in a homeless shelter .
How Is the Economy Treating You ?
Tell ABC News
" My blood pressure is sky - high , " she says .
" We 'll be on the streets .
I 'm just lost about what to do .
We were settled here , this was home , and the kids are looking at me like , ' Mom , please . '
I told them I 'm doing my best . "
Mosely is one of the faces of a national real estate crisis whose most grievous victims are increasingly facing the ultimate fate : homelessness .
With more families on the cusp of having nowhere to live , thousands of both former homeowners and renters are winding up in shelters or turning to charities for food or other aid to get by .
Nearly 61 % of local and state homeless coalitions say they 've seen a rise in homelessness since the foreclosure crisis began in 2007 , according to a study released in April by the National Coalition for the Homeless .
According to the study , which let respondents offer multiple replies when asked where they 're headed once their property is foreclosed on , 76 % of displaced homeowners and renters are moving in with relatives and friends .
About 54 % are moving to emergency shelters .
About 40 % are already on the streets .
Those facing homelessness include the working poor , who were among those hardest hit by the collapse in subprime mortgages .
But others are middle - class families who scarcely expected to find themselves unable to afford their homes .
" Shelters are full , and it 's getting worse , " says Michael Stoops of the National Coalition for the Homeless in Washington .
" There are more homeless homeowners , people who first try to downsize , then wind up living with family and friends or in vehicles .
At the shelters , there 's almost no room at the inn .
It 's first come , first serve . "
Six cities reported a rise in the number of homeless people who used emergency shelter and transitional housing programs in the past year , and 10 cities reported an increase in households with children seeking help , according to a 2007 survey done in part by the U.S. Conference of Mayors .
The report cites several reasons for the increase , with the rise in foreclosures at the top of the list .
Many cities that have seen an increase in homelessness — among them Detroit , Portland , Ore. , and Salt Lake City — have also suffered sharp jumps in foreclosures .
The Salvation Army , which provides transitional emergency and shelter housing , is reporting a surge in demand for homeless services .
For the first time in memory , it 's seeing the trend in such middle - class enclaves as Olathe , Kan. , and Englewood , Colo .
In Kansas City , the Salvation Army has opened shelters in middle - class communities that are serving more families and middle - income wage earners .
In Anchorage , a shelter has expanded from six rooms to 16 .
" Typically , if families lose their homes , unless they have relatives , they 're scrambling , " says Maj .
George Hood , national community relations secretary for the Salvation Army .
" We 're really seeing an uptick in homelessness right now .
You have to rescue some from sleeping in vehicles .
" They 're embarrassed and do n't want to ask for help .
They 've found themselves in situations they never expected , and you 're also finding families and people with established homes out there on the street . "
Foreclosure Figures Rising
The intensity of the foreclosure crisis helps explain why .
For the first quarter of this year , the rate of new foreclosures hit 0.99 % , the highest since record - keeping began in 1979 , the Mortgage Bankers Association reported .
About 2.47 % of all mortgages were in some stage of foreclosure during those three months , another record .
And more than 2 million foreclosures were reported in 2007 , according to the National Coalition for the Homeless .
For some who 've lost homes to foreclosure , charitable groups are a desperate alternative to living on the streets .
Take Judy Johnson , 46 , of Sacramento , who works 10 - hour days as a hair stylist .
Johnson and her husband , Gregory , 52 , had been living for eight years in a two - story , 3,000 - square - foot home when he lost his job as a supervisor in waste management .
He also developed diabetes , fell into a coma and was hospitalized for a short time .
He is now recovered .
Judy , a mother of four , tried to support her family and make the mortgage bills on her single income because Gregory was unemployed .
" We became paycheck - to - paycheck , " she says .
Ultimately , the family fell behind on their payments .
In December , the home was sold at auction , and the family had to move out .
They had no savings left , Judy says , and no family or friends who could take them in .
And they could n't afford the security deposits of $ 2,000 or so that landlords were requesting .
" We were thinking we would have to separate the family ; we had nowhere to go , nobody to help us , " she says .
" We were basically homeless .
We were on the verge . "
The tension caused Judy to overeat , and for her and her husband to fall into frequent arguments .
But just days before they were to leave , the Salvation Army told them it could provide her with a security deposit on an apartment .
Some charitable groups will provide financial help , such as a rental deposit and money for groceries .
The Salvation Army will provide assistance to people who meet certain qualifications .
Clients meet with a case worker and provide information such as proof of residency , Social Security numbers of each person in the household , proof of income , statements of alimony and / or child support and lease agreements .
A background check is often conducted , too .
" I was just sitting on the couch , and I was just sitting there lost , thinking , ' I have to figure out how to get all this stuff out , ' and we had no place to go , " Judy says .
" I never thought I 'd be facing homelessness .
Some days , I could n't focus on my job .
The tension was so high in the house . "
Now , they 're in an apartment with three bedrooms , two bathrooms and a balcony to barbecue on .
Judy says that after facing homelessness , she realizes that in today 's wobbly real estate market , the same fate can befall almost anyone , even a middle - class two - earner family , as her own had been .
Gregory is still looking for a job .
Rising Prices a Contributing Factor
In addition to foreclosures , other factors are driving families to the edge of homelessness : mounting utility bills , the surge in gas prices and the rise in unemployment , which jumped from 5 % to 5.5 % in May , the government reported .
Often , those factors make it harder for families to afford their mortgages — especially for those who bought homes with adjustable - rate mortgages that have reset to higher rates .
Foreclosures have been spreading to prime loans , the kind made to those with good credit .
About 2.3 % of prime loans were 60 days or more past due in April , the highest level in at least a decade , according to data issued by First American CoreLogic LoanPerformance .
That 's up from about 1.4 % a year ago .
" There are people coming home from work , and their houses are boarded up , " says Jean Beil , senior vice president for programs and services at Catholic Charities USA in Alexandria , Va .
" They 're working poor , middle class .
Many were surprised when mortgages increased , and they could n't pay it . "
Homeless coalition and advocacy groups have called for steps to help ease the problem .
Proposals include state laws requiring home foreclosures to be entered into courthouse records within 30 days of a foreclosure sale , which would help renters determine the status of properties .
Another idea would require homeowners to provide potential tenants with information about a home , such as whether it 's under foreclosure .
In addition , groups such as the National Coalition for the Homeless want all federally insured mortgages to protect tenants in case of foreclosure by allowing them to maintain their lease until it expires .
In many cases , tenants who live in properties that are foreclosed upon may have little time before being forced to move out .
They may also lose any security deposits they had put down .
Some advocacy groups also favor more federal oversight of the financial services industry .
States have jurisdiction over non-bank mortgage lenders ; the National Coalition for the Homeless argues that this system creates inconsistent regulatory standards .
Homelessness Affecting Schools
In the meantime , the effects of foreclosures and homelessness are seeping into public school systems that are now serving more children without permanent addresses .
An estimated 2 million children will be directly affected by the subprime mortgage crisis as their families lose their homes to foreclosures , according to First Focus , a bipartisan children 's advocacy group that issued the report .
The April 2008 report indicates that foreclosures often result in disruptions to a child 's education .
Losing one 's home and having nowhere to go can also leave former homeowners emotionally wounded , seized by a sense of failure and shame .
Others struggle to hold onto their pride and a fierce desire to avoid the help of charities or government services .
Sandra Wright , 37 , and her three children and three grandchildren have lived in a rental home for about a year in Gary , Ind .
The home has been foreclosed on , and she has until Friday to move out .
Wright , a housekeeper at a hotel , was worried that she 'd wind up in a homeless shelter .
But she 's hopeful of finding another rental in time because the lender on the home is offering her $ 1,000 if she leaves the house by Friday .
" I was worried I 'll wind up in a shelter , " Wright says .
" They could come and put everything out on the streets .
I 've been praying a lot .
All you can do is pray . "
Do you feel it's a waste of time trying to prevent climate change ?
That reducing your carbon footprint is pointless when someone else is happy to increase theirs ?
That changing lightbulbs is a futile gesture ?
Well do n't , says Michael Pollan , because even small changes in your lifestyle - and your thinking - can help save the world
Why bother ?
That really is the big question facing us as individuals hoping to do something about climate change , and it 's not an easy one to answer .
I do n't know about you , but for me the most upsetting moment in An Inconvenient Truth came long after Al Gore scared the hell out of me , constructing an utterly convincing case that the very survival of life on earth as we know it is threatened by climate change .
No , the really dark moment came during the closing credits , when we are asked to ... change our lightbulbs .
That 's when it got really depressing .
The immense disproportion between the magnitude of the problem Gore had described and the puniness of what he was asking us to do about it was enough to sink your heart .
But the drop - in - the - bucket issue is not the only problem lurking behind the " Why bother ? " question .
Let 's say I do bother , big time .
I turn my life upside - down , start biking to work , plant a big garden , turn down the thermostat so low I need the Jimmy Carter signature cardigan , forsake the clothes dryer for a laundry line across the yard , trade in the SUV for a hybrid , get off the beef , go completely local .
I could theoretically do all that , but what would be the point when I know full well that halfway around the world there lives my evil twin , some carbon - footprint doppelgänger in Shanghai or Chongqing who has just bought his first car ( Chinese car ownership is where America 's was back in 1918 ) , is eager to swallow every bite of meat I forswear and who is positively itching to replace every last pound of CO2 I 'm struggling no longer to emit .
So what exactly would I have to show for all my trouble ?
A sense of personal virtue , you might suggest , somewhat sheepishly .
But what good is that when virtue itself is quickly becoming a term of derision ?
And not just on the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal or on the lips of the American vice - president , Dick Cheney , who famously dismissed energy conservation as a " sign of personal virtue " .
No , it seems the epithet " virtuous " , when applied to an act of personal environmental responsibility , may be used only ironically .
Tell me : how did it come to pass that virtue - a quality that for most of history has generally been deemed , well , a virtue - became a mark of liberal softheadedness ?
How peculiar , that doing the right thing by the environment - buying the hybrid , eating like a locavore - should now set you up for ridicule .
And even if in the face of this derision I decide I am going to bother , there arises the whole vexed question of getting it right .
Is eating local or walking to work really going to reduce my carbon footprint ?
According to one analysis , if walking to work increases your appetite and you consume more meat or milk as a result , walking might actually emit more carbon than driving .
A handful of studies have recently suggested that in certain cases under certain conditions , produce from places as far away as New Zealand might account for less carbon than comparable domestic products .
True , at least one of these studies was co-written by a representative of agribusiness interests in ( surprise ! )
New Zealand , but even so , they make you wonder .
If determining the carbon footprint of food is really this complicated , and I 've got to consider not only " food miles " but also whether the food came by ship or truck and how lushly the grass grows in New Zealand , then maybe on second thoughts I 'll just buy the imported chops , at least until the experts get their footprints sorted out .
There are so many stories we can tell ourselves to justify doing nothing , but perhaps the most insidious is that , whatever we do manage to do , it will be too little too late .
Climate change is upon us , and it has arrived well ahead of schedule .
Scientists ' projections that seemed dire a decade ago turn out to have been unduly optimistic : the warming and the melting is occurring much faster than the models predicted .
Now truly terrifying feedback loops threaten to boost the rate of change exponentially , as the shift from white ice to blue water in the Arctic absorbs more sunlight and warming soils everywhere become more biologically active , causing them to release their vast stores of carbon into the air .
Have you looked into the eyes of a climate scientist recently ?
They look really scared .
So do you still want to talk about planting gardens ?
I do .
Whatever we can do as individuals to change the way we live at this suddenly very late date does seem utterly inadequate to the challenge .
It 's hard to argue with Michael Specter , in a recent New Yorker piece on carbon footprints , when he says : " Personal choices , no matter how virtuous [ NB ! ] , cannot do enough .
It will also take laws and money . "
So it will .
Yet it is no less accurate or hardheaded to say that laws and money cannot do enough , either ; that it will also take profound changes in the way we live .
Why ?
Because the climate - change crisis is at its very bottom a crisis of lifestyle - of character , even .
The Big Problem is nothing more or less than the sum total of countless little everyday choices , most of them made by us ( consumer spending represents 70 % of our economy ) , and most of the rest of them made in the name of our needs and desires and preferences .
For us to wait for legislation or technology to solve the problem of how we 're living our lives suggests we 're not really serious about changing - something our politicians cannot fail to notice .
They will not move until we do .
Indeed , to look to leaders and experts , to laws and money and grand schemes , to save us from our predicament represents precisely the sort of thinking - passive , delegated , dependent for solutions on specialists - that helped get us into this mess in the first place .
It 's hard to believe that the same sort of thinking could now get us out of it .
Thirty years ago , Wendell Berry , the farmer and writer , put forward a blunt analysis of precisely this mentality .
He argued that the environmental crisis of the 70s - an era innocent of climate change ; what we would give to have back that environmental crisis !
- was at its heart a crisis of character and would have to be addressed first at that level : at home , as it were .
He was impatient with people who wrote cheques to environmental organisations while thoughtlessly squandering fossil fuel in their everyday lives - the 70s equivalent of people buying carbon offsets to atone for their SUVs .
Nothing was likely to change until we healed the " split between what we think and what we do " .
For Berry , the " Why bother ? " question came down to a moral imperative : " Once our personal connection to what is wrong becomes clear , then we have to choose : we can go on as before , recognising our dishonesty and living with it the best we can , or we can begin the effort to change the way we think and live . "
For Berry , the deep problem standing behind all the other problems of industrial civilisation is " specialisation " , which he regards as the " disease of the modern character " .
Our society assigns us a tiny number of roles : we 're producers ( of one thing ) at work , consumers of a great many other things the rest of the time , and then once a year or so we vote as citizens .
Virtually all of our needs and desires we delegate to specialists of one kind or another - our meals to agribusiness , health to the doctor , education to the teacher , entertainment to the media , care for the environment to the environmentalist , political action to the politician .
As Adam Smith and many others have pointed out , this division of labour has given us many of the blessings of civilisation .
Specialisation is what allows me to sit at a computer thinking about climate change .
Yet this same division of labour obscures the lines of connection - and responsibility - linking our everyday acts to their real - world consequences , making it easy for me to overlook the coal - fired power plant that is lighting my screen , or the mountaintop in Kentucky that had to be destroyed to provide the coal to that plant , or the streams running crimson with heavy metals as a result .
Of course , what made this sort of specialisation possible in the first place was cheap energy .
Cheap fossil fuel allows us to pay distant others to process our food for us , to entertain us and to ( try to ) solve our problems , with the result that there is very little we know how to accomplish for ourselves .
Think for a moment of all the things you suddenly need to do for yourself when the power goes out - up to and including entertaining yourself .
Think , too , about how a power failure causes your neighbours - your community - to suddenly loom so much larger in your life .
Cheap energy allowed us to leapfrog community by making it possible to sell our speciality over great distances as well as summon into our lives the specialities of countless distant others .
Here 's the point : cheap energy , which gives us climate change , fosters precisely the mentality that makes dealing with climate change in our own lives seem impossibly difficult .
Specialists ourselves , we can no longer imagine anyone but an expert , or anything but a new technology or law , solving our problems .
Gore asks us to change the lightbulbs because he probably can't imagine us doing anything much more challenging , like , say , growing some portion of our own food .
We can't imagine it , either , which is probably why we prefer to cross our fingers and talk about the promise of ethanol and nuclear power - new liquids and electrons to power the same old cars and houses and lives .
The " cheap - energy mind " , as Berry called it , is the mind that asks , " Why bother ? " because it is helpless to imagine - much less attempt - a different sort of life , one less divided , less reliant .
Since the cheap - energy mind translates everything into money - its proxy - it prefers to put its faith in market - based solutions : carbon taxes and pollution - trading schemes .
If we could just get the incentives right , it believes , the economy will properly value everything that matters and nudge our self - interest down the proper channels .
The best we can hope for is a greener version of the old invisible hand .
Visible hands it has no use for .
But while some such grand scheme may well be necessary , it is doubtful that it will be sufficient or that it will be politically sustainable before we have demonstrated to ourselves that change is possible .
Merely to give , to spend , even to vote , is not to do , and there is so much that needs to be done - without further delay .
In the judgment of James Hansen , the Nasa climate scientist who began sounding the alarm on global warming 20 years ago , we have only 10 years left to start cutting - not just slowing - the amount of carbon we 're emitting or face a " different planet " .
Hansen said this more than two years ago , however ; two years have gone by , and nothing of consequence has been done .
So : eight years left to go - and a great deal left to do .
Which brings us back to the " Why bother ? " question and how we might better answer it .
The reasons not to bother are many and compelling , at least to the cheap - energy mind .
But let me offer a few admittedly tentative reasons that we might put on the other side of the scale :
If you do bother , you will set an example for other people .
If enough other people bother , each one influencing yet another in a chain reaction of behavioural change , markets for all manner of green products and alternative technologies will prosper and expand .
( Just look at the market for hybrid cars . )
Consciousness will be raised , perhaps even changed : new moral imperatives and new taboos might take root in the culture .
Driving an SUV or eating a 24 oz steak or illuminating your house like an airport runway at night might come to be regarded as outrages to human conscience .
Not having things might become cooler than having them .
And those who did change the way they live would acquire the moral standing to demand changes in behaviour from others - from other people , other corporations , even other countries .
All of this could , theoretically , happen .
What I 'm describing ( imagining would probably be more accurate ) is a process of viral social change , and change of this kind , which is nonlinear , is never something anyone can plan or predict or count on .
Who knows , maybe the virus will reach all the way to Chongqing and infect my Chinese evil twin .
Or not .
Maybe going green will prove a passing fad and will lose steam after a few years , just as it did in the 80s , when Ronald Reagan took down Jimmy Carter 's solar panels from the roof of the White House .
Going personally green is a bet , nothing more or less , though it's one we probably all should make , even if the odds of it paying off are n't great .
Sometimes you have to act as if acting will make a difference , even when you can't prove that it will .
That , after all , was precisely what happened in Communist Czechoslovakia and Poland , when a handful of individuals such as Václav Havel and Adam Michnik resolved that they would simply conduct their lives " as if " they lived in a free society .
That improbable bet created a tiny space of liberty that , in time , expanded to take in , and then help take down , the whole of the eastern bloc .
So what would be a comparable bet that the individual might make in the case of the environmental crisis ?
Havel himself has suggested that people begin to " conduct themselves as if they were to live on this earth for ever and be answerable for its condition one day " .
Fair enough , but let me propose a slightly less abstract and daunting wager .
The idea is to find one thing to do in your life that does n't involve spending or voting , that may or may not virally rock the world but is real and particular ( as well as symbolic ) and that , come what may , will offer its own rewards .
Maybe you decide to give up meat , an act that would reduce your carbon footprint by as much as a quarter .
Or you could try this : determine to observe the Sabbath .
For one day a week , abstain completely from economic activity : no shopping , no driving , no electronics .
But the act I want to talk about is growing some - even just a little - of your own food .
Rip out your lawn , if you have one , and if you do n't - if you live in a high - rise , or have a garden shrouded in shade - look into getting an allotment .
Measured against the Problem We Face , planting a garden sounds pretty benign , I know , but in fact it 's one of the most powerful things an individual can do - to reduce your carbon footprint , sure , but more important , to reduce your sense of dependence and dividedness : to change the cheap - energy mind .
A great many things happen when you plant a vegetable garden , some of them directly related to climate change , others indirect but related nevertheless .
Growing food , we forget , comprises the original solar technology : calories produced by means of photosynthesis .
Years ago the cheap - energy mind discovered that more food could be produced with less effort by replacing sunlight with fossil - fuel fertilisers and pesticides , with a result that the typical calorie of food energy in your diet now requires about 10 calories of fossil - fuel energy to produce .
It 's estimated that the way we feed ourselves ( or rather , allow ourselves to be fed ) accounts for about a fifth of the greenhouse gas for which each of us is responsible .
Yet the sun still shines down on your garden , and photosynthesis still works so abundantly that in a thoughtfully organised vegetable patch ( one planted from seed , nourished by compost from the kitchen and involving not too many drives to the garden centre ) , you can grow the proverbial free lunch - CO2 - free and money - free .
This is the most - local food you can possibly eat ( not to mention the freshest , tastiest and most nutritious ) , with a carbon footprint so faint that even the New Zealand lamb council dares not challenge it .
And while we 're counting carbon , consider too your compost pile , which shrinks the heap of garbage your household needs trucked away even as it feeds your vegetables and sequesters carbon in your soil .
What else ?
Well , you will probably notice that you 're getting a pretty good workout there in your garden , burning calories without having to get into the car to drive to the gym .
( It is one of the absurdities of the modern division of labour that , having replaced physical labour with fossil fuel , we now have to burn even more fossil fuel to keep our unemployed bodies in shape . )
Also , by engaging both body and mind , time spent in the garden is time ( and energy ) subtracted from electronic forms of entertainment .
You begin to see that growing even a little of your own food is , as Berry pointed out 30 years ago , one of those solutions that , instead of begetting a new set of problems - the way " solutions " such as ethanol or nuclear power inevitably do - actually beget other solutions , and not only of the kind that save carbon .
Still more valuable are the habits of mind that growing a little of your own food can yield .
You quickly learn that you need not be dependent on specialists to provide for yourself - that your body is still good for something and may actually be enlisted in its own support .
If the experts are right , if both oil and time are running out , these are skills and habits of mind we 're all very soon going to need .
We may also need the food .
Could gardens provide it ?
Well , during the second world war victory gardens supplied as much as 40 % of the produce Americans ate .
But there are sweeter reasons to plant that garden , to bother .
At least in this one corner of your yard and life , you will have begun to heal the split between what you think and what you do , to commingle your identities as consumer and producer and citizen .
Chances are , your garden will re-engage you with your neighbours , for you will have produce to give away and the need to borrow their tools .
You will have reduced the power of the cheap - energy mind by personally overcoming its most debilitating weakness : its helplessness and the fact that it can't do much of anything that does n't involve division or subtraction .
The garden 's season - long transit from seed to ripe fruit - will you get a load of those courgettes !
- suggests that the operations of addition and multiplication still obtain , that the abundance of nature is not exhausted .
The single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum , and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant , think and do , we can , if we bother to try , find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world .

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- Chinese and Taiwanese officials agreed Thursday to set up permanent offices in each other 's territories , in the first formal talks between the two sides in almost a decade .
The decision , reported by each territories ' official news agencies , came during a meeting between the Straits Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits .
Both bodies are semi-official organizations that negotiate on behalf of their respective governments .
The two sides are also expected to discuss the possibility of establishing chartered flights across the 100 - mile Taiwan Strait on the weekends and approval for Chinese residents to travel to Taiwan .
Cross -straits talks between the two delegations began in 1993 , a year after China and Taiwan informally agreed to the " 1992 consensus . "
The consensus said the two sides belonged to " one China , " although it did not describe what that meant , and both sides were free to use differing interpretations .
After that , the dialogue was delayed for five years over cross -strait tensions .
A second meeting in 1998 was held in Shanghai , but a 1999 meeting was canceled by Beijing when then - Taiwanese President Lee Teng - hui proposed that Taiwan and China treat each other as two separate states .

Do n't Miss China , Taiwan seek talks as relations warm
Taiwan 's new president , Ma Ying - jeou , has rejected the push for independence .
Although Ma also opposes unification with China , he campaigned on promises of seeking closer ties to mainland China , particularly seeking for Taiwan some of the benefits of China 's robust economy .
Taiwan separated from China during civil war in 1949 , but Beijing has always considered it a part of China and has threatened to go to war should Taiwan declare formal independence .

The idea for server virtualization technology was originally conceived as a means to reduce costs through software consolidation .
Looking back it seems like a pretty obvious solution , but at the time this was revelatory .
Instead of running each individual workload on a separate physical server , unused hardware capacity was now able to be used to run a number of workloads at the same time as virtual machines .

A PENSIONER was arrested for murdering a friend after he " confessed " the crime to his cats , a court heard yesterday .
Detectives investigating the death of Joyce Sutton had secretly set up a recording device in David Henton 's home .
And , after they took his car away for inspection , he was taped allegedly telling his pets he had killed her .
Scroll down for more ...
On the recordings , Henton , 72 , is said to have told the animals : " They know I did it " and " What can I do now ?
I hit my Joyce " .
Mrs Sutton , 65 , was found bludgeoned to death in her bedroom two years ago .
The court heard that Henton – who had visited her on a daily basis and had known her for 30 years – was initially interviewed by detectives as a witness only .
The murder investigation was going nowhere until police turned their attention back to him last January , Swansea Crown Court heard .
Paul Lewis QC , prosecuting , said the listening devices caught the life - long bachelor " musing to his cats " a number of times .
He was allegedly heard to say : " A bloody woman .
It 's too much , too
much .
I had to do ... about it . "
Last January 24 , he allegedly told his pets : " I do n't know if they can prove it or anything .
" What am I going to say if they find anything ? "

The following day he was apparently caught saying : " Hi Joyce , it 's Dai .
They know I did it , see . "
In another excerpt , he allegedly says : " I 'm still under suspicion .
I will get a
solicitor .
" They know it was me .
They had my car in and they searched it .
But they have taken it again now . "
Mr Lewis told the jury that police are allowed to use listening devices in serious investigations and officers had followed strict rules when setting up the equipment in Henton 's home .
Police at first suspected Mrs Sutton had been killed by a burglar because her back door had been broken open .
However , Mr Lewis said : " Mrs Sutton was not murdered by a random burglar , but by a man she knew and trusted . "
Henton had a key to his friend 's neat , end - of - terrace house and sometimes stayed the night , always in a separate bedroom .
Most mornings he drove to her home in Skewen , West Glamorgan , buying her a newspaper on the way .
He would let himself in and bring her breakfast in bed .
They would then spend the day together .
" Why such a long - term relationship led to murder , we cannot say , " Mr
Lewis told the jury .
" But the attack on her was violent and cruel . "
The divorced mother - of - one suffered multiple head injuries and died from a fractured skull .
Mr Lewis said the back door was damaged to throw police off the scent .
Mrs Sutton 's blood was found on glass from the door , indicating it was
broken – with the missing murder
weapon – after her death , he said .
More fragments of the broken glass were allegedly found in Henton 's car .
" The burglar must have been pretty inept , " said Mr Lewis , because nothing
was stolen from Mrs Sutton 's home .
Her purse was found by her body and held £ 190 in cash .
Another £ 1,200 was found in the house , along with a collection of jewellery .
Mr Lewis added : ' There was no struggle in the bedroom .
" She was killed by someone with legitimate access to her home who wanted it to
look like a burglar had done it .
" It was not burglary , just murder . "
He said that before her death , Mrs Sutton had developed anxiety and depression and took to spending whole days in bed .
" It became a rather difficult and frustrating task for him to nurse his
companion , " said Mr Lewis .
" He became upset she was spending so much time in her room .
" He was urging her to get up and be more active .
" Had she become a burden he could no longer bear ? "
Mr Lewis said witnesses would cast doubt on the time Henton said he had spent at Mrs Sutton 's house around the time of the murder .
Elwen Evans , Henton 's barrister , said the defence would dispute the accuracy of the prosecution 's secret transcripts .
Henton , a retired lorry driver , and also from Skewen , denies murder .
He claims he found his friend dead in bed after noticing the back door had been damaged .
The trial continues .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The environmental group Greenpeace posed as a pro-coal organization to become a sponsor of the 2008 McCloskey Coal USA conference and deliver an anti-coal message at the gathering , officials said on Friday .
When The McCloskey Group figured out that the Institute for Energy Solutions was really Greenpeace , they decided to let the group retain its booth under the phony name and make brief remarks , organizers said .
The conference managers did take the precaution of adding security because of Greenpeace ’s reputation for confrontational , disruptive tactics , they said .
The muscle was used once , to eject one Greenpeace member .
Greenpeace spokesman Carroll Muffett was allowed to speak twice .
He blasted coal as a polluting fuel and accused coal executives of failing to protect the public .
The team manned a booth offering information and anti-coal paraphernalia .
“ It ’s a lot of value for the money , ” said Muffett of the $ 8,500 co-sponsorship fee that allowed the Greenpeace front group be an official sponsor .
In the conference brochure , an ad for the fake Institute seems pro-coal , but readers that go to the www.tomorrowsenergytoday.org
Web site are redirected to www.coal-is-dirty.com.
The Greenpeace team handed out business cards that read : “ The Institute for Energy Solutions is a joke .
So is clean coal . ”
The cards were signed Greenpeace .
Muffett said the environmental action group merely copied a tactic used by several industries , creating a benign - sounding but phony front to promote their position .
Gerard McCloskey , chairman of the consulting and publishing company that bears his name , said it was his second experience with Greenpeace recently .
The group disrupted a conference in London several months ago , and he decided to try to have a conversation with Greenpeace , McCloskey said .
“ I thought what we should do was engage them , ” McCloskey said .
“ All of us have children , grandchildren .
It was good to see Greenpeace here willing to put their argument out . ”
As the conference broke for lunch Thursday , Greenpeace had three children , including Muffett ’s nine - year - old daughter , handing out asthma inhalers and masks .
That offended some attendees .
“ I think that using kids ... was inappropriate , ” McCloskey said .
Muffett demurred , saying one of the 12 - year - old boys has asthma and the youngsters wanted to be there .
“ What to me is unconscionable is to sell a product when you know it gives children asthma , ” Muffett said .
Muffett said he was pleased with the effort and called the conference attendees “ quite receptive ” after they listened quietly and responded to his remarks with polite applause .
“ Maybe the coal industry ’s excessively polite , ” McCloskey said .
The second time Muffett addressed the conference , however , a moderator cut off his speech before it ended .
McCloskey said he would like to address a Greenpeace meeting .
“ I would like to persuade them that they ’re wrong in key areas , ” he said .
