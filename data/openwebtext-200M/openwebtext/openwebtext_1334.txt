Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas on Wednesday filed criminal charges against Gary Donahoe , presiding criminal judge of Superior Court , accusing him of hindering prosecution , obstructing a criminal investigation and bribery .
The three felony charges relate to Donahoe 's handling of criminal investigations into county officials , particularly a controversial court tower under construction in downtown Phoenix .
Thomas and Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who stood side by side during a news conference Wednesday , have repeatedly questioned the $ 340 million joint project of the Superior Court and Maricopa County government .
The charges claim Donahoe failed to disclose an attorney - client relationship with two lawyers hired to represent the county on issues related to the court tower 's construction and Thomas and Arpaio 's ongoing investigations .
Donahoe would not comment on the charges Wednesday .
The sheriff and the county attorney have battled elected and appointed county officials for more than a year .
The charges against Donahoe come a week after Thomas and Arpaio filed a suit in federal court alleging racketeering and conspiracy among county officials , judges including Donahoe , and private attorneys .
And they come a day after Thomas announced criminal indictments against county Supervisors Don Stapley and Mary Rose Wilcox .
On Wednesday , Thomas declared that county government is corrupt because of a " triad " that includes the Board of Supervisors , the court and the private attorneys .
He also suggested that there will be ongoing criminal investigations and possibly more criminal charges against the other defendants named in the federal suit .
The charges were released hours before Donahoe was scheduled to hear arguments on whether the Board of Supervisors and county management have authority over Thomas ' appointment of a pair of outside prosecutors to investigate allegations against Stapley .
County officials have tried to block funding for their appointment and asked a court to rule on the issue , which Thomas said was related to the obstruction charge against Donahoe .
Donahoe canceled the hearing Wednesday morning , though Thomas said he should have vacated it because of conflict of interest as soon as he was named a defendant in the federal suit .
" The hearing itself ( would have been ) a crime , " Thomas said , because it would reveal grand - jury information .
Thomas stopped short of saying the various legal actions were a strategy to stop Wednesday 's hearing .
Direct complaint
According to the complaint , Donahoe , who has been presiding criminal judge since early 2008 , quashed grand - jury subpoenas relating to the court tower without revealing an attorney - client relationship with Tom Irvine and Ed Novak , the attorneys who sought to have the subpoenas quashed on behalf of the county .
That led to the hindering and obstruction charges .
Bribery has a broad definition under Arizona law , and Thomas said he does not believe any money changed hands .
But he accused Donahoe of accepting an unspecified benefit from Irvine and Novak .
Donahoe had previously ruled that Thomas had a conflict of interest and could not proceed with the court - tower investigation because he could not prosecute county officials , whom he also represents as county attorney .
Tuesday 's indictments and Wednesday 's criminal complaint were quickly moved out of Maricopa County Superior Court .
Barbara Mundell , presiding judge of Maricopa County Superior Court , who also was targeted in the federal suit , referred the Stapley and Wilcox cases to the Pima County Superior Court , and the Donahoe matter to the Arizona Supreme Court .
Supreme Court Chief Justice Rebecca
White Berch ordered that the case be heard by Judge William O'Neil of Pinal County Superior Court .
' Unprecedented ' step
Although judges are not immune from prosecution - a Maricopa County Superior Court judge was convicted of marijuana possession in the late 1980s - court observers cannot recall a judge charged by the county attorney in his own court .
James Belanger , a Phoenix defense attorney who represents lawyers on ethical issues with the State Bar of Arizona , called Thomas ' latest action unprecedented .
" This is , in my opinion , an abuse of process , " he said .
He said the move is intended to create a legal conflict , forcing judges off of Thomas ' cases .
" And that , in my opinion , violates Arizona 's ethical rules of professional responsibility for lawyers . "
Stephen Gerst , a retired Superior Court judge and Phoenix School of Law professor , said many of the allegations against Donahoe were based on his actions in open court and therefore protected .
" I 've never seen ( a criminal complaint ) filed against a sitting judge before except by a prisoner , " Gerst said .
" It 's almost a complete defense unless a judge is acting outside the scope of his employment . "
Belanger said if Thomas believed Donahoe committed a crime , he had other options .
" It strikes me that you could have , for example , asked the FBI . . . the U.S. Attorney 's Office , the Attorney General 's Office to investigate , " he said .
But Thomas and Arpaio say they are investigating Attorney General Terry Goddard , and on Wednesday , Thomas acknowledged that the U.S. Attorney 's Office was not interested in a previous case he pursued against Stapley .
Charges in that case , involving financial - disclosure issues , were dropped or dismissed , though some issues remain on appeal .
Judicial review
Donahoe , a former urban planner , received his law degree from Arizona State University in 1979 , and he was a civil attorney in private practice until he became a court commissioner in 1989 .
In 2000 , he was appointed to the Superior Court bench as a judge and kept a low profile until Presiding Judge Mundell appointed him to head the criminal bench early last year .
Superior Court judges in Arizona 's two largest counties , Maricopa and Pima , are appointed to the bench by the governor , who picks from a short list vetted by a merit - selection committee .
Judges in all other counties are publicly elected .
Every four years , the merit - selected judges are evaluated by questionnaires filled out by attorneys and court customers , then stand for a " retention " election in which voters decide whether they should stay in office .
All judges are not evaluated in every election , and only two judges have ever been ousted from office ; the last was in 1974 .
Even Philip Marquardt , the judge convicted of drug possession , was retained , although he voluntarily left the bench .
The Arizona Supreme Court maintains authority over all courts .
Donahoe 's last Judicial Performance Review , in 2002 , resulted in most respondents rating him as " very good " or " superior . "
Donahoe must appear before a judge for an initial appearance within 10 days .
He then must have a preliminary hearing before a judge or be indicted by a grand jury within 20 days after that .
Republican Gov. Jan Brewer says Arizona 's economic future may hinge on making the state a hub for renewable - and nuclear - energy development that can both power the state and drive job creation .
Speaking Tuesday in Phoenix at a gathering of the Business Summit of the West , Brewer laid out what she called " a vision for Arizona 's second century . "
It 's one that leans heavily on the production of wind , solar and other leading - edge technologies as she looks to position the state as a leader in green energy .
Brewer also said it 's time to revisit an older power source : nuclear .
" Let there be no doubt .
Let there be no mistake .
Let there be no mischaracterization : I 'm a strong advocate for the development of more nuclear energy in Arizona , " Brewer told the conference of elected officials and business leaders at the Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa .
" Nuclear power is at the cornerstone of our clean - energy future . "
Her words come two decades after the completion of the state 's Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station .
The triple - reactor plant 50 miles west of downtown Phoenix was the nation 's last such facility to come online .
Nuclear power is not considered renewable energy in the strictest sense .
But Brewer stressed its value as a consistent energy source with stable costs and no greenhouse - gas emissions .
There are about 3,000 employees at Palo Verde .
Even more promising in terms of job production are renewable energies , for which Brewer believes the state is well - suited with its wealth of sunshine , available workforce and corporate - tax incentives .
She pointed to the early success of tax incentives signed into law last year , which played a critical role in landing Suntech Power Holdings Co .
The Chinese solar - panel maker plans to build a 100,000 - square - foot Arizona factory .
" I assure you , it will not be the last one .
I am committed to making Arizona the solar capital of the world , " Brewer said .
" In Arizona , we are firing on all cylinders . . . to attract renewable - energy industries . "
Alternative energy represents " probably the most promising area of new job growth " for the state , said Glenn Hamer , executive director of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
In that regard , he said Tuesday 's address figures to be instrumental in terms of rolling out Arizona 's proverbial welcome mat to companies worldwide on the leading edge of energy production .
Said Hamer : " It 's going to lead to a lot of points on the board when it comes to renewable - energy companies locating here . "
Building off the solar tax credits already in place , Brewer said she 'd like to identify additional incentives as well as the regulatory burdens , the so - called " green tape , " preventing new development .
She signed two executive orders Tuesday that will create a Solar Energy Advisory Task Force and direct state agencies , public universities and other entities to coordinate planning for the development of renewable - energy projects .
Some of Brewer 's most pointed language came on the issue of nuclear energy .
Any such nuclear development would have to be approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission and undergo a lengthy federal permitting process .
Brewer 's willingness to so enthusiastically endorse nuclear power came as a surprise to some in the crowd - even those in the energy industry .
" She was passionate about it .
She was almost strident .
I said , ' Wow , ' " said Martin Shultz , vice president of intergovernmental affairs for Pinnacle West Capital Corp. , parent of Arizona Public Service , which operates Palo Verde .
This is just Brewer 's latest foray into nuclear energy .
In recent months , she backed the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality when it issued permits to a company interested in mining uranium in northern Arizona .
She also objected to a proposal by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to withdraw uranium - mining claims on federal land near the Grand Canyon .
Sandy Bahr of the Sierra Club called Brewer 's statements Tuesday a mistake , adding : " It 's sad that she includes nuclear power in the same discussion about truly clean and renewable energies . "
Bahr noted the environmental costs that come with mining uranium and storing the radioactive waste from nuclear power .
Those issues , along with political opposition , extensive federal permitting and up - front construction costs that can run into the tens of billions of dollars are central to why no new nuclear plant has been ordered in the United States in 30 years .
Obstacles aside , Shultz applauded Brewer for recognizing Arizona 's need for a host of energy choices in the years ahead .
" She 's trying to be realistic about Arizona 's energy needs , " Shultz said .
The U.S. Supreme Court today granted certiorari in the case of Christian Legal Society v. Martinez , in which a Christian student group challenges a decision of the University of California Hastings Law School to deny official recognition to the group for failure to abide by the school ’s non-discrimination policy .
That policy requires that membership and leadership positions be open to all students .
The Christian Legal Society ’s Hastings chapter requires members to sign a statement of faith that vows devotion to Jesus Christ , thereby excluding non-Christians from membership .
The Society ’s Statement of Faith has also been interpreted to exclude gay and lesbian students .
As a result , Hastings denied the Society official recognition and the benefits of recognition , including student activity fee funding .
The Christian Legal Society says it has a right to equal access to school funds and meeting space , even though it discriminates against non-Christian and gay and lesbian students .
The CLS is appealing a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit , which held that the law school ’s action was " viewpoint neutral and reasonable . "
The 9th Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that the University ’s anti-discrimination rules are permissible , regardless of whether they regulate speech or conduct .
The lower court decided that even if the school ’s policy is a regulation of speech , the school created a limited public forum , so that reasonable , viewpoint - neutral regulations are permissible .
The court held that even though the policy particularly affected a group with a certain perspective or belief system , this did not render the policy viewpoint based ; the policy applied to all student groups , not just religious groups , and contained no language targeting a specific viewpoint .
The court also found that the school was not forcing the Christian Legal Society to admit any student as a member or officer ; it was merely placing a condition on receiving university funding and using campus facilities .
The Christian Legal Society points out that the 9th Circuit decision conflicts with a 2006 7th Circuit decision involving the same organization , Christian Legal Society v. Walker .
In that case , the appellate court found that the Society ’s ability to convey its message would be hampered if it was forced to accept members who disagree with it .
It found that the state school had no compelling interest in imposing the policy on the organization .
Cases like these have a tendency to divide First Amendment defenders .
Some argue that forcing religious student organizations to open their membership and leadership to all would undermine religious students ’ right to free association and expression .
But remember that the University is not barring CLS members from associating ; it is only denying their association official recognition and funding .
Should a public university be forced to recognize and fund a racist student organization , in violation of its general , viewpoint - neutral policy of non-discrimination , because the organization ’s racist beliefs are grounded in religion or in a right of free association ?
This would seem to be the implication .
Or consider granting exceptions to non-discrimination policies in the interest of accommodating religious student groups .
How is it " equal treatment " to say that student organizations engaging in discrimination cannot receive funding , unless the organization is a religious one ?

Animal sacrifice is a vital part of life for many South Africans
A bull - killing ritual can go ahead on Saturday after a court ruled against an animal rights group which tried to have the practice banned in South Africa .
The bull is killed during the Ukushwama ritual , an annual thanksgiving event in Kwa - Zulu Natal , in which youngsters kill the animal using their hands .
Animal Rights Africa took the Zulu king and the government to court over the manner in which the bull is killed .
ARA says it will consult its lawyers on what do next .
During his judgement the Pietermaritzburg High Court , Judge Nic van der Reyden said he was satisfied with the evidence of cultural expert Professor Jabulani Mapalala that the ARA 's objection to the ritual was based on untrue information and hearsay , reports Sapa news agency .
' Cruel and protracted ' ARA claimed that the killing took some 40 minutes and involved dozens of men trampling on the beast as they tried to break its neck .
I am very happy that I am going to participate in a cultural practice that is very sacred and dear to us as Zulu people
Albert Mncwango
Inkatha Freedom Party
The organisation described the killing as " cruel and protracted " .
ARA 's Michelle Pikover told the BBC that it took King Goodwill Zwelithini to court " as a last resort " .
" There had been various attempts over the years by other organisations to approach the Zulu royal household to engage them on that particular aspect - the manner in which the animal is killed .
" There 've been no meetings at all .
In fact the door has been completely closed which is why we took the matter to court , " she said .
The court 's decision has caused mixed reactions .
Inkatha Freedom Party Member of Parliament , Albert Mncwango told the BBC that the killing " does n't even take a minute " .
Mr Mncwango has to attend a number of these ceremonies and says they are an important part of Zulu culture .
" As a Zulu I am very happy that I am going to participate in a cultural practice that is very sacred and dear to us as Zulu people , " he said .
A time to " thank God for the first fruits of the season " .
Ms Pikover said she was " very disappointed at the ruling " .
" It 's a very sad day for dignity , respect and compassion , " she told the BBC .
The ritual is to take place in Kwa - Nongoma in President Jacob Zuma 's home province .

A see - through frog and a gecko the size of a pencil eraser are among rare and new species spotted in Ecuador .
This story is too funny , but it takes a little background .
Mike Adams is an alt - med pusher ; he writes at Natural News , a website chock - full - o ' nonsense about vaccines , homeopathy , and so on .
Regular readers may remember Mr. Adams from his particularly vile and horrific diatribe about real medicine after Patrick Swayze died .
Adams claims to want to help people , but instead peddles all manners of treatments that are known not to work at all .
So that ought to give you a picture of how Adams operates .
The Shorty Awards are a popular new internet award for people who use Twitter .
It allows tweeters to vote for someone in various categories like science , humor , celebrity , and , oh , say , health .
Adams , who tweets under the name HealthRanger , was doing well with votes in the Shorties last week , well ahead of everyone else .
In second place was another alt - med antivax promoter named Joe Mercola .
I 've written about him before as well .
But then skeptic Tim Farley noticed something -- a lot of votes going to Mercola and Adams were coming from brand new Twitter accounts with only one actual tweet : a vote for Mercola or Adams for the Shorties .
Hmmm .
Now , someone who may be a bit conspiracy - minded might assume that either Mercola or Adams , or their followers , might be working a campaign to stuff the ballot box by setting up fake Twitter accounts for the sole purpose of making sure these alt - med public health threats would win the Shorty award in health .
So Tim tweeted about it , and a bunch of us started to promote our friend Australian Rachael Dunlop , who has been tirelessly fighting alternative medicine quackery for years .
Within a few days Rachael had moved into first place .
Yay !
But there 's more !
Tim ( as well as several others , including me ) reported Mercola 's and Adams ' voter fraud to the people at the Shorty Awards .
Today it was announced that Adams was being removed from the contest due to this fraudulent ballot stuffing .
Adams , of course , took this all in stride and has been gracious and self - deprecating about it all .
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA !
Oh my .
Of course he has n't .
Instead , he posted what can only be called a frothing rant about this , accusing the Shorty Awards and many of us reality - based people with all kinds of evil doing .
You have to read his diatribe to believe anyone could post something so filled with rage , righteous indignation , logical fallacies , made - up transgressions , self - contradictions , and paranoid conspiracy mongering .
It 's really a masterpiece of woo - based garment - rendering nonsense .
He 's even threatened to sue !
Maybe he should win a Shorty Award for fiction .
To be fair , I actually do n't think Adams should have been disqualified ; we do n't know who set up the fake votes for him .
It might have been just one overzealous altmed fan .
What should have happened was all the fake votes should have been struck from the count -- a large fraction -- and then let the most popular person win .
It hardly matters anyway , since Rachael is so far out front that she 'll win anyway .
But it would be the fair thing to do .
Not that this would assuage Adams anyway .
Since he does n't deal with anything using facts and logic in the first place , he 'll just continue to post his nonsense as he pleases .
Orac posted a lovely satirical takedown of all this , which is worth reading .
It 's always a good idea to keep yourself abreast of what these people are like .
The alt - med movement talks a good game about the evil of Big Pharma and Western Medicine , and also claim they want to help people out of the goodness of their hearts ... but when you actually get a glimpse of what 's in their hearts , well , it 's not exactly rainbows and unicorns .

Light Stage is a special effects system for films that records how people and objects look when lit from every possible direction .
That way , virtual versions of actors can be accurately " lit " to perfectly match the background set .
You 've probably seen the magic of Light Stage ( and not realized it ) in fils like Spider - Man 2 , Peter Jackson 's King Kong , The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , and many other films .
The Light Stage systems was first developed by Paul Debevec , a brilliant graphics researcher at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies who I first met ( and wrote about ) when we were grad students at UC Berkeley in the 1990s .
Now , Debevec , and his colleagues Tim Hawkins of LightStage LLC , John Monos of Sony Pictures Imageworks , and Mark Sagar of WETA Digital received a Scientific and Engineering Academy Award for their work .
I 'm really proud of Paul .
I distinctly remember when he first blew my mind with a demonstration of a photorealistic virtual fly - through film he had made of UC Berkeley 's Campanille tower from photos acquired using kite aerial photography .
The technique was later used in The Matrix 's " Bullet Time " sequences .
Congratulations , Paul and team !
More info and Paul 's demo video from TED after the jump .
From the ICT press release :
Based on original research led by Debevec at the University of California at Berkeley and published at the 2000 SIGGRAPH conference , the Light Stage systems efficiently capture how an actor 's face appears when lit from every possible lighting direction .
From this captured imagery , specialized algorithms create realistic virtual renditions of the actor in the illumination of any location or set , faithfully reproducing the color , texture , shine , shading , and translucency of the actor 's skin .
While the first Light Stage had just one spotlight which spiraled around on a wooden gantry , Light Stage 2 built at USC's Institute for Creative Technologies featured thirty bright strobe lights on a ten foot semicircular arm which rotated to capture detailed facial reflectance in just eight seconds .

Cambridge , Massachusetts —
In 1989 , at the apogee of his exceedingly rebellious teenage years , my brother 's band released their first full - length record ( 1,000 copies , available on both black and red vinyl ) .
To be iconoclastic in the suburbs of Boston — especially the progressive pocket where we grew up — was rather difficult .
Everyone in high school smoked pot and drank beer , and everyone 's parents had stumped for Mike Dukakis the previous year .
So the hardcore punk band in which he played drums was " straight edge " — i.e. , no booze or drugs allowed ( a commandment he abandoned the following year ) — and the record would open with the song " Nuke the Duke , " a full - frontal assault on Dukakis and the tyranny of " Taxachusetts . "
Perhaps , as with so much punk rock , the inevitable has finally happened : dissenting from Massachusetts political orthodoxy has finally been " commodified " by the mainstream .
In this bluest of blue states , I have been following Republican Senate hopeful Scott Brown and Democratic gaffemaster Martha Coakley as they weave their way back to Boston .
I have spent the past few days talking to union members , former Democrats , current Democrats , Kennedy voters , former Deval Patrick enthusiasts , and gay rights campaigners who are — as almost all of them say — Scott Brown supporters worried about the " explosive growth of government . "
All natives of the commonwealth and reflexively Democratic , they kvetch about spending , taxes , and health care .
As one member of a pipefitters union told me , " none of the guys in my union trust that Obama wo n't hit us with that 40 percent health care tax . "
When I was a student in this state , before one could get any book overnighted from Amazon.com , I had to special order Road to Serfdom from a local bookstore .
On Sunday , in front of Northeastern University , I chatted with a Massachusetts native — if I recall , he had an accent as broad as the Shannon , though after a day one tends not to notice the " bubblahs " and " packies " — carrying a hand - lettered sign that made reference to Hayek and his 1944 classic defense of classical liberalism .
At a rally in Littleton ( Obama 58 , McCain 41 ) , almost every car that drove by honked horns in support of Scott Brown and more than a few people explained that they had always voted for Teddy Kennedy .
What on earth is happening here ?
A local Republican Party Chairman was blunt :
It 's health care , big government , and national security that are driving Brown 's spectacular bounce in the polls , but no one in state party politics expected something like this .
To lose by 15 points would , this time last month , have been considered a good , if not really good , result .
Everywhere I turn there are r-dropping Bostonians complaining about government , insisting that Americans need to " take their country back . "
One woman , who seemed overly familiar with all of my childhood neighbors — the Flynns , the McBreens — compares herself to a passenger on Flight 93 who wants to yell " let 's roll " and regain control of our hijacked country .
Or perhaps she was suggesting that President Obama is a Muslim .
It was , like many of the arguments I heard , not completely clear .
Those who say that the foot soldiers coming out in the bitter cold , in a wet and soggy snow , to hoot and holler for Scott Brown are hirelings , out - of - staters , both teabaggers and carpetbaggers , are talking nonsense .
I came across a man from Michigan selling " second American revolution " flags , an Atlanta native who , veins popping on his neck , told me that the government was run by " thieves , " a woman from Pittsburgh who " blogs on Facebook " ( whatever that means ) , and a handful of people from New Hampshire who would rather die than not live free .
Or so their license plates informed me .
But most were like Nick Redmond , a native of Dorchester — the neighborhood famous outside Massachusetts for bequeathing New Kids on the Block and Donna Summer to American culture — who was voting for Scott Brown because , under the current administration , " the middle class is getting screwed . "
Or John Camuso , a gay man from Boston who said he was " proud to give [ Brown ] my vote , " despite thinking that Coakley , whom he knew from his neighborhood , was a " nice lady . "
Perhaps this explains Coakley 's appearance last night at the Eire Bar in Dorchester , a redoubt of working class , union - affiliated Irish Catholics .
The crowd was surprisingly small and unsurprisingly sedate .
The candidate gave no speech , was surrounded by union heavies and representatives of local media , and quietly sipped a pint of Guinness .
Across the bar , a boisterous Belfast native called Larry was holding a Brown sign and telling the Coakley people who surrounded him , hoisting their own signs , to " fuck off . "
When we spoke , Larry identified himself as a conservative , a union member , a supporter of Sinn Fein , and a Scott Brown voter .
" Obama has demonized every facet of the private sector [ and his policies ] have given us huge unemployment , " he says .
Outside , a Nigerian man in a red , white , and blue vest and holding a Coakley sign patiently explained to me that Israel was his " favorite country in the world " ; that African - Americans need lessons in entrepreneurship from Nigerians ; and that because of a Muslim student in the chemistry department at his local university , he received an unfair C+ on a recent exam .
" I am the American dream , " he proclaimed .
Nigerian Zionists for Coakley .
Irish Republicans for Brown .
It is becoming increasingly difficult to make sense of any of this .
This much is , and has always been , clear :
The working class Massachusetts Democrat — or the constantly referenced Reagan Democrat — is n't so hip to , say , gay rights or political correctness and cannot be counted on as a natural Democrat .
One registered Democrat I spoke to launched into an incoherent rant about a friend who has a " faggot purple phone . "
These guys support labor unions , not civil unions .
And if they can ignore the social stuff that makes them uncomfortable and pull the lever for a Democrat , what 's to stop them from rolling the dice on Brown , who the Coakley campaign accuses of being a mustache - twisting free trader who will ship Massachusetts jobs to " India and China " ?
Here , again , the issue seems to be concerns over health care and rising taxes trumping union - stoked fears of foreign competition .
At the Obama event on Sunday , the union guys were hard to spot ( though a small contingent of " SEIU for Brown " supporters were camped in the middle of Huntington Avenue ) .
Perhaps they were all inside the Obama revival tent , but the Brown contingent outside Northeastern was large , loud , and energized , while the Coakley sign carriers not only look drained of energy , they look defeated and depressed .
They are also in no mood to be forgiving .
As I walk towards the front lines , looking to take the temperature of these morose supporters of a floundering campaign , I am shouted at by a small woman in a North Face jacket and New Balance sneakers — i.e. , the middle - aged Cambridge liberal uniform .
" We have been here since this morning .
Go stand somewhere else . "
They are waiting to see the Obama motorcade .
" No , no .
I do n't want your space , I just wanted to ask you a few questions . "
Another shouts , " Who do you write for ? "
" Reason magazine . "
" Heathen magazine ? "
" No…R - E - A … "
" You wanna quote ? " someone yells .
I make eye contact with a flame - haired , sign - toting Coakleyite .
He looks like an extra from Gangs of New York ; a prize fighter from Sligo .
" Here 's your quote : Scott Brown sucks . "
And there you have it .
As one Massachusetts libertarian said to me , no one is voting for Martha Coakley .
They are voting against Scott Brown .
All polls look rather promising for a Brown upset , but it 's too close to call — and after all , as every Republican official has told me , this is still Massachusetts .

How is the American economy supposed to limp its way back towards some pitiful semblance of prosperity when every time a city has a nice space that would be perfect for a cash - earning business , woops , a church just stole it ?
This is happening !
Did you know that a church does not contribute a god damn thing economically , and , to the contrary , pays no taxes at all while still consuming city services such as firefighter responses when heathens burst into flames ?
It is true .
Churches contribute less to the public coffers than more civic - minded businesses like strip clubs and sex shops and Satanic apparel outlet stores .
The WSJ reports that America 's entire tumbleweed - strewn business district is hamstrung by a preponderance of freeloading houses of worship , popping up faster than toadstools on the cow shit of the recession .
The City of San Diego fought for two years to prevent a church from settling in an industrial park , which the city said was meant for job - creating businesses , not worship .
Something useful — not church .
When will Jesus start paying his fair share ?

Four in ten workers are worried about the possibility of being made redundant during the next 12 months , according to a new Ipsos MORI poll published today .
The survey of 1,500 people , which was conducted between July and September shows that fear of redundancy is at its highest since the poll began in 1999 .
Forty - eight per cent of full - time private sector employees said they were concerned about losing their job over the next year compared to just 24 per cent of public sector workers .
However , the poll reveals that in terms of worrying about their personal financial situation , 46 per cent of State employees believe their finances will decline as against 32 per cent of private sector workers .
“ These latest figures indicate that for many of those working in this sector , cuts in public sector pay are seen as a likely outcome of the upcoming Budget , " said Kieran O’Leary , research director at Ipsos MORI .
“ Furthermore , despite a slowdown in increases in the rate of unemployment , fears of redundancy remain a real concern for many private and public sector workers alike ” .
The underlying outlook about the Irish economy remains pessimistic among consumers , with 64 per cent of respondents saying they think it will worsen over the coming 12 months , and 11 per cent thinking it will improve .

Albert Exergian created this series of posters depicting popular television shows boiled down into their most simplified forms .
He describes them as “ A HUMOROUS VIEW ON TV CULTURE ” but they do n’t strike me as being particularly humorous .
Intriguing is a better word , Exergian ’s sense of efficiency is uncanny .
This would make a great set of screen prints , if only he were selling them .
I guess he might have some legal issues though .
Although , he ’s only really putting words on a page ; does writing “ Dexter ” ( my favorite poster by the way ) constitute copyright infringement ?
I hope not .
Anyways , if anyone knows where to get prints of these , please let me know .

Update : Found better images over at Blanka , but the following gripe still stands !
Major tangent here : Sorry for the white lines around the edges , I got these directly from Exergian ’s site and that ’s how they came .
This brings up a HUGE gripe I have with Photoshop :
If you do n’t flatten a file before you resize it , the edges tend to show through to the transparent background so when you save as JPEG , it ends up with these annoying white lines .
I have no idea why this is so , but it is .
I guess it ’s time for another “ Dear Adobe ” post .

LIKE many New York bachelors , John Durant tries to keep his apartment presentable — just in case he should ever bring home a future Mrs. Durant .
He shares the fifth - floor walk - up with three of his buddies , but the place is tidy and he never forgets to water the plants .
The one thing that Mr. Durant worries might spook a female guest is his most recent purchase : a three - foot - tall refrigerated meat locker that sits in a corner of his living room .
That is where he keeps his organ meat and deer ribs .
Mr. Durant , 26 , who works in online advertising , is part of a small New York subculture whose members seek good health through a selective return to the habits of their Paleolithic ancestors .
Or as he and some of his friends describe themselves , they are cavemen .
The caveman lifestyle , in Mr. Durant ’s interpretation , involves eating large quantities of meat and then fasting between meals to approximate the lean times that his distant ancestors faced between hunts .
Vegetables and fruit are fine , but he avoids foods like bread that were unavailable before the invention of agriculture .
Mr. Durant believes the human body evolved for a hunter - gatherer lifestyle , and his goal is to wean himself off what he sees as many millenniums of bad habits .
Mohammad Ajmal Kasab , the only gunman captured alive in last year ’s Mumbai attacks that killed more than 160 people , today unexpectedly retracted his confession about his role in the attacks , fueling speculation about the future of his high - profile trial , which the prosecution earlier claimed would end in days .
In a bizarre twist , Mr. Kasab denied his involvement in the attacks , alleging that he had arrived in Mumbai 20 days before it happened to find work in Bollywood films .
He claimed the Mumbai police had framed him , and that all his previous confessions were false and made under duress .
The prosecution claims that Kasab ’s retraction , just one of the many twists in his trial since it began in May , is not likely to have an “ adverse effect on the trial . ”
Ujwal Nikam , the chief prosecutor , dismissed his statement as a shrewd ploy of a “ dramatic actor ” and a soulless terrorist “ trained to manipulate people . ”
He said it was a bid to prolong his trial .
Kasab , who is 21 and was dubbed the “ baby - faced killer , ” launched a commando - style raid with nine other gunmen in Mumbai in November 2008 , killing nearly 166 people .
The only survivor among 10 terrorists , he became a poster boy for terror after he was photographed marching through Mumbai with his gun bared .
When the judge today questioned him about the photograph , the most clinching evidence of his involvement , Kasab responded , it “ was not me , but someone who resembles me . ”
On Wednesday , the prosecution rested its case after 610 witnesses testified against Kasab .
He faces 86 criminal charges slapped on Kasab , including charges of murder and waging war against the state , crimes that transmit the death penalty if proven guilty .
Not his first retraction
Kasab ’s retraction today is not his first .
When his trial began in early May in a special courtroom inside Arthur Road Jail , Mumbai ’s largest and oldest prison , Kasab firmly pleaded not guilty .
This was after he had admitted to his crime in jail , where he allegedly stated that he had been trained by a Pakistani Army major .
But in court , he retracted his confession , claiming that he was physically tortured and coerced by the police .
Kasab was uncooperative with the prosecution , unruly and overly talkative on some occasions , and cold and indifferent on many others .
When some witnesses narrated heart - rending tales of loss while testifying against him , he burst into giggles .
But as weeks passed , he became quieter .
There were signs that the trial was taking a psychological toll .
In July , nearly three months after his trial began , in a dramatic outburst in the court , Kasab pleaded guilty .
His confession , which surprised his own lawyer , was almost theatrical .
“ I do not want punishment from God , ” he said .
“ Whatever I have done in this world I should get punished for it by this world itself . ”

For research published earlier this year , physiologists at Nebraska Wesleyan University had distance - running members of the school ’s track and field team sit on the ground , legs stretched before them , feet pressed firmly up against a box ; then the runners , both men and women , bent forward , reaching as far as they could past their toes .
This is the classic sit - and - reach test , a well - established measurement of hamstring flexibility .
The runners , as a group , did n’t have exceptional elasticity , although this varied from person to person .
Overall , the women were more supple , as might have been expected .
Far more telling was the correlation between the various runners ’ tight or loose hamstring muscles and their running economy , a measure of how much oxygen they used while striding .
Economy is often cited as one of the factors that divide great runners from merely fast ones .
Kenyan distance runners , for instance , have been found to be significantly more economical in their running than comparable Western elites .
When the Nebraska Wesleyan researchers compared the runners ’ sit-and - reach scores to the measurements of their economy , which had been garnered from a treadmill test , they found that , across the board , the tightest runners were the most economical .
This was true throughout the groups and within the genders .
The inflexible men were more economical than the women , and for both men and women , those with the tightest hamstrings had the best running economy .
They also typically had the fastest 10 - kilometer race times .
Probably , the researchers concluded , tighter muscles allow “ for greater elastic energy storage and use ” during each stride .
Inflexibility , in other words , seems to make running easier .
For years , flexibility has been widely considered a cornerstone of health and fitness .
Many of us stretch before or after every workout and fret if we can’t lean over and touch our toes .
We gape enviously at yogis wrapping their legs around their ears .
“ It ’s been drummed into people that they should stretch , stretch , stretch — that they have to be flexible , ” says Dr. Duane Knudson , professor of biomechanics at Texas State University in San Marcos , who has extensively studied flexibility and muscle response .
“ But there ’s not much scientific support for that . ”
In fact , the latest science suggests that extremely loose muscles and tendons are generally unnecessary ( unless you aspire to join a gymnastics squad ) , may be undesirable and are , for the most part , unachievable , anyway .
“ To a large degree , flexibility is genetic , ” says Dr. Malachy McHugh , the director of research for the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and an expert on flexibility .
You ’re born stretchy or not .
“ Some small portion ” of each person ’s flexibility “ is adaptable , ” McHugh adds , “ but it takes a long time and a lot of work to get even that small adaptation .
It ’s a bit depressing , really . ”
What happens to our muscles and tendons , then , when we dutifully stretch before a run or other workout ?
Does n’t this lengthen our muscles , increasing our flexibility and range of motion ?
According to the science , the answer appears to be no .
“ There are two elements ” involved in stretching a muscle , Dr. McHugh says .
One is the muscle itself .
The other is the mind , which sends various messages to the muscles and tendons telling them how to respond to your stretching when the discomfort of the stretching becomes too much .
What changes as you stretch a muscle is primarily the message , not the physical structure of the muscle .
“ You ’ll start to develop a tolerance ” for the discomfort of the stretch , Dr. McHugh says .
Your brain will allow you to hold the stretch longer .
But the muscles and tendons themselves will not have changed much .
You will feel less tight .
But even this sensation of elasticity is short - lived , Dr. McHugh says .
In a new review article of the effects of stretching that he co-wrote and that will be published soon in The Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports , he looked at the measurable impacts of a number of different stretching regimens .
What he found was that when people performed four 90 - second stretches of their hamstrings , their “ passive resistance ” to the stretching decreased by about 18 percent — they felt much looser — but the effect had passed in less than an hour .
To achieve a longer - lasting impact , and to stretch all of the muscles involved in running or other sports , he says , would probably require as much as an hour of concerted stretching .
“ And the effects still would n’t be permanent , ” he says .
“ You only see changes ” in the actual , physical structure of the muscles “ after months of stretching , for hours at a time .
Most people are n’t going to do that . ”
And most of us do n’t need to .
“ Flexibility is a functional thing , ” Dr. Knudson says .
“ You only need enough range of motion in your joints to avoid injury .
More is not necessarily better . ”
For runners , extremely tight hamstrings and joints have been found in some studies ( but not all studies ) to contribute to overuse injuries .
But somewhat tight hamstrings , as the Nebraska Wesleyan study showed , can make you more economical .
Some degree of inflexibility may make you a better runner .
How then to judge your own flexibility ?
“ The sit - and - reach test is pretty good ” for at - home evaluations , Dr. Knudson says , at least of your back and hamstring muscles .
Using a staircase , sit and straighten your legs so that your feet push against the bottom step , toes upright .
Stretch forward .
“ Try to lay your chest onto your thighs , ” he says .
If you can reach past your toes , you ’re more than flexible enough .
( No one yet has devised a way to reduce flexibility , by the way , although some Olympic - level coaches in other countries are rumored to be trying . )
If , on the other hand , “ you ca n’t get anywhere near your toes , and the lower part of your back is practically pointing backward ” as you reach , then you might need to try to increase your hamstring flexibility , Dr. Knudson says , to avoid injuring yourself while running , cycling or otherwise exercising .
You can find multiple hamstring stretches on YouTube , although you should consult with a physical therapist before replicating them at home ; proper technique is important to avoid injury .
“ You wo n’t get a lot of change , ” Dr. Knudson says , ” but a little may be all you need . ”
“ This delicious fish pie is a great excuse to pack in the veg , so use whatever you have to hand – even frozen peas !
Instead of plain old mash , I ’ve created a crispy root veg topping to add colour and texture – it ’s a bit like a rosti , only baked instead of fried .
Give it a go . ”
WHY HAVEN'T THESE STATE LEGISLATORS BEEN INDICTED ?

Illegal : forbidden by law or statute
The outlaws in Congress are gearing up for a new amnesty push to reward criminals for breaking our laws by smuggling themselves into our country , stealing our jobs and draining resources ( medical , education , law enforcement ) .
Ethically bankrupt individuals like Sens. Harry Reid , Juan McCain and Reps. Joe Baca and Luis Gutierrez will be the ring leaders in this upcoming battle .
Political correctness and outright cowardice in dealing with the invasion of close to 20 MILLION illegal aliens , regardless of country of origin , has brought nothing but misery and pain to this nation .
It has n't mattered one bit to these professional politicians that the word illegal means forbidden by law .
It has n't mattered one bit to federal judges who have ruled that criminals who break our laws have some sort of " right " to free health care , free education and other financial benefits paid for by the sweat of your labor .
Those federal judges should have been impeached by Congress .
Instead , their rulings have wrecked havoc on our people and nation while Congress has sat on their corrupt backsides and done nothing .
But , what about state legislators who have voted to give these criminals driver 's licenses so they can work ?
Remember what the usurper in the White House , Obama / Soetoro said , " When I was a state senator in Illinois , I voted to require that illegal aliens get trained , get a license , get insurance to protect public safety .
That was my intention .
The problem we have here is not driver 's licenses .
Undocumented workers do not come here to drive .
They 're here to work . "
They 're here to work ?
They have no right to even be in this country , much less help themselves to jobs that belong to Americans .
Comrade Obama wants to reward them by stealing the fruits of your labor to train them , give them driver 's licenses and steal American jobs .
This is the morally bankrupt individual people voted for to bring " change " and " hope . "
Marxist Obama brought more of the same and worse .
Juan McCain stands right next to him on this issue .
This rot has seeped into the state houses as well .
Four states of the Union allow these criminals to have driver 's licenses : Hawaii , New Mexico , Washington and Utah .
Those state legislatures are aiding and abetting criminals who have violated federal laws .
Those legislators and the governors have signaled loud and clear that it's a good thing to reward those who break the law and rub it in our faces .
What happens when an illegal with a Utah driver 's license hits and kills an American citizen in San Diego and then skips across the border ?
Are we then supposed to thank Utah 's legislature for the carnage they let loose ?
At a time when unemployment is running at 17 million out of work and 37.2 million on food stamps , those MILLIONS of jobs held by illegal aliens should be going to Americans :
Illegals build F - 22 hangers on Air Force base
Real good for national security .
And , do n't try to feed me the horse crap that illegals do jobs Americans wo n't :
1,200 Illegal Workers Fired in Minnesota .
" First of all , it is clear that illegal aliens are , indeed , doing the work Americans and lawful immigrants very much want to do .
The fact that when 1,200 illegal aliens were fired as a result of a field investigation conducted by ICE ( Immigration and Customs Enforcement ) all of those jobs were quickly filled , presumably by United States citizens and lawful immigrants .
This makes it abundantly clear that as I noted in a recent commentary , " A job freed up by removing an illegal foreign worker creates a job for an American worker . "
How about the citizens of Nevada - a state on the brink of financial collapse ?
No .
Of Illegal Aliens On Welfare Doubles In Nevada .
There is no such thing as an " anchor baby . "
It is hogwash that must be stopped .
Legal research on Fourteenth Amendment is in this file .
" It is clear the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment had no intention of freely giving away American citizenship to just anyone simply because they may have been born on American soil .
Again , we are fortunate enough to have on the record the highest authority tell us , Sen. Lyman Trumbull , Chairman of the Judiciary Committee … and the one who inserted the phrase . "
Should this surprise anyone ?
Rewarding criminals only brings more :
" A new survey by Zogby International finds that people in Mexico think that granting legal status to illegal immigrants in the United States would encourage more illegal immigration to the United States ....
A clear majority of people in Mexico , 56 percent , thought giving legal status to illegal immigrants in the United States would make it more likely that people they know would go to the United States illegally . "
Can anything be done ?
The now discredited , hypocrite Lou Dobbs , brought something out on his show years ago which I wrote about :
Should Officials of the FDIC be Prosecuted ?
" The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is encouraging banks to sign up illegal aliens in the banking system , calling the growth of the market " a compelling incentive for U.S. banks to enter this largely untapped market . "
And the FDIC program demonstrates that unbanked Latin American immigrants can be brought into the financial mainstream .
" But there are clear laws on the books for the integrity of the immigration system .
United States criminal code , " It is a crime punishable by 10 years in jail for aiding and abetting someone in this country illegally for commercial gain . "
And the Bank Secrecy Act of 1972 makes it clear banks must know their customer , and any illegal activity must be reported to the government . "
Advertisement
" The FDIC , this " independent " government operation is knowingly and willfully encouraging their organization and its employees to break the law and they are openly and blatantly violating federal immigration law . "
Nothing was ever done to those lawbreakers .
No one is above the law , so why are these state legislators getting away with passing laws that reward criminals and thumb their noses at our immigration laws ?
Are state legislators given immunity to break federal laws ?
I say no , they should be held accountable .
How many state legislators have voted for laws to allow illegal aliens to attend state colleges - at the expense of taxpayers in those states ?
It 's sickening .
Illegal alien students , regardless of country of origin , have no " right " to attend any school in this country .
They suck the fruits of your labor while you struggle to help your child with college expenses .
Just because these individuals are elected to a state legislature does not give them carte blanche to simply violate federal laws .
I 'm not a lawyer , but someone show me where it says state legislators can simply break federal laws without any legal consequences ?
I did some research on this and found :
" Section 274 of the Immigration and Nationality Act , which provides criminal penalties for any act that " encourages or induces an alien to come to , enter , or reside in the United States , knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to , entry , or residence is or will be in violation of law . " [ 2 ]
" Encourage " and " induce " include actions that permit illegal aliens to be more confident that they could continue to reside with impunity in the United States , or actions that offer illegal aliens " a chance to stand equally with all other American citizens . " [ 3 ]
" To prove that a state or local government agency " encouraged or induced " illegal Mexican aliens , all the government needs to establish is that the agency knowingly helped or advised the aliens , or emboldened them , or made them more confident in their continued illegal residence in the United States . [ 4 ]
" The courts have held that INA § 274 is to be broadly construed both as to those persons subject to criminal liability under the statute , [ 5 ] and as to the types of activities covered therein . [ 6 ] "
By giving illegal aliens driver 's licenses , those state legislators have encouraged illegals to come to , enter and reside in the U.S. in violation of the law .
Those state legislators have " emboldened them " and have made illegals more " confident " in their continued illegal residence in the U.S .
Where is the Federal Department of Justice ?
They are supposed to ensure federal laws are enforced and when violated , go after the lawbreakers .
Well , the answer to that question is simple :
The DOJ has become so politicized , the Attorney General ( past and present ) does what his / her masters tells them and we the people suffer .
Eric Holder should have been indicted for obstruction of justice .
Instead , he 's Obama 's top lap dog .
Make no mistake :
The battle to reward illegal aliens for breaking into our country , stealing jobs and drowning us in crime is about to heat up once the outlaws come back from their Christmas recess .
We defeated these lawbreakers in Congress before and we must do it again .
There should also be a loud outcry by the people of those four states to their U.S. Attorney ( which has jurisdiction over their area ) to indict every single member of those four state legislatures who voted to give illegal aliens driver 's licenses .
Silence is not an option .
My daughter is a victim of illegal aliens driving on our roads and highways .
Do n't think your family member wo n't be next .
The actions of those legislators and Congress has spread now to a college professor who should be charged under Section 274 :
" Ricardo Dominguez , a University of California , San Diego tenured visual arts professor and activist , designed the Transborder Immigrant Tool , an application much like a global - positioning system used in cars , to help illegals find the best locations for food , water and groups to assist them as they sneak into America . "

Hey , if Congress condones and supports illegals as well as state legislatures , why not a college professor aiding and abetting ?
If you live in California , that dirt bag 's salary is paid for by the fruits of your labor .
Here 's more insanity :
S.F. to ease up on unlicensed drivers .
" Beginning Sunday , cops will no longer impound cars the first time drivers are pulled over without a license .
The reason : Many such drivers are in the United States illegally - and thus unable to get a license - and the officials pushing the change think that impounding their cars is an unfair hardship . "
An " unfair hardship " ?
These are illegal aliens who have violated federal immigration law and should be deported immediately .
Live in San Francisco ?
I wo n't even visit that city any more .
In 2010 , the people of Utah , Washington , New Mexico and Hawaii should drown out the militant pro-illegals organizations and push to boot out any legislator who voted to reward illegal aliens .
If you live in one of those states and your state legislator ( rep or senator ) voted to reward illegals , make it a campaign issue and work to get them thrown out of office .
The same applies to so - called sanctuary cities .
Throw out mayors like Gavin Newsom ( SF ) and restore the rule of law and order .
I have no sympathy for illegal aliens .
They need to be picked up and deported whether they 've been here five minutes , five years or fifteen years :
ALTOONA -- " Miguel Padilla , an illegal immigrant from Mexico , visited Altoona one night and murdered three people after being denied admission to a social club .
He had been in the United States for 17 years and had accumulated an arrest record before he shot his victims . "
Three lives taken and all the family members who will grieve the rest of their lives .
THIS is what supporters of amnesty and those state legislators condone and support .
I 've heard the bleeding heart rhetoric that most illegals are " good " people who just want to come here and work .
Good people do n't deliberately dump in our face by smuggling themselves across our borders when they know it 's against the law .
Good people respect the laws of other nations , not break them .
Good people do n't set out to steal someone else 's job when they have no legal right to that job .
Illegals know when they sneak across our borders like theives in the night , they have no legal right to be in our country .
And , just like any other criminal , they should not be rewarded .
You do n't get to go home and gather your belongings or anything else .
You 're arrested , thrown in lock up and then deported .
Too bad what you have to leave behind .
Had this been done decades ago ( after Ronald Reagan signed the 1986 law which opened the flood gates ) , we would n't have this problem on such a grand scale .
This is what state legislators and members of Congress who support amnesty want to reward :
Marine Cpl. Brian Mathews , 21 , was killed by a drunk illegal alien Thanksgiving evening , 2006 .
This young man on leave from serving eight months in Iraq and having completed a tour of duty in the Pacific , was out on his second date with young Jennifer Bower , age 24 .
They Died For " Cheap " Labor : " Employers of America : the blood and suffering of innocents is on your hands because you want cheap labor .
How cheap are the lives of the above and the tens of thousands of others who have suffered because of this massive , unchecked invasion ?
Does your bottom line feel good , now ?
Will you go to church on Sunday and then hob nob outside after services feeling warm and fuzzy while you have been knowingly violating federal immigration laws which has led to so much death and suffering ?
" Did you save so much money hiring illegals that you own a nice boat and can be a big shot with the boys or yuk it up on the golf course a few extra days a week ?
The same goes for every member of Congress , the four border governors and all the state legislatures who have allowed themselves to be bribed by big business and turned a blind eye for three decades .
How does " cheap labor " feel now ? "

You think rewarding them with legal driver 's licenses is going to " fix " the problem ?
Vote out all state legislators in 2010 who have voted for giving illegals driver 's licenses and college tuition .
Do n't forget Ohio as a major offender : Ohio Panders To Illegal Immigrants .
All to get votes from one ethnic group while their citizens who are natural born or legal immigrants stand in unemployment lines .
Those elected officials should also be charged under Section 274 .
Perhaps some of the great immigration groups out there can check with their lawyers to see about pursuing this so that a clear message is sent to all of them :
You cannot break the law just because you 're an elected official .

The Incredibly Small Number of ‘ Breaking ’ DIY Artists
Just how many DIY artists are really breaking into this market ?
Tough question , though Tommy Boy ( and New Music Seminar ) founder Tom Silverman recently investigated the issue using 2008 sales figures from Nielsen Soundscan .
Silverman counted 105,575 new album releases that year , and found that just 225 of those were new artists surpassing the 10,000 unit threshold for the first time .
Of that , just 14 were do - it - yourself artists , unaffiliated with a major , indie , or other entity .
Or were they ?
After digging deeper , Silverman realized that 14 was way too high .
Right off the top , Silverman nixed two from the list after confusing the names with other , previously - successful artists .
Silverman then eliminated another after discovering a partnership with indie hip - hop group Tech N9ne .
Another hip - hopper was crossed - off after a massive marketing spend came to light .
The list kept shrinking .
Another was boosted by American Idol , and another America ’s Got Talent .
A ‘ few others ’ were on ‘ small labels with big budgets , ’ according to Silverman .
And so on .
“ What does this say about the Chris Anderson ‘ Long Tail ’ promise ? ” Silverman blogged in Musician Coaching .
“ Clearly the ease of making and distributing music does not benefit ‘ breaking ’ music .
Breaking music requires mass exposure which requires luck or money or both .
I can say with great authority that less new music is breaking now in America than any other time in history .
Technology has not helped more great music rise to the top , it has inhibited it .
I know this is a bold statement but it is true . ”
So what ’s left ?
All of that sounds deflating , though Silverman pointed to opportunities at lower sales levels .
Whether artists can truly monetize smaller audiences remains an open question , though certainly , life goes beyond the recording .
“ In the meantime , artists can still make a very good living without selling 10,000 albums by careful cultivation of their fan relationships , ” Tommy Boy surmised .
Credit Suisse confirms that it is in advanced settlement discussions with the New York County District Attorney ’s Office , the United States Department of Justice , the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , and the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( " OFAC " ) .
The discussions relate to a previously disclosed investigation into US dollar payments during the period 2002 to April 2007 involving parties that are subject to US economic sanctions .
As part of the settlement , Credit Suisse is likely to pay a total of USD 536 million combined .
Credit Suisse has previously disclosed the investigation by US authorities and that it was conducting an internal review into certain US dollar payments involving countries , persons or entities that may be subject to US economic sanctions .
In December 2005 , Credit Suisse decided to exit the business in question and subsequently proactively undertook an extensive independent investigation into the Zurich - based payment activity and other practices , working closely and constructively with regulators and US authorities .
Credit Suisse ’s internal review has now been concluded and discussed with these and other government authorities including Credit Suisse ’s main regulator , the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority , FINMA .
Credit Suisse is committed to the highest standards of integrity and regulatory compliance in all its businesses , and takes this matter extremely seriously .
Credit Suisse has enhanced its procedures to prevent practices of this type from occurring in the future .
In particular , Credit Suisse :
Terminated its business with all OFAC - sanctioned parties in 2006 , including closing its representative office in Tehran ;
Enhanced its global compliance program by , among other things , appointing a global sanctions compliance officer , establishing competency centres and designating individuals responsible for coordinating and monitoring compliance with sanctions programs and enhancing its global policies , procedures and employee training programs , which will continue to be regularly reviewed for effectiveness ; and
Enhanced sanctions filters screening designed to cover incoming and outgoing transactions .
While Credit Suisse had recorded provisions for this matter through the end of the third quarter of 2009 , it expects to record an additional pre-tax charge of CHF 445 million in the current quarter , which is estimated to be approximately CHF 360 million after tax .
The City of Fresno is on the attack again .
They are willing to spend endless amounts of money to chase the homeless from one vacant lot to another .
Why wo n’t they use some of their resources to provide a safe and legal campground where the homeless can live ?
The City of Fresno tried a new approach in court today in their ongoing attempt to evict the homeless in an encampment at Ventura and F street in downtown Fresno .
They dropped their effort to get a Temporary Restraining Order ( TRO ) and convinced the judge to dismiss a case they had brought before the court .
With the court hearings over , the city now plans to move forward with the evictions , claiming the “ owner ” of the property has asked them to clear the homeless people off the land .
The city is expected to say the homeless are trespassing and subject to arrest if they do not leave .
Some homeless advocates say the city has mis-stated the ownership issue of the property and coerced the “ so called ” owner into asking for the homeless to be removed .
The legal owners of the property died and it is now in probate .
Robert and Walt Williams were in court and testified that they owned the property .
Walt Williams is the executer of the estate and will decide who owns the property .
If the homeless advocates are correct and the property is not currently owned by the Williams ’s , it could make any arrests that take place on Thursday problematic for the city .
The homeless are talking about challenging any arrests that occur in court , through civil action .
Bruce Rudd , Assistant City Manager , is telling the press tonight that they will try and force the homeless off the property tomorrow , starting at 8 a.m. , without arresting anyone .
Alan Simon , one of the homeless living on the vacant lot , told me that he ca n’t move .
Simon has a cast on his leg and says he is not capable of packing up his tent and moving it .
He says that he will stay and see what happens .
The mood in the camp this evening was defiant , with most of the people I talked to saying they would not move .
People said there was no place else to go .
The City of Fresno has no campgrounds or other facilities where people can go .
Rudd claims that The Rescue Mission has bed space available and that the homeless at F and Ventura should go there .
Rudd did not tell the media that The Rescue Mission is for men only , that you have to sit through a Christian religious service before you get a bed , or that many homeless people will not go to the Mission because of the way they treat the homeless .
Larry Arce , the Rescue Mission director , has sent his “ disciples ” into the homeless encampments to destroy their tents and other property .
Rudd is also telling the media that the homeless should avail themselves to the other services available , so they can get off the streets .
Other city officials attempt to take the moral high ground by saying they are trying to put an end to the terrible conditions at the Ventura and F street encampment .
They do not , however , explain why the city has seemingly endless amounts of money to attack the homeless in court and chase them from one vacant lot to another , but no money to establish a safe and legal campground where the homeless can live .

Rooftop Solar Installations Growing Faster than Utility - Scale Solar
January 10th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
Private solar installations are really taking off nationwide .
In just two years , ( about the same length of time it takes to get a pair of 250 MW solar power plants approved in California , for example ) , homeowners and businesses have added that much power to the Californian grid , just from individual rooftops throughout the state .
[ social_buttons ]
By July last year , 50,000 installations were supplying the California grid with 500 MW of solar power ; the equivalent of two average sized solar power plants now under review in the state .
Nearly all solar installations are now grid - connected in California , by contrast with the first wave of solar power in the 70’s when a battery was needed to supply power at night , and early adopters had to be careful not to exceed their power , turning off dishwashers on cloudy days .
Now however , nearly all solar is grid - connected , meaning that the power generated is stored in a giant battery : the grid .
Output is measured as it enters the grid , by the utility , which gives a credit for the electricity generated .
Solar installers are able to size each system so that it generates the same kwh a month as the homeowner or business uses in total ( including both nights and days ) , with the result that the credits on the utility bill will zero out the debits from night time use .
Because of the grid acting as a cheap or free battery , whereas in 1999 average installed systems were 2.5 KW and included an expensive battery , now the average system for homeowners is 4.8 KW and is grid -connected .
The growth in solar power has been fast among homeowners , and even faster among commercial building owners .
The faster adoption of commercial solar is due to the lower prices for larger scale installs ( over 500 KW cost 17 % less per watt than the under 10 KW systems typically installed on homes ) and the wider availability of Power Purchase agreements , which are usually only available to businesses .
Commercial installations grew from 19 % in 2005 to 46 % of all installations in 2008 .
As the percentage of non-utility solar being added to the grid increases , some states , like California , are looking at raising the state imposed limit .
Californian non-utility solar is now close to the current 2.5 % of the state ’s electricity coming from rooftops .
The Solar Alliance has sponsored a bill to allow up to 10 % of the state ’s electricity to be generated by private homeowners and businesses .
Other states , like North Carolina , are proposing no cap at all .

Brain injuries , even apparently " mild " ones , are often devastating and life - altering ailments .
Damage to the brain , skull and spine can leave you unable to live your life as you 've always been able to .
For specific information about what damage to different parts of the brain can do , please click the infographic to the right .
Experienced Brain Injury Lawyers

If you 're an Atlanta , Georgia resident looking at life after a brain injury caused by someone else 's negligence , please contact Watkins , Lourie , Roll & Chance , PC online or by calling our Atlanta office today at 404-760-7400 for a free consultation .
Causes of Traumatic Brain Injury
Brain injuries and traumatic brain injuries are exceptionally complicated medical issues , which means it 's best to find a lawyer who has ample experience handling these sorts of cases .
Our Georgia personal injury lawyers understand brain injuries , but more importantly , we have deep , well - established connections with respected medical professionals who can both bolster your case and provide you with the treatments needed to make the fullest recovery possible – though complete recovery from a brain injury is never guaranteed .
The immediate cause of a brain injury is relatively simple : trauma to the head resulting in damage to the skull and brain .
However , this trauma can result from a wide range of case types , including :
Our brain injury lawyers have decades of experience helping Atlanta - area residents with these case types , which means we 're equipped to handle your case .
Medical Consequences of Brain Injury
The long - term costs of brain injuries are immense , but the consequences of brain injuries obviously extend beyond a victim 's finances .
The pain and suffering of a brain injury are significant and tangible .
A traumatic brain injury can cause :
Debilitating headaches
Loss of feeling or mobility in the limbs
Depression or other mental health ailments
Mood swings , including violent shifts
Nausea
Insomnia
Death
As the victim of someone else 's negligence , you have the right to pursue compensation for these consequences , as well as for the medical expenses you have to deal with in the aftermath of a brain injury .
There are no guarantees in personal injury law , but our Atlanta personal injury law firm can stand with you and serve as your champion in this difficult time , helping ensure you are provided the compensation you will need to cover the long - term costs .
Long Term Cost of Traumatic Brain Injury
The uncomfortable reality of brain injuries , as with other significant medical trauma , is that they also result in huge medical bills .
The American medical system can do wonders in treatment , but it is an expensive process .
Without the compensation offered from a brain injury suit , you can find yourself bearing these expenses yourself .
And that 's not right .
Lifetime treatment costs for a severe traumatic brain injury can easily exceed $ 1 million , and few people have the resources on - hand to handle those costs themselves .
But why are brain injuries so expensive ?
Because everything you do and everything you are starts with your brain .
When it is damaged , you often have to re-learn basic tasks .
And because the brain is such a sensitive , important organ , treating it requires highly specialized and skilled medical professionals .
Such professionals do not work cheaply .
The costs of brain injuries can include :
Multiple , highly complex surgical procedures
Lengthy physical therapy sessions
A loss of long - term income caused by an inability to work as you did before the procedure
Expensive prescription medications , including painkillers
Mental health and other psychological treatments
All of these are necessary if you are to recover from your brain injury and live a full , healthy life .
However , they 're expensive , and insurance only covers so much .
Our Atlanta brain injury lawyers can help you bear these expensive burdens by pursuing the justice and compensation you deserve as a victim of someone else 's negligence .
Do n't allow yourself to be buried under an avalanche of medical bills when another party 's mistakes placed you in this unfortunate position .
Handling Brain Injury Cases
An individual may need ongoing medical treatment and therapy for brain injury and a lifetime of emotional and physical struggle is entirely possible – even with treatment .
Our lawyers will do a thorough assessment of your situation and provide you with a detailed cost analysis .
We will discuss medical injury costs , loss of employment and other costs you have incurred .
Our attorneys will also analyze future loss of income and future medical expenses .
We work hard to maximize our clients ' compensation .
If you have a brain injury , it is important to speak with an attorney as soon as possible .

Two of our favorite PC games over the past decade have been " The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion " and " Fallout 3 " .
Imagine , an RPG much like those two amazing games , but in the Star Trek : TOS Universe .
This could have been a reality according to Bethesda studio head Todd Howard .
Bethesda had the rights to Star Trek for a very short period and considered the game .
Unfortunately , it never made it past the pitch phase .
We found the article via The Escapist , but Howard made that revelation on Kotaku 's podcast last week .
Check out the article excerpt below .
The reason it was n't developed was due to other projects already underway , including the massive Fallout 3 .
Howard said Bethesda just " ca n't do everything , " even though he wants a " big Star Trek RPG [ where ] you go out and explore the universe . "
Forget Picard , Bethesda 's pitch put the Star Trek RPG back in the classic era .
I guess this confirms Howard 's favorite captain , though I am partial to Picard myself .
After all , he never broke when that Cardassian told him there were five lights .

This could have been absolutely amazing !
We just may have to slingshot around the sun and change history for this .

Well today is your lucky day .
Heifer International is my favorite charity .
It helps people raise themselves up out of poverty and starvation .
All over the world Heifer promotes education , sustainable agriculture , and local industry .
They do n't just keep kids from starving , they make it so families can take care of themselves .
They give goats , sheep , and chickens to families so their children have milk to drink , warm clothes to wear , and eggs to eat .
This year we 've got a couple different options for donating .
This is the option most people will want .
It 's simple .
You hop directly over to the page I 've set up at Team Heifer , and donate .
When you donate using my page at team Heifer , two things happen .
1. Worldbuilders will match 50 % of your donation .
That means your ten - dollar donation becomes fifteen dollars .
If you donate two goats , it becomes three goats .
And so on .
2 . You 'll be entered in the lottery .
After the fundraiser is over on January 15th , we 'll have random drawing for all the swag that 's been donated by authors and publishers over the last couple months .
More than a thousand books , DVD 's and CD's .
For every 10 bucks you donate , your name will get entered into the drawing once .
If you donate thirty bucks , your name goes in three times .
Think of it as buying tickets , if you like .
We 've had * way * too many books donated for me to post them all up at once .
It 's a prize - rich environment , with over a thousand books .
So I 'll be putting up a new blog full of donated books pretty much every day or so , just to keep people from being overwhelmed with all the awesome .
Make sure to check back often .

$ 106836.28 may seem like kind of a strange target , but I assure you it 's significant .
It 's exactly twice the amount that people donated last year .
If we can raise it , I think we 'll have pretty conclusive proof for the stunning awesomeness of us .
Personally , I think we can make it .
But remember , So if you 're been waiting to chip in , now 's the time .
Or , as I like to think of it , the Christmas Present option .
For those of you who are n't interested in the lottery , I have some stuff you can just buy .
All the proceeds will go directly to Heifer International .
This year we 've decided to auction off some of the rarer items and specialized services people have donated .
We 've got industry professionals willing toLastly , I 'd like to ask everyone to please read the instructions / directions carefully before they donate .
I know you 're excited .
I 'm excited too .
We 're going to raise some money , make the world a better place , and end up with big warm fuzzy feelings .
But here 's the problem .
If you 're * too * excited , you 'll end up clicking buttons all higgledy - piggledy , forgetting vital steps and leaving things out .
( Especially when buying things with Paypal )
Then you 'll send me an e-mail that says something like : " I 'm sorry , but I forgot to include my shipping address / t - shirt size / signing instructions .
Could you please fix it for me ?
" I know I 'm bound to get one or two e-mails like this .
No biggie .
But each one is like a cold drop of water eroding my warm fuzzy feeling .
If I get , say , a hundred , I 'll have no warm fuzzy left at all .
I 'll be left with nothing but a cold prickly feeling .
You do n't want to give me a cold prickly , do you ?
I 'm sure you do n't .
And I 'm sure that you 'll read the instructions carefully .
Have questions about the fundraiser ?
Most of them are probably answered over in the FAQ .
Even if your question is n't answered , I talk about Batman a bit , so it wo n't be a complete waste of your time .

The senior Republican on the tax - writing Ways and Means Committee , Representative Dave Camp of Michigan , issued a statement today rejecting President Obama ’s plans to help middle class Americans with additional tax breaks for retirement savings , education and child care , which are expected to be outlined in Wednesday evening ’s State of the Union speech .
“ What will help middle - class families most is creating jobs and reducing the unemployment rate , but these proposals wo n’t do either , ” Mr. Camp said in a statement .
“ Moreover , if these proposals are coupled with higher taxes or more mandates on small businesses , the President ’s plan could end up making it tougher for middle - class families to find a job . ”
The quick denunciation of the president ’s proposals seemed to signal a broader unwillingness among Republicans to consider Mr. Obama ’s policy proposals as the midterm election year heats up and the G.O.P. senses an opportunity to make gains in the House and Senate .
Separately on Monday , the House Republican leader , Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , issued a statement accusing Mr. Obama of defying the will of the American people by saying that he would continue to press for a broad overhaul of the nation ’s health care system .
“ Less than a week after the Massachusetts special election , the Obama Administration is vowing to ‘ stay the course ’ and double down on the same costly , job - killing policies that are leaving America ’s middle - class families and small businesses high and dry , ” Mr. Boehner said .
“ This ‘ stay the course ’ approach does n’t just apply to a government takeover of health care , ” Mr. Boehner continued .
“ Out - of - touch Washington Democrats remain committed to all their costly , job - killing priorities , including more government ‘ stimulus ’ spending , a ‘ cap - and - trade ’ national energy tax and ‘ card check . ’ ”
Card - check is a reference to legislation that Democrats have proposed that would make it easier for labor unions to organize .
Democrats call that bill the Employee Free Choice Act .

Remember
Calcium increases fat excretion and boosts testosterone .
That 's great stuff and we obviously want our calcium intake in the optimal range .
Adding a 500 - 750 mg tablet to your daily diet wíll usually do the trick .
If you get enough calcium through your diet , there 's no need to supplement it .
Emerging scientific evidence suggests that people do n't get enough vitamin D to function optimally .
The newfound interest for this vitamin and it's potential benefits was actually featured in New York Time 's Top Ten List of medical breakthroughs in 2007 .
Here 's a good ( and free ) full - text paper on vitamin D's role in health and disease .
Moreover , vitamin D may boost strength and athletic performance .
2000 IU / day is a conservative and safe dosage , but some people use considerably higher doses without any negative implications .
I use BCAA pre-workout whenever I train fasted .
You can read more on why here and here .
I prefer Purple Wraath by Controlled Labs .
It contains beta - alanine as well , which gives me a nice little tingle and also seems to aid a bit with intra-set recovery and muscle endurance in the higher rep ranges .
Take 10 g pre-workout if you train fasted .
I 've been using Xtend by Scivation for my fasted training sessions ever since stores around here ran out of Purple Wraath a few months ago .
Taste and effects wise , it 's pretty much a toss - up between Xtend and Wraath .
Price wise , Xtend can't be beaten .
Flavor wise , Xtend is very agreeable and I prefer " Refreshing Watermelon " .
Creatine is the only legal supplement with numerous scientific studies to support it 's effectiveness .
It 's so far ahead of the competition that it 's the only supplement I can place in this category with a straight face .
Besides elevating muscle creatine contents for a direct performance boost , creatine may boost muscle growth through effects on satellite cell proliferation , myogenic transcription factors and insulin - like growth factor - 1 signalling ( if that sounds like greek to you , let 's just say all of this is " good stuff " ) .
I get beta - alanine through my BCAA - supplement , but this amino acid is also availabe as a stand - alone supplement ; and as such has shown to boost exercise performance .
As I noted before , the effect is only noticeable in the higher rep ranges ( 12 reps and above ) .
The study summarizes the effect as " beta - alanine ... have demonstrated improvements in performance during multiple bouts of high - intensity exercise and in single bouts of exercise lasting more than 60 s . "
So it wo n't improve your maximal strength , but anaerobic threshold and time to exhaustion will be enhanced .
This may be particularily useful for CrossFit - practitioners and those training with kettle bells .
Ideal use is pre-and post - workout .
Optimum 100 %
Whey is the top selling product at bodybuilding .com .
I would venture to guess that 's due much to the innovative tastes available .
I 've tried Caramel Toffee Fudge and Extreme Milk Chocolate and both are very tasty .
Ideal use is pre-bedtime , but it could be used at any other time during the day as well .
Casein protein is slow releasing and provides more satiety than whey protein in general .
For the best tasting casein protein , check out this post While I 've been lucky enough to never find any use for this supplement personally , clients claim to have used it successfully for relieving joint pain .
Studies support such notions and state that glucosamine seems to be a safe and effective supplement for relieving pain and stiffness in joints .
Note that intermittent fasting potentiates the effect of stimulants .
Any stimulant ingested during the fasted phase will have a greater effect compared to it 's ingestion during the fed state .
Some caution should therefore be exercised for those not familiar with the use of stimulants .
If you 're not a regular coffee drinker , you 're really missing out by not adding caffeine to your diet when the going gets tough .
It 's cheap , suppressses appetite and has thermogenic properties
This stuff is nasty as hell .
On the plus side , it has a quite potent stimulatory effect and works very well as an appetite suppressant .
If you can't stand the horrid taste of Clenbutrx , VPX Meltdown is a great alternative .
This one actually has legit scientific backing , which is a true rarity when it comes to fat loss products .
You can read both ( free full text ) studies on Meltdown here and here .
Note the effect on resting energy expenditure .
Not bad .
This herb may be particularily useful for those trying to get rid of stubborn body fat - such as the fat covering lower abs and back in lean men and thighs and hips in lean women .
Hokey as that may sound , there is a valid explanation for how this occurs .
Lyle McDonald explains this in great detail in The Stubborn Body Fat Solution .
In short , yohimbine inhibits alpha - 2 - receptors ( and lower abs / back has a high density of a 2 - receptors ) which aids with blood flow and fat mobilization from stubborn fat areas .
Yohimbine is another fat loss product that has been proven effective in clinical trials and this is perhaps the most widely cited study on the effects of yohimbine on body composition .
Pure yohimbine may lead to feelings of anxiety and even panic attacks in predisposed individuals .
A better alternative can be found in Alpha Burn , and other supplements containing rauwolscine , which is a stereoisomer of yohimbine .
Reg from Predator Nutrition recently sent me a box of these and I can vouch for it 's psychoactive effects not being as rough as pure yohimbine .
While it wo n't make you as jumpy and jittery as yohimbine , it seems to have a pretty potent appetite suppressive effect .
L- tyrosine is a precursor ( " building block " ) to the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine .
For this reason , it has been studied in the context of performance enhancement among other things .
Although studies show mixed results , empirical evidence suggests that tyrosine has it's use as a pre-workout stimulant when combined with other substances such as caffeine .
It seems to enhance the effect of other stimulatory substances , which has been my experience as well .
Tyrosine has also shown promise in alleviating the decrements in cognitive performance associated with stress and fatigue .
For this reason , it might be useful for keeping your mind sharp during intense stints of dieting .
I 've been trying a wide range of pre-workout supplements but I 've never found something worth recommending .
Some like the extra pump from NO Xplode and similar nitric oxide based supps , I just do n't any use for it .
I was pleasantly surprised by Jack3d .
Besides the usual ingredients present in many pre-workout supplements , such as caffeine , creatine , arginine and beta- alanine , it contains 1,3 - Dimethylamylamine also known as geranamine .
This is a potent stimulant ( as far as legal alternatives goes ) and this is what provides the oomph in this product .
Apparently Geranamine is used as recreational drug in some circles and banned in a few countries .
I would n't be surprised if we 'll see more countries banning it soon as everything that is mildly effective seems to get a ban sooner or later .
Shortly after I wrote the supplements guide , Meltdown and Clenbutrx both got banned in Sweden .
Anyway , being somewhat resistant to stims , I started off with the maximum recommended dosage the first time ( three scoops ) .
After 5 - 10 minutes , I could tell that it was working as I got an intense urge to do the dishes .
During training , I did n't notice anything out of the norm besides a somewhat uncomfortable back pump after squatting .
After training , I had to wait two hours before my appetite returned .
I never have problems eating after training , especially not after fasted training , but the thought of food made me queasy .
I also noticed some slightly panicky feelings at that point , the kind where you want to crawl out of your own skin .
Nothing serious , but for those sensitive to CNS stimulants or prone to anxiety attacks , I would not recommend starting off with the highest dose like I did .
However , it seems tolerance develops and within a few days I could use the maximum recommended dosage without any side - effects .
Unfortunately , the stimulant effect is also lessened .
In my experience , Jack3d is quite effective , but less so for the purpose it 's advertised .
I see it 's use mainly as an appetite surpressant or stimulant , much like ephedrine .
The mechanism by which Jack3d exerts its effect is also similar to ephedrine in that it increases epinephrine / adrenaline , which in turn boosts lipolysis and leads to that " focused " feeling .
Or that urge to do something , anything .
Either way you want to use it , for a pre-workout or motivational boost , or appetite surpression , Jack3d works , which is why it ends up on my list of recommended , but certainly not essential , list of supplements .
By the way , I have n't found any studies to back the effectiveness of 1,3 - dimethylamylamine for fat loss .
If anyone knows of any human trials regarding its use for weight loss or improving cognition , alertness , or anything else for that matter , let me know .
I always try to find some scientifical backing for the supplements I recommend but I 'm at a loss for this one .
Adipoxil is a strange beast .
It 's different from all other fat burners reviewed here in the sense that it has no stimulatory properties .
At the same time , it 's a very potent appetite suppressant - at least as far as legal alternatives goes .
I suspect this might be explained by the synephrine and the " lipolytic oxidation protocol , " which contains cayenne pepper and various other thermorgenic compounds .
Synephrine and cayenne pepper are both known to suppress appetite .
There 's also a peculiar side - effect that 's noticeable shortly after ingesting the tabs ; it alters taste , and specifically it made coffee undrinkable .
I 'm not sure how to describe it .
I'm a coffee - fiend but that hot cup of goodness turned wretched after I downed the tabs .
Also , be careful with the dosing and do n't go for double dose the first time you try it .
I experienced nausea with two tabs and it was n't very pleasant .
Anyway , Adipoxil might be a good alternative for those looking for a supplement without pronounced stimulatory properties .
I need to add a big disclaimer here however ; Adipoxil does contain Yohimbine and caffeine , andprovide a stimulatory effect .
I might just be a weird outlier to not have noticed anything .
If you do try it , let me know in comments if you felt anything .
I should also note that I only tried this three days in a row , so I 'm not sure about tolerance issues .
For the short time I ran it , it worked very well .
I also tried another supplement from iForce Nutrition , the makers of Adipoxil : a pre-workout supplement called " Maximize V2 " .
This was nothing special - pretty much the same as Jack3d , but less potent .

( CNN ) --
The New Jersey legislature voted Monday to make that state the 14th in the country to approve marijuana for medicinal use , pending the governor 's signature .
Gov. Jon Corzine , who leaves office next week , has said he would sign the bill .
Two years after the bill was introduced to the legislature , the New Jersey Compassionate Medical Marijuana
Act was passed by the state Assembly in a 48 - 14 vote .
It received Senate approval just hours later in a 25 - 13 vote .
According to the news release from the state Senate , the bill would allow doctors to give to patients with state - issued identification cards prescriptions to buy marijuana legally from registered alternative treatment centers .
The identification cards would be issued by the Department of Health and Senior Services
Only patients with proven " debilitating conditions " would qualify for ID card .
Such conditions include " cancer , glaucoma , positive HIV / AIDS status or other chronic , debilitating diseases or medical conditions that produce , or the treatment of which produces , wasting syndrome , severe or chronic pain , severe nausea , seizures , or severe and persistent muscle spasms , " according to the Senate news release .
" Out of the 14 states that have similar bills , New Jersey 's will be the strictest , " Assemblyman Reed Gusciora , one of the bill 's sponsors , told CNN .
" I believe that this bill will be model legislation for states here on out that will look to ( be ) legalizing marijuana .
We looked at the pitfalls of California and made a more restrictive bill . "
Sen. Nicolas Scutari , the bill 's Senate co-sponsor , also attributed the bill 's success to its restrictive measures , saying , " We put a whole lot of safeguards to make sure that what had happened in other states with respect to abuses ... would not happen here , and I think everyone was satisfied as a result , so it passed pretty easily . "
Gusciora pointed to the omission of stress and anxiety as one of the qualifying conditions for a prescription , to further emphasize the bills distinction from other states ' bills , saying " I feel like every college student would qualify for stress and anxiety , and has qualified in California . "
Marijuana use would be restricted to private property under the measure .
Patients with legal prescriptions could still be arrested for using marijuana in public , and they could still face driving under the influence charges if they used marijuana and got behind the wheel , according to Gusciora .
The bill has been passed in time for Corzine to sign it before Gov.-elect Chris Christie takes over on January 19 .
According to Scutari , although Christie has shown a " willingness to sign " the bill , the timing of the bill 's passage is ideal .
" I did n't want to start from scratch , " says Scutari , " I 've been working on this for five years , and we wanted to ensure while we had control of the bill that we could get it passed in a form that was acceptable to all sides .
According to Gusciora , the bill will still take six to nine months to take effect .
Various safeguards such as Department of Health approval of dispensaries and tracking of patients by the Division of Consumer Affairs need to take place before doctors and patients can legally buy medical marijuana in New Jersey .
For most of the New Jersey state lawmakers , however , this is huge victory .
" My mother has multiple sclerosis and I could tell you that anything that could alleviate her symptoms , I would certainly want to be able to offer , " said Scutari .

In case you did n’t know , the default WPA key in Thomson / SpeedTouch routers is generated from the router ’s serial .
By some strange coincidence , so is the router ’s SSID , which means that if you know the SSID ( which is public knowledge ) , you can brute - force the serial .
There are programs to do this already , but they were not future - proof or open enough to work now , so I wrote a small Python script to do it .
Just enter the last part of the router ’s SSID ( e.g. 99AF3C in Thomson - 99AF3C ) and the script will find the likely WPA keys .
You can use this script to verify that your router is vulnerable and change the encryption key , but please do n’t use it to break into other people ’s networks !
That ’s rude .
EDIT : I updated the algorithm , it now features 200 % more correctness and 400 % more slowness :/
Sadly , it ’s many times slower than similar tools , but maybe it will be useful to you somehow .
Speedup tips appreciated !

PLO second in command Khalil al - Wazir ( left ) was assassinated by Israeli commandos in Tunisia
By Heather Sharp
BBC News , Jerusalem
The Islamic movement Hamas claims that the death of one its senior commanders , Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , is the latest in Israel 's history of assassinating individuals it believes to have been behind attacks on its citizens .
Israel 's general policy is to neither confirm nor deny allegations about the activities of its intelligence agents but it is notable that many of its enemies meet suspicious and violent deaths .
" We are witnessing an intense intelligence struggle , most of it is covert , some of it overt , " said Ronen Bergman , author of By Any Means Necessary , and other books and articles on Israel 's covert operations .
In some cases Israel has decided to close the circle and take revenge on people who were behind symbolic acts of terrorism
Ronen Bergman
Investigative journalist Among the best documented of Israel 's assassinations were a wave of killings of pro-Palestinian militants in Paris , Nicosia , Beirut and Athens , carried out in response to the hostage crisis at the Munich Olympics in 1972 which resulted in the deaths of 11 Israelis .
Methods used included a booby - trapped telephone , a bomb planted in a bed , and a raid in Beirut in which current Defence Minister Ehud Barak dressed as a woman .
There are even claims that a poisoned chocolate was later used to kill a commander of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in East Germany in 1978 .
In 1987 Israel made no attempt to disguise their assassination of Khalil al - Wazir - known as Abu Jihad - the Palestine Liberation Organisation 's military leader and second in command .
Israeli commandos crept into Tunisia , where the PLO 's exiled leadership was based , and shot him several times in his own home before escaping by sea .
It was an operation in which Mr Barak is also believed to have been involved .
Covert failure
In 1997 during the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's first term in office , one special operation went humiliatingly wrong .
Khaled Meshaal 's life was saved by Jordan and the US Israeli agents tried to kill Khaled Meshaal , who was then a fund - raiser for Hamas based in Amman .
Disguised as Canadian tourists , they injected poison into his ear - but he was rushed to hospital before it took full effect .
Mr Meshaal 's life was literally saved by Jordan 's then King Hussein , who was outraged by the attack and - boosted by pressure from then US President Bill Clinton - demanded the Israeli government hand over the antidote .
The agents - who had been arrested - were exchanged for an Israeli apology and the release of 20 prisoners , including Sheikh Ahmad Yassin , Hamas 's spiritual leader .
Mr Meshaal has gone on to become Hamas 's Damascus - based leader .
Targeted killings
As the second Intifada , or Palestinian uprising , raged in the years after 2000 , Israel turned its sights on militant leaders within Gaza and the West Bank .
Sheikh Yassin was killed in an Israeli air strike in 2004 Militant groups sent waves of suicide bombers to attack Israeli civilian targets such as buses and cafes .
Part of Israel 's response was the controversial policy it described as " targeted " killings - Amnesty International described them as " extra- judicial " .
Palestinians say dozens of militant figures , including Sheikh Yassin and another senior Hamas leader Abdel Aziz al - Rantissi , were killed , in many cases by missiles launched from helicopters .
But in 2008 , allegations of Israeli action farther afield intensified with the death of Hezbollah commander Imad Mughniyeh , implicated in numerous bomb attacks and a wave of hostage - taking in Lebanon in the 1980s .
Hezbollah wasted little time in blaming Israel for his death in a car bomb in Damascus .
The group is thought to have been trying to avenge his death ever since .
' Revenge '
Investigative journalist Mr Bergman says the past three to four years have seen the Hamas , Hezbollah , Iran and Syria alliance " far more exposed " by Israeli intelligence , and on the defensive .
Even in recent weeks , the deaths of two Hamas members in a bombing in Lebanon , an attempt to bomb an Israeli diplomatic convoy in Jordan , and the mysterious killing of an Iranian scientist - though a quantum physicist , not a nuclear specialist - offer more material for speculation .
Targeting Mr Mabhouh would fit with Israel 's historical policy , Mr Bergman adds .
" In some cases Israel has decided to close the circle and take revenge on people who were behind symbolic acts of terrorism - not necessary the most violent or lethal acts , " he said .
And this can happen years after the incident in question .
Hamas claims
Mr Mabhouh is the mastermind of the capture and killing of two Israeli soldiers , Avi Sasportas and Ilan Saadon , in 1989 .
Sgt Sasportas 's body was located seven years later , from a sketched map supplied by the Palestinians , and dug up from underneath a road that had been built over it .
The incident was an emotional one for the public in a country where most people serve in the military .
Mr Mabhouh 's brother said Israel had been trying to kill him for years , and had unsuccessfully attempted to poison him six months earlier in Beirut .
But the reports remain confusing , with allegations that he was electrocuted , suffocated and poisoned all circulating - as well as reports that Hamas initially announced that he had died from bone disease a week earlier .
And this incident , like many before it , may remain shrouded in mystery , even as Hamas vows to take revenge .

As astronomers begin detecting planets that are more and more like Earth , their task will be to determine if the planets are capable of supporting life .
Now , the first direct observation of the light spectrum emitted by an exoplanet shows how they might do this .
Using the Very Large Telescope in the Chilean desert , astronomers were able to see the infrared spectrum of the exoplanet HR 8799 c , 129 light - years away from Earth .
Though this planet is a gaseous planet larger than Jupiter and not habitable , scientists could use the same technique to find the telltale atmospheric signals of gases like water vapor and nitrogen on Earth - like planets by measuring variations in the color of the planet 's light .
" The spectrum of a planet is like a fingerprint .
It provides key information about the chemical elements in the planet 's atmosphere , " astronomer Markus Janson of the University of Toronto , who led the work , said in a press release .
" With this information , we can better understand how the planet formed and , in the future , we might even be able to find telltale signs of the presence of life . "
At the same time , the difficulty of observing a planet much larger , brighter and much farther away from its star than any Earth - like planet shows just how far we have to go before we 'll be able to detect if there are smaller , life - ready planets closer to their stars .
" It 's just that this is hundreds of times easier because the planet is at a temperature of 1,000 degrees [ Celsius , about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit ] , so it 's radiating like crazy in the infrared , " said Greg Laughlin , an exoplanet astronomer at University of California , Santa Cruz , who was not involved with the research .
" It 's 38 times farther from its parent star than the Earth is from the sun . "
The infrared light emitted by the planet is particularly strong at a wavelength of about four microns .
That 's a part of the spectrum where its star is not as bright , providing a sweet spot for planetary observations .
Even though this situation is especially good for using the light - detection method , the new study can be seen as a proof - of - concept for the technique of screening out starlight to see a planet 's comparatively meager radiations .
" Here they are able to use adaptive optics get rid of the starlight and get the planetary light directly , " Laughlin said , calling it an " encouraging milestone . "
The planet itself is an interesting object , unlike anything in our solar system .
It is glowing from the heat of its creation , not just by reflection of its star .
At 10 times the mass of Jupiter , it nearly reached the threshold to become a brown dwarf star .
Instead , it 's a smoldering planet , perfectly suited for exoplanetary observation .
The work , which will be published in Astrophysical Journal , stretches our current telescopes and data processing to the limit .
" The Very Large Telescope is one of the premier telescopes in the world , absolutely awesome equipment , and it is able to barely nose in and get true spectra of exoplanets in this very fortunate situation , " Laughlin said .
Other techniques have been used to peer into the atmospheres of some other exoplanets .
In those cases , astronomers look at the light coming from a star both during and after a planet crosses its face .
By taking the difference between the two , they can determine some things about the composition of the planet 's atmosphere by how the light changes when passing through it .
The exciting thing about exoplanetary research right now is that there is a profusion of techniques and ideas about how to get from our current observations to the detection and study of an Earth - like planet .
" Even though it is a gigantic leap , it is something that is a matter of technology , " Laughlin affirmed .
" The planets are there , the physics is there , the roadmap is there .
We just need to improve our technology . "

Last year a collaborative effort in Britain of Lotus Engineering , Jaguar and Queen ’s University Belfast began developing a two - stroke engine called Omnivore , for its ability to run on a variety of fuels .
The direct - injection engine has the ability to vary its compression ratio from 8:1 to 40:1 by changing the volume of the combustion chamber .
On Dec. 9 , Lotus released test results that it termed successful for fuel economy and exhaust emissions .
Image A two - stroke engine designed by EcoMotors .
And in Chapman , Kan. , impressively credentialed scientists , engineers and investors are developing what they call the Grail Engine , a reference to their quest for a power plant beyond current levels of efficiency and greenness .
The Grail Engine differs from two - stroke convention in the use of an intake valve positioned in the top of the piston to admit the fresh charge of air for combustion .
It also has an overhead exhaust valve , surrounded by three spark plugs , and a fuel injector at the top of the combustion chamber .
The project ’s goals are to exceed 100 miles per gallon and 100 horsepower from a clean - burning 1 - liter engine .
While there is no running prototype , interest in its approach has brought a visit by research engineers from Honda Motor .
In simplest terms , the strength of the two - stroke engine lies in its delivery of a power pulse with every revolution of the crankshaft ; the familiar four - stroke piston engine in today ’s cars fires each cylinder on every other revolution .
Both types of engines use a four - step combustion cycle that converts fuel and air to power : intake , compression , ignition and exhaust .
But the two - stroke does it all with just two sweeps of the piston through the cylinder , one up and one down .
The four - stroke design takes twice as many trips of the piston up and down the cylinder , allowing more time for each step and placing less stress on the engine .
But the big bull sharks , despite their reputation as aggressive man-eaters , were strangely shy .
An enormous and visibly pregnant one the divers called Big Mama seemed almost finicky as she warily sniffed at the flesh being offered her before turning up her nose entirely .
Some of the bulls lurked in the distance , no more than silhouettes in the blue .
Others swam languidly toward us , as if playing a lazy game of chicken before nonchalantly turning away .
R. Dean Grubbs , a shark expert at Florida State University , says this is probably the safest way to encounter bull sharks , in deep , clear water , where they are far less likely to mistake you for their normal prey , as they do with swimmers and surfers in the shallows or at the surface .
Some sharks , including bulls , also have space issues , so the fact that they ’ve come to you , not the other way around , means they ’re less likely to feel crowded and testy .
But George H. Burgess , director of the Florida Program for Shark Research , contends that once you start luring big sharks all bets are off , pointing to the death of a tourist on a shark dive in the Bahamas last year .
Still , he acknowledges that statistics do n’t show that chum dives are any more dangerous than normal dives .
In fact , the bigger concern for researchers like him and Dr. Grubbs is the impact on the sharks themselves .
Even Papa wonders if his beloved sharks have grown a little complacent under his care , though they still adhere to many of their natural habits , like migrating or disappearing up the rivers for weeks on end when it ’s time to breed .
And because some shark - diving profits go to the villages themselves , no one fishes along the reef or drops anchor on it , granting it a welcome reprieve from overfishing .
Some of the local divers say the reef certainly looks a lot healthier than it did before the shark diving started here 10 years ago .
Long before Christianity , Papa said , the people of his village considered sharks their spiritual guardians and looked to them for protection before going into the water .
Now , Papa said , he is the protector , boasting that he and his crew are deputized to impound illegal fishing boats that wander in the area to pluck from the healthy fish stocks there .
He even speaks of the sharks as his children .
“ They know Papa ’s coming , ” he said , heading out to sea one morning , his nickname emblazoned across his T - shirt .
“ They ’re waiting for me . ”
In a significant step toward restoring healthy blood circulation to treat a variety of diseases , a team of scientists at Weill Cornell Medical College has developed a new technique and described a novel mechanism for turning human embryonic and pluripotent stem cells into plentiful , functional endothelial cells , which are critical to the formation of blood vessels .
Endothelial cells form the interior " lining " of all blood vessels and are the main component of capillaries , the smallest and most abundant vessels .
In the near future , the researchers believe , it will be possible to inject these cells into humans to heal damaged organs and tissues .
The new approach allows scientists to generate virtually unlimited quantities of durable endothelial cells -- more than 40 - fold the quantity possible with previous approaches .
Based on insights into the genetic mechanisms that regulate how embryonic stem cells form vascular endothelial cells , the approach may also yield new ways to study genetically inherited vascular diseases .
The study appears in the advance online issue of Nature Biotechnology .
" This technique is the first of its kind with serious potential as a treatment for a diverse array of diseases , especially cardiovascular disease , stroke and vascular complications of diabetes , " says Dr. Shahin Rafii , the study 's senior author .
Dr. Rafii is the Arthur B. Belfer Professor in Genetic Medicine and co-director of the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College , and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
In recent years , enormous hopes have been pinned on stem cells as the source of future cures and treatments .
Indeed , human embryonic stem cells have the potential to become any one of the more than 200 types of adult cells .
However , the factors and pathways that govern their differentiation to abundant derivatives that could be used to repair organs have remained poorly understood .
A major challenge for Dr. Rafii's lab has been to improve their understanding , and hence control , of the differentiation process ( how stem cells convert to various cell types ) , and then to generate enough vascular endothelial cells -- many millions -- so they can be used therapeutically .
advertisement
To meet this challenge , the scientists first screened for molecular factors that come into play when stem cells turn into endothelial cells .
Their findings led them to a strategy that significantly boosts the efficiency of producing these cells .
Then , the researchers tracked the differentiation process in real - time using a green fluorescent protein marker developed by Dr. Daylon James , the study 's first author and assistant research professor in the Department of Reproductive of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College .
They found that when they exposed stem cells to a compound that blocks TGF - beta ( a growth factor involved in cell specialization ) at just the right time during cell culturing , the propagation of endothelial cells dramatically increased .
Even more striking , they found that the cells worked properly when injected into mice .
The cells were quickly assimilated into the animals ' circulatory systems , and functioned alongside normal vasculature .
To achieve long - lasting clinical benefits , there remain additional hurdles to exploiting endothelial cells generated in vitro .
Indeed , a fundamental prerequisite to using vascular cells in regenerative medicine has been the proper assembly in vivo of new blood vessels from stem - cell - derived cells , according to Dr. Sina Rabbany , who is an adjunct professor at Weill Cornell Medical College and professor of bioengineering at Hofstra University .
Dr. Rabbany emphasizes that , in addition to manipulating biological factors implicated in endothelial cell differentiation , the impact of blood flow on endothelial cells is critical to engineering durable , vascularized organs .
With the plentiful supply of endothelial cells that the new methods provide , Dr. Rabbany 's team is working to build biological scaffolds that model the microenvironment of the vasculature , so that the vessels they generate will be functional and long - lasting in patients .
Another major obstacle to clinical use of cultured endothelial cells is the potential of immune rejection when the cells are injected into a patient .
To address this risk , one approach would be to create a large , genetically diverse bank of human embryonic stem cells that , on demand , could be converted into endothelial cells that are compatible with specific patients .
advertisement
" Given the success rate our group has shown in generating human embryonic stem cells from donated normal and diseased embryos , this new approach has broad implications not only for regenerative medicine , but also for the study of genetic diseases of the vasculature , " states Dr. Zev Rosenwaks , who is director and physician - in - chief of the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine as well as the director of the Tri-Institutional Stem Cell Initiative Derivation Unit at Weill Cornell Medical College .
The new endothelial cell culture is currently being validated in ongoing research at Weill Cornell using a number of stem cell " lines , " or " families " of stem cells .
" Employing a highly sophisticated derivation technology , we have been able to generate 11 normal and diseased human embryonic cell lines from discarded embryos at the Tri-Institute Derivation Unit at Weill Cornell , " states Dr. Nikica Zaninovic , an assistant professor at the Department of Reproductive of Medicine who is spearheading the human embryonic stem cell derivation effort .
Using the new differentiation methods , several of these new embryonic stem cell lines have been turned into vascular cells .
Testing in humans is the next major step in verifying the ability of this breakthrough cell - based approach to restore blood supply to injured organs .
Armed with this new technology and under the umbrella of support from the Ansary Stem Cell Institute and Tri-Institutional Stem Cell Initiative ( Tri - SCI ) , this team of scientists is hoping to transfer their methods to the clinic within the next five years .
The current study sheds light on the generation of human embryonic vasculature in ways that have not previously been feasible due to obstacles associated with the use of human embryonic tissue .
As Dr. James explains ,
" The unbiased screening technique we used is a major technological advance that opens up possibilities for discovery of how human embryonic stem cells morph into the specific mature cells that compose the brain , liver , pancreas , and so on .
Our general approach can be applied to additional human tissues and help other stem cell research groups develop and maintain specialized cell types in the larger effort to understand human development -- and to heal many different kinds of human diseases and injuries . "
The Tri-Institutional Stem Cell Initiative , supported by a generous gift from The Starr Foundation , is a collaborative venture of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center , The Rockefeller University , and Weill Cornell Medical College .
Herschel 's HIFI instrument ready to resume operations
18 January 2010
The quality of the first spectra obtain with HIFI on 22 June 2009 effectively demonstrated the versatility of the instrument and showed that its accuracy and resolution exceeded specifications .
On 3 August 2009 , early in the performance verification phase , it was discovered that HIFI was no longer operating normally .
This was later traced to an unexpected voltage peak in the electronics of HIFI ’s Local Oscillator Control Unit ( LCU ) having shut it down .
In case of such events HIFI has a redundant set of electronics including the LCU which provides full functionality , however before it was utilised , ESA and the HIFI consortium wanted to fully understand the cause of the problem .
Following the shut down of HIFI , the consortium , joined by ESA , carried out a detailed and thorough investigation before making the necessary adaptation to software that monitors the LCU to prevent the problem from happening again .
All tests have confirmed that the LCU back - up system is functioning perfectly after switch - on last week .
In addition , the HIFI sensors are performing with the same high quality as they did when they captured the spectra of the warm molecular gas in the DR21 star - forming region in Cygnus .
This spectra showed clear evidence for water , as well as for singly ionized carbon ( a key diagnostic for molecular cloud material ) , and carbon monoxide .
HIFI was built specifically to observe water in a number of different celestial targets as part of the investigation into the role of gas and dust in the formation of stars and planets , and the evolution of galaxies .
The successful activation of HIFI comes as an important target , the star forming regions of the Orion Nebula or M42 , approaches the instruments field of view .
HIFI has been designed and built by a consortium of institutes and university departments from across Europe , Canada and the USA under the leadership of the Netherlands Institute for Space Research ( SRON ) , Groningen , The Netherlands , and with major contributions from Germany , France and the USA .
Consortium members are : Canada : CSA , U.Waterloo ; France : CESR , LAB , LERMA , IRAM ; Germany : KOSMA , MPIfR , MPS ; Ireland , NUI Maynooth ; Italy : ASI , IFSI - INAF , Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri-INAF ; Netherlands : SRON , TUD ; Poland : CAMK , CBK ; Spain : OAN ( IGN ) , CAB ( CSIC - INTA ) ; Sweden : Chalmers University of Technology - MC2 , RSS & GARD ; OSO ; SNSB , Stockholm University - SO ; Switzerland : ETH Zurich , FHNW ; USA : Caltech , JPL , NHSC .

This morning the President proposed what he called " the Volcker Rule , " named after one of the fiercest advocates for financial reform over the past year , and who has been particularly focused on addressing the issue of banks being " too big to fail . "
He also proposed addressing one of the clearest issues leading to the financial crisis of the past years , namely banks that stray wildly from their core mission : serving their customer .
Having met with Paul Volcker this morning , and having last week proposed new fees on Wall Street to ensure the taxpayers get their money back , the President came with a direct message for banks that might object to these changes :
I welcome constructive input from folks in the financial sector .
But what we 've seen so far , in recent weeks , is an army of industry lobbyists from Wall Street descending on Capitol Hill to try and block basic and common - sense rules of the road that would protect our economy and the American people .
So if these folks want a fight , it 's a fight I 'm ready to have .
And my resolve is only strengthened when I see a return to old practices at some of the very firms fighting reform ; and when I see soaring profits and obscene bonuses at some of the very firms claiming that they can't lend more to small business , they can't keep credit card rates low , they can't pay a fee to refund taxpayers for the bailout without passing on the cost to shareholders or customers -- that 's the claims they 're making .
It 's exactly this kind of irresponsibility that makes clear reform is necessary .
President Barack Obama meets with Economic Recovery Advisory Board Chair Paul Volcker in the Oval Office January 21 , 2010 .

The President went on to explain the reforms he was proposing in more detail :
First , we should no longer allow banks to stray too far from their central mission of serving their customers .
In recent years , too many financial firms have put taxpayer money at risk by operating hedge funds and private equity funds and making riskier investments to reap a quick reward .
And these firms have taken these risks while benefiting from special financial privileges that are reserved only for banks .
Our government provides deposit insurance and other safeguards and guarantees to firms that operate banks .
We do so because a stable and reliable banking system promotes sustained growth , and because we learned how dangerous the failure of that system can be during the Great Depression .
But these privileges were not created to bestow banks operating hedge funds or private equity funds with an unfair advantage .
When banks benefit from the safety net that taxpayers provide –- which includes lower - cost capital –- it is not appropriate for them to turn around and use that cheap money to trade for profit .
And that is especially true when this kind of trading often puts banks in direct conflict with their customers ' interests .
The fact is , these kinds of trading operations can create enormous and costly risks , endangering the entire bank if things go wrong .
We simply cannot accept a system in which hedge funds or private equity firms inside banks can place huge , risky bets that are subsidized by taxpayers and that could pose a conflict of interest .
And we cannot accept a system in which shareholders make money on these operations if the bank wins but taxpayers foot the bill if the bank loses .
Get much more from the White House fact sheet .
announcement was different especially for me .
You see , I sort of had skin in the game .
It started when TechCrunch 's Michael Arrington wrote that the Google Phone was real and it was coming .
Google 's not in the hardware game and Arrington 's story cited unnamed sources .
I read it as not making good market sense for Google and as Arrington trying to will something into being .
and more in what many described as a rant .
Arrington and I have some history ; he tends to make me ranty .
I was partially wrong .
There is a Google phone , or at least something everyone except Google wants to call a Google Phone .
It 's the HTC - designed and built Nexus One .
This is another Android phone , featuring Google 's most up - to - date software ( Android 2.1 ) .
It 'll work on T - Mobile 's 3G network and eventually Verizon 's 3G network .
Funny how that does n't sound all that exciting or significant .
What 's changed , though , is that Google has opened its own online phone store to sell this and other Android phones .
It 'll even sell them unlocked for a priceor with carrier support via the store .
So , it 's a game changer like Arrington and many others predicted , right ?
No .
If Google was only selling the Nexus One and then a bunch of other " Google branded " phones with nary a manufacturer partner name in sight we might have something .
If Google was planning on making some cash on the sale of these new phones , that could be a game changer .
The reality is , however , that Google has changed very little .
In fact , when I think about this launch , it does n't seem wildly different from the T - Mobile G1 launch .
The big difference , of course , is that the manufacturer and Google are taking center stage not T - Mobile .
Back then , Google worked closely with HTC and T - Mobile to make the first Android phone a good product .
It was almost a year before more Android phones followed , and I wonder if something in that relationship , or even the roll - out , made Google want to try something different .
Google giving HTC Android 2.1 earlier than other manufacturer partners so it could build a better Android phone , by the way , is still Google simply trying to get the best Android phone out to the marketplace .
Even so , Google 's decision to open a store where it does not appear interested in making a direct profit is puzzling .
During the press conference , Google indicated that the process of buying a phone was too difficult .
It wanted to simplify things .
I think Google 's just created a solution for a problem that does n't exist .
I know that people like me and Michael Arrington can sometimes live inside the cocoons of our gadget - obsessed lives and not quite realize how average consumers perceive these roll - outs .
So I asked a consumer who now owns a Droid if , given the choice , he would buy , say , a Motorola Droid phone unlocked from Google for almost $ 600 , or if he would rather get it from Verizon for $ 199 .
The consumer started answering Verizon before I even finished the question .
I firmly believe that Joe and Josephine Consumer are simply not interested in the rigmarole of buying an unlocked product and having to choose a carrier separately .
I know that many of my readers are more savvy and they like the idea of jail - breaking iPhones and possibly running their favorite phone on another supported service provider ( if the radio fits , you just might switch ) , but that simply is n't the norm .
But back to the central question : Was I wrong ?
In Arrington 's article , he insisted that the product we would see would not be an HTC phone but a " pure - branded Google phone . "
Nope .
This phone has Android branding , but it 's clearly an HTC device .
HTC execs were at the event and even spoke !
Obviously , HTC is a major manufacturer , but it 's based in Taiwan not South Korea .
Not that it really matters .
If , for instance , Samsung had built the Nexus One , executives would have been up on stage with Google , just like HTC 's leadership .
Google did surprise me by officially getting into the retail business .
I never expected it and got that wrong .
Google will sell this phone directly to consumers .
Google has n't done much advertising before , but I think Arrington 's assertion that it'll have a big Nexus One advertising push is perfectly sensible , though Google did not exactly promise as much at the event .
Overall , though , I think Arrington misread Google 's intentions .
He thought it was about to start competing directly with other Android phone manufacturers .
HTC and Google made it crystal clear who built and designed this phone and it was n't Google .
The Google store is not intended to compete with any Android manufacturer or even service provider .
Instead , it 's there to help all of them .
For Google , the name of the game is scalebig massive scale so it can do what it does best : sell advertising space on a large distribution network .
In this case , the network is Android phones .
A month ago , we wrote about the new Star Wars–themed shoe line Adidas was creating for 2010 .
At the time , only teaser shots were available .
But the full deets are out , and the results , against all expectations , are kind of awesome .
What ’s particularly clever is how very subtle the Star Wars references are .
Spotting these on the street , you ’d never know they were themed cross-branding .
But if someone told you what the visual inspiration was , you ’d say “ Ah- ha ! ”
Yoda ’s shoes have that rugged , handmade look that ’s oh so popular in the forbidding swamps of Dagobah :
The X - wing shoes look exactly like what you ’d be wearing to pilot one : Comfy , light , and a little bit weathered from running around the cargo hold screaming about the Empire :
The AT - AT shoes pick up lots of clever details from their inspiration –like the upraised , rounded joints and the ribbed tongue , that looks like the articulated neck joint of the AT - AT :

" What I 'm saying is that should anyone care to consider inflation and per-capita share of GDP , we 've hit the top of the mountain , when a nation reaches the tippy - top of the mountain , it 's a beautiful view right up to the point of realizing that everything from that point is downhill . "
What we face in 2010 and beyond

The first time you use an Android phone , one thing becomes immediately clear :
You 're not in Cupertino anymore .
Android , as recent Verizon commercials remind us , is the antithesis of Apple 's celebrated handset :
It 's open source , fully customizable , and free from unexplained app rejections .

The palette is in your hands ; it 's up to you to add color .
We 've assembled 40 tips and tricks to help you make the most of your Android phone .
Some are specific to Android 2.0 or later , but most apply to any Android - based device .
And not one of these tricks requires you to jailbreak anything .
So grab your phone , and get started - - it 's time for you to become a certified Android master .
Optimize Your Home Screen
1 . Make the most of your space by using widgets -- dynamic programs that operate right on your home screen .

Widgets come in a huge variety of sizes and functions , so search the Android Market to find what works for you .
2 . Prefer not to be bothered by a sound every time an e-mail arrives ?
Head into Gmail 's Settings menu and set its ringtone to Silent .
You 'll still see new - message alerts in the notification panel at the top of your screen , and you can always pull the panel down to get detailed information .
You can configure text messaging and other alert - generating apps the same way .
3 . Set up one - touch dialing for the people you call the most .
Hold your finger on an open space and select Shortcuts .
Then , touch Direct dial and pick the person from your contact list .
If one - touch texting is what you crave , use the Direct message option instead .
4 . To drop your favorite Web pages onto your home screen , long - press on any site in your browser 's bookmarks and then select the Add shortcut to home option .
5 . Try using folders to keep your home screen organized .
Long - press on a blank space and select Folders to create one .
You can then drag and drop frequently used contacts , apps , or other shortcuts into it to cut down on clutter .

Get Around Android
6 . Make file management a snap with a utility such as Astro , which allows you to browse through your phone just as you would a computer , navigating directories and moving or deleting files at will .
7 . Need to cut and paste text ?
Long - press on any text input area .
If you 're on a Web page , tap the Menu key and use the Select text option .
8. Use Android 's hotkeys to do everything from zooming in to a Web page to opening a program .
Check out our complete list of Android keyboard shortcuts to learn them all .
9 . You can set your own hotkeys to open apps , too .

11 . You can see the current date at any time by touching your finger to the top - left corner of the screen .
Stay Connected
12 . To load files onto your Android phone , plug the handset into your PC and pull down the notification panel .
Tap the USB connected box , and then tap Mount when the confirmation dialog box appears .
Your phone will appear as a hard drive on your PC , and you can then drag and drop files as you wish .

' Tis the season to be lonely .
Half a million pensioners will spend Christmas Day alone , while nearly three in five people over 55 will be wishing they could see more of their family .
This is n't just a seasonal or British phenomenon .
At any given time , around one in five Americans – 60 million people – feel so isolated that it makes them seriously unhappy .
That last statistic comes from a new book called Loneliness , co-written by John Cacioppo , a neuroscientist .
He says social pain is akin to physical pain .
That occasional pang of isolation – the odd Saturday night when none of your friends are around – is no more than a prompt to socialise , in the same way that burning skin is a spur to get your hand away from that frying pan .
It 's regular , chronic loneliness that does the serious damage : increased stress levels , higher blood pressure , disrupted sleep – all the way to accelerated dementia .
Many pensioners who complain about not seeing enough of their loved ones might end up in this category .
Loneliness is contagious , even between people who do n't have direct contact with each other .
A study of nearly 5,000 Massachusetts residents conducted over 10 years found that a friend of a lonely person was 52 % more likely to develop feelings of social rejection – and one of their friends had 25 % more chance of feeling lonely in turn .
Even a friend of a friend of a friend was at greater risk of loneliness .
This is a social disease that threatens to turn into an epidemic .
And it has spread not geographically but economically .
In the new boomtowns of China , community - oriented societies are beginning to be swept by serious loneliness .
The Chinese are getting richer , but they also feel more alone .
What can be done ?
Cacioppo wants to encourage neighbours to come into contact with each other , by making cities more walkable .
And for the seriously lonely , he has one overriding piece of advice : help others through charity work , or cook for acquaintances .
" When you 're lonely you feel you could just eat other people , " he says .
" But the trick is to feed them . "
( CNN ) -- NASA scientists revealed Friday a first - of - its - kind image from space showing reflecting sunlight from a lake on Saturn 's largest moon , Titan .
It 's the first visual " smoking gun " evidence of liquid on the northern hemisphere of the moon , scientists said , and the first - ever photo from another world showing a " specular reflection " -- which is reflection of light from an extremely smooth surface and in this case , a liquid one .
" This is the first time outside Earth we 've seen specular reflection from another liquid from another body , " said Ralf Jaumann , a scientist analyzing data from the Cassini unmanned space probe .
Jaumann said he was surprised when he first saw the photos transmitting from Cassini , orbiting Saturn about a billion miles from Earth .
" It was great because if you look at photos of planets , you mostly see nothing is happening .
But in two hours we saw a glint of light getting brighter . "
Titan 's similarities to Earth have attracted NASA 's attention for decades .
It 's the only body besides our own in the solar system that is believed to have liquid on its surface .
Like Earth , Titan has an atmosphere which is mostly nitrogen .
Experts believe the presence of liquid on a planet or moon improves the chances that some kind of life could develop there .
The photo comes from the spacecraft Cassini , which has been searching for this kind of reflection since it began circling Saturn in 2004 .
Scientists with the University of Arizona were able to use previous data from Cassini to learn details about the reflection 's location on Titan .
The glint appears to be coming from the southern edge of a lake called Kraken Mare -- a massive body of methane that covers about 150,000 square miles ( 400,000 square kilometers ) .
That 's larger than the Caspian Sea , which is the largest lake on Earth .
The hunt for the specular reflection took five years , NASA said , because the moon 's northern half had been shrouded in winter darkness .
" Next , we want to find out more about Titan 's liquid , " said Jaumann .
" Do we have some kind of weather there ?
Do we have changes with seasons ?
Does it rain ?
How does the liquid methane run across the surface ? "
But Jaumann sounded a note of caution regarding the prospect of life in this case .
" The temperature on Titan 's surface is something like minus - 180 degrees Celsius , " he said .
" That means it 's very cold .
But you never know . "
The project is based out of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
This is not the first evidence of liquid on Titan .
In 2008 , project members used infrared technology to discover a large lake in the moon 's southern hemisphere .
But this recent discovery is a sure sign that liquid exists on the moon 's northern half .
That region is believed to include larger basins that could hold more liquid .
Join the conversation : Religion , spirituality & ethics | Reader forum : Your beliefs @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER Americans ' views of the " honesty and ethics " of clergy have hit a 32 - year low , with just half rating their moral caliber as high or very high , according to Gallup 's annual Honesty and Ethics Ratings of Professions survey .
The reason for the decline from 56 % last year to 50 % in 2009 is " unclear , " according to a Gallup news release , which also noted that " now the clergy 's ratings are below where they were earlier this decade " at the height of the Catholic Church 's clergy abuse scandal .
Barbara Dorris , outreach coordinator for the Chicago - based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests , attributed the drop to ripple effects from seven years of negative press surrounding predatory priests .
" The Catholic church 's ongoing clergy sex abuse and cover - up crisis has also prompted victims in other denominations to step forward , speak up , call police , expose predators , file lawsuits , and speak publicly , " she said .
" This has , we suspect , also contributed to the diminished view of clergy . "
Ratings dropped year - over - year among Catholics and Protestants , as well as among regular and occasional churchgoers .
However , they rose in one category : among those professing " no religion . "
Last year , 31 % rated clergy honesty high or very high ; in 2009 , that figure inched up to 34 % .
" Still , ratings of the clergy remain high on a relative basis , ranking eighth of the 22 professions tested this year , " Gallup said .
Clergy ratings , however , declined the most — 6 percentage points — followed by lawyers , with a 5 - point drop to 13 % .
The most highly regarded profession was nursing , with 83 % judging nurses ' honesty and ethics as high or very high .
Police officers showed the greatest gain ( 7 points ) , to 63 % .
Bankers ' ratings tumbled amidst the financial crisis to 19 % , down from 23 % in 2008 and 35 % in 2007 .
Ratings of stockbrokers fell to 9 % , the same level as members of Congress .
The survey was based on telephone interviews with 1,017 adults nationwide with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points .

Proving once again that those who do n't watch The Engadget Show are always going to be one step behind those who do , our latest star guest Erick Tseng has dropped a dollop of exclusive wisdom on us : Android 's next big iteration will be known as Froyo .
That 's short for " frozen yogurt " and fits right in line with the zany naming scheme that has delivered us Cupcakes Donuts , and Eclairs so far .
If you had your money on Flan being next in that alphabetical order , sorry to disappoint .
No additional info could be squeezed out of the Google man at present -- such as how much further along Froyo will be from Android 2.1 ( technically considered part of Eclair ) or when we might expect the upgrade -- but we 've got a name and that should be plenty to get us started on another wonderful journey of soothsaying and speculation .
Manca relativamente poco allo scoccare del 2010 ; prima delle festività natalizie , InformaticaEasy vi propone come penultimo articolo un rapido report sulle prossime CPU firmate Intel che vedranno la luce a partire dal prossimo anno .
Si inizia con Gulftown e con i suoi 12 core logici ...
Secondo i dirigenti Intel , la Legge di Moore , sostenuta dai progressi realizzati dall ' Azienda nelle tecnologie di produzione a 32 e 22 nanometri ( nm ) , è destinata ad accelerare il ritmo e la portata di " innovazione e integrazione " .
E tra un progetto futuristico ed l'altro ( ricordiamo ad esempio una CPU da 48 core che consuma 125W in full load ) ,
Intel si prepara a sbarcare nel 2010 più grintosa che mai , proponendo nuove inedite soluzioni basate essenzialmente sulla tecnica del die - shrink , almeno inizialmente .
Ciò significa che le prime nuove CPU Intel manterranno l'attuale architettura introdotta con i microprocessori Nehalem da 45 nm ma subiranno una " restrizione " del die grazie all ' adozione di un nuovo processo produttivo : i 32 nanometri , appunto .
2010 : l'anno dei 32nm .
Westmere , Sandy Bridge e Larrabee
Westmere è la prima serie di processori
Intel a 32 nm , la prima in assoluto a integrare il die di grafica direttamente nel package del processore .
Oltre a supportare la tecnologia Intel Turbo Boost e la tecnologia Hyper - Threading , Westmere include nuove istruzioni AES ( Advanced Encryption Standard ) per velocizzare la crittografia e la decrittografia dei dati .
Dopo Westmere , l'integrazione dei chip Intel proseguirà con i processori a 32 nanometri il cui nome in codice è “ Sandy Bridge ” .
Sandy Bridge si distinguerà per core di grafica
Intel di sesta generazione sullo stesso die o piastrina di silicio del core del processore , e comprenderà istruzioni AVX per il software in virgola mobile , video e a elaborazione intensiva disponibile in generale nelle applicazioni multimediali .
Seguiranno nuovi prodotti in silicio denominati “ Larrabee ” , nome in codice utilizzato per una famiglia di futuri co-processori orientati alla grafica .
Larrabee rappresenterà un'estensione delle funzionalità di elaborazione parallela della programmabilità dell ' Architettura Intel .
Grazie a questa flessibile programmabilità e alla possibilità di trarre vantaggio dagli attuali strumenti di sviluppo , software e progettazione , i programmatori sono liberi di comprendere i benefici del rendering completamente programmabile e quindi di implementare facilmente un'ampia varietà di pipeline 3D , ad esempio rasterizzazione , rendering volumetrico o ray tracing .
Con i 32 nanometri , arriveranno transistor con gate metallici ad alta costante k ( high - k ) di seconda generazione ed Intel utilizzerà , per la prima volta , una particolare tecnica di litografia denominata " a immersione per gli strati critici " .
Gli altri aspetti da segnalare dal punto di vista chimico - microelettronico sono : la presenza di 9 strati di interconnessioni in rame + bassa costante k , riduzione di circa il 70 % delle dimensioni rispetto alla generazione a 45 nm e packaging senza piombo e privi di alogeni .
Gulftown : il Nehalem Bloomfield replacement
Ma torniamo a parlare della realtà che interesserà il futuro prossimo del panorama informatico :
Westmere , ed in particolare Gulftown .
Quest 'ultima sigla identifica , come codename , una " sottoserie " di microprocessori a 32 nanometri ;
Westmere è invece il nome globale di tutti i prossimi microprocessori a 32 nanometri Intel .
La tabella che riporto di seguito , timidamente inserita sul sito Intel in un comunicato stampa aziendale , riporta le principali caratteristiche delle prossime CPU Westmere e la fascia di mercato in cui si collocano .
In più , abbiamo a disposizione una comparativa di nomenclatura e numero di core fisici / logici con l'attuale offerta Nehalem , a parità di fascia di mercato .

L'utenza desktop high - end attualmente adotta CPU Intel Nehalem Bloomfield ; il prossimo step per gli appassionati della tecnologia sarà , almeno per alcuni , la migrazione alle CPU high - end Intel Gulftown , etichettate imprudentemente Core i9 ( in realtà , giusto per confondere ulteriormente le idee a livello di nomenclatura , Intel prevede di continuare a chiamare , almeno i primi sample Gulftown , Core i7 ) .
In sostanza , Gulftown sarà l'equivalente futuro di Bloomfield .
La seguente tabella che riportai svariate settimane fa in un articolo che parlava di evoluzione delle CPU Intel , sebbene non sia aggiornatissima e presenti qualche errore nella nomenclatura
Core ix , racchiude informazioni tecniche su Gulftown che sono ancora valide nonchè confermate dalla stessa Intel .
Alcuni dati su Gulftown , il mostro esa-core
Essenzialmente , gli esemplari Gulftown saranno microprocessori con package LGA1366 e dunque ( potenzialmente ) compatibili con tutte le schede madri basate sull ' omonimo socket ed integranti chipset Intel X58 Express .
Sarà necessario un aggiornamento del BIOS per rendere compatibili le attuali motherboard X58 - based con Gulftown .
La serie high - end di Westmere , Gulftown appunto , comprende CPU integranti in un unico die monolitico ben 6 core fisici che , grazie al supporto all '
Hyper - Threading ripreso con Nehalem , diventeranno 12 logici .
Rispetto a Nehalem , ripeto , Gulftown ed in generale Westmere sarà caratterizzato da transistor più piccoli : si passerà da 45 a 32 nanometri e , per questo , l'incremento del numero fisico di core produrrà un aumento della superficie del die di silicio praticamente nullo .
Complici le migliorate tecnologie di risparmio energetico , la superficie inalterata del die e la riduzone dei nanometri dei transistor , il TDP sprigionato da Gulftown non supererà quello degli attuali esemplari Intel Core i7 .
Oltre all '
Hyper Threading , sembra confermato il supporto all 'architettura Quick Path Interconnect , con accesso diretto alla memoria ( DMI ) .
A proposito di RAM , Intel ne assicura la compatibilità con DDR3 1066 MHz ( stessi prerequisiti introdotti con Nehalem ) .
La memoria cache di Gulftown , infine , raggiungerà quota 12 MB rispetto agli 8 MB di Core i7 .
Gulftown in azione : l'anteprima stroncata da Intel
Sul forum di InformaticaEasy.net , già diverso tempo fa è stata segnalata la presenza online di alcuni screenshot che immortalavano CPU - Z ed altri benchmark in esecuzione su una piattaforma utilizzante CPU Gulftown .
Protagonista il website PCLab.pl , che ha riportato in un articolo una sorta di analisi in anteprima dei prossimi Core ix Intel .
Il sito web ha però ha dovuto subito fare i conti con le reazioni di Intel , che hanno comportato una rimozione , perlomeno temporanea , dell ' articolo prodotto .
Secondo quanto riportato sullo stesso sito web , infatti : " We have been contacted by the reps of Intel Corporation .
We agreed to remove the article .
We will bring it back once Gulftown hits the stores , somewhere in 2010 :-) " .
Pur tuttavia , gli screenshot di cui sopra sono sempre rimasti hostati sul sito web PhotoBuchet , eccoli riportati di seguito .
Iniziamo con uno screen di CPU -Z , che conferma alcune delle caratteristiche tecniche di questi sample tra cui la quantità di Cache , il numero di core logici e fisici ed il principio di funzionamento BCLK / moltiplicatore .
Everest mostra maggiori informazioni in merito al processore : l'utility rileva la presenza di una CPU effettivamente esa-core , da 3.2 GHz e stepping A0 .
Da evidenziare il supporto alle SSE4.2 ; trattandosi di un esemplare Engineering Sample ( e probabilmente anche appartenente alla serie Xtreme Edition ) il moltiplicatore è sbloccato anche verso l'alto e può " teoricamente " raggiungere quota 63 x .
Come abbiamo potuto notare dalle immagini appena inserite , la frequenza della CPU variava tra 1,6 GHz e 3,2 GHz circa : merito dello Speed Step e della tecnologia Turbo Boost , che rendono tutt ' altro che chiara la determinazione del moltiplicatore di base utilizzato dalla CPU .
Passiamo a saggiare le performance che Gulftown può offrire iniziando dal software Cinebench .
I punteggi ottenuti sono pari a 4535 per il rendering con un core e 25564 nel caso di utilizzo di tutti i core .
Altro bench comparativo con le attuali soluzioni Core i6 ed AMD Phenom II .
Risultati incredibili anche questa volta ... ( cliccate sull ' immagine per visualizzarla nelle sue dimensioni originali ) :
Molto positivo anche il risultato di Super PI , stavolta eseguito però su CPU overcloccata a 4,4 GHz ( da notare il relativo vCore , decisamente basso se comparato a tale frequenza di clock ) .
Non dimentichiamo che Super PI non è ottimizzato per il multicore , ed il bench è quindi relativo alle potenzialità di uno dei sei core fisici costituenti Westmere Gulftown .
( CNN ) -- Zakaria Amara , a man prosecutors say wanted to create a Canadian version of 9/11 , was sentenced Monday to life in prison in Canada .
Amara , 24 , has been described as the mastermind of a group known as the Toronto 18 -- a group of teenagers and young adults who were rounded up in the spring of 2006 .
Police say the group of young Muslim men from suburban Toronto -- all Canadian citizens -- were planning to blow up three one - ton ammonium nitrate bombs inside vans parked in downtown Toronto .
A police informant who infiltrated the group told CNN that Amara was planning to time the three explosions for September 11 , 2006 , the five - year anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Centers in New York .
At his sentencing hearing last Thursday , Amara pleaded with the court for leniency .
In a letter he told the court he was a changed man and vowing to transform himself from " a man of destruction to a man of construction . "
Amara also was sentenced Monday to an additional nine years for his participation in a terrorist group .
Earlier Monday , Saad Gaya , a 22 - year - old Canadian who was charged with being part of the plot , was sentenced to 12 years in prison .
Police were able to infiltrate the group and make arrests before the plot got dangerous .
But the group actually did try to acquire the material needed , even testing their own cell - phone detonation devices , police said .
In an interview last November , Toronto 's police chief , Bill Blair , told CNN the goal of the group was to kill as many Canadians as possible .
" The detonators they obtained worked , " Blair said .
" Had they been able to obtain all the chemicals that they were trying to obtain , had they been able to detonate that in the city of Toronto , thousands of citizens would have been killed . "
Blair has been critical of what he considers lenient sentencing for Toronto 18 suspects .
Charges against seven of the group were dropped or stayed .
Of those convicted , one is already free , after being sentenced to two - and - a - half years for participating in , and contributing to , a terrorist group .
Gaya , sentenced Monday to 12 years in prison , was caught on video tape unloading what he thought was ammonium nitrate to make the bombs .
The public prosecution office in Canada says that with adjustments for time served , he could possibly be released after serving another four - and - a - half years .
CUSHING — For 10 minutes and 20 seconds , Donna Jackson remained calm as she stood in the dark pleading for help and repeatedly telling emergency dispatchers that she did not want to shoot the " crazy , ” " drunk sounding ” man who was yelling and determined to get inside her house early Friday .
But when he threw a table through her sliding glass patio door , the 56 - year - old woman — who was home alone — could n’t wait for deputies any longer .
There is a loud crash on the 911 tape .
The phone drops , and there ’s a single shot from a 16 - gauge shotgun .
Only then , does the woman who has been so calm throughout the ordeal begin to fall apart .
" I shot .
I shot , ” Jackson tells the dispatcher frantically .
" I ’m going out front .
I hit him .
Oh God , help me !
I dropped the phone .
...
Oh please , dear God , I think I ’ve killed him . ”
As the reality sinks in , her voice fades to a whisper , " Please , Father in Heaven .
Please , Father in Heaven .
Oh my God , ma’am .
Please . ”
And she begins to sob , " I ’m sorry .
I ’m so sorry . ”
The dispatcher on the other end of the line tries to comfort her , telling her there was nothing she could have done — she had to protect herself .
" No , he ’s bleeding , ” Jackson said , looking at the body on her back porch .
" I ’m so sorry , Father . ”
A ‘ bizarre ’ situation
Lincoln County Sheriff Chuck Mangion said dispatchers first got the call from Jackson about 12:40 a.m. , after her dogs ’ barking woke her up .
The man shot and killed at Jackson ’s home , Billy Dean Riley , 53 , was no stranger to the sheriff ’s office .
" I ’d say he ’s been in an out of jail since he was old enough to go to jail , ” Mangion said .
" He has a long history of drug and alcohol - related offenses . ”
But what has the sheriff puzzled is why the intruder was so determined to break into Jackson ’s rather fortified home , marked by a locked gate and " Beware of the dog ” signs .
" As to what his motives were in trying to break into the house remains unclear , ” Mangion said .
Jackson said the man was talking " crazy . ”
He apparently did n’t know where his pickup was , and he kept yelling for someone named " Pat . ”
Mangion said his deputies found Riley ’s pickup just down the secluded rural road , and it appeared the vehicle had left the roadway and run into a ditch .
Inside the pickup , investigators found Riley ’s sister , Patricia Ellen Totty , 45 , unconscious from what they called an overdose of alcohol and narcotics .
She was taken to a Stroud hospital , where she was later listed in good condition .
Mangion said he could n’t say whether Riley had gone to the house to get help for his sister .
" He did n’t go to the front door or ring the door bell to try to gain entry , ” the sheriff said .
Mangion said Riley is a repeat offender , but local officers have never seen him do anything like this before .
" Dealing with him , I can tell you that when he had a load on , he could be a pretty mean individual , ” the sheriff said .
" But this is just bizarre .
I ’ve been doing this for 35 years , and this one is pretty much a mind - blower . ”
Court records show Riley , of Sparks , has a number of driving under the influence of alcohol convictions , including convictions in Lincoln County in 1997 , 1999 , 2001 and 2004 .
He was convicted of public intoxication in Lincoln County in 2002 and of possession of marijuana in Lincoln County in 1998 .
Thyroid cancer among women is skyrocketing all over the world .
Incidence is growing faster than for any other cancer .
This has been going on for a long time , and the reasons why remain elusive .
The prevailing view is that there ’s been an “ epidemic of diagnosis ” — that is , overdiagnosis — particularly following a screening program .
The tumors have always been there , the argument goes , but new and better detection tools ( ultrasound , for example ) have made it easier to spot small ones , many of which would likely never present a real threat .
In any case , thyroid cancer is not one of the bad ones ; 98- 99 percent of those diagnosed survive at least five years , the highest for all cancers .
Watchful waiting is often the best prescription .
The only recognized cause for thyroid cancer is ionizing radiation .

Rebel army enters Havana , January 1 , 1959 .
By Fidel Castro
January 3 , 2010 --
As the Cuban Revolution celebrated its 51st anniversary two days ago , memories of that January 1 , 1959 , came to mind .
The outlandish idea that , after half a century — which flew by — we would remember it as if it were yesterday , never occurred to any of us .
During the meeting at the Oriente sugar mill on December 28 , 1958 , with the commander in chief of the enemy ’s forces , whose elite units were surrounded without any way out whatsoever , the commander admitted defeat and appealed to our generosity to find a dignified way out for the rest of his forces .
He knew of our humane treatment of prisoners and the injured without any exception .
He accepted the agreement that I proposed , although I warned him that operations under way would continue .
But he travelled to the capital , and , incited by the United States embassy , instigated a coup d’état .
We were preparing for combat on that January 1 when , in the early hours of the morning , the news came in of the dictator ’s flight .
The Rebel Army was ordered not to permit a ceasefire and to continue battling on all fronts .
Radio Rebelde called on workers to launch a revolutionary general strike , immediately followed by the entire nation .
The coup attempt was defeated , and that same afternoon , our victorious troops entered Santiago de Cuba .
Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos received instructions to advance rapidly by road in motor vehicles with their battle - hardened forces toward La Cabaña and the Columbia military camp .
The enemy army , hit hard on all fronts , was unable to resist .
The people in arms themselves took over the centres of repression and police stations .
In the afternoon of January 2 at a stadium in Bayamo , and accompanied by a small escort , I met with more than 2000 soldiers from the tank , artillery and motorised infantry units , against whom we had been fighting until the day before .
They were still carrying their weapons .
We had won the enemy ’s respect with our audacious but humanitarian methods of irregular warfare .
This was how , in just four days — after 25 months of war that we reinitiated with a few guns — some 100,000 air , sea and ground weapons and the entire power of the state remained in the hands of the Cuban Revolution .
In just a few lines , I am recounting everything that happened during those days 51 years ago .
Battle to save our species
Then the main battle began : to preserve Cuba ’s independence against the most powerful empire that has ever existed , a battle which our people waged with great dignity .
I am happy today to observe those who , in the face of incredible obstacles , sacrifices and risks , were able to defend our homeland , and who today , together with their children , parents and loved ones , are enjoying the happiness and glories of each new year .
Today , however , is nothing like yesterday .
We experience a new era unlike any other in history .
Before , the people fought and are fighting still , with honour , for a better and more just world , but now they are also having to fight , without any alternative whatsoever , for the very survival of our species .
If we ignore this , we know absolutely nothing .
Cuba is , without question , one of the most politically educated countries on the planet ; it started out from the most shameful illiteracy , and what is worse , our yankee masters and the bourgeoisie associated with the foreign owners of land , sugar mills , production plants for consumer goods , warehouses , businesses , electricity , telephones , banks , mines , insurance , docks , bars , hotels , offices , houses , theatres , printshops , magazines , newspapers , radio , the emerging television , and everything of important value .
After the ardent flames of our battles for freedom had been quenched , the yankees had taken upon themselves the task of thinking for a people that struggled so hard to be the masters of their independence , resources and destiny .
Absolutely nothing , not even the task of thinking politically , belonged to us .
How many of us knew how to read and write ?
How many of us even made it to sixth grade ?
I recall that especially on a day like today , because that was the country that was supposed to belong to the Cuban people .
I will not list anything more , because I would have to include much more , including the best schools , the best hospitals , the best houses , the best doctors , the best lawyers .
How many of us had a right to that ?
Which of us possessed , with some exceptions , the natural and divine right to be administrators and leaders ?
Every millionaire and rich individual , without exception , was a political party leader , senator , representative or important official .
That was the " representative and pure democracy " that prevailed in our country , except that the yankees imposed , at their whim , merciless and cruel petty dictators whenever it was more convenient for them to better defend their properties against landless campesinos and workers with or without jobs .
Given that nobody even talks about that anymore , I am venturing to remember it .
Climate change and the battle in Copenhagen
Our country is one of more than 150 that constitute the Third World , which would be the first but not the only nations destined to suffer incredible consequences if humanity does not become aware , clearly , certainly and a lot more quickly than we thought , of the reality and consequences of the climate change caused by human beings if it is not prevented in time .
Our mass media has dedicated space to describing the effects of climate change .
Increasingly violent hurricanes , droughts and other natural disasters have likewise contributed to the education of our people on this subject .
One singular event , the battle over the climate issue that took place at the Copenhagen summit , has contributed to knowledge of the imminent danger .
It is not a matter of a distant threat for the 22nd century , but for the 21st ; nor is it just for the latter half of this century , but for the coming decades , in which we will begin to suffer its terrible consequences .
It is also not just a question of simple action against the empire and its henchmen , which in this issue , like in everything else , are trying to impose their own stupid and egotistic interests , but a battle of world opinion that that cannot be left to spontaneity or the whims of the majority of their mass media .
It is a situation with which , fortunately , millions of honourable and brave people in the world are familiar , a battle to wage with the masses and within social organisations and scientific , cultural , humanitarian and other international institutions , most especially in the heart of the United Nations , where the United States government , its NATO allies and the richest countries tried to effect a fraudulent and anti-democratic coup in Denmark against the rest of the emerging and poor countries of the Third World .
Rich states attempted to load climate burden on poor
In Copenhagen , the Cuban delegation , which attended together with others from the ALBA and the Third World , was forced into a fight to the finish in the face of the incredible events that began with the speech of the US president , Barack Obama , and of the group of the richest states on the planet , resolved to dismantle the binding commitments of Kyoto — where the thorny problem was discussed more than 12 years ago — and to load the burden of sacrifice onto the emerging and underdeveloped countries , which are the poorest and at the same time the principal suppliers of the planet ’s raw materials and non-renewable resources to the most developed and opulent countries .
In Copenhagen , Obama appeared on the last day of the conference , which began on December 7 , 2009 .
The worst aspect of his conduct was that , after he had decided to dispatch 30,000 soldiers to the slaughter of Afghanistan — a country with a strong tradition of independence , which not even the English in their better and cruellest times could dominate — he went to Oslo to receive no less than a Nobel Peace Prize .
He arrived in the Norwegian capital on December 10 and gave an empty , demagogic and justifying speech .
On the 18th , the date of the summit ’s last session , he appeared in Copenhagen , where he planned to remain for just eight hours .
His secretary of state and a select group of his best strategists had arrived the previous day .
The first thing that Obama did was to select a group of guests who were given the honour of accompanying him as he gave a speech at the summit .
The complacent and fawning Danish prime minister , who was presiding over the summit , gave the podium over to a group that numbered just 15 .
The imperial chief deserved special honours .
His speech was a was a combination of sweetened words seasoned with theatrical gestures , already boring for those of us , like me , assigned themselves the task of listening to him in order to try and be objective in an appreciation of his characteristics and political intentions .
Obama imposed on his docile Danish host , so that only his guests could speak , although as soon as he had made his own comments , he " made himself scarce " through the back door , like an imp escaping from an audience which had done him the honour of listening with interest .
Once the authorised list of speakers was finished , an Indigenous man , Aymara through and through , Evo Morales , president of Bolivia , who had just been reelected with 65 % of the vote , demanded the right to speak , which was granted , to the resounding applause of those present .
In just nine minutes , he expressed profound and dignified concepts in response to the words of the absent US president .
Immediately afterward , Hugo Chávez got up to ask to speak on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ; the person presiding over the session had no choice but to also give him the right to speak , and he used that to improvise one of the most brilliant speeches that I ’ve ever heard .
When he finished , a strike of the gavel ended the unusual session .
The extremely busy Obama and his entourage , however , did not have a minute to lose .
His group had put together a draft statement , full of vagueness , which was the negation of the Kyoto Protocol .
After he dashed out of the plenary session , Obama met with other groups of guests numbering no more than 30 , negotiated in private and in groups ; insisted ; mentioned figures to the tune of millions of green bills without gold backing and which are constantly being devaluated , and even threatened to leave the meeting if his demands were not met .
Worst of all , it was a meeting of super - rich countries , to which several of the most important emerging nations were invited and two or three poor ones , to which he submitted the document as if proposing , " take it or leave it ! " .
The Danish prime minister tried to present that confusing , ambiguous and contradictory statement – in the discussion of which the UN did not participate in any way – as the summit agreement .
The summit sessions had already concluded , almost all of the heads of state and government and foreign ministers had left for their respective countries and , at three in the morning , the distinguished Danish prime minister presented it to the plenary session , where hundreds of long - suffering officials who had n’t slept for three days , received the thorny document , and were given only one hour to discuss and approve it .
Poor countries resist
That is when the meeting became fiery ; the delegates had n’t even had time to read it .
A number of them asked to speak .
The first was the delegate from Tuvalu , whose islands would be inundated if what was proposed there was approved ; those of Bolivia , Venezuela , Cuba and Nicaragua followed him .
The dialectical confrontation at 3 am on that December 19 is worthy of going down in history , if history should continue after climate change .
As a large part of what happened is known in Cuba , or is on internet web pages , I will confine myself to partially expounding on the two responses of Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez , worthy of being recorded in order to know the last episodes of the Copenhagen soap opera , and aspects of the final chapter , which are still to be published in our country .
Mr. President ( Prime Minister of Denmark ) …
The document that you affirmed on various occasions did not exist , has now appeared .
We have all seen versions circulating surreptitiously and being discussed in small and secret meetings outside the conference halls in which the international community , via its representatives , is negotiating in a transparent manner .
I add my voice to those of the representatives of Tuvalu , Venezuela and Bolivia .
Cuba considers the text of this apocryphal draft as extremely insufficient and inadmissible …
The document which you are presenting , lamentably , does not contain any commitment whatsoever to reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
I am aware of prior versions which , in questionable and clandestine procedures , were also being negotiated behind closed doors and which talked of a reduction of at least 50 % by the year 2050 …
The document that you have presented now , precisely omits the already meager and insufficient key phrases that that version contained .
This document does not guarantee , in any way , the adoption of minimal measures that would make it possible to avert an extremely grave disaster for the planet and the human species .
This shameful document that you have brought is likewise omissive and ambiguous in relation to the specific commitment to emission reductions on the part of the developed countries , those responsible for global warming given the historic and current level of their emissions , and on whom it falls to implement substantial reductions immediately .
This paper does not contain one single word of commitment on the part of the developed countries .
… Your role , Mr. President , is the death certificate of the Kyoto Protocol , which my delegation does not accept .
The Cuban delegation wishes to emphasize the preeminence of the principle of " common but differentiated responsibilities ’ as the central concept of the future negotiation process .
Your paper does not say one word about that .
The Cuban delegation reiterates its protest at the grave violations of procedure that have been produced in the anti-democratic management of the process of this conference , via the utilization of arbitrary , exclusive and discriminatory forms of debate and negotiation … Mr. President , I am formally asking for this statement to be placed in the final report on the workings of this lamentable and shameful 15th Conference of the Parties .
What nobody could have imagined is that , after another lengthy recess and when everybody thought that only the formalities remained before the conclusion of the summit , the prime minister of the host country , at the instigation of the yankees , would make another attempt to pass off the document as a consensus of the summit , when not even foreign ministers were left in the plenary .
The delegates from Venezuela , Bolivia , Nicaragua and Cuba , who remained vigilant and unsleeping until the last minute , frustrated the latter maneuver in Copenhagen .
However , the problem was not concluded .
The powerful are not accustomed to brooking resistance .
On December 30 , the Danish Permanent Mission to the United Nations , in New York , courteously informed our mission in that city that it had taken note of the " Copenhagen Agreement " of December 18 , 2009 , and attached an advance copy of that decision .
It affirmed textually :
… the government of Denmark , in its capacity of president of COP15 , invites the Parties to the Convention to inform the secretariat of the UNFCCC in writing , and as soon as possible , of your willingness to commit to the Copenhagen Agreement .
This surprise communication motivated a response from the Cuban Permanent Mission to the United Nations , in which it " … flatly rejects the intention to gain indirect approval of a text that was the object of repudiation by various delegations , not only on account of its insufficiency in the face of the grave effects of climate change , but also for exclusively responding to the interests of a reduced group of states . "
At the same time it prompted a letter from Dr. Fernando González Bermúdez , first deputy minister of the Ministry of Science , Technology and the Environment of the Republic of Cuba to Mr. Yvo de Boer , executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , some of whose paragraphs are transcribed below :
We have received with surprise and concern the note that the government of Denmark is circulating to the Permanent Missions of the member states of the United Nations in New York .
Of which you are surely aware , via which the party states of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to inform the executive secretary , in writing , of you wish to be associated with the so - called Copenhagen Agreement . "
We have observed , with additional concern , that the government of Denmark communicates that the executive secretary of the Convention is to include in the report of the Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen , a list of the party states which have stated their will to commit to the quoted agreement .
In the judgment of the Republic of Cuba , this form of acting constitutes a crude and reprehensible violation of what was decided in Copenhagen , where the party states , faced with an evident lack of consensus , confined themselves to taking note of the existence of the said document .
Nothing that was agreed in COP15 authorizes the government of Denmark to adopt this action and , far less , the executive secretary to include a list of party states in the final report , for which he has no mandate .
I must inform you that the government of the Republic of Cuba most firmly rejects this new attempt to indirectly legitimate a spurious document and to reiterate to you that this way of acting compromises the result of future negotiations , sets a dangerous precedent for the Convention ’s work and , in particular , is injurious to the spirit of goodwill in which delegations must continue the negotiation process next year .
Many know , especially the social movements and better informed people in humanitarian , cultural and scientific movements , that the document promoted by the United States constitutes a regression of the positions achieved by those who are making efforts to avert a colossal disaster for our species .
There is no point in repeating here facts and figures that are mathematically demonstrated .
The data is confirmed on internet web pages and are within the reach of a growing number of people who are interested in the issue .
The theory defending adherence to the document is feeble and implies a setback .
The deceptive idea that the rich countries will contribute the miserable sum of US $ 30 billion over three years to the poor countries in order to offset the costs implied by confronting climate change , costs which could rise to $ 100 billion by 2020 , which in the context of this exceedingly grave problem , is like waiting for the Greek calendars .
Specialists know that those figures are ridiculous and unacceptable given the volume of investments required .
The origin of such sums is vague and confused , in a way that they do not commit anybody .
What is the value of one dollar ?
What is the significance of $ 30 billion ?
We all know that , from Bretton Woods in 1944 to Nixon ’s presidential order in 1971 – imparted in order to offload the cost of the genocidal war on Vietnam onto the world economy – that the value of one dollar , measured in gold , has gradually been reduced to the point of today , when it is approximately 32 times less than then ; $ 30 billion thus signifies less than one billion , and one billion divided by 32 is equivalent to $ 3.125 million , which would not even stretch to building one middle - capacity oil refinery at the present time .
If , at some point , the industrialised countries were to meet their promise to contribute 0.7 % of their GDP to the developing countries – something that , barring a few exceptions , they never have – the figure would be in excess of $ 250 billion every year .
The US government spent $ 800 billion on saving the banks .
How much would it be prepared to pay to save the nine billion people who will inhabit the planet in 2050 , if large - scale drought and sea flooding provoked by the melting of glaciers and great masses of frozen water from Greenland and Antarctica ?
Divide and rule
Let us not deceive ourselves .
What the United States has attempted with its maneuvres in Copenhagen is to divide the Third World , to separate more than 150 underdeveloped countries from China , India , Brazil , South Africa and others with which we must fight united to defend – in Bonn , Mexico or any other international conference , along with the social , scientific and humanitarian organisations – genuine agreements that will benefit all countries and preserve humanity from a disaster that could lead to the extinction of our species .
The world is in possession of constantly more information , but politicians have constantly less time for thinking .
The rich nations and their leaders , including the US Congress , would seem to be arguing which will be the last to disappear .
When Obama has completed the 28 parties with which he proposed to celebrate this Christmas , if Epiphany is included among them , perhaps Caspar , Melchior and Balthasar will advise him on what he should do .
El mundo medio siglo después
Por Fidel Castro Ruz
Enero 3 de 2010 --
Al cumplirse hace dos días el 51 aniversario del triunfo de la Revolución , acudieron a mi mente los recuerdos de aquel 1 º de Enero de 1959 .
Ninguno de nosotros imaginó nunca la peregrina idea de que transcurrido medio siglo , que pasó volando , lo estaríamos recordando como si fuera ayer .
Durante la reunión en el central Oriente , el 28 de diciembre de 1958 , con el Comandante en Jefe de las fuerzas enemigas , cuyas unidades élites estaban cercadas y sin escape alguno , este reconoció su derrota y apeló a nuestra generosidad para buscar una salida decorosa al resto de sus fuerzas .
Conocía de nuestro trato humano a los prisioneros y heridos sin excepción alguna .
Aceptó el acuerdo que le propuse , aunque le advertí que las operaciones en curso proseguirían .
Pero viajó a la capital e instigado por la embajada de Estados Unidos promovió un golpe de Estado .
Nos preparábamos para los combates de ese día 1 º de Enero , cuando en la madrugada llegó la noticia de la fuga del tirano .
Se impartieron órdenes al Ejército Rebelde de no admitir el alto al fuego y continuar los combates en todos los frentes .
A través de Radio Rebelde se convocó a los trabajadores a una Huelga General Revolucionaria , secundada de inmediato por toda la nación .
El intento golpista fue derrotado , y en horas de la tarde de ese mismo día nuestras tropas victoriosas penetraron en Santiago de Cuba .
El Che y Camilo recibieron instrucciones de avanzar rápidamente por la carretera , en vehículos motorizados con sus aguerridas fuerzas , hacia La Cabaña y el Campamento Militar de Columbia .
El ejército adversario , golpeado en todos los frentes , no tendría capacidad de resistir .
El propio pueblo sublevado , ocupó los centros de represión y las estaciones de policía .
El día 2 , en horas de la tarde , acompañado por una peque ña escolta , me reuní en un estadio de Bayamo con más de dos mil soldados de los tanques , artillería e infantería motorizada , contra los cuales habíamos estado combatiendo hasta el día anterior .
Portaban todavía su armamento .
Nos habíamos ganado el respeto del adversario con nuestros audaces , pero humanitarios métodos de guerra irregular .
De este modo , en solo cuatro días — después de 25 meses de guerra que reiniciamos con unos pocos fusiles — , alrededor de cien mil armas de aire , mar y tierra y todo el poder del Estado quedaron en manos de la Revolución .
En solo pocas líneas relato lo ocurrido aquellos días hace 51 años .
Comenzó entonces la principal batalla : preservar la independencia de Cuba frente al imperio más poderoso que ha existido , y que nuestro pueblo libró con gran dignidad .
Me complace hoy observar a aquellos que por encima de increíbles obstáculos , sacrificios y riesgos , supieron defender a nuestra Patria , y en estos días , junto a sus hijos , sus padres y sus seres más queridos , disfrutan la alegría y las glorias de cada nuevo año .
En nada se parecen , sin embargo , los días de hoy a los de ayer .
Vivimos una época nueva que no tiene parecido con ninguna otra de la historia .
Antes los pueblos luchaban y luchan todavía con honor por un mundo mejor y más justo , pero hoy tienen que luchar , además , y sin alternativa posible , por la propia supervivencia de la especie .
No sabemos absolutamente nada si ignoramos esto .
Cuba es , sin duda , uno de los países políticamente más instruido del planeta ; había partido del más bochornoso analfabetismo , y lo que es peor : nuestros amos yankis y la burguesía asociada a los dueños extranjeros eran los propietarios de las tierras , los centrales azucareros , las plantas de productos de bienes de consumo , los almacenes , los comercios , la electricidad , los teléfonos , los bancos , las minas , los seguros , los muelles , los bares , los hoteles , las oficinas , las casas de vivienda , los cines , las imprentas , las revistas , los periódicos , la radio , la naciente televisión y todo cuanto tuviera un valor importante .
Los yankis , apagadas las ardientes llamas de nuestras batallas por la libertad , se habían arrogado la tarea de pensar por un pueblo que tanto luchó por ser dueño de su independencia , sus riquezas y su destino .
Nada en absoluto , ni siquiera la tarea de pensar políticamente , nos pertenecía .
¿ Cuántos sabíamos leer y escribir ?
¿ Cuántos llegábamos siquiera al sexto grado ?
Lo recuerdo especialmente un día como hoy , porque ese era el país que se suponía pertenecía a los cubanos .
No cito más cosas , porque tendría que incluir muchas más , entre ellas las mejores escuelas , los mejores hospitales , las mejores casas , los mejores médicos , los mejores abogados .
¿ Cuántos éramos los que teníamos derecho a ello ?
¿ Quiénes poseíamos , salvo excepciones , el derecho natural y divino de ser administradores y jefes ?
Ningún millonario o sujeto rico , sin excepción , dejaba de ser jefe de Partido , Senador , Representante o funcionario importante .
Esa era la democracia representativa y pura que imperaba en nuestra Patria , excepto que los yankis impusieran a su antojo tiranuelos despiadados y crueles , cuando convenía más a sus intereses para defender mejor sus propiedades frente a campesinos sin tierra y obreros con o sin trabajo .
Como ya nadie habla siquiera de eso , me aventuro a recordarlo .
Nuestro país forma parte de los más de 150 que constituyen el Tercer Mundo , que serán los primeros aunque no los únicos destinados a sufrir las increíbles consecuencias si la humanidad no toma conciencia clara , cierta y bastante más rápida de lo que imaginamos de la realidad y consecuencias del cambio climático ocasionado por el hombre , si no se logra impedirlo a tiempo .
Nuestros medios de comunicación masiva han dedicado espacios a describir los efectos de los cambios climáticos .
Los huracanes de creciente violencia , las sequías y otras calamidades naturales , han contribuido igualmente a la educación de nuestro pueblo sobre el tema .
Un hecho singular , la batalla en torno al problema climático que tuvo lugar en la Cumbre de Copenhague , ha contribuido al conocimiento del inminente peligro .
No se trata de un riesgo lejano para el siglo XXII , sino para el XXI , ni lo es tampoco solo para la segunda mitad de este , sino para las próximas décadas , en las que ya comenzaríamos a sufrir sus penosas consecuencias .
Tampoco se trata de una simple acción contra el imperio y sus secuaces , que en esto , como en todo , tratan de imponer sus estúpidos y egoístas intereses , sino de una batalla de opinión mundial que no se puede dejar a la espontaneidad ni al capricho de la mayoría de sus medios de comunicación .
Es una situación que por fortuna conocen millones de personas honradas y valientes en el mundo , una batalla a librar con las masas y en el seno de las organizaciones sociales e instituciones científicas , culturales , humanitarias , y otras de carácter internacional , muy especialmente en el seno de las Naciones Unidas , donde el Gobierno de Estados Unidos , sus aliados de la OTAN y los países más ricos trataron de asestar , en Dinamarca , un golpe fraudulento y antidemocrático contra el resto de los países emergentes y pobres del Tercer Mundo .
En Copenhague , la delegación cubana , que asistió junto a otras del ALBA y el Tercer Mundo , se vio obligada a una lucha a fondo ante los increíbles acontecimientos que se originaron con el discurso del presidente yanki , Barack Obama , y del grupo de Estados más ricos del planeta , decididos a desmantelar los compromisos vinculantes de Kyoto — donde hace más de 12 años se discutió el peliagudo problema — y a hacer caer el peso de los sacrificios sobre los países emergentes y los subdesarrollados , que son los más pobres y a la vez los principales suministradores de materias primas y recursos no renovables del planeta a los más desarrollados y opulentos .
En Copenhague , Obama se presentó el último día de la Conferencia , iniciada el 7 de diciembre .
Lo peor de su conducta fue que , cuando tenía ya decidido enviar 30 mil soldados a la carnicería de Afganistán — un país de fuerte tradición independentista , al que ni siquiera los ingleses en sus mejores y más crueles tiempos pudieron someter — asistió a Oslo para recibir nada menos que el Premio Nobel de la Paz .
A la capital noruega llegó el 10 de diciembre , donde pronunció un discurso hueco , demagógico y justificativo .
El 18 , que era la fecha de la última sesión de la Cumbre , se apareció en Copenhague , donde pensaba permanecer inicialmente solo 8 horas .
El día anterior habían llegado la Secretaria de Estado y un grupo selecto de sus mejores estrategas .
Lo primero que hizo Obama fue seleccionar a un grupo de invitados que recibieron el honor de acompañarlo a pronunciar un discurso en la Cumbre .
El Primer Ministro danés , que presidía la Cumbre , complaciente y adulón , le cedió la palabra al grupo que apenas rebasaba 15 personas .
El jefe imperial merecía honores especiales .
Su discurso fue una mezcla de edulcoradas palabras aliñadas con gestos teatrales , que ya aburren a quienes , como yo , se asignaron la tarea de escucharlo para tratar de ser objetivos en la apreciación de sus características e intenciones políticas .
Obama impuso a su dócil anfitrión dinamarqués que solo sus invitados podían hacer uso de la palabra , aunque él , tan pronto pronunció las suyas , hizo " mutis por el foro " por una puerta trasera , como duende que escapa de un auditorio que le había hecho el honor de escuchar con interés .
Concluida la lista autorizada de oradores , un indígena aymara de pura cepa , Evo Morales , presidente de Bolivia , que acababa de ser reelecto con el 65 % de los votos , exigió el derecho a usar la palabra , que le fue concedida ante el aplauso abrumador de los presentes .
En solo nueve minutos expresó profundos y dignos conceptos que respondían a las palabras del ausente Presidente de Estados Unidos .
Acto seguido se levantó Hugo Chávez para solicitar hablar en nombre de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela ; a quien presidía la sesión no le quedó otra alternativa que concederle también el uso de la palabra , que utilizó para improvisar uno de los más brillantes discursos que le he escuchado .
Al concluir , un martillazo puso fin a la insólita sesión .
El ocupadísimo Obama y su séquito no tenían , sin embargo , un minuto que perder .
Su grupo había elaborado un Proyecto de Declaración , repleto de vaguedades , que era la negación del Protocolo de Kyoto .
Después que salió precipitadamente de la plenaria , se reunió con otros grupos de invitados que no llegaban a 30 , negoció en privado y en grupo ; insistió , mencionó cifras millonarias de billetes verdes sin respaldo en oro , que constantemente se devalúan y hasta amenazó con marcharse de la reunión si no se accedía a sus demandas .
Lo peor fue que se trató de una reunión de países superricos a la que invitaron a varias de las más importantes naciones emergentes y a dos o tres pobres , a las cuales sometió el documento , como quien propone : ¡ Lo tomas o lo dejas !
Tal declaración confusa , ambigua y contradictoria — en cuya discusión no participó para nada la Organización de Naciones Unidas — , el Primer Ministro danés trató de presentarla como Acuerdo de la Cumbre .
Ya esta había concluido su período de sesiones , casi todos los Jefes de Estado , de Gobierno y Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores se habían marchado a sus respectivos países , y a las tres de la madrugada , el distinguido Primer Ministro danés lo presentó al plenario , donde cientos de sufridos funcionarios que desde hacía tres días no dormían , recibieron el engorroso documento ofreciéndoles solo una hora para analizarlo y decidir su aprobación .
Allí se incendió la reunión .
Los delegados no habían tenido siquiera tiempo de leerlo .
Varios solicitaron la palabra .
El primero fue el de Tuvalu , cuyas islas quedarán bajo las aguas si se aprobaba lo que all í se proponía ; lo siguieron los de Bolivia , Venezuela , Cuba y Nicaragua .
El enfrentamiento dialéctico a las 3 de aquella madrugada del 19 de diciembre es digno de pasar a la historia , si la historia durara mucho tiempo después del cambio climático .
Como gran parte de lo ocurrido se conoce en Cuba , o está en las páginas Web de Internet , me limitaré sólo a exponer en parte las dos réplicas del canciller cubano , Bruno Rodríguez , dignas de ser consignadas para conocer los episodios finales de la telenovela de Copenhague , y los elementos del último capítulo que todavía no han sido publicados en nuestro país .
" Señor Presidente ( Primer Ministro de Dinamarca ) ¼
El documento que usted varias veces afirmó que no existía , aparece ahora .
Todos hemos visto versiones que circulan de manera subrepticia y que se discuten en pequeños conciliábulos secretos , fuera de las salas en que la comunidad internacional , a través de sus representantes , negocia de una manera transparente . "
" Sumo mi voz a la de los representantes de Tuvalu , Venezuela y Bolivia .
Cuba considera extremadamente insuficiente e inadmisible el texto de este proyecto apócrifo¼ "
" El documento que usted , lamentablemente , presenta no contiene compromiso alguno de reducción de emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero .
" Conozco las versiones anteriores que también , a través de procedimientos cuestionables y clandestinos , se estuvieron negociando en corrillos cerrados que hablaban , al menos , de una reducción del 50 % para el año 2050 ¼ "
" El documento que usted presenta ahora , omite , precisamente , las ya magras e insuficientes frases clave que aquella versión contenía .
Este documento no garantiza , en modo alguno , la adopción de medidas mínimas que permitan evitar una gravísima catástrofe para el planeta y la especie humana . "
" Este vergonzoso documento que usted trae es también omiso y ambiguo en relación con el compromiso específico de reducción de emisiones por parte de los países desarrollados , responsables del calentamiento global por el nivel histórico y actual de sus emisiones , y a quienes corresponde aplicar reducciones sustanciales de manera inmediata .
Este papel no contiene una sola palabra de compromiso de parte de los países desarrollados . "
" ¼ Su papel , señor Presidente , es el acta de defunción del Protocolo de Kyoto , que mi delegación no acepta . "
" La delegación cubana desea hacer énfasis en la preeminencia del principio de ‘ responsabilidades comunes , pero diferenciadas ’ , como concepto central del futuro proceso de negociaciones .
Su papel no dice una palabra de eso . "
" La delegación de Cuba reitera su protesta por las graves violaciones de procedimiento que se han producido en la conducción antidemocrática del proceso de esta conferencia , especialmente , mediante la utilización de formatos de debate y de negociación , arbitrarios , excluyentes y discriminatorios¼ "
" Señor Presidente , le solicito formalmente que esta declaración sea recogida en el informe final sobre los trabajos de esta lamentable y bochornosa 15 Conferencia de las Partes . "
Lo que nadie podría imaginar es que , después de otro largo receso y cuando ya todos pensaban que solo faltaban los trámites formales para dar por concluida la Cumbre , el Primer Ministro del país sede , instigado por los yankis , haría otro intento de hacer pasar el documento como consenso de la Cumbre , cuando no quedaban ni siquiera Cancilleres en el plenario .
Delegados de Venezuela , Bolivia , Nicaragua y Cuba , que permanecieron vigilantes e insomnes hasta el último minuto , frustraron la postrera maniobra en Copenhague .
No concluiría , sin embargo , el problema .
Los poderosos no están habituados , ni admiten resistencia .
El 30 de diciembre la Misión Permanente de Dinamarca ante Naciones Unidas , en Nueva York , informó cortésmente a nuestra Misión en esa ciudad que había tomado nota del Acuerdo de Copenhague del 18 de diciembre de 2009 , y adjuntaba copia avanzada de esa decisión .
Textualmente afirmó : " ¼ el Gobierno de Dinamarca , en su calidad de Presidente de la COP15 , invita a las Partes de la Convención a informar por escrito a la Secretaría de la UNFCCC , lo antes posible , su voluntad de asociarse al Acuerdo de Copenhague . "
Esta sorpresiva comunicación motivó la respuesta de la Misión Permanente de Cuba ante Naciones Unidas , en la que " ¼ rechaza de plano la intención de hacer aprobar , por vía indirecta , un texto que fue objeto de repudio de varias delegaciones , no sólo por su insuficiencia ante los graves efectos del cambio climático , sino también por responder exclusivamente a los intereses de un reducido grupo de Estados . "
A su vez , originó una carta del Viceministro Primero del Ministerio de Ciencia , Tecnología y Medio Ambiente de la República de Cuba , Doctor Fernando González Bermúdez , al Sr. Yvo de Boer , Secretario Ejecutivo de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre Cambio Climático , algunos de cuyos párrafos transcribimos :
" Hemos recibido con sorpresa y preocupación la Nota que el Gobierno de Dinamarca circulara a las Misiones Permanentes de los Estados miembros de las Naciones Unidas en Nueva York , que usted seguramente conoce , mediante la cual se invita a los Estados Partes de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre Cambio Climático a informar a la Secretaría Ejecutiva , por escrito , y a su más pronta conveniencia , su deseo de asociarse al denominado Acuerdo de Copenhague . "
" Hemos observado , con preocupación adicional , que el Gobierno de Dinamarca comunica que la Secretaría Ejecutiva de la Convención incluirá , en el informe de la Conferencia de las Partes efectuada en Copenhague , un listado de los Estados Partes que hubieran manifestado su voluntad de asociarse con el citado Acuerdo . "
" A juicio de la República de Cuba , esta forma de actuar constituye una burda y reprobable violación de lo decidido en Copenhague , donde los Estados Partes , ante la evidente falta de consenso , se limitaron a tomar nota de la existencia de dicho documento . "
" Nada de lo acordado en la 15 COP autoriza al Gobierno de Dinamarca a adoptar esta acción y , mucho menos , a la Secretaría Ejecutiva a incluir en el informe final un listado de Estados Partes , para lo cual no tiene mandato . "
" Debo indicarle que el Gobierno de la República de Cuba rechaza de la manera más firme este nuevo intento de legitimar por vía indirecta un documento espurio y reiterarle que esta forma de actuar compromete el resultado de las futuras negociaciones , sienta un peligroso precedente para los trabajos de la Convención y lesiona en particular el espíritu de buena fe con que las delegaciones deberán continuar el proceso de negociaciones el próximo año " , concluyó el Viceministro Primero de Ciencia , Tecnología y Medio Ambiente de Cuba .
Muchos conocen , especialmente los movimientos sociales y las personas mejor informadas de las instituciones humanitarias , culturales y científicas , que el documento promovido por Estados Unidos constituye un retroceso de las posiciones alcanzadas por los que se esfuerzan en evitar una colosal catástrofe para nuestra especie .
Sería ocioso repetir aquí cifras y hechos que lo demuestran matemáticamente .
Los datos constan en las páginas Web de Internet y están al alcance del número creciente de personas que se interesan por el tema .
La teoría con que se defiende la adhesión al documento es endeble e implica un retroceso .
Se invoca la idea engañosa de que los países ricos aportarían una mísera suma de 30 mil millones de dólares en tres años a los países pobres para sufragar los gastos que implique enfrentar el cambio climático , cifra que podría elevarse a 100 mil por año en el 2020 , lo que en este gravísimo problema , equivale a esperar por las calendas griegas .
Los especialistas conocen que , esas cifras son ridículas e inaceptables por el volumen de las inversiones que se requieren .
El origen de tales sumas es vago y confuso , de modo que no comprometen a nadie .
¿ Cuál es el valor de un dólar ?
¿ Qué significan 30 mil millones ?
Todos sabemos que desde Bretton Woods , en 1944 , hasta la orden presidencial de Nixon en 1971 — impartida para echar sobre la economía mundial el gasto de la guerra genocida contra Viet Nam — , el valor de un dólar , medido en oro , se fue reduciendo hasta ser hoy aproximadamente 32 veces menor que entonces ; 30 mil millones significan menos de mil millones , y 100 mil divididos por 32 , equivalen a 3 125 , que no alcanzan en la actualidad ni para construir una refinería de petróleo de mediana capacidad .
Si los países industrializados cumplieran alguna vez la promesa de aportar a los que están por desarrollarse el 0,7 por ciento del PIB — algo que salvo contadas excepciones nunca hicieron — , la cifra excedería los 250 mil millones de dólares cada año .
Para salvar los bancos el gobierno de Estados Unidos gastó 800 mil millones .
¿ Cuánto estaría dispuesto a gastar para salvar a los 9 mil millones de personas que habitarán el planeta en el 2050 , si antes no se producen grandes sequías e inundaciones provocadas por el mar debido al deshielo de glaciares y grandes masas de aguas congeladas de Groenlandia y la Antártida ?
No nos dejemos engañar .
Lo que Estados Unidos ha pretendido con sus maniobras en Copenhague es dividir al Tercer Mundo , separar a más de 150 países subdesarrollados de China , India , Brasil , Sudáfrica y otros con los cuales debemos luchar unidos para defender , en Bonn , en México o en cualquier otra conferencia internacional , junto a las organizaciones sociales , científicas y humanitarias , verdaderos Acuerdos que beneficien a todos los países y preserven a la humanidad de una catástrofe que puede conducir a la extinción de nuestra especie .
El mundo posee cada vez más información , pero los políticos tienen cada vez menos tiempo para pensar .
Las naciones ricas y sus líderes , incluido el Congreso de Estados Unidos , parecen estar discutiendo cuál será el último en desaparecer .
Cuando Obama haya concluido las 28 fiestas con que se propuso celebrar estas Navidades , si entre ellas está incluida la de los Reyes Magos , quizás Gaspar , Melchor y Baltasar le aconsejen lo que debe hacer .
Ruego me excusen la extensión .
No quise dividir en dos partes esta Reflexión .
Pido perdón a los pacientes lectores .
In response to a new survey suggesting that P2P file - swapping might not be harming music sales , music 's international trade group IFPI today put out a statement .
" The net effect of illegal file - sharing in the UK and elsewhere has been to reduce legitimate sales , " IFPI asserts .
" This is why spending on recorded music has fallen every year since illegal file - sharing began to become widespread . "
In other words , P2P file - sharing is the main cause of the revenue decline and the ( very real ) job losses in the recorded music business .
It 's a strong assertion , but it 's not necessarily accepted outside the music industry .
And we 're not talking about the usual copyrighters , or groups like EFF , or Pirate Party backers ; complaints about P2P have failed to convince even people like the European Commissioner for Information Society and Media , Viviane Reding .
The industry responded not with a vigorous new ideas , but with strong - arm tactics and threats .
It served fans not with digital innovation but lawsuits — more than 20,000 in the span of four years , in an attempt to intimidate consumers away from file sharing .
Back in June 2009 , Reding made a speech in which she put equal blame for the problem on Big Content , so terrified of piracy and lack of control that many companies refuse to give customers what they want .
" It is necessary to penalise those who are breaking the law , " she said , " but are there really enough attractive and consumer - friendly legal offers on the market ?
Does our present legal system for Intellectual Property Rights really live up to the expectations of the Internet generation ?
Have we considered all alternative options to repression ?
Have we really looked at the issue through the eyes of a 16 year old ?
Or only from the perspective of law professors who grew up in the Gutenberg Age ?
In my view , growing Internet piracy is a vote of no -confidence in existing business models and legal solutions .
It should be a wake - up call for policy - makers . "
Innovation stagnation
" A vote of no -confidence in existing business models . "
It 's a common criticism , and one advanced by all sorts of people who are n't out to destroy copyright or sink major music labels .
Take the All Party Parliamentary Communications Group in the UK Parliament , which solicited mountains of comments from groups on all sides of the issue , and concluded in its final report ( PDF ) this fall that " much of the problem with illegal sharing of copyrighted material has been caused by the rightsholders , and the music industry in particular , being far too slow in getting their act together and making popular legal alternatives available . "
Plenty of musicians now agree .
Greg Kot , a Chicago journalist and the host of NPR's " Sound Opinions " radio show , collected a wide range of such sentiments for his recent book Ripped : How the Wired Generation Revolutionized Music .
Kot quotes Peter Jenner , the first manager of 60s psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd , saying , " The flagrant spread of ' Internet piracy ' in developed countries is a reflection of the failure of the industry as a whole to develop an appropriate copyright responds to the distribution and remuneration options made possible by the new technologies . "
Kot 's own take on what happened to the music labels is that they took the wrong approach to file - sharing .
" The industry responded not with a vigorous new ideas , but with strong - arm tactics and threats , " he writes .
" It served fans not with digital innovation but lawsuits — more than 20,000 in the span of four years , in an attempt to intimidate consumers away from file sharing . "
Even music 's top executives now recognize the dire lack of innovation in their businesses .
Edgar Bronfman , CEO of Warner , said in 2007 , " We used to think our content was perfect just exactly as it was .
We expected our business would remain blissfully unaffected even as the world of interactivity , constant connection , and file sharing was exploding .
And of course , we were wrong .
How were we wrong ?
By standing still or moving at a glacial pace , we inversely went to war with consumers by denying them what they wanted and could otherwise find .
And as a result , of course , consumers won . "
Steve Knopper , in his excellent book Appetite for Self - destruction : The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age , quotes Mac McCaughan , founder of Merge Records ( early home to bands like Arcade Fire ) .
" I 've always felt like major labels claiming downloading for their declining sales is just somewhat wishful thinking , " he said .
" It 's like a scapegoat — they wish it was that and not ' they 've been putting out terrible records for a long time '
People who are our hardcore fans like music and want to support the artists and labels that put out records they like .
We 're all in the music business , but it 's like we 're two different businesses . "
The single resurgent ?
Stealing music is not killing music .
When I talk to people in the music business , most of them will admit that the problem is they 're selling songs and not albums .
But if P2P is n't the main driver of lost revenue , where 's that revenue going ?
After all , major label music income is way down , and up to 50,000 people may have been laid off during this decade .
Knopper offers a simple explanation : labels used the CD era to basically eliminate the single and push the album .
In addition , the new - at - the - time digital format encouraged many consumers to re-purchase albums that they had previously owned only in analog .
When the digital download era arrived , labels had grown fat on this business model and were not prepared to nurture " album bands . "
Instead , the relentless obsession on creating " hits " in order to move albums , which worked so well in the CD era , proved disastrous in the age of iTunes .
Individual digital downloads brought the single back to life in a big way , and moving a 99 � single could n't come close to generating the same profit as a $ 14 CD , even with the costs of packaging eliminated .
And as for repurchasing albums , CDs were already digital , and typically featured better sound than that available through compressed downloads online .
Knopper quotes Robert Pittman , the cofounder of MTV .
" Stealing music is not killing music , " said Pittman .
" When I talk to people in the music business , most of them will admit that the problem is they 're selling songs and not albums .
I mean , you do the math . "
Copyright lawyers like William Patry agree .
In his new book Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars , Patry takes up the theme : " The problems in the Copyright Wars are not caused by technologies or by consumers acting badly , and they cannot therefore be solved by laws , and certainly not by more draconian laws .
The problems — such as the decline in sales of CDs and DVDs — are the result of the copyright industries ' many and considerable failures to focus on satisfying consumers ' desires as opposed to stifling those desires out of a woefully misguided view that copyright equals control and that control equals profits . "
None of this is to say that file - sharing has no effect on music sales ; while some studies have seen a positive impact due to greater music exposure , other studies suggest that revenue ( at least for music labels ) declines .
But it seems unlikely to be the music industry 's chief problem , as numerous innovative ( and profitable ) bands have shown in the last few years .
Dodge brings a Detonator to Detroit - seriously
Dodge Detonator
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
If you 're a struggling carmaker looking to make a splash and create controversy , unveiling a new vehicle called " the Detonator " at the Detroit Auto Show may sound like a good idea .
If you do it two weeks after an attempted terror attack aimed at the very city where you 're doing the unveiling , you may think twice .
Or maybe not .
On Thursday Chrysler unveiled its latest offering : The Dodge Nitro Detonator .
But as tone - deaf as that may seem with the nation still in the grip of terrorism fear , the controversial name is at least guaranteed to get attention .
And Chrysler , with its aging product line , seems desperate for attention .
Chrysler may be pushing the envelope deliberately , suggested Jeremy Anwyl , although it is unclear if Chrysler realized the controversy this name could stir up .
Automakers often exhibit attention - seeking behavior when there 's little to point to in the product , he said .
Chrysler itself was once known for controversial marketing campaigns like the " Lingerie Bowl . "
" There 's a proud history of controversy there , " he said , " but you can see how they get pushed into that . "
Chrysler was not immediately able to comment on whether the name was designed to incite controversy .
Chrysler 's Dodge brand has long used aggressive sounding name for its cars , such as Nitro , Caliber and Avenger .
Two other new Nitro models are called Heat and Shock .
Not much going on here , actually
There is n't much new in the " new " Dodge Nitro Detonator -- for the most part it 's a Dodge Nitro " value package " offering $ 6,000 in otherwise optional equipment at a low price -- but Chrysler Group is doing what it can to try to boost sales from an aging product line - up , analysts say .
The Nitro Detonator is one of several " refreshed " models Chrysler will unveil at next week 's Detroit Auto Show .
None offers significant changes or new content , instead featuring mostly the creative use of paints and decals , although several of the car 's do have improved interiors and some additional features .
Developing a genuinely new model takes years and Chrysler executives have admitted that there 's been little of that taking place at the automaker as it struggled to conserve cash .
Now out of bankruptcy and with a new partner , Italy 's Fiat , Chrysler can get back to trying to bring out some new cars and more significant product changes are planned in the coming months .
In the meantime , it 's trying to generate excitement any way it can .
The new Jeep Wrangler Islander , for example , has bright paint and a Polynesian Tiki - head logo .
The Chrysler PT Cruiser Couture edition has a two - tone paint job and matching interior .
The Chrysler 300 S8 and S6 have blacked - out grilles and slightly fancier interiors .
These changes could help boost sales a bit , said Stephanie Brinley , an industry analyst AutoPacific .
" It helps you to have a special car compared to what you had last year , " she said .
Chrysler is also introducing a new version of the Dodge Journey SUV called the " Hero . "
" At least they 'll have a Hero on the showroom floor next to the Detonator , " said Brinley .
No , this article is not about Johnny Depp or Angelina Jolie .
They may be hot stars , but in comparison to the star at the center of the Bug Nebula , pictured left , they ’ve got nothin’ .
The first image of the star at the center of the Bug Nebula ( NGC 6302 ) has been taken by a team of astronomers at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics , using the newly refurbished Hubble Space Telescope .
This star , one of the hottest in the galaxy , has a temperature of about 200,000 Kelvin – 33 times hotter than the Sun – and is at the center of one of the most beautiful planetary nebula in the galaxy .
The star at the heart of the Bug Nebula , which lies about 3500 light - years away from Earth in the constellation Scorpius , is what gives the two lobes of the formation their glow .
Its extreme temperature of at least 200,000 K ( and possibly up to 400,000 K ) ionizes the gas in the nebula , which is itself composed of ejecta from the star as it shed its corona during the later stages of its life .
The star has gone through its red giant phase and is now a late - stage white dwarf .
As a comparison to how hot the star powering the luminosity of the Bug Nebula is , our Sun ’s hottest temperature is 5,800 Kelvin which is about 5,500 degrees Celsius and almost 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit .
The mass of the star is calculated to be 0.64 solar masses , though it was many times heavier than the Sun before it ejected much of its matter into the nebula .
The astronomers were lucky to have been able to image the star at this point in its life , as the light it is emitting is fading at about 1 % a year .
Professor Albert Zijlstra of the University of Manchester said in an email interview , “ The star seems to be in a phase where nuclear burning has ceased very recently ( within the past 100 - 1000 yr ) .
It is radiating its left - over surface heat away , and that goes quickly .
At some time heat from interior will take over , and as that is a much larger heat reservoir , the star will fade much more slowly from that point . ”
This does not mean , however , that the ionized gas in the nebula will fade out quite as quickly , Zijlstra said .
‘ The nebula is ionized by ultra-violet photons from the star .
The ionized elements recombine with electrons , before being re-ionized .
Normally , there is a good balance between ionizations and recombinations .
In NGC 6302 , if the star is fading rapidly , it is possible that the time scale for recombinations is longer than the time over which the star fades .
The nebula would ‘ remember ’ a more luminous star , and be ionized to a higher degree than the star could currently support .
It is like living off your savings . ”
There have been many attempts at imaging this star , but the brightness of the nebula combined with the dust obscuring the star made imaging difficult .
Only with the new Wide - Field Camera 3 , installed on the Hubble earlier this year , were the astronomers able to make out the star buried in the heart of the Bug Nebula .
Zijlstra said of the Hubble ’s capabilities , “ It is a combination of sensitivity and available filters .
The nebula is very bright , and it is difficult to detect the faint star against the very bright nebular background .
To get the best sensitivity , you need high resolution ( which dilutes the nebulae light while concentrating the stellar light – this requires HST ) , good sensitivity and ideally , a filter which excludes the brightest emission lines ( H alpha , [ O III ] ) .
We detected the star with two different filters which select fainter emission lines , which reduces the glare from the nebula .
The extinction through the dust in the nebula is also very high , which makes the star even fainter especially in the blue . ”
Further observations of the star are definitely in order , including molecular and dust spectroscopy , but Zijlstra said his team does not have any observations of the star planned as of now .
The results of the imaging and calculations detailing the properties of the star will be published in The Astrophysical Journal , but a pre-print article is available on Arxiv .
A zoom animation of some of the images put together is also available on the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics site right here .

Want to impress your friends at your next dinner party ?
If you are having a party and need to feed lots of people for very little money , have an Ethiopian feast !
Not only is it inexpensive but it's a lot of fun , you get to eat with your hands !
I made this for guests recently and they were so impressed .
Ethiopian food is not eaten with cutlery yet they use injera ( kind of like a crepe ) to pick up the food .
The food is served on a large platter or plate ( see photo ) with salad in the middle and the other dishes around it .

Spicy Red Lentil Stew ( Miser Wat )
This is so easy !
I make it in the crockpot .
I find this dish tastes more flavourful the next day .
Ingredients :
Advertisement
4 Tbsp. olive oil
2 cups onion ( one large onion or two small onions )
2 tomatoes
1 tsp. garlic , chopped
1 Tbsp. fresh ginger , minced
2 Tbsp. berbere
2 cups split red lentils

Add the garlic and ginger and saute for another minute .
Add the berbere and saute for a few minutes more , stirring occasionally to prevent burning .
The onions should start to caramelize .
Mix in the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste and simmer for another 5 - 10 minutes .
Add the lentils , tomato paste , salt , red wine , and the vegetable stock or water and bring to a boil , then turn down to a simmer and cook uncovered for an hour .
Serve with injera and a vegetable .
Ethiopian Dressing
This is a dressing that is used on the garden salad which is always placed in the middle of the plate surrounded by hot dishes .
The garden salad usually consists of lettuce , onion , cucumber , and tomato .

Combine well .
Injera
This is the crepe used to lay the food on and also served on the side to pick up the food .
It is originally made with teff flour , the mix is supposed to sit for a few days , but this is my quickie version .
Ingredients :
2 cups white flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
3 cups of club soda ( more or less depending )
Directions :
Mix the dry ingredients and add enough soda to get a liquid consistency , much like a crepe batter ( thinner than pancake batter ) .
Use a ladle to pour into the hot pan and move pan around until covered with a thin layer of batter .
You 'll see bubbles appear and when top seems set , remove from pan .
Do not flip over .
Keep doing this till batter is all gone .
Happy Feasting !

WHEN DOES EDUCATION STOP ?
by James Michener , 1962
During the summer vacation a fine - looking young man , who was majoring in literature at a top university , asked for an interview , and before we had talked for five minutes , he launched into his complaint .
' Can you imagine ? ' he lamented .
' During vacation I have to write a three - thousand - word term paper about your books . '
He felt very sorry for himself .
His whimpering irritated me , and on the spur of the moment I shoved at him a card which had become famous in World War II .
It was once used on me while I was ' bitching ' to a chaplain on Guadalcanal .
It read :
My complaining visitor reacted as I had done twenty years earlier .
He burst into laughter and asked , ' Did I sound that bad ? '
' Worse ! ' I snapped .
Then I pointed to a novel of mine which he was using as the basis for his term paper .
' You 're bellyaching about a three - thousand - word paper which at most will occupy you for a month .
When I started work on Hawaii , I faced the prospect of a three - million - word term paper .
And five years of work .
Frankly , you sound silly . '
This strong language encouraged an excellent discussion of the preparation it takes to write a major novel .
Five years of research , months of character development , extensive work on plot and setting , endless speculation on psychology and concentrated work on historical backgrounds .
' When I was finally ready to write , ' I replied under questioning , ' I holed up in a bare - wall , no - telephone Waikiki room and stuck at my typewriter every morning for eighteen months .
Seven days a week I wrestled with the words that would not come , with ideas that refused to jell .
When I broke a tooth , I told the dentist I 'd have to see him at night .
When DeWitt Wallace , the editor of the Reader 's Digest and a man to whom I am much indebted , came to Hawaii on vacation , I wanted to hike with him but had to say , " In the late afternoon .
In the morning I work . " '
I explained to my caller that I write all my books slowly , with two fingers on an old typewriter , and the actual task of getting the words on paper is difficult .
Nothing I write is good enough to be used in first draft , not even important personal letters , so I am required to rewrite everything at least twice .
Important work , like a novel , must be written over and over again , up to six or seven times .
For example , Hawaii went very slowly and needed constant revision .
Since the final version contained about 500,000 words , and since I wrote it all many times , I had to type in my painstaking fashion about 3,000,000 words .
At this news , my visitor whistled and asked , ' How many research books did you have to consult ? '
' Several thousand .
When I started the actual writing , there were about five hundred that I kept in my office . '
' How many personal interviews ? '
' About two hundred .
Each two or three hours long . '
' Did you write much that you were n't able to use ? '
' I had to throw away about half a million words . '
The young scholar looked again at the chaplain 's card and returned it reverently to my desk .
' Would you have the energy to undertake such a task again ? ' he asked .
' I would always like to be engaged in such tasks , ' I replied , and he turned to other questions .
Young people , especially those in college who should know better , frequently fail to realize that men and women who wish to accomplish anything must apply themselves to tasks of tremendous magnitude .
A new vaccine may take years to perfect .
A Broadway play is never written , cast and produced in a week .
A foreign policy is never evolved in a brief time by diplomats relaxing in Washington , London or Geneva .
The good work of the world is accomplished principally by people who dedicate themselves unstintingly to the big job at hand .
Weeks , months , years pass , but the good workman knows that he is gambling on an ultimate achievement which cannot be measured in time spent .
Responsible men and women leap to the challenge of jobs that require enormous dedication and years to fulfill , and are happiest when they are so involved .
This means that men and women who hope to make a real contribution to American life must prepare themselves to tackle big jobs , and the interesting fact is that no college or university in the world can give anyone the specific education he will ultimately need .
Adults who are unwilling to reeducate themselves periodically are doomed to mediocrity .
For in American life , the average man - let 's leave out doctors and highly specialized scientists - can expect to work in three radically different fields before he retires .
The trained lawyer is dragged into a business reorganization and winds up a college president .
The engineer uses his slide rule for a short time , finds himself a sales expert and ends his career in labor relations .
The schoolteacher becomes a principal and later on heads the town 's Buick agency .
Obviously no college education could prepare a young man for all that he will have to do in his years of employment .
The best a college can do is to inspire him with the urge to reeducate himself constantly .
I first discovered this fact on Guadalcanal in 1945 , when the war had passed us by and we could see certain victory ahead .
Relieved of pressure , our top admirals and generals could have been excused if they loafed , but the ones I knew well in those days took free time and gave themselves orderly courses in new fields .
One carrier admiral studied everything he could get on tank warfare .
The head of our outfit , William Lowndes Calhoun , spent six hours a day learning French .
I asked him about this .
' Admiral , what 's this big deal with French ? '
' How do I know where I 'll be sent when the war 's over ? ' he countered .
But what impressed me most was the next tier of officers , the young Army colonels and the Navy commanders .
They divided sharply into two groups : those who spent their spare time learning something and those who did n't .
In the years that followed , I noticed in the newspapers that whenever President Truman or President Eisenhower chose men for military positions of great power , they always picked from the officers who had reeducated themselves .
More significant to me personally was my stay with the brilliant doctors of an Army hospital in the jungles of Espiritu Santo .
The entire staff of a general hospital in Denver , Colorado , had been picked up and flown out to care for our wounded , and they experienced days of overwork followed by weeks of tedium .
In the latter periods the doctors organized voluntary study groups by which to further their professional competence .
By good luck , I was allowed to participate in a group that was analyzing alcoholism , and one night the leader asked me , as we were breaking up , ' What are you studying , Michener ? '
The question stunned me , for I had been studying exactly nothing .
I drove back through the jungle and that very night started working on something that I had been toying with for some months .
In a lantern - lit , mosquito - filled tin shack , I started writing Tales of the South Pacific .
I have been the typical American in that I have had widely scattered jobs : teacher , businessman , soldier , traveler , writer .
And my college education gave me no specific preparation for any of these jobs .
But it gave me something much better .
I attended Swarthmore College , outside Philadelphia , and by fantastic luck , I got there just as the college was launching an experiment which was to transform the institution and those of us who participated .
At the end of my sophomore year the faculty assembled a group of us and said , ' Life does not consist of taking courses in small segments .
A productive life consists of finding huge tasks and mastering them with whatever tools of intelligence and energy we have .
We are going to turn you loose on some huge tasks .
Let 's see what you can do with them . '
Accordingly , we were excused from all future class attendance and were told , ' Pick out three fields that interest you . '
I chose logic , English history and the novel .
The faculty said , ' For the next two years go to the library and learn what you can about your fields .
At the end of two years we 'll bring in some outside experts from Harvard and Yale , whom you 've never seen , and they will determine whether or not you have educated yourselves . '
What followed was an experience in intellectual grandeur .
The Swarthmore professors , realizing that when I was tested they would be tested too , helped me to gain as thorough an education as a young man could absorb .
For it was in their interest to see that I understood the fine points of the fields I had chosen .
When the two years ended , the visiting experts arrived and for a week they probed and tested and heckled .
At the end of this exciting time one of the examiners told me , ' You have the beginning of a real education . '
He was right .
Nothing that I studied in college has been of use to me in my various jobs .
But what I did learn was how to learn , how to organize , how to write term papers .
If my education had ended the week I stood before those strange examiners , I would have proved a fairly useless citizen .
While I was reflecting on these matters , my young scholar asked , ' If you were a young man today and wanted to be a writer , what kind of education would you seek ? '
I replied , ' I 'd choose some very difficult field and try to master it .
I 'd seek out professors who really poured it on .
Long term papers and many of them , tough laboratory work . '
' Why ? ' he pressed .
' Because we learn only those things at which we have to work very hard .
It 's ridiculous to give a bright fellow like you a three - thousand - word term paper .
It ought to be fifteen thousand words - or thirty .
Tackle a real job .
Then , when you 're through , you 're on the way to facing big jobs in adult life . '
My visitor made a few marks in his notebook , then asked , ' When you were in college , the scientific revolution had n't occurred yet .
Today , would you stick with liberal arts - things like logic and history - or would you switch to science , where the good jobs are ?'
I did n't hesitate a minute on this one .
' Unless I had extraordinary aptitude in the sciences , I 'd stick with liberal arts every time .
The pay is n't as good .
The jobs are n't waiting when you graduate .
And when you want to get married , it 's tough to tell your girl 's father , " I 'm studying philosophy . "
But forty years from now the scientists in your class will be scientists .
And the liberal arts men will be governing the world . '
The idea was so startling that my young visitor wished to discuss it further .
' You mean there 's a chance for fellows like me ? '
' Every year your prospects grow brighter , ' I insisted .
' The more complex the world becomes , the more desperately it needs men trained in liberal arts .
For the government of the world must always rely upon the man with broad human knowledge .
And the government of a business or a university or a newspaper requires the same kind of man . '
' Why ? ' he asked , forgetting his notebook .
' Because governing anything requires knowledge of men , a balanced judgment , a gift for conciliation and , above all , a constant weighing of good versus bad .
Only men with broad educations can perform such tasks . '
' Ca n't scientists do this ? ' he asked .
' They surely can .
If , after they graduate , they give themselves courses in the humanities . '
I finished our interview by telling a story .
' In 1942 the United States Navy was hungry for talent , and four of us were taken into a small room where we sat around shivering in our shorts .
A grim - faced selection committee asked the first wouldbe officer , " What can you do ? " and the man replied , " I 'm a buyer for Macy's , and I can judge very quickly between markets and prices and trends . "
The selection board replied , " But you ca n't do anything practical ? "
The man said no , and he was shunted off to one side .
' The next man was a lawyer , and when the board asked him if he could do anything practical , he had to confess , " I can weigh evidence and organize information , " and he was rejected .
' I was the third in line , and when I answered , " I know language and a good deal of history , " the board groaned and I was sent shivering away .
' But when the fourth man said boldly , " I 'm from Georgia Tech and I can overhaul diesel engines , " the committee jumped up , practically embraced him and made him an officer on the spot . '
' That 's what I mean , ' my young scholar pointed out .
' At the end of the war , ' I continued , ' the buyer from Macy's was assistant to the Secretary of the Navy , in charge of many complex responsibilities requiring instant good judgment .
He gave himself courses in naval management and government procedures until he became one of the nation 's real experts .
' The lawyer wound up as assistant to Admiral Halsey , and in a crucial battle , deducted where the Japanese fleet had to be .
He came out covered with medals .
' I was given the job of naval secretary to several Congressional committees who were determining the future of America in the South Pacific .
And what was the engineer doing at the end of the war ?
He was still overhauling diesel engines . '
' You 're sure there 's hope for the liberal - arts man ? ' the young scholar repeated .
' If he learns to tackle the big jobs - the big ones historically or morally or culturally or politically . '
We parted on that note , but when he had gone , I realized that I had not made my statement nearly strong enough .
I should have said , ' The world is positively hungry for young men who have dedicated themselves to big jobs .
If your present professors are n't training you for such work , quit them and find others who will drive you .
If your present college is n't making you work to the limit of your ability , drop out and go to another that will .
Because if you do n't discipline your brain now , you 'll never be prepared for the years when it 's a question of work or perish . '
Parents or professors who do not encourage their young to tackle big jobs commit a moral crime against those young people .
For we know that when the young are properly challenged , they will rise to the occasion and they will prepare themselves for the great work that remains to be done .
A North Wales man was found guilty yesterday of attempting to have sex with a rottweiler .
Thomas Robert Edwards , 20 , who was working at Chester Zoo at the time of the incident , denied the charge of trying to sexually penetrate a living animal .
A neighbour claimed to have witnessed Edwards grab the rottweiler by its hind legs and thrust himself at it for about twenty or thirty seconds .
Edwards claimed he had merely been stroking the dog in the backyard , where he had gone to have a smoke and relieve himself .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The witness , Mr Richard Williams , said , “ I felt sick .
I was shocked .
I could not believe what I had just seen . ”
Mr Williams claimed that Edwards then performed an indecent act on himself .
The court was told that the accused was drunk at the time of the incident , on the 30th of August this year , following a night out with friends in Wrexham .
He then went to a party at a house on the outskirts of Wrexham where the offence took place in the early hours of the morning .
Edwards had been working in the catering department at Chester Zoo but had no contact with the animals there .
The court was also told that Edwards had pornography featuring bestiality on his computer , which depicted sexual activity with horses and dogs .
Richard Williams , a neighbour , said he been awoken in the early hours by noises coming from the garden next door .
On looking out of the window he claims to have seen Edwards trying to penetrate the female dog .
He then knocked on the window , shortly after which Edwards returned into the house claiming he had n’t done anything .
Edwards strongly denied the allegations and Andrew Green , defending , questioned the witness statement saying that Mr Williams may have mistaken what he saw .
Edwards , of Hope , in North Wales admitted seven charges of possessing extreme pornography , though claimed the films had been downloaded onto his computer by accident .
Sentencing was adjourned until January and reports from the probation service were requested .
Judge John Rogers QC indicated that Edwards would receive a non-custodial sentence .
Edwards told the court that he no longer worked in Chester Zoo but was hoping to go to college and to work with animals .
He sees you when you 're sleeping .
He pounces you awake .
" Do n't care if you 've been bad or good , Just FEED ME , for YOUR sake . "

DethKlan does n't like Left 4 Dead 2 , which is stupid , but they make an awesome mod , so they 'll get a pass this time .

Arguably even more fun is the mod on the right , which turns Team Fortress 2's

The programmers at MechaWare really went all out on this one , creating a NMH - themed energy drink mod and baseball bat to go along with the Travis skin .

Travis Touchdown is a strange , unfamiliar figure to many PS3/360 owners , and getting to know him via these two very popular games could only work to raise consumer interest in the character .

Amazon.com Inc. is showing signs of app envy .
The e-commerce giant says it plans to invite software developers to create programs that would allow its Kindle e-reader device to take on a wider range of uses .
To aid in that process , Amazon will give programmers access to technology and tools to help them build " active content , " which it aims to sell in the Kindle store later this year .
Amazon is borrowing a page from Apple Inc. and its popular app store for the iPhone .
It comes just days before Apple is expected to unveil a tablet computer that is likely to compete directly with the Kindle as a platform for the distribution of electronic books while offering a range of other uses , including music , video and games .
There will be some differences from smartphone app stores that have proliferated over the last two years .
For one , the Kindle 's screen — based on a technology from E Ink — is black and white , and refreshes too slowly to offer video or motion graphics .
It is becoming more of a preferred strategy to systematically walk away from commercial real estate debt .
We have now had two large Wall Street organizations in Morgan Stanley and Tishman and Blackrock Inc. deciding , by voluntary choice , to walk away from their contractual obligations on commercial real estate .
Now much has been made regarding the commercial real estate debacle because some $ 3.5 trillion in commercial real estate debt is outstanding .
This number is enormous and many of the bank failures that we ’ll be seeing on Fridays this year will come from bad loans in the commercial sector .
Part of the problem with commercial real estate is the way deals got financed .
Many of the loans are made under 5 to 10 year terms and unlike a 30 year loan , need to be refinanced at the end of the deal .
Well this is a problem when the property securitizing the loan is now valued at 30 , 40 , or even 50 percent lower .
Unlike residential real estate that saw loan and home values peak in 2005 and 2006 , commercial real estate loans saw volume peak in 2008 :
So what we have is a similar situation as in residential real estate except it is delayed by two to three years .
In other words , the major problems start this year .
Bad commercial real estate deals are not something new .
But this time the amount of bad loans made is astronomical because of the way the banking system securitized the loans .
Just think for a minute how a loan is usually made .
A careful evaluation of the property is made assuring the loan is actually reflecting the value of the underlying asset .
The loan is then made under the assumption the borrower will pay the loan back under the contractual terms .
If the borrower does n’t pay the amount back , then you as a responsible lender will be able to take back a property that ideally would be valued at terms that would make a sale to recoup some money realistic .
At least this was the older system of doing business .
This time , property values were never realistically assessed and banks never had in their equation the possibility of taking the property back :
“ ( WSJ ) The decision comes after the venture between Tishman and BlackRock Inc. defaulted on the $ 4.4 billion debt used to help finance the deal .
The venture acquired the 56 - building , 11,000 - unit property for $ 5.4 billion in 2006 - the most ever paid for a single residential property in the U.S.
The venture had been struggling for months to restructure the debt but capitulated facing a massive debt load and a weak New York City economy that has undercut rents and demand for high - priced apartments .
The property ’s owners signaled they would be unable to reach a deal with lenders and instead decided to allow creditors to proceed with what amounts to an orderly deed - in - lieu of foreclosure , which means a borrower voluntarily gives the property back to lenders to avoid a foreclosure proceeding .
“ It has become clear to us through this process that the only viable alternative to bankruptcy would be to transfer control and operation of the property , in an orderly manner , to the lenders and their representatives , ” the venture said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal .
“ We make this decision as we feel a battle over the property or a contested bankruptcy proceeding is not in the long - term interest of the property , its residents , our partnership or the city . ”
Now you might be asking yourself , this is a rather significant deal and certainly anyone loaning out $ 4.4 billion is going to make sure that they place some kind of conservative valuation on this commercial real estate deal .
So how much is the property currently worth ?
“ By some accounts , Stuyvesant Town is only valued at $ 1.8 billion now , less than half the purchase price .
By that measure , all the equity investors - including the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , a Florida pension fund and the Church of England - and many of the debtholders , including Government of Singapore Investment Corp. , or GIC , and Hartford Financial Services Group , are in danger of seeing most , if not all , of their investments wiped out . ”
Now walk through this deal .
The place was purchased at $ 5.4 billion .
It was financed with $ 4.4 billion in commercial real estate loans .
The place is now estimated to be valued at $ 1.8 billion .
This is a $ 3.6 billion loss .
Now the first buyers are making a conscious business decision to walk away from their obligation to pay on this property .
Clearly Tishman and Blackrock have the money to make the payment if they wanted to but they do n’t .
But who is the big loser here ?
Those that they sold the securities to .
This is how the banking industry is setup .
It is designed to punish those who really have little knowledge of the interworking of Wall Street finance yet the current system is designed to use taxpayer money to gamble on these sorts of deals .
This is what we are bailing out and why there is such outraged geared towards Wall Street .
The reason this is important is because there has been this moralizing of walking away .
There has been this guilt trip put on average Americans that they need to put every penny to their house payment even if it means starving .
Yet here we have Wall Street organizations with billions in funds making a conscious business decision to walk away from billion dollar deals .
This is n’t some homeowner unable to make a $ 100,000 mortgage payment on a home valued at $ 70,000 .
The bank will technically lose $ 30,000 in this case by taking the home back .
Here , someone somewhere is going to lose billions .
As John Getty once said , “ If you owe the bank $ 100 that ’s your problem .
If you owe the bank $ 100 million , that ’s the bank ’s problem . ”
And that is the core of the commercial real estate problem .
Values have collapsed :
By most estimates , commercial real estate values are down over 40 percent from their peak .
Many loans that are now coming due for refinancing will simply fail .
In fact , there are claims that many borrowers have already stopped making payments but banks simply keep rolling over the loans like some debt snowball as to avoid writing down the real value of the underlying asset .
This is an enormous problem .
It is amazing so little is discussed about this in the open .
My guess is the government and Wall Street realize that bailing out the commercial real estate market would garner little to no sympathy from the American public .
After all , these were big banks that supposedly knew a thing or two about financing big deals .
So for them to come out publicly and say they had no idea , which is really the reality , would not play well in bailing out a $ 3.5 trillion industry .
The bottom line is someone is going to pay and so far most of the paying has come from the American taxpayer through bailouts to the corporatacracy .

Richard Park keeps plugging along with the Islanders and Stone remains on in the NHL up in Edmonton .
Those are the only three currently in the NHL , and likely the only on the horizion for the foreseeable future .
It has n't been the prettiest of pictures for Pittsburgh when it comes to the 2nd round .
However with Goligoski a solid contributor , if the team can develop guys like Sneep and Veilleux we may finally be able lay the curse of Greg Malone to rest .
Thomas Jones makes a living launching himself into a crowd of men , each of whom can generate enough force with their bodies to knock over a rhinoceros .
On Saturday , when the New York Jets running back faces the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round of the NFL playoffs , he 'll be riding an impressive streak :
He has repeated this death - defying stunt 1,438 times in a row without sustaining an injury serious enough to keep him out of a game .
( Jets fans should probably find the nearest piece of wood and start knocking on it furiously ) .

In part 1 of this series we looked at how to define the core of a window manager for X in Haskell .
This provided the core logic of the xmonad tiling window manager .
The specification of the window manager as a data structure and its accompanying API enabled us to write high level QuickCheck properties to automatically test the window manager , leading to good assurance that our implementation was correct .
The window manager modeled was a very simple full screen window manager , where the focused window was always the only window visible .
In this article we reimplement the window manager core using a more sophisticated data structure — a “ zipper ” — which will allow us to track focus on each workspace automatically , by maintaining a cursor into an updateable workspace tree .
This data structure will form the basis of a proper tiling window manager , where multiple windows are visible on the screen simultaneously .
By using a data structure that tracks focus for us , we end up with much simpler code , and a clearer understanding of how focus is manipulated by the window manager .
The problem with a finite maps
The original StackSet data structure , which modeled a multiple - workspace fullscreen window manager , was quite simple :
data StackSet a = StackSet { current :: Int , stacks :: Map Int [ a ] } deriving Eq
This is the obvious way to associate stacks of windows with workspaces : use a lookup table to map workspace names ( here just Int keys ) to lists of windows .
We chose to use a finite map , a purely functional lookup table .
In order to track the current workspace , we store separately the key of the current workspace .
The simplicity of this data structure , however , limits its usefulness .
The problem with the StackSet as defined is that it only allows us to track one focused window on each workspace : the window at the head of each window list .
This is fine for very simple fullscreen window managers , as only one window is ever visible anyway .
However , a true tiling window manager , such as xmonad , allows us tile many windows on the screen simultaneously , with focus available to any window on the screen .
The windows are tiled to the screen like so :
In this picture , the current workspace contains 4 windows .
The head of the window list , window # 1 , is tiled first , and is given the largest area .
However , keyboard focus is actually on window # 3 .
Our StackSet data structure implemented as a Map is not able to handle arbitrary focus as it stands .
So the problem then is how best to extend the StackSet type to handle tiling of workspaces , with arbitrary focus .
The naive approach : more tables
One solution is to augment the workspace type with an additional table :
data StackSet a = StackSet { current :: Int , stacks :: Map Int [ a ] , focus :: Map Int a }
Now we maintain a separate mapping of workspaces , to the focused window on each workspace .
This is simple enough , and works in practice ( indeed , xmonad 0.1 does just this ) .
However , there is a certain awkwardness to it : by adding a new table we have obligated ourselves to a second layer of bookkeeping .
When focus changes we have two tables to update and to keep consistent with each other .
The inelegance of this approach becomes apparent when we implement functions that affect focus and will require manipulating both tables .
One such operation is ‘ delete ’ .
For a basic fullscreen window manager , where focus is always the head of the list , delete has an obvious implementation .
Given a window , a workspace and a StackSet , we can remove an arbitrary window from the window manager by removing it from the window list :
delete :: w -> i -> StackSet i w ->
StackSet i w delete win wrk ss = ss { stacks = M . adjust ( delete win ) wrk ( stacks ss ) }
So ‘ delete ’ on the focused window simply calls the ‘ delete ’ function of the list library , and will move focus to the next element in the list .
However , allowing focus on any element in the list complicates the logic — we have two data structures to keep up to date :
delete :: w -> i -> StackSet i w ->
StackSet i w delete win wrk ss = ss { stacks = M . adjust ( delete win ) wrk ( stacks ss ) } , focus = M . update ( \ k -> if k == win then elemAfter k ( stacks ss ! wrk ) else Just k ) wrk ( focus ss ) }
So if we ’re deleting the currently focused element , then focus moves to the element after the current element , otherwise focus is unchanged .
The definition of ‘ insert ’ also changes in a similar way , as inserting a window should now insert to the right of the currently focused window .
In addition , the tracking of focus in a separate table means we need to make a policy decision about where focus goes in the presence of insert and delete .
Under the simple workspace - as - list implementation , there was only one possible implementation , now we can set focus anywhere , so we are forced to state precisely what the behaviour should be .
The obvious behaviour is that : delete .
insert should be the identity , and leave focus unchanged .
This would allows the user to delete transient popup windows , without losing focus on the window they ’re working on .
Ensuring this is the case complicates the code still further .
All this extra work is very unsatisfying !
More book keeping means more code , and more chance for bugs .
What we really need is a data structure that tracks focus by design .
So let ’s follow the functional programmer ’s motto : write less , think more !
A Zipper for Trees
The zipper ( pdf ) is a lovely simple , pure data structure first described by Huet .
A zipper is basically a cursor deep into a structure , allowing O ( 1 ) updates at the cursor site .
By recording a path from the root to the cursor it is possible to navigate locally around the cursor site , while keeping track of the entire structure .
A zipper can also be considered as a delimited continuation reified as data .
In summary , it provides a natural interface for operations on a distinguished position in a data structure : exactly what we need for tracking focus in our window manager .
Let us consider a simple zipper for the following tree data type ( from Huet ’s paper ) :
data Tree a = Item a | Node [ Tree a ]
A zipper for this structure gives us a currently focused node , along with a path back up to a parent node , and to the left and right siblings .
We can implement this as :
data Path a = Top | Point { left :: [ Tree a ] , right :: [ Tree a ] , up :: Path a } data Cursor a = Cursor { it ::
Tree a , context :: Path a }
So , consider the tree representing the parse of the expression : ( a * b ) + ( c * d ) :
expr :: Tree String expr = Node [ Node [ Item " a " , Item " * " , Item " b " ] , Item " + " , Node [ Item " c " , Item " * " , Item " d " ] ]
We can visualise this tree as :
Now , we can focus on a particular element of this tree , for example , the second “ * ” node , using a Cursor type .
The following zipper gives us the binary tree with focus set on the “ * ” node .
subexpr :: Cursor String subexpr = Cursor { it = Item " * " , context = Point { left = [ Item " c " ] , right = [ Item " d " ] , up = Point { left = [ Item " + " , Node [ Item " a " , Item " * " , Item " b " ] ] , right = [ ] , up =
Top } } }
Which we can visualise as a sort of unfolded tree , where the focused item is the top of the tree ( the green branch represents the path back to the parent node ) :
It is as if we had picked up the tree by the “ * ” node , and let the other branches hang down .
The zipper gives us a natural set of O ( 1 ) operations on the focused node .
To move focus to the left of the current node :
focusLeft :: Cursor a ->
Cursor a focusLeft c @ ( Cursor t p ) = case p of Point ( l : ls ) rs up ->
Cursor l ( Point ls ( t : rs ) up ) _ -> c
Applying ‘ focusLeft ’ to our subexpression relinks the local nodes , shifting focus to the item ‘ c ’ :
> focusLeft subexpr Cursor { it = Item " c " , context = Point { left = [ ] , right = [ Item " * " , Item " d " ] , up = Point { left = [ Item " + " , Node [ Item " a " , Item " * " , Item " b " ] ] , right = [ ] , up =
Top } } }
Which yields the tree :
Notice that the ‘ up ’ parts of the tree have n’t changed — the changes were local to the current subexpression , causing focus to cycle left .
We can also move focus back up the tree to the parent , by following the ‘ up ’ path :
focusUp :: Cursor a ->
Cursor a focusUp c @ ( Cursor t p ) = case p of Top -> c Point ls rs up ->
Cursor ( Node ( reverse ls ++ t : rs ) ) up
Moving up the tree collapses the cursor path .
> focusUp subexpr Cursor { it = Node [ Item " c " , Item " * " , Item " d " ] , context = Point { left = [ Item " + " , Node [ Item " a " , Item " * " , Item " b " ] ] , right = [ ] , up = Top } }
Other important operations on the cursor are ‘ insert ’ and ‘ delete ’ .
Now that we have a precise notion of focus , we can specify the behaviour of focus when inserting a new node quite precisely .
Either we insert to the left of the current node , and move focus to this new node :
insertLeft :: Tree a ->
Cursor a ->
Cursor a insertLeft a c @ ( Cursor t p ) = case p of Top -> undefined Point ls rs up ->
Cursor a ( Point ls ( t : rs ) up )
Or we insert to the right :
insertRight :: Tree a ->
Cursor a ->
Cursor a insertRight a c @ ( Cursor t p ) = case p of Top -> undefined Point ls rs up ->
Cursor a ( Point ( t : ls ) rs up )
Lovely !
Our data structure gives us an exact account of how focus changes during an insert operation , with no extra book keeping .
From here we should be able to map focus in the window manager , onto operations on the cursor position in the zipper , directly implementing the window manager policies we decide on .
‘ delete ’ is slightly more complex : we need to consider when deleting the current node whether to move focus to the left or right , or if the node is empty , to move focus up the tree :
delete :: Cursor a ->
Cursor a delete ( Cursor _ p ) = case p of Top -> undefined Point ls ( r : rs ) up ->
Cursor r ( Point ls rs up )
Point ( l : ls ) [ ] up ->
Cursor l ( Point ls [ ] up ) Point [ ] [ ] up ->
Cursor ( Node [ ] ) up
We see again how the data structure forces us to think about the behaviour of focus during critical operations , and also gives us simple , clear operations .
Let ’s see now how to use this cursor data type to our window manager .
A Zipper for a Window Manager
Clearly there is a possibility of adapting the zipper - based focus mechanism to our window manager problem .
However , rather than there being just one point of focus in a tree , we actually have ‘ n ’ focused windows to track : one on each virtual workspace .
Additionally , we need to track which workspace is currently on screen — yet another focus point .
One simplification though , is that rather than having a tree of arbitrary depth , a window manager is a fixed height two level tree , with a fixed ‘ n ’ branches from the top level .
All this suggests that we actually have a two - level zipper !
Firstly , the top level of the window manager tree , the StackSet type , is just a flat zipper , or cursor , onto the focused workspace :
data StackSet a = StackSet { current :: Workspace a , prev :: [ Workspace a ] , next :: [ Workspace a ] }
A workspace itself is just a numeric tag , and a stack of windows :
data Workspace a = Workspace { tag :: Int , stack :: Stack a }
Finally , a window stack on a workspace is a flat zipper giving us a cursor onto the currently focused window , or the empty stack :
data Stack a = Empty | Node { focus :: a , left :: [ a ] , right :: [ a ] }
Mmm … data structures are fun in Haskell .
And we have a polymorphic window manager to boot : the StackSet is polymorphic in the window type .
Note that our Stack and StackSet data types are really degenerate 1 level zippers , as they only provide operations to traverse left or right .
We have no need to move focus up or down a two level tree .
We can visualise the window manager implemented as a zipper - based StackSet this way :
In this picture we have a window manager managing 6 virtual workspaces .
Workspace 4 is currently on screen .
Workspaces 1 , 2 , 4 and 6 are non-empty , and have some windows .
The window currently receiving keyboard focus is window 2 on the workspace 4 .
The focused windows on the other non-empty workspaces are being tracked though , so when we view another workspace , we will know which window to set focus on .
Workspaces 3 and 5 are empty .
With this structure , rather than a set of tables , we have a natural account of the behaviour of window focus during window manager operations .
From the picture alone , we can see how we can ensure operations affect , for example , the current workspace only — such operations will affect only the current node of the workspace zipper .
It is also obvious how shifting window focus in the window manager corresponds to shifting the cursor point on the current window zipper .
By using a data structure that tracks focus in this way , we hope to avoid annoying book keeping code , leading to a simpler implementation of our window manager , and , importantly , making it easier to ensure that the implementation of our window manager matches the specified behaviour .
Keep it simple !
A zipper API for the window manager
Let ’s now consider a natural API for this data structure :
new :: Int ->
StackSet a peek :: StackSet a ->
Maybe a index :: StackSet a -> [ a ] focusLeft , focusRight :: StackSet a -> StackSet a insert :: a -> StackSet a ->
StackSet a delete :: -> StackSet a -> StackSet a
There are some additional operations we ’d like to support , which operate on the workspace level :
viewLeft , viewRight :: StackSet a ->
StackSet a shift :: Int -> StackSet a -> StackSet a
Now to implement this interface for our zipper - based StackSet .
A zipper implementation of a window manager
First , we can construct a new , empty window manager , with ‘ n ’ workspaces , using a list comprehension to unfold the Empty workspace list :
new :: Int ->
StackSet a new n | n > 0 = StackSet t [ ] rs where ( t : rs ) = [ Workspace i Empty | i <- [ 0 .. n 1 ] ]
The data structure requires us to state which workspace has initial focus , so we pick the head of the list : Workspace 0 .
Good — the more policy that is obviously determined by the data structure , the less thinking we have to do !
Extracting the currently focused window is requires us to find the current workspace , then find the current window .
We can use Haskell ’s record access syntax for this :
peek s = case stack ( current s ) of Empty -> Nothing Node t _ _ ->
Just t
However , since almost all operations are on the current workspace , we can abstract out this access pattern into a higher order function — ‘ with ’ — which will take a default value to return in case of ‘ Empty , and a function to apply to a non-empty stack .
It is like the function ‘ maybe ’ for Stacks , and can be written as :
with :: b -> ( Stack a -> b ) ->
StackSet i a s -> b with d f s = case stack ( current s ) of Empty -> d v -> f v
Yielding the much nicer :
peek :: StackSet a ->
Maybe a peek = with Nothing ( return . focus )
The lesson here is to refactor and abstract repetitive logic , so you get it right once , and then gain from simpler , more domain - specific code .
Higher - order functions forever !
We can implement ‘ index ’ with similar ease :
index :: StackSet i a s -> [ a ] index = with [ ] $ \ ( Node t ls rs ) -> reverse l ++ t : rs
Modifying the window manager
As we see , read - only access is easy .
Modifying the window manager is more interesting .
For this we ’ll want to provide a ‘ modify ’ higher - order function , similar to ‘ with ’ , to abstract out the process of replacing the current workspace with a modified version :
modify :: Stack a -> ( Stack a -> Stack a ) ->
StackSet i a s ->
StackSet i a s modify d f s = s { current = ( current s ) { stack = with d f s } }
This just applies ‘ with ’ to the current workspace , and uses record update syntax to replace the current workspace , returning a modified StackSet .
We can now implement the focus - changing functions .
Firstly , focusLeft and focusRight .
Both shift focus to the window immediately to the left or right of the cursor , or if we ’re at the end of the stack , they wrap focus :
focusLeft , focusRight :: StackSet i a s ->
StackSet i a s focusLeft = modify Empty $ \ c -> case c of Node _ [ ] [ ] -> c Node t ( l : ls ) rs ->
Node l ls ( t : rs ) Node t [ ] rs ->
Node x xs [ t ] where ( x : xs ) = reverse rs focusRight = modify Empty $ \ c -> case c of Node _ [ ] [ ] -> c
Node t ls ( r : rs ) ->
Node r ( t : ls ) rs Node t ls [ ] ->
Node x [ t ] xs where ( x : xs ) = reverse ls
The implementation is straight forward , except for the wrapping case .
Indeed , all operations are O ( 1 ) , except for when we wrap , which is O ( w ) , ( ‘ w ’ is the number of windows on the screen ) .
We see here how the cursor - style data structure leads to a simple implementation of focus shifting in a window manager , and helps us think more clearly about the corner cases for focus movement .
Pick the right data structures , and the algorithms will be obvious !
We can implement insertLeft and insertRight , which insert a window to the left or right of focus , and move focus there .
The cases to consider for insert are :
Inserting into an empty workspace , yields a workspace with a single focused window .
Inserting into a non-empty workspace moves the current window to the left or right , and sets focus to the inserted window .
Yielding the obvious implementation :
insertLeft , insertRight :: a -> StackSet i a s ->
StackSet i a s insertLeft a = modify ( Node a [ ] [ ] ) $ \ ( Node t l r ) ->
Node a l ( t : r ) insertRight a = modify ( Node a [ ] [ ] ) $ \ ( Node t l r ) ->
Node a ( t : l ) r
Again , we get a policy for free stating where focus moves on insert , avoiding tedious bookkeeping , and gaining strong assurances from the simpler code .
The data structure hints at the natural policy our window manager should adopt .
We now consider how to delete the current window , and we will try to specify precisely where window manager focus goes on delete .
Remember : tiling window managers need to have predictable behaviour , to be usable , so the more behaviour we can precisely specify , the more predictable our window manager will be .
There are four cases to consider :
delete on an Empty workspace leaves it Empty ;
otherwise , try to move focus to the right ;
otherwise , try to move focus to the left ;
otherwise , a workspace with 1 element becomes Empty .
We implement this as :
delete :: StackSet a ->
StackSet a delete = modify Empty $ \ c -> case c of Node t ls ( r : rs ) ->
Node r ls rs Node t ( l : ls ) [ ] ->
Node l ls [ ]
Node _ [ ] [ ] ->
Empty
And that ’s it .
The code just follows from the spec , and the core window manager ’s implementation , with correct focus behaviour , falls out of the data structure .
Operations on workspaces
Navigating through virtual workspaces uses the level 1 zipper :
data StackSet a = StackSet { current :: Workspace a , prev :: [ Workspace a ] , next :: [ Workspace a ] }
The implementation is obvious , and follows the ‘ focus ’ functions on stacks :
viewLeft :: StackSet a -> StackSet a viewLeft ( StackSet t ( l : ls ) rs ) = StackSet l ls ( t : rs ) viewLeft t = t viewRight :: StackSet a -> StackSet a viewRight ( StackSet t ls ( r : rs ) ) = StackSet r ( t : ls ) rs viewRight t = t
The next , and hardest function to implement , is ‘ shift ’ .
shift moves the currently focused window to workspace ‘ n ’ , leaving the current workspace focused on a new window , and with a new window focused on workspace ‘ n ’ .
We can implement it as a little `script ’ using the primitives defined already , by folding the sequence of operations over our StackSet .
One interesting point to note is that allowing indexing of workspaces requires us to perform sanity checks on the index value .
If ‘ shift ’ only moved to the left or right workspaces , no bounds checking would be needed .
Local operations are more natural for zippers .
shift :: Int -> StackSet a ->
StackSet a shift new s | new >= 0 && new < max_workspaces && new /= old = maybe s go ( peek s ) | otherwise = s where old = tag ( current s ) go w = foldl ( $ ) s [ delete , view new , insertLeft w , view old ]
The ‘ go ’ script performs delete , view , insert , and view calls , and the ‘ view ’ function is a generalisation of viewLeft / viewRight to traverse to an arbitrary workspace ‘ n ’ .
To do this , it has to work out which direction to travel , given the current workspace tag , and the desired workspace :
view :: Int -> StackSet a ->
StackSet a view i s @ ( StackSet ( Workspace n _ ) _ _ ) | i >= 0 && i < max_workspaces = foldr traverse s [ 1 .. abs ( i n ) ] | otherwise = s where traverse _ = if signum ( i n ) >= 0 then viewRight else viewLeft
And that ’s it .
Let ’s now look at using QuickCheck to ensure we have the implementation right , and that our API makes sense .
QuickCheck Your Window Manager
The first thing to check is that the data invariants of the StackSet type hold for arbitrary StackSets Quick Check generates .
For the data structure we have defined , we no longer need to check for focus being valid — the data structure wo n’t let us focus on a window not on the current workspace !
However there is one property not ensured directly by the data structure : uniqueness .
It is required that no window appear more than once in the window manager .
We can check that operations do n’t violate this rule with the following property :
type T = StackSet Char invariant ( x :: T ) = nub ws == ws where ws = [ focus t : left t ++ right t | w <- current s : prev s ++ next s , let t = stack w , t /= Empty ]
Now we can check each operation on StackSets preserves this invariant :
prop_new ( n :: Positive Int ) = invariant $ new ( fromIntegral n ) prop_focusLeft ( n :: NonNegative Int ) ( x :: T ) = invariant $ foldr ( const focusLeft ) x [ 1 .. n ] prop_insertLeft n ( x :: T ) = invariant $ insertLeft n x prop_delete ( x :: T ) = invariant $ maybe x ( \ i -> delete i x ) ( peek x )
And so forth .
Everything looks good so far :
$ runhaskell tests / Properties .
hs new : invariant : OK , 100 tests .
focusLeft : invariant : OK , 100 tests .
insertLeft : invariant : OK , 100 tests .
delete : invariant : OK , 100 tests .
Higher level properties
Rather than go through the basic properties tested in the last article , let ’s now look at stronger properties .
In particular , we will check that particular operations are ‘ local ’ to the area of the data structure they work on — that they do not change parts of the StackSet ( and thus the screen ! ) they should n’t , and secondly , we will check particular policies regarding the movement of focus in the window manager .
A simple property to check is that moving focus on the current virtual workspace never touches the hidden workspaces .
It is purely local to the workspace in focus :
prop_focus_local ( x :: T ) = hidden ( focusRight x ) == hidden x
This says that the hidden workspaces are entirely unchanged by the movement of window focus on the current workspace .
‘ hidden ’ is straightforward :
hidden ( x :: T ) = [ w | w <- prev x ++ next x ]
Similarly , insert and delete should be local .
They should not change anything other than the current workspace :
prop_insert_local ( x :: T ) i = hidden x == hidden ( insertLeft i x ) prop_delete_local ( x :: T ) = hidden x == hidden ( delete x )
And QuickCheck agrees with us .
Good !
We are starting to build up some confidence that our window manager model behaves the way a window manager should .
Another interesting property to check is that shifting focus is reversible .
That is , if you move focus to the left window , you can move it back again by moving focus to the right .
The obvious implementation is :
prop_focus_right ( x :: T ) = focusRight ( focusLeft x ) == x
However , if we run this , we find :
focus right / left : Falsifiable after 0 tests : StackSet { current = Workspace { tag = 0 , stack =
Node { focus = ' n ' , left = [ ] , right = " d " } } , prev = [ ] , next = [ Workspace { tag = 1 , stack = Empty } , Workspace { tag = 2 , stack =
Node { focus = ' e ' , left = " " , right = " " } } ] }
What happened ?
If we look at the current workspace , we see that it has no windows to the left of the currently focused element : “ left = [ ] ” , which means that focusLeft will cause a wrapping , which rests the distribution of windows to the right of the focused element .
So while a window distribution with left , focused and right of :
[ ] 'n ' [ 'd ' ]
and :
[ 'd ' ] 'n ' [ ]
will have the same window ordering modulo wrapping behaviour of focus , they do not compare as equal when tested by QuickCheck .
We thus need to first normalise the window distribution .
We choose to be right - biased here :
normal = modify Empty $ \ c -> case c of Node t ls rs ->
Node t [ ] ( rs ++ reverse ls )
Which yields the property :
prop_focus_right ( x :: T ) = normal ( focusRight ( focusLeft x ) ) == normal x
Which does indeed hold .
Testing where focus goes
Finally , we can check that inserting and deleting a window leaves us with the original StackSet unmodified , including where focus is set :
prop_insert_delete n ( x :: T ) = delete n ( insertLeft n x ) == x prop_delete_insert ( x :: T ) = case peek x of Nothing -> True Just n -> insertLeft n ( delete x ) == x
And QuickCheck again confirms this :
insert is reversible : OK , 100 tests .
delete is reversible : OK , 100 tests .
Wonderful !
Having a data structure that tracks focus automatically gives us simple , clean semantics for the behaviour of focus when windows pop up and are deleted .
In fact , all our properties are now able to assert the behaviour of focus will be unchanged , or will be changed in precisely specified ways , as equality on StackSets now means equality on workspaces , including focus .
This is exactly what we require for an elegant and predictable implementation of a tiling window manager .
Conclusion
By moving more information into our pure data structure , we are able to make stronger statements about the behaviour of our code , on that information .
By using a purely functional data structure , and QuickCheck , we can encode these statements as QuickCheck properties , and have them tested automatically .
Finally , by using a data structure which more closely models the domain we ’re looking at , the implementation becomes simpler , cleaner and more obviously correct , and with a strong , statically typed data structure , we get behaviour for free that previously required dynamic checking .
The data type described here is the core of a branch of the xmonad window manager .
The zipper version of xmonad is running on my laptop as I write , and plans are to merge it into the main xmonad branch soon .
Perhaps the most interesting result is that xmonad is now 50 lines shorter !
By moving more logic ( explicit focus handling ) into the pure StackSet data structure , most of the event handling code is now just a shallow wrapper over the StackSet api .
Smarter data structures , less code .
It ’s all good !
Thanks goes to Wouter Swiestra for the original idea of using a zipper to implement focus - tracking in the xmonad , and to Spencer Janssen , Jason Creighton and David Roundy for several discussions about the subtleties of focus behaviour .
For further information on the lovely zipper data type , see :
Huet made the first presentation of the zipper type in his functional pearl .
Ralf Hinze and Johan Jeuring extended this further in another functional pearl .
There are many interesting results for the zipper type , and an excellent introduction is available on the Haskell wikibook zipper article .
The relationship between zippers and delimited continuations has been described by Oleg Kiselyov .
Jack Clark 's time in the spotlight fell mostly in the years before the so - called steroids era .
That did n't stop the former Cardinals and Giants All - Star slugger from revealing an extreme distaste for players who might have availed themselves of a performance - enhancing drug during their time in the big leagues .
" A lot of them should be banned from baseball , including Mark McGwire , " Clark
told the
St. Louis Post - Dispatch .
Clark served as the Dodgers ' hitting coach several years ago .
He said McGwire , who will return to baseball this season as the Cardinals ' hitting coach , was in a group of players that clearly did n't warrant consideration for Cooperstown .
" All those guys are cheaters -- A - Rod [ Alex Rodriguez ] .
Fake , phony .
Rafael
Palmeiro .
Fake , a phony , " Clark told the newspaper .
" [ Roger ] Clemens , [ Barry ] Bonds . [ Sammy ] Sosa .
Fakes .
Phonies .
They don't
deserve to be in the Hall of Fame .
" They should all be in the Hall of Shame , " Clark said .
" They can afford to build it .
They 've
all got so much money .
And they could all go there and talk about the next way
to rub something on your skin .
The whole thing is creepy .
" They 're all creeps .
All these guys have been liars . "
Clark , a four - time All - Star who hit .267 and belted 340 home runs in 18 seasons , mocked the apologetic and sorrowful tone of McGwire 's Monday admission that he used steroids during much of his major league career .
" They 're
not really a man 's man , " Clark said .
" They 're just whimpering boys who are just sad to watch .
They try to put it off on somebody else .
I do n't know how they sleep at night , looking at all their fame , let alone the money they took by faking everybody out and lying to everybody . "
Clark 's former Cardinals teammate , Andy Van Slyke , took a more subtle tack when speaking with the Post - Dispatch .
" I never condoned a player who used steroids while they played , but I 've never
been mad at a player , " Van Slyke said .
" But I think if you have an opportunity to tell the truth
and you continue to be disingenuous and lie , then there 's every right for
people to be upset by the continued lying or finger - pointing .
" There 's a lot of finger - pointing by Mark McGwire , " Van Slyke continued .
" He blames it on not being
tested and he blames it on the era .
Why would you blame baseball for taking
steroids ?
" That 's like me saying the reason I was drunk - driving was because I knew that
on this particular highway , they did n't have anything for me to blow into . "
Van Slyke was also a teammate of Bonds .
Van
Slyke said he hoped the home run king would be truthful if he ever did reveal whether steroids played a role in his conditioning and performance .
" One thing about Barry -- he 's not afraid to
speak the truth , " Van Slyke said .
" For the last four years [ since his appearance before a
congressional committee ] , McGwire could have said something . "

New Legislation to ensure all battery retailers that sell over 32kg of batteries per year provide collection and recycling facilities comes into effect this month .
The new rules will help deal with the hundreds of tonnes used batteries that are polluting Britain ’s landfill sites every year .
For consumers , all batteries from AA to mobile phone batteries must be separated from household rubbish and disposed of correctly in designated recycling bins in shops or other recycling points .
In the near future it ’s also expected that battery pickups will become available to consumers on kerbside collections .
Any retailer selling more than 32kg of batteries per year will have to provide a collection , recycling service and disposal of old batteries , this is the equivalent of 1 pack of 4 AA batteries per day .
The new rules are created to deal with the 800,000 tonnes of car batteries , 160,000 tonnes of consumer batteries and 190,000 tonnes of industrial batteries that are sold in the EU each year .
When batteries are dumped and are burned they contribute to air pollution and at landfill the metals leach into the soil .
Updated 26th Jan 10
Even Alan Johnson must know his sacking of David Nutt was a mistake .
The boast that he was being " big enough , strong enough , bold enough " to make such decisions was a gift to the gods of hypocrisy .
If he was that big and strong he would have ignored Nutt and not pretended that an academic lecture on drug classification constituted a " public campaign " against him .
Nutt 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs had been humiliated by Johnson and his colleagues , and rendered virtually useless .
Leave the guy alone .
It is not the mistakes politicians make that matter , but why they make them .
The Labour government 's drugs policy must qualify as the worst confection of unreason even in Whitehall 's copious canon .
This is not for want of advice or research .
Few subjects have been more rigorously investigated , not least by Nutt and his collapsed committee .
We know the differential impact of narcotics on the brain .
We chart the evolution of schizophrenia in drug users .
We can measure harm reduction schemes across Europe .
We can even balance the impact of education against deterrence in curbing drug use .
When I hear of another committee , conference or seminar on drugs policy I scream : " Do n't waste the money : spend it on rehab instead . "
Researching drug use is pointless since policy on the subject has nothing to do with evidence , only emotion .
It has to do with fear of the unknown , the taboo of other people 's escapist narcotics ( or worse , those of one 's children ) .
Politicians could not care less what experts say – witness this week 's smattering of support for Johnson .
They care only for the rightwing press , whose editors suffer a similar taboo .
The test was how the Tories reacted to Nutt 's sacking .
Faced with a home secretary gasping for air , Cameron and his home affairs spokesman , Chris Grayling , rushed forward with oxygen .
Parting company with half the cabinet and the weight of scientific opinion , Cameron had a bad attack of funk .
He refused to defend Nutt , and asserted his conviction that ecstasy was as harmful as heroin and crack cocaine .
This was the same Cameron who , as a backbench member of the home affairs select committee in 2001 , had supported Nutt in taking the opposite view .
He must know what he said this week was rubbish .
All these politicians accept in private that the law is in chronic need of reform .
Yet should they dare murmur so , they seem terrified of being assailed by the Mail , the Sun and the Telegraph .
They could handle the House of Commons .
They could even carry their constituents .
But the rightwing press holds them in thrall , perhaps because they feel powerless before its lash .
Might their youthful indiscretions be discovered , or the antics of their children pursued ?
Politicians can stand the pressure of corpses piling up in Helmand , but one corpse at a rave would be too much for their consciences .
Whenever I have tackled Home Office ministers , from Jack Straw and Charles Clarke to recent , less distinguished holders of the office , the response is the same .
Do n't even think about it , they cry .
We would be crucified by the press .
Just say no to drugs reform .
I served on the 2000 police foundation committee on the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act , the only exhaustive study of the act ever undertaken .
It was set up with the government 's blessing and members included David Nutt , distinguished pharmacologists and two chief police officers .
Our conclusions were mild , embracing a redirection of drugs policy towards harm reduction and a partial decriminalisation of cannabis use .
Polling evidence showed a wide gulf between a public desire for toughness on hard drugs on the one hand ; and on the other , two - thirds of opinion that regarded cannabis as " least harmful " .
An overwhelming majority thought chasing cannabis users was " not a police priority " , and a significant majority , from all ages and social groups , favoured cannabis decriminalisation .
That was confirmed in other similar polls .
What happened next was a textbook case of Tony Blair 's governing style .
The home secretary , Jack Straw , went ape , reputedly on the instructions of Alastair Campbell , then at the height of his Downing Street ascendancy .
They feared that the slightest welcome for the report 's findings might have the government castigated by the rightwing press , of which Campbell lived in perpetual fear .
The committee 's chairman , Ruth Runciman , was summoned in advance of publication and castigated by Straw in front of his team , until Mo Mowlam had to suggest it might be better if they all read the document first .
When the report appeared it was well received .
The Daily Mail , in a front - page editorial , welcomed it and said it had delivered " a mature and serious national debate " .
The Telegraph was even more favourable and criticised Straw for " misjudging the public mood " .
The head of the Metropolitan police was supportive .
In other words it was quite untrue that the public and press were opposed to drugs law reform .
Realising this , Straw performed a U - turn and was induced , apparently by Campbell , to write an article full of wishy - washy assertions for the News of the World .
It warmly welcomed the report and further debate .
There was none .
The subject was buried .
The incident was a classic example of public policy determined by ministers trying to second - guess Fleet Street .
Drugs policy is desperately important .
It has the power to wreck lives , families and communities .
It underpins a third of crime and 80 % of acquisitive crime .
Four decades of illegality have done nothing to curb consumption , merely breeding the most lucrative , untaxed product market in Britain .
No country has achieved the remotest success with prohibition , but Britain 's archaic laws have been the least successful .
Go to any deprived area , any difficult school , any failing social service , and the root cause of trouble is drugs .
There is no evidence that the public is averse to reform of the 1971 law , indeed the opposite .
Why senior politicians should accord mystical influence to a few irrationalist newspaper editorialists is bizarre .
Ministers and opposition leaders disregard the press on war and peace , on indulging banks , and on infringing civil liberties .
The media 's bluff is called every day on some topic or other – and rightly so .
The press , like the pope , can field no divisions .
So what is it about drugs ?
Britain 's deepest social problem is blighted by political cowardice towards an outdated taboo .
But who will break the spell ?
" The chance of getting married will be rare if a man is more than 40 years old in the countryside .
They will be more dependent on social security as they age and have fewer household resources to rely on , " said Mr Wang .
With food prices on the rise and consumers looking for ways to save money , a thriving trade is being done online by websites selling discounted groceries past their official shelf lives .
Following on from the success of the freecycle movement which allows members swap unwanted household goods , sites offering clearance , short - dated and out - of - date food and drink have become the latest way to both cut costs and reduce waste .
One website , approvedfood.co.uk , this week reported a 500 % year on year increase in sales in the last week of December , while another , foodbargains.co.uk , is running an apology on its website over backlogged orders due to high demand .
Environmental campaigners have welcomed the trend , saying it can help to reduce Britain 's huge mountain of food waste .
Food charities estimate that more than seventeen million tonnes of surplus food , including fresh produce , is dumped by supermarkets in landfill every year , with a sales value of more than £ 18bn .
Most of the goods sold on discount sites are past their " best - before dates " but not the " use - by " dates , and have been bought at knocked - down prices from wholesalers , suppliers and supermarkets .
The sites offer a range of stock from many top brands , including Heinz , McVities , Baxters , Nescafe and Cadbury .
Items range from tinned food ( 59 p for tuna ) to packet soup ( 19 p each ) , toiletries ( £ 1 for six toilet rolls ) and pet food ( 50 p a tin ) .
There is a predominance of less healthy options such as chocolates ( 10 Mars bars for £ 1 ) , fizzy drinks ( 99 p for 2 litres ) and processed food ( £ 1 for 48 bags of Cheese Doritos ) although approvedfood .
co.uk has introduced a healthy eating range ( 19 p for wholegrain Ryvita ) which includes options out of the normal bargain - basement range – sushi nori roasted seaweed 99 p for six packs ; tins of celeria strips for 99 p ; and cases of six Italian cold - pressed extra virgin olive oil for 49 p a 500 ml bottle ( currently sold out ) .
Dan Cluderay , the founder of approvedfood .
co.uk , said customers saved an average of 75 % on recommended retail prices .
" During November and December 2009 we sold over 500,000 items , " he said .
" Shoppers can spend £ 25 on an order with us and easily expect to see an equivalent shopping basket cost £ 100 in their local supermarket . "
Customers are encouraged to buy in bulk , with both sites charging around £ 5 for delivery up to about 30 kgs .
Cluderay stressed that consumers were not taking a gamble with their health by eating food past its best - before date , adding that there is genuine confusion over food labelling , mainly on the difference between " use by " and " best before " dates .
" We never sell anything past its 'use by ' date , " he said , " but the ' best before ' date simply refers to the product 's optimum quality .
" Products past this date are still perfectly fine to consume and it's very unusual for anyone to be able to tell the difference . "
The government 's Food Standards Agency says that food that has passed a best - before date will be safe to eat when stored correctly , but advises consumers to never eat anything beyond its use - by date .
Last year the food and farming secretary Hilary Benn urged retailers to phase out the sell - by and best - before date labels on food in a bid to reduce food waste , saying they were confusing and meaningless .
Recent figures from his department , Defra , reveal that 370,000 tonnes of food is thrown away each year in the UK after passing its " best before " date , 40,000 tonnes of which had not even been opened while it was still edible .
A spokesperson for the Love Food Hate Waste campaign run by the government body Wrap – set up to advise the government on reducing waste and packaging - said : " It can sometimes be worthwhile to take advantage of promotional offers or last - minute deals , especially during the recession , but the key thing to remember is to make the most of what we buy — otherwise we only end up throwing good food and money away in the end .
" The average family could save just over £ 50 a month just by making the most of the food they buy .
If you 're buying dry cereals or products the key to making the most of a bargain is to store food well . "
A recent Science paper sheds a new light on electron density in individual molecular states .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
For the first time , it has been possible to measure electron density in individual molecular states using what is known as the photoelectric effect .
Now published in Science , this method represents a key building block in the development of organic semiconductor elements .
Supported by the Austrian Science Fund FWF , the success of this project rested on the mathematical transformation of the measured data .
This made it possible to interpret the distribution of the electrons and draw conclusions about the potential properties of organic semiconductor elements .
Ultra - thin films made of organic molecules form the basis of future semiconductor technologies .
Because organic molecules are extremely flexible , they can be used in a whole new range of applications , making it equally possible to create pliable screens and cost - effective solar cells .
However , apart from these everyday applications for organic semiconductors , the most important task is to gain a better understanding of the interactions between organic materials and inorganic carrier substances .
A team from the Universities of Graz and Leoben has now succeeded in developing a means of doing just that .
TIGHTLY PACKED
" The properties of an organic molecule are defined to a large extent by specific electron states " , explains Dr. Peter Puschnig of the Chair of Atomistic Modelling and Design of Materials at the University of Leoben , who led the research .
He adds : " If we can determine their distribution within the molecule accurately , then we will be able to better understand how organic semiconductor components work and thus increase their efficiency . "
Until now , there has been a lack of effective methods of measuring this electron distribution .
Dr. Puschnig and his team have therefore succeeded in making significant progress .
The team 's achievement is based on the use of the photoelectric effect .
This enables individual electrons to be " knocked out " of organic molecules .
As part of this project , an organic molecule was exposed to ultraviolet light that emitted sufficient energy to separate individual electrons from the molecules .
The direction and speed of the electrons thus released were then measured using highly - sensitive detectors , generating the basic data required to calculate the electron distribution within the molecule .
As part of this process , Prof. Michael Ramsay and his team from the University of Graz used a hexaphenyl film just one molecule thick that had been applied to a copper surface .
The team from Graz carried out the actual measurements at the Berliner Elektronen - Speicherring Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung ( BESSY , Berlin Electron Storage Ring Society for Synchrotron Radiation ) .
A CALCULATED RESULT
Commenting on the evaluation of this data , Dr. Puschnig says : " It revealed a quite characteristic distribution of the electrons emitted .
However , it initially proved difficult to interpret this distribution and it seemed it would be impossible to link the measured data to the original electron distribution in the molecule . "
It was only by using special mathematical transformations ( Fourier Transformation ) that the team was able to establish that the measured electron distribution matched that of the molecule .
As the distribution was in this instance already known from calculations carried out as part of the density functional theory , it was possible to test and confirm the viability of the new method .
This new method is particularly valuable as it means measuring the behaviour of electrons at the interfaces between organic semiconductors and metals is now relatively easy and highly accurate .
The study " Interface controlled and functionalised organic thin films " supported by the FWF as part of the National Research Network ( NFN ) is thus making a fundamental contribution to future applications of organic semiconductors .

Apparently , I have crossed a line .
I did n’t realize there was a line , but apparently my last post about Rick Warren was a bridge too far for some folks .
Even though I clearly stated that everything I said about Warren was pure conjecture – meaning an opinion not based in fact – I have been lambasted by Warren defenders .
It ’s puzzling to me .
A while back I wrote a fairly critical piece on Joel Osteen , questioning the motives of his ministry and his low opinion of gays and lesbians as not being “ God ’s best . ”
No one took me to task for criticizing Osteen .
No one claimed I was way off base , did n’t know my facts , or professed disappointment in me .
For some reason , though , Warren appears to be off limits .
Criticizing Warren is apparently somewhat akin to badmouthing Gandhi , King , or even Jesus Christ .
Why is that ?
What is it about Warren that produces slavish devotion by his congregation and even leads those who are not his followers to ardently defend him from freely admitted baseless claims ?
Perhaps it could be that I ’m too close to the truth for some people .
I mean , if my words about Warren did n’t have any truth to them , why is the reaction against them so vitriolic ?
Why not just disregard them as false and move on ?
When someone says something I find to be completely baseless , I simply disregard their opinion as uniformed .
When , however , someone says something that hits too close to home , or strikes a nerve , then , the dukes go up .
Those are fighting words and you ’d better take them back .
Anyone who has done church work for just a few minutes knows that money makes the world go round – even the church world .
No church survives without a budget and faithfully tithing members .
I shudder , though , at mega- churches and incredible bloated budgets .
My mother ’s church in Georgia raised millions of dollars to build a new sanctuary .
I asked my mother , “ Were n’t there any poor people in the area you could help ? ”
She gave me a withering look .
Capital projects are different budgets than missions and never the twain shall meet .
Warren , who has made millions , does n’t take a salary , fine .
He lives in a modest house , fine .
He drives a beat up truck , fine .
All good things .
I give him props for not having a private jet and a BMW or a Mercedes .
But , really , what does that mean ?
Warren is not poor .
He ’s not needy .
He could have made up that $ 900,000 deficit without dipping too far into his own pocket – yet , he decided to turn to his flock .
He knew his flock was hurting – many had lost jobs in this bad economy – but he turned to them anyway .
They responded in their faithfulness , and that is admirable – but did Warren really need his flock to keep him afloat ?
Would a $ 900,000 deficit have sunk Saddleback ?
Highly unlikely , but a couple of support staff may have been streeted without it , so hopefully the money saved a couple of jobs at Saddleback .
That would be a blessing .
Others have speculated ( remember , that ’s an opinion without any supporting facts ) that perhaps I ’m bitter .
Perhaps
I ’m just jealous that Warren is raking in the cash , growing his church , and generally just speaking to a bigger audience than me .
Hardly .
I have enough challenges helping to tend a small flock in South Carolina .
I do n’t need the headaches that come with that much “ success ” in the church business .
Jesus counted success differently than we do these days .
He did n’t build a big church , did n’t send letters to his followers asking for donations , did n’t seek to give high profile prayers .
He simply went about the business of helping people .
He did n’t seek acclaim or write any best - selling books .
He simply went to where the hurting people were and healed them .
His words so empowered people and helped them to connect to God that those in charge of the government and the religious leaders of the day found him to be a threat to the status quo they had carefully put in place .
His words , his actions , his unconditional love for all , moved many and threatened many more .
Warren is no threat to the entrenched government or those in power over the modern church .
He may have a heart for the poor and a genuine desire to help them .
God will use that and bless it .
But , my problem with Warren is he ’s not radical enough .
He plays it safe – making people feel good about being Christian instead of challenging them to upend the power structure that keeps them poor and strips them of their dignity .
Warren is not an evil man , he ’s just a poor example of how Christians ought to be acting in this world .
We should be challenging the government , not praying as it installs a new leader .
Instead of asking how we can help the poor , we should be asking why we have poor in the first place – and challenging the world ’s leaders , and ourselves , to ensure that no one goes without .
We should be challenging the religious mores of the day instead of buying into them and using them for personal gain .
In short , we should be in this world , but not of it .
In the end , Warren is far too worldly for me to see him as a blueprint on how to follow Christ .
My friend Ramit ( name changed on request ) called me late Friday night .
He sounded quite agitated .
“ You know , Haagen Dazs has opened its Delhi outlet ” .
I reacted with a joke .
“ Good , now you can spend a lot more on an ice cream than you normally would .
But why are you agitated ? ”
“ Because I am not allowed to enter ” , he said .
Now , Ramit is not like one of the politician ’s son or into drugs , the sort who are often in news in India ’s capital for all the wrong reasons , nor is he the kind who will shoot someone down because she refused to serve him a cone of ice cream .
He did not waste much time and said he has taken a picture and is mailing me the reason .
I switched on my mail , and clicked on the attachment .
I could n’t believe what I saw .
Was I in India , 62 years after gaining independence , and years after South Africa officially ended apartheid ?
The banners outside the outlet said : Exclusive Preview for International Travellers .
And under that , in an even finer print , the real bombshell : Access restricted only to holders of international passports .
I immediately called Ramit .
“ You are an international traveler , and you have a passport , so you can go in ” , I said .
Ramit ’s response was instant : I tried to enter but they said you are not allowed for you do n’t have an international passport .
I am normally not given to immediate emotional reactions , but I could n’t resist this time .
I was , to be honest , upset .
How can they do this to an Indian , in India ?
Do a story on TOI or NBT ?
Do it for print or Online ?
Call other media friends and colleagues ?
I simply did n’t know how to react .
Print would have a better impact , but should I wait that long ?
Then I felt , why not use the power of the social media ?
Next thing I knew was that I had put up a few pictures on facebook , added a caption and also sent out a tweet with a request it be retweeted .
In a few hours , it had turned into a viral and I started getting messages from angry Indians all over .
Why just Indians , even friends in international media wrote to say “ this is the stupidest thing they have seen in a long time ” .
I did n’t stop at that .
I ended up calling a few MPs I knew I could speak to bluntly and told them about it , taunting them about it .
I do n’t know what finally worked , but it seems word did get around to the outlet ’s franchisee and they started claiming there never was any restriction on anybody entering the outlet .
While this may be considered a victory for people power , I am still unable to figure out who in his right senses would have advised the dessert company to do something so stupid .
Was it a way to generate controversy for free publicity ?
Did they think it will work subliminally on Indians mind that now that it has been ‘ certified ’ by international travelers it would be good for them too ?
Whatever it is , it is idiotic .
I checked later and found that the franchisee is an Indian company based in Delhi and the man incharge is also an Indian .
I have often maintained that we ourselves are our biggest enemies .
Our mentality is that of slaves and we think anything is good only if its approved by foreigners , or the “ holders of international passport ” .
Perhaps the Indian franchisee had this in mind .
And a comment on the picture I put up on the facebook by an Indian who migrated to Australia decades ago sums it up :
Most international travellers do n’t want HD in India when they can get it in their own backyard .
Its a commodity not a special thing for them .
They would also see this as pure cashing in and thinking they are idiots – ‘ India taking them for a ride . ’
Have to remember not every international traveler is American ; makes an average salary of squillion dollars ; can often be allergic to dairy ( yes ) ; is in India to have an ‘ authentic Indian ’ experience and by golly even enjoy kulfi , falooda , lassi , dosa !
This is all about how India and Indians see themselves .
Foreigners have nothing to do with it .
UPDATED : December 17 , 2009
Dear readers ,
A Director of Haagen Dazs , Arindam Haldar , called me Wednesday evening and wanted to discuss this post and the reaction it has generated from Indians all over the world .
He tried to explain that their banner that has resulted in such heat was merely a teaser and that the company can never say no to an Indian .
He admitted that the company may have erred in its choice of words and he was sorry .
When I said I merely did the job of a journalist and that the apology should actually be addressed to Indians all over the world , and even non-Indians , who have expressed disgust at your company ’s insensitivity , he said he ’d send out an apology to the media .
While he sounded apologetic on the phone and said he was genuinely sorry , I present below the ‘ apology ’ the Managing Director of the company that manages the brand in India sent out .
You can decide for yourself if this really constitutes an apology .
Media Statement from : Mr. Anindo Mukherji , Managing Director , General Mills India
There have been some reports alleging that the recently opened Häagen - Dazs shop denied access to Indians .
We vehemently and categorically deny this .
Häagen - Dazs products and our Häagen - Dazs shop in India are and will always be for our consumers in India .
The recently opened Haagen - Dazs shop is open to one and all , and there ’s no question of barring entry to anyone on any basis .
The pre view on Thursday , 10th December had a morning media event which was attended by journalists of repute from Indian media .
The same evening we had a launch party for our friends and families , less than 5 % of who were foreigners .
Also , during the mock training days at the shop leading up to 10th December , a lot of interests were generated and hundreds of walk - ins were given samples of our ice cream .
The poster in question was part of initial local store communication at a few locations within the same mall announcing the opening of the new Häagen - Dazs shop in the mall .
The message was intended to suggest that you can enjoy , for instance , a taste of the French Riviera without traveling to France – by enjoying Häagen - Dazs .
Unfortunately the reference to the international passport holder on the poster may have led to a significant miscommunication .
This was completely unintended and we apologize for creating the misimpression that may have hurt our sentiments as Indians .

On the opening day of the COP15 talks , the Obama administration is poised to provide an Exxon - led consortium with a $ 3 billion loan for a liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) project in Papua New Guinea .
The loan has been approved by the Export - Import Bank , an agency of the Obama administration , and was first reported on Friday by the Bloomberg news service .
The report comes amidst increasing pressure on the U.S. to offer billions of dollars to poor and developing countries for clean energy generation and projects that will assist them in adapting to climate change .
But the financing package also runs counter to prior commitments given by Obama .
Back in September , at the UN Climate Change summit , he promised : “ I will work with my colleagues at the G20 to phase out fossil fuel subsidies so that we can better address our climate challenge . ”
A few days later , in Pittsburgh , G20 heads of state included in their final communiqué a commitment to ending these subsidies , although without specifying a timeframe .
Opponents of the Exxon deal are now raising the issue at COP15 .
“ The Obama administration talks a good game on climate and ending fossil fuel subsidies , ” Steve Kretzman of Oil Change International told The Nation , “ but $ 3 billion for Exxon says its still business as usual in Washington . ”
Obama ’s message to the world and to his colleagues in the G20 is to cut subsidies .
But the message to agencies within his administration is to keep the subsidies flowing .
The loan approval could further undermine US legitimacy during the COP15 talks .
Yvo de Boer , Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC , has made “ fast - track financing ” a key negotiating demand at COP15 .
He has called on developed nations to commit to $ 10 billion per year for three years beginning in 2010 .
The money would be used to finance adaptation to the effects of climate change , such as rising sea levels or desertification , and fund a transition in developing economies from carbon intensive forms of energy production to cleaner ones .
The US has said that it will pony up its “ fair share ” of that amount but has not made a specific offer .
Greenpeace , which has a large and visible presence inside and outside the Bella Center , is pushing hard on the issue of financing .
When asked about the Exxon - Mobile loan , Steve Herz , a policy analyst with the group , told The Nation : “ For one company , for one project to receive that level of funding is huge , especially relative to the amount of financing that ’s currently on the table in Copenhagen . ”
Pledges for “ fast track financing ” have been made , but questions remain about who will provide long - term financing , perhaps $ 300 billion a year by 2020 , for clean energy and adaptation projects .
Cutting global fossil fuel subsidies could go a long way for addressing both financing tracks .
Kretzman is working the halls of the Bella Center trying to link the issue of fossil fuel subsidies and climate finance .
He estimates that fossil fuel subsidies among developed nations are in the range of $ 57 billion .
“ One of the key issues on the table here in Copenhagen , ” he says , “ is money .
The US has n’t been able to give any specific commitments yet towards climate finance .
I guess Exxon comes first . ”

( Cooperstown , NY ) – Brewery Ommegang will release a Belgian - style Pale
Ale for the first time this spring in bottle - conditioned 750 ’s and on draft .
The beer will ship in February for sales in March - April .
It is the first of six in a new series of “ specialty ” beers to come out in 2010 .
Marketing and Press Relations Director , Larry Bennett expounds ,
“ The idea is a full - flavored , full aroma , authentic Belgian Pale ale with a quaffable 5.7 % abv .
It is part of a series of beers we ’re trying out this year as ‘ accessible draft ’ candidates .
Accessible draft meaning : satisfying to drink , moderate ABV , reasonably priced ( in line with our other year - round beers ) , ultimately able to get and hold its own handle , apart from our other handles out there .
Like many breweries our size , we make a broad range of beers , but do n’t really have one dedicated or focused ‘ entry ’ ‘ accessible ’ draft beer .
We ’re looking into whether or not we need to have one .
This is one of three we ’re putting out there in next six months to see how the retailers and public respond .
Depending on that , one could go into production full time , or could all go to the Specialty Beer route . ”
Around 12,000 bottles ( 6 x 2000 ) of Ommegang Belgian - style Pale Ale will be produced .
The brewery is putting roughly 100HL into bottle and 100HL in draft ( mostly 1/6 bbl ) .
This will also hit Ommegang ’s entire 45 - state distribution market .
There is a possibility that this hits 12 oz .
bottles later in the year as well though that is undetermined at this time .
The label reads , “ This fine pale ale has citrus and tropical fruit aromatic shared with a well - balanced – yet abundant – hop character .
It uses our own Belgian yeast , five malts , two hops , and plenty of patience .
Finishing touches include dry - hopping with Cascade hops and warm - cellaring . ”
5.8 % ABV .
Says Bennett , “ We ’ve worked on this for a while , trying to crack the code for accessible with distinctive character .
The brewers have done it . ”
Look for it in late winter / early spring .

Here ’s the reaction over in Britain to news about the banking sector ’s recent return to outsize profitability :
Ministers are drawing up plans for a tax raid on Britain ’s banks worth hundreds of millions of pounds , The Sunday Telegraph has learned .
The radical move , being considered as a way of forcing banks to pay a price for the taxpayer - funded bail - out of the financial system , could include a one - off “ windfall ” tax on profits .
…. Last night , in his weekly podcast , Gordon Brown , the Prime Minister , said his government would be “ taking extensive action to reform the whole culture of the financial sector ” .
Any action is likely to hit all UK banks — even those which have not been part - nationalised , or given access to hundreds of billions of pounds worth of taxpayer - funded collateral .
There is understood to be “ considerable anger ” , both inside No 10 and among Cabinet ministers , over recent signs that banks are once again ready to unveil huge profits and bonus payments .
Mattel 's coolest Hot Wheels ever :
They fold
The first - ever " flat " remote - control Hot Wheels cars will hit stores in August .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It 's the size of a credit card and about as slim as a cell phone .
But the coolest feature of Mattel 's new Hot Wheels ride is its 3D action : Push a button and the " flat " car pops up into a remote - control vehicle .
Called " Stealth Rides , " these toy cars are Mattel 's first - ever folding Hot Wheels .
It 's the latest innovation for a brand that 's been selling in toy stores for more than 40 years .
" This is definitely one the coolest new toys in 2010 , " said Jim Silver , a toy industry analyst and editor in chief of TimetoPlayMag.com .
Mattel ( MAT , Fortune 500 ) has created five different models of Stealth Riders , including two cars , two tanks and a " Batmobile Tumbler " that the toymaker will debut next month during the Toy Fair in New York .
The annual industry event showcases some of the hottest new toys that will hit stores later in the year , in time for the Christmas shopping season .
All five Stealth Rides fold flat and slide out of a plastic case that functions as both a carrying case and a remote control .
With the push of a button , the " flat " cars transform into three - dimensional , fully functioning remote - control vehicles .
" Containing a fully functioning vehicle in a pocket - sized case will allow kids to play anywhere , anytime , " said Geoff Walker , senior vice president with Mattel Brands .
" The vehicles [ provide ] a unique and cool level of play experience that was not previously possible . "
The Hot Wheels Stealth Rides will hit stores in August , priced at about $ 25 per car .
" The remote control category [ of toys ] used to include big toys for $ 70 or more , " said Silver .
" So this is an affordable price point for a very cool product that 's never been done before . "
He also praised the cars ' engineering .
" These [ cars ] are easy to carry around and the charge time is fantastic , " Silver said .
" It 's 30 minutes of play , and that 's a long time for such a small remote - control toy . "
We wish you all merry xmas and happy new year .
As a Christmas gift we ( finally ) release the solution to t2’09 Challenge .
When the truth hurts , sometimes it 's better to manage its eventual disclosure .
Crisis - stricken Greece is in dire need of funding .
Yet rather than issue new bonds via auction right now , whereby the market might be shocked by a worse than expected result , Greece is considering something more discrete -- a private placement with banks , essentially a privately negotiated loan , according to the managing director of the country 's Public Debt Management Agency .
Thus they can discover what the market rate for Greek debt ahead of time , outside of the lime light , and then do damage control afterward should the interest rates banks require them to pay be far worse than expected .
It 's not exactly a sign of confidence .
Bloomberg : Greece may borrow privately through banks by the end of January , the second such transaction in as many months , following cuts to the government ’s credit ratings , according to the country ’s debt manager .
The decision on whether to use a private placement will depend on reaction to the country ’s stability and growth program , Spyros Papanicolaou , the managing director of Greece ’s Public Debt Management Agency , said today .
The country had earlier considered offering bonds through a syndicate of banks .
“ We are yet to decide whether to go ahead with a syndication , ” Papanicolaou said today in a telephone interview from Athens .
“ We might do a private placement instead .
It will depend on how the stability and growth program is received by the European Commission and the markets . ”

Augmented reality software promises to let us see the world as the Terminator saw it : overlaid with digital information .
Given that most of us are n’t cyborg assassins from the future , we ’re more likely to use the technology to see restaurant ratings as we walk past that new taqueria , status updates floating over friends ’ heads or a trail of digital breadcrumbs leading us back to our hotel rooms .
Most of us will use smartphones instead of a head - mounted display because cellphone cameras help these services reconcile digital and physical reality without making you look like a cyborg assassin .
But as the video below shows , the digital tags in today ’s early augmented - reality mobile apps float unmoored , as if not quite tethered to reality .
This “ floating tag ” problem is more than just a quirk or annoyance because of how our brains process information .
In order to convince us they ’re real , augmented - reality tags must stick to the world they ’re describing .
The problem is existing systems such as Acrossair ( below right ) , Layar and Twittaround rely on the iPhone ’s GPS and digital compass .
These , and other existing apps like WikiTude AT Travel Guide and Yelp Monocle work , but they are n’t nearly accurate enough to support truly sticky augmented - reality tags .
Google Goggles sidesteps the problem by displaying tags in two dimensions at the bottom of the screen rather than trying to overlay them .
The solution is on the way , but it ’s not from Google .
Earthmine , which takes 3 - D pictures of cities that assign every pixel a specific point in real space , launched three software - development kits in October to help developers affix augmented reality tags more firmly to reality .
The company captures more data per street than Google Street View , which it claims is its only competitor .
By matching Earthmine ’s 3 - D city data with what a phone ’s camera sees , developers can solve the floating - tag problem using Earthmine ’s iPhone , HTTP and Flash software development kits .
Company CEO
Anthony Fassero says they “ localize [ a developer ’s ] camera position to less than a foot , and its orientation just fractions of a degree , versus 20 to 30 feet with a GPS , and 20 degrees with the [ iPhone ’s ] compass . ”
“ Right now , [ augmented reality ] is kind of cheesy , ” he said .
“ You pull up your augmented - reality app and things are kind of floating around , and it does n’t look like Terminator , where you ’re looking around and all the information ’s popping up .
The thing Earthmine does for augmented reality is we enable it to look like it does in the movies . ”
“ For it to line up and ‘ stick ’ in the real world , they need to use our data , ” Fassero said .
“ There ’s no other way to get that accurate localization . ”
A number of local search companies apparently are taking him up on that , but seem to be doing it in stealth mode .
Munich - based Metaio , an early Earthmine client already has an augmented reality iPhone app on the market , ( Junaio video ) , but it , too , suffers from the floating tag problem .
“ It was a big decision for us to put it out there , because the technology part of Metaio said , ‘ Hey , this is not ready yet in terms of accuracy , it ’s just GPS , man , that ’s jumping around like crazy , and we ca n’t do it , ' ” said Metaio CTO Peter Meier .
“ But then of course , on the other side , we have to be out there . ”
The iPhone ’s GPS is accurate to 30 feet or so most of the time , but that ’s not close enough .
“ Imagine there are two restaurants next to each other , and one gets a 5 - star rating and the other gets a 1 - star rating as people tag it , ” said Meier .
“ [ Using GPS ] , the 1 - star restaurant [ can ] get the 5 - star rating . ”
Metaio ’s app eventually will incorporate GPS , Earthmine ’s 3 - D maps and Metaio ’s optical tracking technology in what could be the first augmented - reality app to solve the floating - tag problem , assuming another company does n’t beat it to the punch .
Metaio plans to debut its first working demo for Earthmine ’s hometown of Berkeley , California , in the coming months .
Earthmine ’s small size meant it could provide specific information to Metaio , such as where the sun was when a picture was taken .
Metaio wants to know because it helps mesh photos taken at different times into a cohesive view .
“ If the shadows are different , it makes a big difference for our computer vision algorithms … .
We would never get that [ data ] from a big company like Google because we ’re probably too small . ”
He also backed up Fassero ’s claim that Earthmine ’s more - detailed 3 - D maps work better than Google Street View for mixing augmented reality and real - world information .
As much as a journalist might like to know what augmented reality ’s killer app is , Meier says one does n’t exist .
“ What is the killer application ?
The same question would be ‘ What is the killer application for a touchscreen ? ' ” he said .
“ We ’re not revolutionizing everything , we ’re not creating really new applications , we just make what ’s possible right now easier to use , easier to understand , and better to grasp . ”
That said , he does see location - based , augmented - reality mobile games as a promising area .
He expects game developers to use Metaio ’s and Earthmine ’s technology to create realistic , nongimmicky games that take place in real - world cities starting in 2010 .
An ad - supported model for AR gaming is easy to envision : Local businesses could pay to have the game send players past their storefronts .
“ When there ’s a dragon flying in front of a building , and you take one step and the dragon comes one step closer — exactly one step closer — and it ’s really flying right next to that building , and it ’s not jittering around , it ’s a completely different experience — close to special effects in real time , ” Meier said .

These are just a few of the choice words a New York state judge used to describe the behavior of Indymac in a decision in which he wiped out the $ 292,500 sub - prime mortgage owed by a homeowner to the bank .
Indymac began foreclosure proceedings in 2004 on the home of defendant Dana Yano - Horoski in East Patchogue , New York .
Judge Jeffrey Spinner said that it became clear to the court at a September 2009 settlement conference -- one that had been postponed five times due to Indymac 's failure to " cooperate " -- that Indymac " had no good faith intention whatsoever of resolving this matter in any manner other than complete and forcible devolution of title ... "
The judge repeatedly stated that the homeowners were willing to work out a deal and could do so , and noted Indymac 's repeated failure to make concessions , including the fact that they denied an offer by the defendants ' daughter to purchase the home at fair market value with third - party financing .
The court found that Indymac 's conduct was " wholly unsupportable at law or in equity , greatly egregious and so completely devoid of good faith that equity cannot be permitted on its behalf . "
And thus , finding that if he just dismissed the foreclosure action he " cannot be assured that Plaintiff will not repeat this course of conduct , " he concluded the most effective course of action would be to cancel the entire mortgage .
Skinner leads a foreclsoure unit created " to accommodate settlement conferences that have reached 2,400 " in his county , according to the New York Law Journal .

San Jose Sharks goaltender Evgeni Nabokov is on pace for 71 starts this season , a workload that will be the highest in his career with the exception of the 77 he saw in 07-08 under Ron Wilson .
Thomas Greiss was his backup goaltender that season as well , at least before Doug Wilson signed Brian Boucher from the Philadelphia Phantoms .
Everyone knows I think he 's been getting too many starts between the pipes .
My concerns are well chronicled , and frankly , have probably become akin to beating a dead horse .
So , instead of lengthy paragraphs rehashing the same arguments , here are some items of note I compiled .
If you 'll notice , this post is n't labelled under the section " Statistical Analysis . "
This is because I 'm not convinced any of these are compelling proof that McLellan 's decision to ride him is bound for failure , nor am I convinced that any of these are proof that the decision will not affect Nabokov in the long run .
I think a qualitative approach is best here considering the complexity of analyzing the notoriously difficult to gauge goaltending position , Nabokov 's age , and the fact that he will be starting for the 2010 Russian Olympic team .
After the jump are the bullet points ; I highly encourage all readers to submit their own in the comments section .
If you are interested in advanced statistical analysis of goaltenders , this article is not your number one source ; Brodeur Is A Fraud brings the goods .
The last goaltender to win a Stanley Cup with over 70 starts is Martin Brodeur , who did so in 2003 with the New Jersey Devils .
He had 73 to his name .
Since the lockout , the average number of games started for Stanley Cup winning goaltenders is 44.75 games .
Cam Ward had 25 , JS Giguere had 53 , Chris Osgood had 40 , and Marc - Andre Fleury had 61 .
Since the lockout , there have been sixteen cases of goaltenders making 65 + starts and their team getting into the playoffs .
In other words , 25 % of playoff teams have goalies making 65 + starts .
In those sixteen cases , the goaltenders have compiled a .911 SV % before the ASG / Olympic break , and a .916 SV % afterwards .
Since the lockout , all goaltenders that made the playoffs and had 65 + starts averaged a .913 SV % in the regular season and a .912 SV % in the postseason .
Since the lockout , Cam Ward went the farthest in the postseason with 65 + starts , doing so last year when he led the Carolina Hurricanes the Eastern Conference Finals .
They were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins .
Evgeni Nabokov 's best playoff run was during 2004 , where he posted a .935 SV % and led the team to the Western Conference Finals .
He started 58 games that year .
Nabokov 's second best playoff run was during 2007 , where he posted a .920 SV % .
He started 49 games that year .
During the rest of Nabokov 's playoff runs , he has yet to eclipse a .908 SV % .
When Nabokov started 77 games in 07 - 08 , he had a .910 SV % in the regular season and a .907 SV % in the postseason .
Go Sharks .
I got into the cab slowly enough to size up the situation .
One car in the family means that every once in a while I ’m well and truly stranded , public transportation not being enough .
I have to trust some other person to be a decent driver who will get me where I want to go safely and quickly .
When I ’m lucky , I can get a story out of it , too .
The tall thin frame of a Somali man greeted me , as usual in cabs these days , and that was the situation .
I needed a ride , he was making a living , and that was all there was to the deal .
I told him where I needed to go and we were off .
Before he could switch on the radio and create his own professional space in the front seat , I let him know I was a chatty , friendly kind of guy with some simple banter .
Did this ride come with a story ?
There was an awkward moment before we got the talk moving as easily as the red minivan , but it came together .
We had enough between us to build a little bit more trust by chatting , sharing opinions more than stories .
I let him do much of the talking as we got it going because , after all , he ’d seen a lot of guys like me but I had n’t had a chance to speak with someone like him in a while .
“ What do you think about Obama ’s plan for Afghanistan ? ” fell from his mouth easily enough after awhile .
“ I ’m not sure .
I do n’t know what we want to accomplish . ”
I did n’t let on much .
“ The people there , you know , they have had a lot of war . ”
“ I ’m sure they are weary of it by now . ”
“ They just want to defend their families .
The US goes in there and does nothing but shoot them , they will make more radicals .
They do n’t want to be told what to do . ”
He did n’t waste a lot of time getting to the heart of it .
I knew where this was going , and I listened carefully to what he had to say .
This was a man who came from a place that has been ripped apart by war longer than he ’s been alive , so he knows .
Somewhere along the line , he got out of the situation and found a way to keep his family safe here in the US .
He choose to come here , yes , but no one wants to be told what to do .
We got into Afghanistan a bit deeper and moved on to an excellent schooling in recent Somali history .
I enjoyed it immensely .
Long after I got where I was going the basic thrust of the conversation stayed with me .
This was n’t about revenge or geopolitics or Sharia Law or any of the things being talked about on the teevee nooze .
It was about people , generally just as stubborn as I am , who do n’t want to be shot at and told how they have to run their world .
I ’ve never been completely against war in Afghanistan because , after all , we were attacked .
The Taliban gleefully harbored the terrorists , and we cannot tolerate that situation .
Yet there ’s always been a small dissonant chorus in the back of my mind that tells me that , no matter how justified we feel , it ’s simply not enough .
What do we hope to accomplish through war ?
A democratic government would be a wonderful thing , but a nation like ours is not made by force from the outside .
A corrupt government , elected or not , is going to be hated and feared in wrenching turns of instability .
It may be possible , as I ’ve read , to have a comparable “ Peace Surge ” that builds infrastructure like dams across Himalayan rivers , irrigating the desert and providing electrical power to Pakistan for cash .
But if this is n’t what people really want in their lives , it ’s just another imposition from the outside , a casual disregard for their lives .
As much as we talk about our own goals in Afghanistan , a simple understanding of what the people of Afghanistan might possibly want , over the long haul , is what will make all the difference .
I ’m sure I do n’t know what that is , and I have yet to hear anyone on CNN tell me anything that sounds reasonable .
I doubt that our State Department knows what that is , either .
Perhaps the people of Afghanistan themselves have no idea – there may not be much room for anything called “ Afghanistan ” in the daily grind of surviving .
When any of us get into a situation that we have no prior understanding of , all we have is a sense of trust .
We can trust in a few ideas and principles , such as the basic goodness of people or the implied deal of the situation .
Real trust is formed through listening to each other and understanding common goals .
It ’s not a necessary part of hiring a cab , but it makes the ride more interesting .
When it comes to having a decent opinion about how we affect other people ’s lives , however , knowing their goals is as at least as important as our own .
Until I know them I ’m not convinced of anything .

A few months ago I was hanging out at the back of a fringe event at the Tory conference , bored and exhausted and frankly wondering whether I could justify going home , when Mike Penning said something that suddenly made me start listening .
Penning , a shadow health minister , casually mentioned that a Tory government would take from the poor and give to the rich .
He did n’t put it in those terms , of course .
But that , nonetheless , was the implication .
The government , he said , had done all sorts of iffy things to the formula that distributes money around the NHS .
They ’d over - emphasised poverty .
They ’d under - emphasised age .
They ’d done this for political reasons , to redirect cash to their own voters , and as a result a lot of sweet old ladies in nice , Tory constituencies were snuffing it with distressing speed .
The Tories would correct all that .
They ’d “ de- politicise ” that formula .
No longer would those old ladies have to die .
So I looked into this .
Yes , a press officer told me , this was actual policy .
It had featured in the party ’s published health plans since 2007 ( page 18 , paragraph 3.1.1 ) .
A couple of weeks later I interviewed another shadow health minister , Mark Simmonds , who ’s a terribly nice chap and who told me the following :
We need an independent body to ensure that the funding follows the requirements and needs of the patient .
There ’s a significant correlation between age and burden of disease .
What the current government have done is to deliberately over emphasise socio-economic deprivation .
Of course there are issues in relation to that and prevalence , so it needs to be taken into account , but they ’ve done this to transfer resources from rural areas to their urban heartlands .
Brilliant !
I thought .
Either a ) Labour have been inadvertently euthanising elderly Tories ; or b ) the Tories are openly planning to steal from the poor .
Either way , it ’s a story .
So I rang a bunch of people who knew more about this than me .
I developed a migraine as they tried to explain it to me .
And eventually I came to the conclusion that Labour were right , the Tories were wrong , and I wrote this for the New Statesman to argue just that .
Two weeks later , David Cameron announced plans for a “ health premium that targets resources on the poorest areas so we banish health inequalities to history . ”
This , of course , is exactly the kind of measure that Labour had already introduced for “ political reasons ” and that the Tories ’ revisions were intended to correct .
The Conservatives , too , would “ deliberately over emphasise socio- economic deprivation ” .
Cameron added : “ If the NHS is not working for the poorest in our society , then it ’s doing a poor job . ”
Those little old ladies can go stuff themselves .
I ’d love to think that my ace reporting single - handedly changed Tory policy .
( I ’d love it even more if you thought the same ) .
But that , sadly , seems vanishingly unlikely .
Instead , I see two possibilities .
Either , the party talked to the same experts I did and realized that their initial policy was bunk .
Or , they talked to some focus groups and realized their initial policy was an electoral liability .
I ’m not sure which .
But what I am sure of is that the Tories have done a bloody great u-turn , and they ’re hoping nobody ’s noticed .

Bob Emrich is the pastor of Emmanuel Baptist Bible Church in Plymouth , Maine .
He was also a campaign leader and spokesman for Stand for Marriage Maine , the organization primarily responsible for the passage of Question 1 which reversed the Maine Legislature ’s law enacting marriage equality .
Emrich was , in many ways , the voice and face of the anti-gay marriage movement in Maine .
When campaigning against equality for gay Mainers , Emrich tried to portray himself and his organization as being in favor of traditional marriage rather than being anti-gay .
Emrich said he has tried to keep the emphasis on marriage , rather than on “ homosexual behavior . ”
“ At some point , it ’s a personal , private matter , ” he said .
“ There ’s an obligation on all of us to try to warn and encourage each other away from destructive behaviors and toward healthy behaviors , but we ’re always going to debate what those are .
When it comes to public policy , that ’s not what this bill is regulating .
It ’s about something more than that . ”
But Emrich ’s “ personal , private ” comments may have only been for public consumption in Maine , and his real goals and desires may be something quite other than what he was willing to admit .
In fact , Emrich may well favor draconian laws that enact extreme civil punishment of gay men and women .
And Emrich is part of that previously - unknown but amazingly large collection of conservative evangelical Americans who have been investing time and effort in Uganda .
GoodAsYou.org has a copy of an email sent out yesterday by Emrich to those who share his religious and political views .
I have just recently returned from two weeks in Uganda , ministering the Word among village pastors and Churches .
It was a refreshing change of pace from the last year spent on the “ marriage referendum ” .
My trip to Uganda took me away from email , cell phones and the internet ( also from electricity , running water , etc. ) .
But I was able to see the Spirit of God working apart from the many distractions that we are faced with every day in Maine .
I visited almost 20 remote villages and spent time with the believers .
One of the common sentiments expressed there was that “ in order to have a healthy village , there must be a strong and healthy church ” .
That is one of the important lessons we have been learning here as well .
We will have more to say about that later .
But as I work my way back into ministry here at Emmanuel Bible Baptist Church ( Plymouth ) and with the Maine Jeremiah Project , I wanted to share the following article I found in Uganda\ ’s largest daily newspaper .
I had tucked it into my journal and found it yesterday as I reviewed some of my scribbling .
I think it speaks for itself , but I hope you will wonder , as I do , where our own culture lost its way .
The article in question is from New Vision which calls itself “ Uganda ’s leading website ” .
It rails against the West and in declining morals .
The most relevant part is :
One can now shamelessly stand up and tell you : “ I do as I please .
You have no business in my affairs . ”
A sodomist can now swear to you that what they do in the privacy of their bedroom does not concern the public .
No wonder when a brilliant MP comes up with a Bill against homosexuality , the human rights activists baptise him an enemy of the people .
It is high time politicians , religious leaders , cultural leaders and all concerned Africans woke up and defended the African heritage against the moral confusion of Western civilisation .
This civilisation is eroding African moral pride .
The so - called human rights activists have hijacked the driver\ ’s seat and are sending nations into the sea of permissiveness in which the Western world has already drowned .
Every evil that has penetrated our society comes disguised as a human right and is watered by a group of elites who have attained education in the West .
These elites have come back to impose on us practices that our forefathers deemed abominable .
Emrich wonders where our culture , the Western culture , “ lost its way ” .
There simply is no other possible interpretation than that Emrich extols the ideas in the article and wishes that the United States were more like Uganda in such matters .
Let me be clear .
It is virtually impossible that Bob Emrich is unaware of the nature of the Ugandan Kill Gays bill .
Surely no one who has any interest in Uganda could possibly have missed news coverage of the proposed death penalty for HIV positive gays , life sentences for others , and incarceration of their friends , family and acquaintances .
Yet , as incredible as it seems , Bob Emrich is suggesting that the West has lost its way and that Uganda has important lessons that we need to learn here .
I ’m finding it difficult to find any interpretation other than that Bob Emrich , the leader of the Yes on 1 Campaign , endorses recriminalization of homosexuality and may even support execution of gays .
So when they tell you that they do n’t hate you and that they are only trying to protect the traditional definition of marriage , remember Bob Emrich .

Strike three .
Obama ’s out .
Stop war ?
Nope .
Address climate change ?
Sorry no .
Reform health care ?
In the insurer ’s interest only .
I ’m hearing Obama ’s failure to deliver real health care being blamed on Americans themselves , for not building a movement to support it .
WTF .
In fact Dems are being asked to root for Obama ’s duplicitous health care legislation , or hinder the change - meister ’s momentum .
Momentum for what ?
Not one issue remains for which Democrats can claim to deliver America from the GOP .
Is n’t it time to uproot all incumbents and side with the majority of voters ?
Teabaggers can have their Palin , the Dems can sink their last hope in Obama , Americans need to claim the largest constituency of recent past elections , the independents .

First , the answers to the self quiz in Could Your Thoughts Be Criminal Part I . *
All statements , 1 - 10 , are examples of the criminal thinking patterns identified by the Minnesota Department of Corrections and the Hazelden Foundation in A New Direction : A Cognitive - Behavioral Treatment Curriculum .
Are you surprised ?
Statement number one ( 1 ) says : I tend to be a victim of the whims of others .
Friends , family , employers , and / or the government really created the mess I am in today .
This statement best reflects the researchers ' " Victim Stance " pattern of criminal thinking .
Individuals who take a victim stance tend to blame others for their problems and often fail to take responsibility for their own actions .
They may also create justifications for their behavior ( i.e . " I only cheated on my wife because I was hurting after she cheated on me " ) .
Failure to take ownership of their own choices stands in the way of viewing themselves in an objective light .
Statement number two ( 2 ) says : I 've done things in my life that others really look down upon me for , like , stealing , drug dealing or fighting , but I 'm still a really good person .
This statement best reflects the " Good Person " pattern of criminal thinking .
People who take this stance tend to ignore their negative behaviors when evaluating themselves ( i.e .
" So what if I lie a little on my taxes .
I only use that extra money to support my family and give them the lifestyle they enjoy .
They could n't ask for a better dad . ) .
Like the Victim Stance , this pattern stands in the way of positive change by obscuring objective self - evaluation .
Statement number three ( 3 ) says : I act tough , but even though I 'd never admit it , I 'm scared of being ‘ found out ' .
This statement is an illustration of the " of Exposure " pattern .
Individuals with this criminal thinking pattern tend to have low and be afraid of their real .
They may be very protective of their image and keep others at a distance .
Statement number four ( 4 ) says :
It does n't take a lot of hard work , time or effort to be successful .
I am really interested in ‘ get rich quick ' ideas .
This statement exemplifies the " Selective Effort " pattern of criminal thinking .
These individuals tend to be relatively lazy with little sense of responsibility .
The majority of their efforts are tied up in finding new ways to earn easy money .
They are not likely to engage in long - term plans or such as attending college or job training programs .
Statement number five ( 5 ) says :
No one knows what I have gone through .
I 've lived a tough life that has given me the experience to be better at things than others .
This statement best reflects the " Unique Person " pattern .
This criminal thinker believes that he or she is special and different from others .
They may also believe that the rules will not apply to them .
This pattern seems have some similarities with David Elkind 's theories on adolescent egocentrism particularly the ‘ personal fable ' ( I am unique ) and ‘ invincibility fable ' ( I am invincible ) , thereby suggesting an immaturity in the cognitions of this criminal thinker .
Statement number six ( 6 ) says : Rules and laws are made for other people .
I tend to have my own way of doing things .
This statement is another example of the " Unique Person " pattern of criminal thinking .
Statement number seven ( 7 ) says : People are always telling me that I should learn from my mistakes and plan for my future .
Not me , I live for today .
This statement best reflects the " Lack - of - time Perspective " pattern and those who use it tend not to learn from their mistakes .
Loved ones may become frustrated with them for their failure to see the big picture and their tendency to live in the moment .
They tend to be irresponsible and seemingly unaware of their true position in life ( i.e .
An unemployed woman with no job prospects purchases a new luxury car after her old car was repossessed . ) .
Statement number eight ( 8 ) says : Honestly , I like it when others are fearful of or intimidated by me .
It illustrates the criminal thinking pattern of " Using Power to Control . "
The researchers say that it is motivated by selfishness and may be used when the " Victim Stance " fails to get the individual what he or she wants from others .
They use intimidation , threats or even physical force to get what their way .
Provoking fear in others may raise their self - esteem and give them the sense that they are respected .
Statement number nine ( 9 ) says : I 'm a thrill seeker .
I live for excitement - responsibility is not for me .
This statement best illustrates the " Seek Excitement First " pattern of criminal thinking in which the individual 's first priority is to prevent boredom .
They tend to enjoy socializing and are hardly ever alone .
Like the " Lack - of time Perspective " and " Selective Effort " patterns of criminal thinking , this pattern shuns responsibility .
For these individuals , being responsible and planning for the future is considered boring and thus avoided .
Statement number ten ( 10 ) says : I tend to be possessive of my things and the people around me , but get upset when others do n't share their good fortunes with me .
This statement is an example of " Ownership Stance " and , according to the researchers , is a criminal thinking pattern where the individual has " one - way boundaries " in respect to his dealings with others .
This pattern suggests both entitlement and selfishness at the same time ( i.e .
A man expects his partner to treat him on dates and buy him gifts , yet refuses to return the favor . ) .

The Universe is a dangerous place .
But pop culture has played fast and loose with the facts , and often the things we know are all wrong , and when you 're dealing with the universe , ignorance can be deadly .
For the first time in years , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg finds himself governing New York City from a most unaccustomed vantage point : Vulnerability .
Ninety million dollars and a near - constant loop of negative commercials about his opponent later , the mayor ended election night in possession of a surprisingly modest margin of victory  far narrower than pollsters had predicted and with 100,000 fewer votes than he won in 2005 .
This could have profound implications for the tenor of a third Bloomberg term , not least that it is likely to hinder the mayor ’s well - honed ability to cow Democrats and liberal interest groups .
“ You ’re going to see Democrats lining up to run in 2013 , and they ’ll start next week , ” said George Arzt , a longtime campaign consultant who generally works for Democrats .
“ For a mayor who is very confident in himself , this is an earthquake . ”
The mayor often seems most comfortable working leader to leader , cultivating black ministers , community board leaders and the like .
He communicates with the broader public largely from an arm ’s length  with expensive television campaigns , handsome Web sites and the 311 community - service system .
What perhaps was missing all along , and what will be his challenge now , is to find a more tactile , emotional connection with New Yorkers .
On January 1 , 2009 , a US drone strike killed two senior al - Qaeda leaders , the first in what then President - elect Barack Obama had said would be a dramatic escalation of the aerial bombardment of Pakistan ’s tribal area .
And escalate it did .
The US launched 44 distinct drone strikes in Pakistan in 2009 , far more than in previous years .
The pinnacle of America ’s drone achievements was in August , when they killed Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) leader Baitullah Mehsud .
Much has been made of the successes , but while the strikes have been regular and they almost always are presented by Pakistan ’s intelligence community as having killed “ suspects , ” the actual successes are few and far between , with only five confirmed kills of real militant leaders , and a handful of unconfirmed claims that usually have n’t panned out .
The vast majority of the deaths , around 700 according to one estimate , have been innocent civilians .
With such a massive civilian toll and so little to show for it , it is no wonder that Pakistani people have been up in arms over the continued strikes .
But US officials have rarely commented on the drone strikes , except on those rare occasions when they actually kill someone meaningful , and seem completely ambivalent to the hundreds of innocent people killed in the meantime .
The ultimate example of this was June 22 - 23 .
On June 22 , the US struck at a house officials called a “ suspected militant hideout , ” burying a few locals inside .
When others rushed to the scene to rescue them , they launched another missile , killing 13 apparently innocent Pakistanis .
When they held a funeral procession on June 23 , the US hit that too , ostensibly on the belief that Baitullah Mehsud might be among the mourners .
He was n’t , but the attack killed at least 80 more people .
When announcing the December escalation into Afghanistan , President Obama reportedly also approved an escalation of drone strikes into Pakistan .
It seems unlikely that the intelligence has gotten any better , however , and civilians across North and South Waziristan are in an understandable panic .
Canonical , the company behind the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution , revealed today that it has established a revenue sharing agreement with Yahoo .
As part of the deal , the Firefox Web browser that is shipped in Ubuntu will be configured to use Yahoo as the default search engine .
Rick Spencer , the leader of Canonical 's desktop team , announced the search engine change today on a public Ubuntu mailing list .
The specific terms of the agreement have not been disclosed .
According to Spencer , the new default will appear in the development version of the distribution " as soon as reasonably possible " and will be in place in time for Ubuntu 10.04 , which is scheduled for release in April .
They have not indicated whether the change will be applied retroactively to existing installations of the current stable version , but they have confirmed that it will be changed for existing users who upgrade from the current stable version to 10.04 .
The change will encompass both the search provider in Firefox 's toolbar and the default start page .
Users will still be able to quickly change the default search service by clicking the search provider icon in Firefox and selecting the search service of their choice from the dropdown menu .
In order to make it easier for users to switch completely , Canonical is customizing the browser so that switching your default search provider will also change your start page if you have n't already set one .
Canonical is unusual among major commercial Linux distributors in the sense that it does n't sell an " enterprise " or " pro " version of its software .
In an effort to make this approach sustainable , Canonical is experimenting with a number of different business models , including commercial support for end users , subscription - based Web services , and integration support for hardware makers .
In the announcement about the search engine change , Spencer says that Canonical 's partnership with Yahoo will help to fund the ongoing development of the distribution .
" I am pursuing this change because Canonical has negotiated a revenue sharing deal with Yahoo ! and this revenue will help Canonical to provide developers and resources to continue the open development of Ubuntu and the Ubuntu Platform , " he wrote .
" This change will help provide these resources as well as continuing to respect our users ' default search across Firefox . "
Canonical currently gains a portion of the revenue from Google searches , so the change means that Yahoo offered a better deal .
Search partnerships have become increasingly common .
The development of Firefox itself is largely funded by Mozilla 's relationship with Google and other search providers .
Hardware vendor
Dell already ships
Yahoo as the default search engine in its Ubuntu - based systems due to its own revenue sharing deal with the search company .
It 's worth noting that Yahoo's data retention practices are more privacy - friendly than Google's .
Yahoo search records are anonymized after 90 days , a practice that will continue in the future .
Google , on the other hand , keeps the data for three times as long and has faced criticism for its allegedly inadequate anonymization .
The move has generated a bit of controversy among some Ubuntu enthusiasts who are concerned by the adoption of a default that does n't represent the general preference of a majority of the users .
In practice , the ease with which the default can be changed largely mitigates any potentially detrimental implications .
As long as Canonical 's efforts to monetize the desktop does n't escalate into the kind of crapware epidemic that has infected the major PC makers , it 's not going to be a problem .
Selling the default search seems like a fairly uninvasive and practical way for Canonical to boost its revenue , thus helping to ensure that the company can continue to provide its software to users at no cost .
The government should force illegal aliens out of the country , as an influx of foreigners will bring drugs and disease into Israel , Interior Minister Eli Yishai told Channel 2 Saturday evening .
" We will have , based on what the internal security minister said in the last discussion , hundreds of thousands of foreign workers coming in here with disease like hepatitis , tuberculosis , AIDS , drugs … , " he said .
" Would any one of Israel 's citizens agree to have a million or two and a half million Sudanese and refugees from Eritrea come in here ? " he said . " ' Does n’t it threaten the Zionist enterprise of the State of Israel ? "
Addressing the issue of expelling the children of illegal aliens , Yishai slammed their parents for " turning their children into a human shield . "
" My problem is not with the children , but rather , with those who will enter the country illegal , " he said .
" The children will be their insurance policy for staying here .
In 20 years people will be asking why we did n't enforce this law . "
Meanwhile , Knesset Member Nitzan Horowitz ( Meretz ) responded to Yishai 's words , harshly criticizing what he dubbed as racism .
" Eli Yishai is an archaic racist who failed in his job as interior minister , " Horowitz said .

The last time global negotiations collapsed like this was in Doha in 2001 .
After the trade talks fell apart , the World Trade Organisation assured delegates that there was nothing to fear : they would move to Mexico , where a deal would be done .
The negotiations ran into the sand of the Mexican resort of Cancun , never to re-emerge .
After eight years of dithering , nothing has been agreed .
When the climate talks in Copenhagen ended in failure , Yvo de Boer , the man in charge of the process , urged us not to worry : everything will be sorted out '' in Mexico one year from now ' ' .
Is Mexico the diplomatic equivalent of the Pacific garbage patch - the place where failed negotiations go to die ?
We can live without a new trade agreement ; we can't live without a new climate agreement .
One of the failings of the people who have tried to mobilise support for a climate treaty is that we have made the issue too complicated .
So here is the simplest summary I can produce of why this matters .
Human beings can live in a wider range of conditions than almost any other species .
But the climate of the past few thousand years has been amazingly kind to us .
It has enabled us to spread into almost all regions of the world and to grow into the favourable ecological circumstances it has created .
We enjoy the optimum conditions for supporting 7 billion people .
A shift in global temperature reduces the range of places that can sustain human life .
During the last ice age , humans were confined to low latitudes .
The difference in the average global temperature between now and then was 4 degrees .
Global warming will have the opposite effect , driving people into higher latitudes , principally as water supplies diminish .

I had this problem a lot as a kid .
I would frequently get some sort of glow - in - the - dark toy early in the day .
I would then spend hours going in and out of closets or under blankets to play with it .
I once got a new frisbee and was really excited to try it out but it was just turning dark outside .
Wound up with a bruise on my forehead that night .
There was one summer though where everything worked out perfectly when I got a glow - in - the - dark frisbee .
A British newspaper has named an Iranian woman shot dead during protests against her country 's disputed June elections as its " person of the year " .
The Times said Neda Agha -Soltan became a " global symbol of opposition to tyranny " after images of her bleeding to death during the protests in Tehran were shown around the world .
" Ms Soltan , 26 , joined the protest because she was outraged at the way that the regime stole the presidential election , " the newspaper said on its front page that included a photograph of protesters holding pictures of her .
" She wanted to make a difference , she said .
She had no idea quite what an impact she would have .
Mobile phone footage of her bleeding to death on a pavement flashed around the world .
" It tore the last shreds of legitimacy from the regime , made her a global symbol of opposition to tyranny , and inspired the Green Movement in a region where populations are all too easily cowed . "
The move risks angering Iranian hardliners who say Neda 's killing was " staged " to denigrate the regime , claiming there have been fabricated reports about the incident , including " widespread propaganda " by the foreign media .
Hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters poured into Iranian streets in week - long protests in June over the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , saying the vote was rigged .
The demonstrations were suppressed following a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who gave his strong backing to Ahmadinejad and warned the opposition against continued street protests .
The opposition movement has continued however to mount protests , with some members wearing the colour green in support of defeated rival presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Iran last month reportedly denounced Oxford University after one of its colleges set up a scholarship in honour of Neda , accusing it of joining a " politically motivated " campaign .

The Australian Christian Lobby has called for a review of the mandatory internet filter within three years to expand its scope beyond the ACMA blacklist .
Managing director Jim Wallace issued a statement claiming the Enex report had " proven the technological principle [ of filtering ] can be extended to deal with other harmful X and R- rated material on the internet .
" This is now clearly feasible and we need a review in three years that might test this in practice , particularly using third party providers of URLs , " Wallace said .
But in a question - and - answer session following the filtering announcement , Communications Minister Stephen Conroy has indicated the Government is unlikely to support such scope - creep .
" It would take a legislative amendment in the future to add any other content , " Conroy said .
" We 're not proposing it .
We 'll make it quite clear - this is as far as we 're going .
" So for people wanting to campaign on the basis that we 're going to maybe slip political content in - we will never support that .
" And if someone 's proposes that I will be on the floor of Parliament arguing against it . "
" Scaremongering " dismissed
Wallace also believed the report " disproved the scaremongering of the sex industry and Internet civil libertarians who claimed filtering would slow down the Internet by up to 87 percent .
" We welcome the clear establishment of the principle that the internet should not be ‘ a law unto itself ' when it comes to putting safeguards in place to protect children , as we do with movies and books , " Wallace said .
" We also welcome the Government 's provision of financial incentives to ISPs to provide their customers with optional filtering of pornography and other harmful materials not covered under the Government 's new scheme . "

Western food manufacturers are buying so little sustainable palm oil that the system set up to limit damage to tropical forests caused by the world 's cheapest vegetable oil is in danger of collapse .
Palm - oil producers say the industry may quit the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) because so few firms are financially backing the scheme .
Houshold products giant Unilever and the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) founded the RSPO seven years ago , to encourage producers of the oil , used in products such as biscuits and margarine , to minimise forest destruction , greenhouse gas emissions and loss of endangered wildlife , such as tigers and orangutans .
Palm oil is in hundreds of branded foods such as Kit Kat and Hovis and household products such as Dove soap and Persil washing powder .
The first certified RSPO supplies arrived in Europe in November 2008 , yet only 27 per cent of present supply has so been sold , leading to claims of hypocrisy among Western buyers .
Tesco , Asda , Morrisons , Procter & Gamble , Nestle , Allied Bakeries and even Unilever did not buy any separate certified RSPO oil last year , though Tesco and Asda " offset " small quantities by buying GreenPalm certificates for Rspo production elsewhere .
Only Sainsbury has bought significant quantities of RSPO oil separated from other sources , for 10 per cent of its range .
United Biscuits , Unilever , Waitrose aim to switch to a sustainable supply within two years .
Most companies have set a date of 2015 for converting their ranges , complaining that they cannot easily source certified sustainable supplies .
Dato ' Azhar Abdul Hamid , plantations managing director of the world 's biggest palm - oil producer , Sime Darby , said : " The rate of take up is very , very slow .
The industry is producing more supply of certified palm oil than the market is buying .
It 's disappointing to see that .
We were always hoping demand would always be ahead of supply , because that is what the world wanted .
More specifically , it was what Europe wanted . "
He rejected the suggestion , often made by UK manufacturers , that too little certificated oil was available .
" They claim to be interested , but they 're not doing it .
If the UK consumer insists on it , then whether the producers like it or not , they will have to make RSPO work . "
According to WWF , manufacturers bought 343,857 tonnes of RSPO oil last year , 27 per cent of the 1.27 million tonnes available .
A segregated supply costs about 10 per cent more but that is expected to fall a few per cent this year when New Britain Palm Oil opens an £ 18 m refinery in Liverpool capable of handling 150,000 tonnes of certified oil .
United Biscuits , which makes Jammie Dodgers and Jaffa Cakes , and the Italian chocolate company Ferrero have signed long - term contracts for the plant .
Others have not done so , yet .
New Britain estimates certifying the UK 's entire annual supply would cost 12 p per person .
Its , executive director , Alan Chaytor said : " We were the second company to be certified and we have only sold a few thousand tonnes but , in the end , you have to to have the infrastructure where you can deliver that [ certified oil ] to the customers who want it .
It 's going to take money , and commitment . "
Asda said : " Over the next 12 to 24 months , our own - label supply base will begin sourcing physically segregated RSPO palm oil .
As a result , our new stated target is to source all of our palm oil from RSPO sustainable sources by 2015 .
But clearly we hope to meet this target early . "
Tesco said : " To ensure we achieve our target of using 100 per cent certified sustainable palm oil by 2015 , we have issued all of our suppliers with a timeline and code of practice to achieve that target . "
Food Manufacture magazine quoted one supplier as saying : " We have had a chat about it but we have n't been told to do anything yet by Asda or Tesco . "
Palm - oil production has exploded in the past 10 years on the South - east Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra , providing work for one million people , but the expansion has a high environmental and human cost , destroying hundreds of square miles of virgin rainforest and displacing native people .
Now producers , having started to exhaust legally allowed concessions in Asia , want to plant oil palm in the tropical forests of West Africa and the Amazon .
Britain has become increasingly concerned about palm oil 's role in deforestation which causes 20 per of global emissions .
Planting of palm oil on cleared lowland peat forests in Indonesia released especially strong methane gas .
Hilary Benn , Secretary of State for the Environment , is tracking the quantity and use of palm oil in the UK .
" Even though solutions are often local , this is everyone 's business , because what happens in Indonesia , the Democratic Republic of Congo or Brazil does n't stay there , " he said .
" It affects us all . "

Marriage Discrimination Amendment Passes Senate , Heads to House
Ask Your State Representative to Reject SJR - 13
Indiana ’s Marriage Discrimination Amendment , Senate Joint Resolution 13 ( SJR - 13 ) authored by Senator Carlin Yoder passed the Indiana State Senate by a vote of 38 to 10today , Thursday , January 28 , 2010 .
Leading the Senate opposition to SJR - 13 , Senators Vi Simpson ( Bloomington ) and Tim Lanane ( Anderson ) stated clearly that the Marriage Discrimination Amendment threatens Indiana ’s economic recovery and distracts from the real issues facing Hoosiers .
The amendment will moves now to the House of Representatives where similar proposals – House Joint Resolutions 5 and 7 ( HJR - 5 & HJR - 7 ) were filed by Representatives Bill Davis and Eric Turner .
“ The Marriage Discrimination Amendment violates every Hoosier ’s basic right to fairness and equality .
It ’s just an attempt to distract Hoosiers from the greater issues facing Indiana , threatening our state ’s current and future economic development ” stated Indiana Equality Action President Randy Studt .
The Marriage Discrimination Amendment is being advocated by Advance America , the American Family Association of Indiana , and the Indiana Family Institute .
Even though Indiana has passed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1997 , a law that has been upheld by Indiana courts , these organizations continue to push for this unnecessary and discriminatory amendment .
Contact members of the House of Representatives today , asking them to reject SJR - 13 , the Marriage Discrimination Amendment .

Nine Lives by William Dalrymple
" Does travel writing have a future ? " William Dalrymple asked in the autumn , with his tongue dancing against his cheek .
The best travel books of 2009 – including his own Nine Lives – prove that the genre is alive and tripping , this year transporting readers between the planet 's coldest and hottest destinations , as well as from its spiritual birth to nuclear death .
Nine Lives , Dalrymple 's first travel book in a decade ( Bloomsbury , £ 20 ) , is a collection of short stories which explores how south Asia 's religious traditions are being affected by modernity .
He asks a temple dancer , " Is this a full - time job , becoming a god ? "
At a Bengali cremation ground – surrounded by naked sadhus playing cards - he enquires , " So how do you go about finding the right skull ? "
It 's a wise and rewarding book fizzing with Dalrymple 's signature erudition , solid opinion and lightness of touch .
Magnetic North by Sarah Wheeler
Sara Wheeler is a prolific raconteur of distant places and remote people .
Her sixth book The Magnetic North : Notes from the Arctic Circle ( Jonathan Cape , £ 20 ) tells a sweeping , magnetic story – part - history lesson , part - portent , part - elegy – of her lifelong passion for the frozen top of the world .
From Siberia to Nunavut she seeks out explorers , missionaries and death camp commissars .
At the same time she traces the looming ecological disaster : global warming melting the ice caps , Norilsk Nickel spewing two million tons of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere every year , Greenlanders ' marine - borne toxin diet rendering some of them radioactive .
" The survival of civilisation as we know it hangs on what happens in the Arctic , " writes Wheeler .
Her observations are occasionally poetic , often tragic and always wise and engaging .
Titian : The Last Days by Mark Hudson
These days many travel writers are keeping in step with our interactive times by collaborating with web gurus , photographers , game designers or – as in the case of Dalrymple – musicians , to create something new , and bring a more transformative experience to readers .
In this vein author Mark Hudson 's daughter was enlisted to record a plug for her dad 's new book Titian : The Last Days ( Bloomsbury , £ 20 ) .
" I think it 's boring but my Mum read it and she thought it was really interesting , " nine - year - old Rachel declares on YouTube .
Hudson is on a mission to find the " real " Titian , reclaiming the celebrated 16th - century painter from the foxed pages of scholarly tomes .
This is art history disguised as travel , a fascinating journey across northern Italy and into the Renaissance world with nothing boring about it .
With her eye on her father 's move into multimedia , young Rachel Hudson adds , " It would be cool if it was made into a movie . "
In Burma , Aung San Suu Kyi is once again under house arrest .
Earlier this year she was subjected to a sham trial , the purpose of which was to ensure that she 'll remain locked up until after the May 2010 elections .
So there 's no better time to read Guy Delisle 's heart - breaking comic masterpiece Burma Chronicles ( Jonathan Cape , £ 14.99 ) .
This graphic travelogue , which traces the artist 's time in Rangoon in whimsical , black - and - white drawings , is the most enlightening and insightful book on Burma in years .
Buy it , and begin to understand the cruelty , injustice and absurdity of life in that beautiful , betrayed land .
Delhi : adventures in a megacity by Sam Miller
Books on India are ten - a - rupee .
But in his wild , spiralling wonder of a book , Delhi : Adventures in a Megacity ( Jonathan Cape , £ 14.99 ) , Sam Miller has created the sharpest reflection of the capital since William Dalrymple 's City of Djinns .
" Delhi , the city of Sultanates and Mughals , of Djinns and Sufis , of poets and courtesans , is now also a city of cybercafés and shopping malls , of Metros and multiplexes , " enthuses Miller , a former BBC India correspondent .
" It is the past and it is the future .
It is also my home . "
Across his pages gyrate the Gandhi family , V.S. Naipaul , Sting and Tintin .
His vignettes of historical and contemporary figures are concise and impressionistic .
Read this book and laugh , grow and gaze in gob - smacked wonder at India 's whirling dreamtown – and its purgatory .
A Nuclear Family Vacation by Nathan Hodge and Sharon Weinberger
In the 50s and 60s , paranoia about nuclear attack led to fallout shelters being built across the US , Russia and Europe .
Thankfully nukes never rained from the skies and - ­ as the fear of all - out war has faded -­ nuclear tourism has mushroomed .
Today bus loads of retirees drop by America 's missile fields while the Bureau of Atomic Tourism guides travellers from the Manhattan Project to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial .
Step up to the launch pad husband - and - wife defence journalists Nathan Hodge and Sharon Weinberger .
Since 2005 their dispatches from battlezones and war rooms have been hugely popular on Slate .
Now their articles have been collected together with new material in A Nuclear Family Vacation ( Bloomsbury , £ 9.99 ) , a guide to " the unique culture and history of the nuclear complex " .
A Nuclear Family Vacation is not a book for the anxious traveller , not least because its authors found that nuclear labs and command posts are often surprisingly close to home .
Worries about holiday tummy bugs will pale into insignificance on learning that your hotel is targeted by a bunkerbuster .
But for the adventurous , ICBM - spotter , this is a readable and informative guide .
It 's also a wake - up call to an enduring , apocalyptic danger .
Our fear of " Mutual Assured Destruction " may have faded but the US military still spends the same amount on nuclear weapons ( in real terms ) as it did at the height of the cold war .

Anjem Choudhary and his band of publicity - seeking wimps backed out of the demo in Trafalgar Square in the face of up to three counter - demos .
Apparently some small alternative - demo was held in Walthamstow but no one has yet confirmed that .
Good thing the people from British Muslims for Secular Democracy and their friends turned up .
The English Defence League did not , apparently they were at a demo in Leeds , but the English Democrats did .
The latter were generally a nice bunch of people ( at least their spokesperson was ) .
Below are some pictures .

The people from English Democrats were adamant they had nothing to do with the English Defence League .
One said it was too infiltrated by BNP types for him .
The English Democrats said they were quite proud of the anti-Islamists demo and stood by them .
However , a little distance remained between the two groups .
I also did a short interview with the English Democrats spokesperson that I ’m uploading now .

Historian Howard Zinn has died at age 87 .
Zinn was best known for A People ’s History of the United States , which turned the glossy , textbook version of American history on its head by pointing out that far from being an unbroken chain of political and economic progress , our history was one of conflict along class , racial , and gender lines .
Though Zinn ’s radical , bottom - up approach cast aside the America - first tone of mainstream texts , it was still guided by a deep sense of commitment to what he saw as often - neglected American ideals .
As he wrote in 2004 , “ History , looked at under the surface , in the streets and on the farms , in GI barracks and trailer camps , in factories and offices , tells a different story .
Whenever injustices have been remedied , wars halted , women and blacks and Native Americans given their due , it has been because ‘ unimportant ’ people spoke up , organized , protested , and brought democracy alive . ”
Still in print after 30 years , A People ’s History has removed the scales from many an undergrad ’s eyes , and has won its fair share of famous admirers , from Viggo Mortensen to Matt Damon ( who name - dropped it in Good Will Hunting and just opened a stage adapation of it . )
For more of Zinn ’s recent writing and thinking , see this 2005 interview or his commencement address at Spelman College , where he was fired in 1963 for — amazingly — his civil rights activism .
If you ever wanted to know why Luigi is thinner than Mario or how he bears living in the shadow of his older brother , this exhaustively researched article over on Games Radar 's got you covered .

" Luigi : A life in the shadows " cover the other brother 's origins from palette swap to star of his own ( two ) video games .
Anybody else remember playing Mario is Missing ?
Yeah , that game starred Luigi .
Best bit ?
Right here ...
But Luigi 's heart has strayed at least once during the previously mentioned Mario & Luigi : Superstar Saga .
The Beanbean Kingdom the two stars explore has a prince to match the Mushroom Kingdom 's Princess Peach .
Prince Peasley is a dashing ( if self - absorbed ) pretty boy , who throughout the game slowly gains Luigi 's attention .
As time goes on , Luigi seems almost enamored with Peasley , blushing at his compliments and eventually trying to hug him , which Peasley deftly dodges , as Peasley seems to only love himself .
But this bi-curious side of Luigi has yet to return , as he 's since stayed pretty true to Daisy .
However , that has n't stopped the devs of the M&L series from continuing to ramp up Luigi 's effeminacy to Tingle levels of fab .

I totally did not know that .
I thought when Luigi was n't with Daisy , he was letting Peach cheat on Mario with him .
Also , I thought John Leguizamo and Samantha Mathis as the " ideal " Luigi / Daisy couple .

Onorevole Ministro Meloni ,
le scrivo in qualità di segretario dell ’ Unione degli Atei e degli Agnostici Razionalisti , l’associazione di promozione sociale riconosciuta dal ministero che difende i diritti di quei dieci milioni circa di cittadini italiani che non si riconoscono in alcuna religione o altra credenza nel sovrannaturale .
Ho avuto modo di leggere con dispiacere alcune sue dichiarazioni sulla presenza del crocifisso nelle aule scolastiche .
Avrebbe infatti consigliato a chi si « offende » per la presenza del simbolo cattolico « di prendere in considerazione l’idea di andare a vivere da qualche altra parte del mondo » .
Avrebbe altresì sostenuto di essere « stufa di vedere burocrati europei che stanno lì a sindacare se si possa appendere un crocifisso nelle scuole » .
Onorevole ministro , nessuno di noi si offende per la presenza del crocifisso nelle aule scolastiche .
Non sappiamo quanti cattolici si offenderebbero se trovassero , nelle aule scolastiche , il simbolo dell ’UAAR , ma sappiamo che sia il simbolo cattolico , sia il nostro , in un ’aula scolastica non ci devono stare .
Perché sono entrambi simboli di parte , e dunque inevitabilmente incapaci di rappresentare tutti i cittadini italiani : cattolici , atei , agnostici , cristiani non cattolici e credenti non cristiani .
La presenza del crocifisso contrasta con il supremo principio costituzionale della laicità dello Stato .
Costituisce inoltre un condizionamento particolarmente pesante nei confronti di minori : come recita la sentenza della Corte Europea dei Diritti dell ’ Uomo , « lo Stato è tenuto alla neutralità confessionale nel contesto dell ’educazione pubblica dove la presenza ai corsi è richiesta senza tener conto della religione » .
Onorevole ministro , criticando la sentenza della Corte di Strasburgo lei ha preso le distanze , contemporaneamente , dai valori espressi dalla Costituzione italiana e dalla Convenzione europea dei diritti dell ’ uomo : un documento che l ’Italia ha firmato come membro fondatore , e che lo Stato della Città del Vaticano non ha invece mai sottoscritto .
Posizioni come le sue non allontaneranno dall ’ Italia i non credenti : allontaneranno invece , ancor di più , l’Italia dall ’ Europa , perché la classe politica che la governa sembra incapace di far propri quei valori di civiltà , democrazia , laicità che contraddistinguono gli altri paesi del nostro continente .
Paesi dove i giudici non sono considerati « burocrati » , ma donne e uomini chiamati a proteggere quei fondamentali valori .
Paesi dove , e non per caso , il crocifisso non è quasi mai presente .
Confidiamo che lei si sia semplicemente espressa male , e che non pretenda pertanto di non rispettare i diritti umani .
Se invece quanto riportato dagli organi di stampa corrisponde al vero , le consigliamo di prendere a sua volta in considerazione l’idea di andare a vivere in una di quelle parti del mondo ( e sono purtroppo ancora tante ) in cui la loro negazione è moneta corrente .
Noi rispettiamo le idee e le credenze di tutti , ma chiediamo lo stesso rispetto da chi governa l’Italia e che dovrebbe , per primo , dare l’esempio .
Se chi governa l’Italia propone l’allontanamento dal resto della società di chi la pensa diversamente ( una misura che , come lei ben sa , in Italia non è più applicata dai tempi del fascismo ) allora , per coerenza , dovrebbe contemporaneamente chiedere l’uscita dell ’ Italia dall ’ Unione Europea .
Distinti saluti
Raffaele Carcano , segretario UAAR
FEW political promises are such tried and trusted crowd pleasers as the vow to get tough on crime .
But what is a politician to do when the crime rate is at a 30 - year low and both the rate and the severity of reported crime has been dropping ?
If you are Stephen Harper , Canada 's prime minister , you pledge to keep “ law - abiding Canadians and their families ” safe , and introduce a series of bills that will put more people in prison for longer and make it harder for convicts to win early release .
Fighting crime has been a priority for Mr Harper 's minority government ever since the Conservatives defeated the Liberals in 2006 .
A third of the 63 bills introduced in the House of Commons in the past year have dealt with some aspect of criminal justice , and more are on their way .
Despite complaints that a similar , purely punitive approach has not worked in the United States , and that piecemeal change will clog up the justice system and leave taxpayers with a larger bill , the government has not deviated .
Normally , a minority government might expect to be held in check by opposition in the House of Commons .
The opposition parties — the Liberals , the Bloc Québécois and the New Democrats — all disapprove of the Conservatives ' approach .
But none wants to be seen as soft on crime .
Liberal senators , who still control the upper house , have shown a bit more backbone , proposing amendments , only to give in when slammed for being an appointed body thwarting the will of an elected one .
The new legislation includes a measure to end the practice of crediting those serving jail terms with two days remission for every day spent in custody while awaiting trial or sentencing .
This was introduced when judges recognised that lengthy delays between arrest and trial were confining those unable to post bail in remand centres , where conditions are much harsher than in prison .
At the Senate 's hearings on the measure , criminal lawyers said ending the credit would turn routine bail hearings into mini-trials and cause lawyers to focus on getting clients in custody to trial , rather than those charged with more serious crimes who were free on bail .
The association representing Crown prosecutors made an unusual appearance to plead with senators to consider the effect the bill would have on the whole justice system which was “ at or well over capacity ” .
Senators reflected these concerns in proposed changes .
But these were then retracted under pressure from the government .
Each of the 13,000 inmates in federal prisons costs the government C$ 93,000 ( $ 89,000 ) a year .
Another 22,000 prisoners are in provincial jails , serving shorter sentences or on remand .
The government acknowledges that its crime bills , which also include some new offences , new mandatory minimum sentences and an end to house arrests , will cause the number of federal inmates to rise .
By how much is unclear .
The estimates are “ cabinet confidences ” , says Peter Van Loan , the public safety minister who is in charge of prisons .
He is working on plans to build new jails or to expand existing ones .
The lack of public debate on the get - tough policy is being interpreted by the government as a show of support .
“ We have made this a key part of our platform in the last three elections and we keep getting stronger every election , ” says Rob Nicholson , the justice minister .
“ Everywhere I go , people say ‘ you are on the right track ' . ”
The opposition , so supine on this issue , is clearly worried that in that judgment Mr Nicholson may be right .

A former handyman at two Portland apartment complexes was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison Monday for groping three young girls .
Delbert Ray Ross , 58 , handed out sweets at the apartment complexes where he worked , acquiring the nickname of the " candy man . "
In 2003 , he gave some candy to a 10 - year - old girl and grabbed her breasts .
In 2005 , he lifted up the shirt and squeezed the chest of another 10 - year - old girl , telling her she had nice breasts .
Around the same time , he rubbed the chest of a 12 - year - old girl .
Ross was convicted of three counts of first - degree sexual abuse in Multnomah County Circuit Court in October .
Monday , his attorney , Scott Raivio , asked Judge Michael Marcus to sentence his client to about six years in prison , the mandatory minimum under state law .
Raivio said a longer term would be excessive .
He also said that his client would only be able to receive sex offender treatment outside of prison , so incarcerating him beyond the minimum would n't put his client back on track toward recovery .
Prosecutor Nathan Vasquez asked for more than 18 years .
Vasquez said Ross was at high risk to re-offend .
A psychologist determined that Ross was unlikely to change .
" This was n't a one - time mistake , " Vasquez said .
" This was a repeated behavior . "
Ross worked as a maintenance man or apartment manager at the Morgan Place Apartments and the Emerald Park Apartments .
Ross declined to say anything , even after the judge asked him a second time if he'd like to speak .
During his trial , Ross claimed he was innocent .
He said one of the girls had placed his hand on her shoulder , he 'd tickled another girl and another girl 's story was n't true .
The victims and their families attended Ross ' sentencing hearing .
One girl stood up to say she had nightmares and was afraid to leave home after she was abused .
" Sometimes I would go to the pool with my friends and you would show up and I would be so freaked out I almost cried , " she said .
Vasquez spoke for the girl 's parents , because they were too angry to speak themselves , he said .

SBS claims that Crikey 's use of a content tag " the world game " on articles about soccer is a breach of its property rights .
Can an organisation really own such a common phrase ?
Who owns the phrase “ the world game ” , and what exactly does it mean ?
Crikey has received a legal threat from our No.2 public broadcaster , SBS , because it seems to think it owns the term :
In SBS ’s view your use of “ the world game ” on your website is an infringement of SBS ’s common law and registered rights .
SBS requires that you cease to use the Mark by no later than Friday December 11 2009 and reserves its rights to take any legal action it deems necessary should this not occur .
Now , it is true that SBS has a site branded “ The World Game ” which , they will be glad to know , comes up top of the pops with the first two entries in Google when you do a search on the relevant phrase .
It is also true that Crikey uses the world game as a content tag on its website , a tag that when clicked builds a modest topic aggregation page that dares to use the same phrase in a distinctly plain - wrap heading .
Needless to say , Crikey is nowhere to be seen on the first page of Google search results .
Other top search results for “ the world game ” phrase include computer gaming sites and the site of the Victorian Department of Planning and Community Development , which dares to use the phrase “ strengthening the world game ” to advertise a program of sporting grants .
So why is SBS getting so hot under the collar about Crikey ’s use of the phrase ?
SBS spokeswoman Jane McMillan provided the following short statement this morning :
Thanks for signing up
We look forward to seeing you bright and early with your need - to - know talking points and tidbits for the day ahead .

It ’s standard practice for an organisation to protect its trademarks and intellectual property .
SBS has a long association with The World Game across its broadcasting , online and retail operations and owns the registered trademark .
Crikey is using the trademark on a blog on its website and we have simply asked for it to be renamed .
So is Crikey in breach ?
Does SBS own the term “ the world game ” ?
A lawyer specialising in trademarks spoke to me this morning .
He does n’t think so .
First , most of the trademarks registered by SBS , including the plain word versions , are registered not for provision of media content , but for retailing of clothing , games , sports accessories and the like .
One relates to the selling of radio air time .
Under trademark law there is only a breach if use is for trade and commerce and “ deceptively similar ” or “ substantially identical ” to the registered mark .
The issue is whether the consumer is likely to be confused by the trademark .
Crikey using the phrase for media content is hardly likely to be confused with a trademark for sporting equipment .
Only one of the trademarks registered by SBS — number 1245378 — includes use for media content .
But , according to this expert , Crikey is still in the clear , because it is not using the phrase in trade or commerce .
On this reading , Crikey is the brand .
“ The World Game is just a topic heading , and no more a breach than if a set of articles about Coca - Cola were tagged or headed with the word Coke .
As for the trademarks SBS claims to have applied for , these include plain - word versions , and might be a problem for Crikey if they are registered .
But because the phrase is in common use , it is open to Crikey to oppose the registration .
But , as Crikey editor Sophie Black pointed out this morning , Crikey lacks the resources to do that kind of thing .
So could it be that the phrase “ the world game ” will be allowed to become the property of SBS ?
We ’ll keep you abreast of developments .

The decision must be taken early enough
Please turn on JavaScript .

Europe wants a decision in 2010 on an extension to the life of the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
At the moment , no programme for its use nor any funding has been put in place to support the platform beyond 2015 .
But the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) Director General , Jean - Jacques Dordain , told the BBC the uncertainty was undermining best use of the ISS .
He said he was persuaded of its worth , and expressed the desire to keep flying the station until at least 2020 .
Only by guaranteeing longevity would more scientists come forward to run experiments on the orbiting laboratory , he argued .
" I am convinced that stopping the station in 2015 would be a mistake because we cannot attract the best scientists if we are telling them today ' you are welcome on the space station but you 'd better be quick because in 2015 we close the shop ' , " he said .
The weightless environment on the station enables scientists to study systems and processes without the bias of gravity .
Already it is providing new insights into infectious and degenerative diseases , and is expected to return new knowledge in a host of other fields as well , such as materials science .
But scientists needed time to run their experiments , Mr Dordain said .
The ISS project is a partnership of five - the US , Russia , Europe , Japan and Canada .
Budget consideration
One of the biggest issues holding up an agreement on station - life extension is the human spaceflight review ordered by US President Barack Obama .
The Americans are developing a new vision for space exploration , and the rockets and spacecraft they will need to implement it .
The future of US participation in the ISS is intimately tied to the outcome of the review .
Mr Dordain said no one partner in the ISS project could unilaterally call an end to the platform .
A meeting would be held in Japan later in the year where he hoped the partners could get some clarity going forward .
" The decision must be taken early enough to put the budget in place , to build the hardware necessary and to decide on which transportation policy we shall use between 2015 and 2020 .
There are lot of aspects to be discussed and if decisions are not taken by the end of this year - beginning of next year - it will become more and more difficult to have the approach under which we will exploit the space station . "
Europe 's Columbus science module was attached to the ISS in 2008
Mr Dordain said it was also essential the benefits were increased and the costs were reduced .
Increasing the benefits could include finding new uses for the station .
Esa has called for ideas on how to use the ISS as a platform for Earth observation .
Mr Dordain said the agency had received about 20 very good proposals .
Tranquility will complete the non-Russian side of the ISS
On the issue of reducing costs , there were many ideas on the table , he explained .
" First of all , we have four control centres - one in Houston , one in Oberpfaffenhofen , one in Moscow and one in Tsukuba - and these four control centres are working 24 hours a day .
Question mark :
Why can't we use only two of them for 12 hours and then the other two for 12 hours ? "
He also questioned whether it was necessary for the station to be staffed by six astronauts at all times .
If there were periods when little maintenance was required or the experiment load was light , could the ISS run on a smaller crew , he suggested .
One way to reduce costs would be to bring in new partners outside the current five - something Mr Dordain is keen to see discussed .
Construction of the space station is due to finish this year .
Next month , two components built in Europe - a connecting node and a robotic control room - will be flown to the platform by the US shuttle Endeavour .
Tranquility and the Cupola , as they are known , will complete the non-Russian side of the ISS .
Some expected highlights for Europe in space in 2010 : FINISHING THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ( ISS )
In early February , Europe 's last major construction items for the space station head into orbit on the US shuttle Endeavour .
Tranquillity is a connecting node that will house much of the life support equipment on the ISS .
Attached to this module will be the Cupola , an observation room from where astronauts will direct robotic operations on the exterior of the station .
Europe has now produced more than half of the pressurised volume on the US side of the orbiting platform .
A SECOND CHANCE FOR CRYOSAT Cryosat - 2 will study the state of the planet 's ice cover After the successful launches last year of its Goce and Smos Earth observation satellites , Esa will look to place Cryosat - 2 in orbit .
This spacecraft is a re-build of the mission destroyed on lift - off in 2005 .
It will map the ice on the sea and on the land in the Arctic and the Antarctic .
Goce , Smos and Cryosat - 2 are part of the agency 's Earth Explorer programme , which seeks swift answers to issues of pressing environmental concern .
Mars 500 - A SIMULATED MISSION TO THE RED PLANET
There is sure to be a lot of interest in the progress of this project , which will see an international crew of six make a 520 - day round - trip to Mars .
They will not actually leave Earth ; they will be in a sealed facility in Moscow , Russia .
The idea of the project is to investigate the psychological and medical aspects of long - duration spaceflight .
The crew are all volunteers .
They will be split into two groups for a 30 - day period when a " surface expedition " takes place .
A NEW BEGINNING FOR THE VENERABLE SOYUZ
The Russian Soyuz rocket is scheduled to make its maiden flight from French Guiana in July .
Europe has helped construct a brand new launch facility for the vehicle at Sinnamary , just to the northwest of the established Kourou spaceport used by the Ariane 5 .
Soyuz will experience a 50 % increase in performance merely by launching from an equatorial location .
It will become a key player in the roll - out of Europe 's forthcoming sat - nav system , Galileo .
EUROPEAN ASTRONAUTS PLAY LEADING ROLES
Paulo Nespoli trains for his launch in a Soyuz capsule Esa 's astronaut corps has enjoyed plenty of flight opportunities in recent years , culminating in Belgian Frank de Winne being made commander of the space station in late 2009 .
Two Italians will fly the flag for Europe this year .
Paolo Nespoli will undertake a long - duration tour on the ISS , while Roberto Vittori will be on the penultimate shuttle flight .
Vittori's mission to the station will deliver a large physics experiment called the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer .
GALILEO - NEXT - GENERATION SAT-NAV
The first two In - Orbit Validation ( IOV ) spacecraft for Galileo are scheduled to launch on a Soyuz rocket from Sinnamary in November .
The IOVs ( two more will follow in 2011 ) will prove Europe 's satellite - navigation system works according to the design specification .
The four pathfinders will then be joined in orbit by further satellites , starting in 2012 .
The intention is to have an operational Galileo - albeit a partial network - up and running by early 2014 .
EUROPE'S SECOND SPACE TRUCK - JOHANNES KEPLER
The second Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) should fly towards the end of 2010 .
Named after Johannes Kepler , Esa 's space truck will transport about six tonnes of air , water , food , fuel and equipment to the ISS astronauts .
The freighter will also push the station higher into the sky to avoid the drag from residual air molecules at the top of the atmosphere .
Without this type of re-boost effort , the station would eventually fall back to Earth .
VEGA - A NEW CLASS OF EUROPEAN ROCKET
The maiden flight of Vega from the Kourou spaceport could be an end - of - year highlight for Esa .
This new rocket will be used for institutional payloads ( 300 - 2,000kg ) such as the Earth Explorers that currently ride into orbit on ex-Soviet , converted ICBMs .
Vega uses primarily solid propulsion and builds on the expertise developed for the side - mounted boosters of the Ariane 5 .
Vega 's first " passengers " will include a French physics experiment to test aspects of Einstein 's theory of general relativity .

The " phenomenon " has landed to bring relief to the dispossessed of Haiti .
John Travolta was in the pilot 's seat of his Boeing 707 flying in doctors , medical supplies , ready - to - eat military rations – and Scientology ministers .
Travolta 's visit – which the star called Operation Phenomenon – is not the first Scientologist trip to Haiti since the shattering earthquake a fortnight ago : there are already 150 members in Haiti , as well as 250 medical staff .
Soon the group hopes to have 400 of each in place .
" Our volunteers are coming from all over , " said Frank Suarez , one of dozens of yellow T - shirt - wearing members who have set up a camp at a gym in the capital , Port - au - Prince .
" The need is huge . "
Whatever the intentions of the volunteers , Travolta 's trip has reignited controversy over the management of supplies into the airport , and Scientology 's broader aims in Haiti .
Critics point out that while the actor was able to fly in 7,000lb of medical supplies , aid groups have been forced to wait because of congestion .
Médecins Sans Frontières say the priorities decided by US military controllers have led to deaths .
At least 800 relief planes are currently on the waiting list .
But Travolta was adamant about the trip yesterday .
With his actress wife , Kelly Preston , at his side , he said : " We have the ability to actually make a difference in Haiti , and I just can't see not using this plane to help . "
On the ground in Port - au - Prince , the situation remained desperate .
Hours before Travolta 's flying visit , a mini riot broke out in front of the collapsed presidential palace where food was being distributed .
The jostling 4,000 - strong crowd took no notice of the 18 Uruguayan UN peacekeepers waving pepper spray under their noses or firing rubber bullets into the air .
Asked why they were not trying to calm people by talking to them , one soldier cried : " Whatever we do , it does n't matter – they are animals . "
Medicine was not in much greater supply than food .
But a group of Scientologists working in the hospital courtyard shrugged off the shortages , saying they were healing patients through " the power of touch to reconnect nervous systems " .
Sylvie , a French woman , said : " We are trained as volunteer ministers , we use a process called ' assist ' to follow the nervous system to reconnect the main points . "
One 22 - year - old whose leg had been amputated , Oscar Elweels , received the touch treatment on his remaining damaged leg .
What did he know about Scientology ?
It was , he responded , a French charity .
Doctors were sceptical .
" I did n't know touching could heal gangrene , " one said .
L Ron Hubbard , founder of the group , once wrote about a technique called " casualty contact " , which sought to exploit disasters as recruiting opportunities , but warned his followers against portraying them as such to outsiders .
The Scientology spokeswoman Linda Hight said yesterday that such an attitude was unduly cynical .
" They 're definitely not there to talk about Scientology , " she said .
" The volunteer ministers have tremendous organisational skills , they haul water , they build latrines . "
' Casualty Contact ' : The Hubbard method
L Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology , said the following about recruiting followers in times of tragedy :
" Every day in the daily papers one discovers people who have been victimised ... [ The Scientologist ] should enter the presence of the person and give a nominal assist , leave his card which says where church services are held with the statement that a much fuller recovery is possible by coming to free services ...
Handling the press he should simply say that it is a mission of the church to assist those in need . "
February , 1956
" Casualty contact is very old , is almost never tried and is almost always roaringly successful ...
This is a pretty routine drill really .
You get permission to visit .
You go in and give patients a cheery smile .
You want to know if you can do anything for them , you give them a card and tell them to come around to your group ...
Your statement , ' the modern scientific church can cure things like that .
Come around and see ' will work .
It 's straight recruiting ! "
Women 's minds and genitals respond differently to sexual arousal , whereas in men , the responses of the body and mind are more in tune with each other , according to Assistant Professor Meredith Chivers , from Queen 's University in Kingston , Canada , and her international collaborators , Michael Seto , Martin Lalumière , Ellen Laan , and Teresa Grimbos .
Their meta - analysis1 of the extent of agreement between subjective ratings and physiological measures of sexual arousal in men and women is published online this week in Springer 's journal Archives of Sexual Behavior .
The human sexual response is a dynamic combination of cognitive , emotional and physiological processes .
Chivers and colleagues were interested in the degree to which an individual 's experience of sexual arousal mirrors physiological genital activity and whether gender difference in this agreement ( commonly reported in individual studies ) would be found when a meta- analysis of sexual psychophysiology studies was conducted .
The authors reviewed 134 studies , published between 1969 and 2007 , which measured the degree of agreement between subjective experiences of sexual arousal and physiological genital responses .
Overall , the studies reviewed data collected from over 2,500 women and 1,900 men .
Participants indicated how aroused they felt during or after they were exposed to a variety of sexual stimuli , called subjective arousal .
Researchers measured the physiological responses to the sexual stimuli using different methods , including changes in penile erection for men and changes in genital blood flow for women .
Men 's subjective and physiological measures of sexual arousal showed a greater degree of agreement than women's .
For the male participants , the subjective ratings more closely matched the physiological readings indicating that men's minds and genitals were in agreement .
For the women , however , the responses of the mind and genitals were not as closely matched as men's , suggesting a split between women 's bodies and minds .
The readings from the physiological measurements and their subjective ratings were , in some cases , significantly different .
The researchers then looked at factors in the studies that might shed some light on this gender difference .
They identified two methodological differences , in particular , that may play a role .
The type of sexual stimuli - their content and how it was presented e.g. visually or as an audio recording - made no difference to how well the subjective and physiological responses mirrored each other in men .
However , it did influence women 's responses .
Women exposed to a greater range and number of sexual stimuli - content and presentation - were more likely to have stronger agreement between subjective and physiological responses .
The timing of the assessment of self - reported sexual arousal also had an effect .
When participants were asked to rate their subjective arousal at the end of each stimulus , men 's responses were closer to one another than women's .
However , when both men and women were asked to rate their arousal whilst they were exposed to the stimulus , the gender difference disappeared because men's concordance dropped to the range of women's .
The authors conclude : " The assessment of sexual arousal in men and women informs theoretical studies of human sexuality and provides a method to assess and evaluate the treatment of sexual dysfunctions .
Understanding measures of arousal is , therefore , paramount to further theoretical and practical advances in the study of human sexuality .
Our results have implications for the assessment of sexual arousal , the nature of gender differences in sexual arousal , and models of sexual response . "

The full - text article is available to journalists as a pdf .
It 's not just bloggers who are upset about both the content and secrecy surrounding the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) ; the Swedish government is displeased , the European Union has concerns , and 1,700 European ISPs have now expressed their opposition to the process .
While the worst fears of the ACTA worriers have yet to be realized , there 's still plenty of opposition to a secretive treaty that attempts to push the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) on the rest of the world .
The US drafted the section of ACTA dealing with Internet copyright infringement and recently unveiled it to negotiating partners at a meeting in Seoul , South Korea .
The draft does not mandate " three strikes " Internet disconnection laws , nor does it propose to strip ISPs of their " intermediary " immunity from prosecution .
But it does push the DMCA 's anti-circumvention rules and " notice - and - takedown " provisions on the rest of the world , even going so far as to stop countries from making DRM interoperability laws ( requiring Apple to open its Fairplay DRM , for instance , so that content from iTunes could be used on other devices .
The European Union 's response to the ACTA draft has now predictably leaked , and it points out that this ban on interoperability rules goes against EU policy , which is that " compatibility and interoperability of the different systems should be encouraged . "
The response also notes that Internet disconnections are hugely controversial in Europe at the moment .
Although the ACTA draft would not mandate such rules , " three - strikes " laws are apparently cited in the document as one good example of how ISPs might be required to help out the content industries .
The fact that such important issues are being hashed out far from the prying eyes of legislators and constituents is also troubling to people like Sweden 's Communications Minister , �sa Torstensson , who is visiting Washington , DC this week .
According to the Swedish government , Torstensson will meet with people like FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski to talk about network neutrality , but also with a senior advisor to the US Trade Representative .
The topic ?
ACTA .
" �sa Torstensson will present the opinion that the negotiations process should be opened up , so that interested parties and groups are given the opportunity to submit more detailed opinions about the contents of the negotiations and draft documents , " says the release ( translation ) .
" She will also stress that Sweden cannot accept that ACTA opens up the possibility of a ' 3 - strikes and you ’re out ' policy of internet access termination for violators of intellectual property rights . "
EuroISPA , which represents 1,700 European Internet providers , has also issued a statement of concern ( PDF ) about the ACTA process .
" EuroISPA is concerned that the attempt to implement such measures through a trade agreement , rather than a conventional legislative process , will not allow the various stakeholders , such as European citizens ’ representatives , to enter the debate , " it said .
EuroISPA president Malcolm Hutty is also concerned that ACTA will pare away some ISP immunity and that it will strongly encourage Internet disconnections .
" Such heavy - handed measures would create a serious danger of undermining and restricting the open innovative space that lies at the very heart of the Internet ’s success , " he said .
" This agreement would have a negative impact on Internet users without having an appreciable impact on fighting illicit use of copyrighted material . "
ACTA negotiators have felt the pressure and continually pledge to open the debate to public participation — whenever there 's a draft text to be shown .
Negotiators have insisted for over a year that there 's simply nothing to show except lists of proposals , but that stance is harder to maintain now that drafts of ACTA 's main pillars have been produced and disseminated .
Saying that the public needs to wait until the draft has achieved basic consensus it exactly what ACTA critics do n't want to hear ; they want input early , not when the basic text has been settled .
The first GeForce GPU based on Nvidia 's next - gen Fermi architecture will make a showing at CES 2010 in Vegas next week , according to an update on Nvidia 's Facebook page .
Writes Nvidia :
Happy New Year to all GeForce Fans !!!
Oh , and there will be a sneak peek of GF100 at our booth at CES in Las Vegas next week .
Stop by and say hi !
Fermi reportedly crams in over 3 billion transistors ( the GeForce GTX 280 in my desktop PC has just 1.4b ) , supports Microsoft 's new DirectX 11 architecture , offers hardware support for ratcheting up the GPU voltage and " extreme " overclocking , does full hardware decode for 3D - based Blu-ray , and supports 32 x anti-aliasing ( today 's GPUs top out at 16 x ) .
Fermi was originally due in November , but Nvidia delayed production until 1Q 2010 ( rumor has it March or April for production parts at the earliest ) .
By comparison , AMD 's 5000 - series " Evergreen " DX11 part launched already last September , though availability has been limited due either to popularity , supply issues , or some combination of both .
What precisely will Nvidia be demonstrating at CES next week ?
No idea , but PC Games Hardware speculates it could be two Fermi cards running in SLI configuration .
Question is , has development kept up with the GPU cycle or lagged behind ?
The dual GTX 280s in my system coupled with a slightly overclocked 3.3GHz Intel i7 have yet to choke on anything whatsoever running at 1680 x 1050 with detail settings maxed .
Pick a game , any game , and my system utterly devours it .
For more up - to - the - minute blogs , stories , photos , and video from the nation 's largest consumer electronics show , check out PC World 's complete coverage of CES 2010 .

My cats lick me in the face with a disturbing frequency .
Â Why ?
Â I ’m not so sure .
Â I imagine it ’s a sign of affection , though I ’m not entirely unsure it is n’t a “ tasting ” before the feast .
Â
Whatever the case , I am wry enough to realize that those tongues , despite all the digestive juices in their mouths , are not as clean I ’d like .
Have you ever noticed that your cat will not eat the food that ’s been lying out for days , but has no problem sticking the toy mouse in its mouth that has been lying out for years ?
Â
It must be a strange trip through their minds .
One gray , frosty morning , our guards ordered those of us still capable of slave labor to line up and marched us out of the camp .
We were to be shunted westward , from Poland into Germany .
I was beside myself with excitement  and dread .
Salvation somehow seemed closer  yet we also knew that we could be killed at any moment .
The goal was to hang on a little longer .
I was almost 16 now , and I wanted to live .
We marched from camp to camp , day and night , until we and our torturers began to hear distant explosions that sounded like artillery fire .
One afternoon we were strafed by a squadron of Allied fighter planes that mistook our column for Wehrmacht troops .
As the Germans hit the dirt , their machine guns blazing in all directions , someone near me yelled , “ Run for it ! ” I kicked off my wooden clogs and sprinted into the forest .
There I hid , hungry and cold , for weeks , until I was discovered by a group of American soldiers .
The boys who brought me life were not much older than I .
They fed me , clothed me , made me a mascot of their regiment and gave me my first real taste of freedom .
Today , the last living survivors of the Holocaust are disappearing one by one .
Soon , history will speak about Auschwitz with the impersonal voice of researchers and novelists at best , and at worst in the malevolent register of revisionists and falsifiers who call the Nazi Final Solution a myth .
This process has already begun .
And it is why those of us who survived have a duty to transmit to humankind the memory of what we endured in body and soul , to tell our children that the fanaticism and violence that nearly destroyed our universe have the power to enflame theirs , too .
The fury of the Haitian earthquake , which has taken more than 200,000 lives , teaches us how cruel nature can be to man .
The Holocaust , which destroyed a people , teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man when he loses his moral compass and his reason .
After so much death , a groundswell of compassion and solidarity for victims  all victims , whether from natural disasters , racial hatred , religious intolerance or terrorism  occasionally manifests itself , as it has in recent days .
Below we have broken downs several key areas that players in the United States need to be aware of before joining an online poker site .
Knowing what you are getting into before doing it is always going to help no matter what you , playing online poker included .
Options For US Players To Deposit Into Online Poker Sites
Poker deposit methods that work for U.S. players that are commonly available at various online poker sites where Americans are allowed to sign up and play .
Not all deposit methods that are listed at a poker site will be available for players in the U.S. which is why it is important to know which methods are available to you , which we have listed below .
These options will not be available all together at every site but you will find at least one of these in the cashier at the poker room you choose .
Keep reading on and see which method will work best for you .
VISA - Players that use VISA are using the most commonly accepted form of major credit card accepted at US online poker sites , and it makes depositing extremely easy when it works ..

Checks / Money Orders - Personal checks are typically not accepted at online poker rooms , however some poker sites do accept them but more commonly money orders are preferred .
USA Online Poker Payouts & Withdrawal Options
Because having money in a poker account without having access to actually use that money is useless , you have got to know the viable ways to withdrawal money from online poker accounts .
This probably one of the biggest obstacles facing American players and we 're going to break them down below .
These methods are the ones that most USA players turn to because frankly they are all that are offered by online poker websites that allow Americans to play .
While each has their own merits , you should know which one is going to work best for you and then find the poker room that offers that method .
Checks / Money Orders - Americans turn to receiving a check or money order through the mail when getting funds out of online poker accounts .
Normally using this method gives real - money players an option to get all the funds out their account thanks to the high withdrawal limits in place .

Wire Transfer - Generally viewed as a last resort , withdrawals via wire transfers can cost a bit more to process but they do show up pretty quickly and are guaranteed to work .
Plus , wire transfer payouts can be collected as cash which can then be spent anywhere that accepts American currency .

Bank Wires -
Much the same way you can send funds from your bank account to fund online poker , you can have funds sent back to your bank account from poker websites .
Bank wires require time to get setup but once everything is in place , users rarely have to seek other ways to get paid by poker rooms .
Poker Bonuses For U.S. Players
Online poker rooms are , in some ways , much better than land based poker rooms and it is partially due to the fact that you can play whenever you please .
Also , because of the online poker bonuses , Americans can extend their playing time just for making a simple deposit into their account for the first time .
Most online poker rooms will give bonuses of free money to all players making a deposit into their accounts matched at a percentage of your initial deposit .
These are one of the most fair bonuses available to any online gambling site , as they are released as you place bets , rather than at the end of the deposit or after you have made a total amount of bets .
Since the money is dispersed as you continue to play , you will gradually receive additional money as you go .
This works best in ring games but can also be accomplished by playing in tournaments .
Legal Online Poker Games
Poker is one of the most beloved games of all time , and there are several variations of it .
Texas
Hold 'em is not surprisingly one of the most popular online poker games , and for the simple reason that it 's easy to learn .
Not to say that you can be a master in minutes because truly mastering any poker game takes years , however it does only take minutes to learn and is extremely fun to play .
Some of the other popular poker variants are Stud and Omaha , which are also rather easy to learn .
The top online poker rooms we have listed for you here offer several different poker variants for players to choose from , and you can try them out in free mode before betting real money on them .

With the Senate ’s 60 - 39 vote to proceed to debate , after Thanksgiving , on a healthcare bill that the president is seeking by year ’s end , the debate of the 2010 midterm elections has been joined .
Democrats , in control of the White House and Congress , will present the congressional elections as a question of fulfilling an agenda of progress and change and keeping “ the party of no , ” the intransigent GOP , in check .
Republicans will frame the midterms as a chance to reclaim at least part of Congress from a party trying to take over not just healthcare and imposing big government , big spending and taxation on every aspect of life -- “ socialization , ” a leading Republican senator calls it .
If President Barack Obama is unable to sign a healthcare overhaul into law by the midterm vote , the GOP will be painting a picture of a president unable to work his will with his own party in control .
If there is healthcare reform and more to present at the polls in 2010 , the GOP will be cast by the people in power as an obstructionist , no-solution party .
Consider the words of the Florida Democratic Party , where one of the signal Senate campaigns is playing out : A 2010 contest featuring a popular Republican governor , Charlie Crist , whose own party is challenging him for siding with President Obama on the first of the White House ’s spending sprees , the economic stimulus .
Democrats weighed in with this volley for interim Sen.
George LeMieux , who was appointed to office by Crist and on Saturday was among the 39 Republicans voting against debating the healthcare bill .
“ Instead of standing with his constituents , Sen. LeMieux has decided to stand with the Republican ‘ Party of NO , ’ which is offering no real alternatives and no real solutions , ” the Democrats wrote in an overnight e-mail to their forces in Florida .
“ Sen. LeMieux ’s unwillingness to even discuss the issue of health insurance in our country -- which has been on the minds of Floridians for many years -- shows that neither he nor Gov. Charlie Crist are interested in fixing our broken health insurance system and are only interested in seeing Democrats and President Obama fail . ”
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele also foreshadowed next year ’s election season in his response to Saturday ’s Senate vote , in which all the Republicans but the absent Sen.
George Voinovich of Ohio voted against taking the healthcare bill to debate -- just as all the House ’s Republicans , except for Rep. Joseph Cao of New Orleans , voted against the House health bill .
“ Make no mistake : this was not a free vote , ” Steele said .
“ A vote in favor of this procedural motion paves the way for the bill ’s final adoption , which would impose a government - run healthcare experiment on America that increases premiums , increases taxes , cuts Medicare and allows for taxpayer - funded abortions .
“ President Obama , [ Senate Majority Leader ]
Harry Reid and their liberal Senate allies will surely gloat and pat themselves on the back for winning tonight ’s vote in the dark of night during a rare Saturday session , while Americans were home with their families , ” Steele said .
“ But as they do , those moderate Democrats who voted for Harry Reid ’s bill will have to answer to their constituents . ”
That means in November 2010 .
Reid ’s own words to the Senate had the sound of campaign oratory .
“ It ’s clear by now that my Republican colleagues have no problem talking about healthcare in press conferences or television interviews or town halls , ” said Reid , D - Nev .
“ Yet now that we have actual legislation to debate , to amend and to build on -- now that we have words on paper and not just wild rumors -- will they refuse to debate ?
“ After all , if we are not debating -- if we refuse to let the Senate do its job -- what are we doing here ?
If senators refuse to debate about a profound crisis affecting every single citizen , the nation must ask : in whose interest do you vote ?...
“ My Republican friends , there is nothing to fear in debate , ” Reid said .
“ Be not afraid of debate .
It is our job , and it is exactly what the legislative process is all about : discussing , amending , improving .
We Democrats stand ready to do what needs to be done .
We welcome debate .
We encourage it . ”
Afterword , Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas pushed this e-mail out to his party ’s supporters overnight :
“ No matter what the Democrats may try to tell you , this is a bill that will increase taxes , cut Medicare and use fancy accounting tricks to hide its true cost .
The American people deserve better and Senate Republicans and our supporters continue to be the only thing standing between Democrats and the socialization of the American healthcare system .
“ We cannot allow Washington bureaucrats to take control of our healthcare system . ”

T - LK - M-T- can become talkamata , or tolkimato , or tulkometi , or any one of 625 different words with that consonant pattern .
Once the word is selected and added to the lexicon the template is discarded , never to be used again .
Thus every core word in the lexicon has a unique consonant pattern , and no matter how the pronunciation of the vowels change with accent , the identity of the word remains the same , because there is only one possible word with that template .
Thus the lexicon has a built - in tolerance for different accents , and a sort of checksum error correcting feature that preserves the meaning of the word even under extreme distortions of the vowel sounds within it .
It is , therefore , indifferent to , or at least very tolerant of accents .
Using a conservative set of 30 intial consonants and consonant clusters , 30 final consonants or clusters , and 30 medial consonants or clusters , the number of templates for words of three syllables or less exceeds a hundred thousand , with over three million words of four or fewer syllables .
A hundred thousand core words of three or fewer syllables ( each with a completely unique consonant pattern ) seems adequate .

Confused about what Islam is ?
Join the party – it seems Google can't figure it out either .
Or , at least its search suggestion program can't .
If you type , " Buddhism is " or " Christianity is , " Google will quickly show you suggestions for what it thinks you might be trying to type .
In the former query 's case , the Google guesses " not a religion , " " wrong , " " not what you think . "
Christianity gets tougher treatment with the suggestions " bullshit " and " not a religion . "
But the query " Islam is " ?
Not a thing comes to mind for Google to suggest .
( Search results are still there , of course . )
It 's enough to get some to conclude Google is censoring itself , perhaps as a result of complaints for suggestions that one guesses are just as flattering as those for other faiths .
But Google says it 's just a software problem .
" This is a bug and we 're working to fix it as quickly as we can , " a Google spokesman told Wired.com .
The suggestion feature relies on your previous searches and searches from users globally .
Google says it filters out " pornographic terms , dirty words , and hate and violence terms . "
That means it 's most likely someone at Google got a complaint , added the phrase to a list of skip words , like f**K , seeing the results as hate and violence – perhaps without even looking at suggestions for other religions .
So , " What is the ' Islam is ' " thing ?
We suggest " a bug , " an " affront , " " censorship , " " an attempt at international relations by a large , profit - driven advertising company , " or a " feature , " depending on your politics , religion or employer .

Today I stumbled across a Facebook page entitled “ There ’s a perfectly good path right next to the road you stupid cyclist ” .
Cyclist hate groups on Facebook are common , but this one in particular is more distasteful than others I have come across because it boasts more than 31,000 fans , and it in no uncertain terms explicitly promotes the murder of cyclists for simply being on the road .
The description for the group reads :
No matter how far to the left you are , you ’re taking up my road .
My car is hard , and i am not slowing down !
Status updates include messages such as “ saw a cyclist stack it today ! ” ( Nov 29th ) , with 396 people who like it , and 116 comments , including the following :
Carly Foster – epic fail .
Thats so funny Kristen Hawkins – yayyy !!!!
stupid cyclists ill run them over !

How is Possible the hack of original Ms OS series codes ?
Thanks .
Earlier this week I received an email from Ilene at Phil 's Stock World about her interview with a Commercial Real Estate Developer .
Ilene writes " Hi Mish , I thought you might find this interesting , and perhaps want to use some or all of it .
I know my interviewee well , and his thoughts in this area have been consistently correct . "
With that backdrop here are a few excerpts from Interview with a Commercial Real Estate Developer about the CRE Industry .
Mr. Solomon ( name changed ) is a CRE veteran with 40 years of experience developing commercial real estate in 15 states and has kindly agreed to be interviewed about the current conditions in the CRE market .
Ilene :
What are you seeing in the CRE market now ?
Mr. Solomon : CRE is undergoing deleveraging with the rest of the economy , debts are being reduced or going into default .
Large numbers of projects are not cash flowing and will have to be liquidated , or ownership will have to be transferred .
Concurrently , there ’s an oversupply caused by the same ill advised financing that led to the overbuilding .
Ilene :
How far into the decline are we now ?
Mr. Solomon : So far about 25 % .
A lot has been recognized .
And it ’s no longer a surprise .
Some properties have already been foreclosed out .
There are a lot of vacancies .
I think a further substantial group of commercial properties will get foreclosed .
I do n’t see it leveling off for another few years because of the problems of contraction , debt , and oversupply .
Oversupply in real estate does n’t get worked off , the buildings have to be used .
Less consumption and less business mean less demand .
Creative financing , excessive easy money caused the oversupply , caused hyped up prices .
Now there ’s less demand , less employment , less consumption , and on top of that , the excess debt still has to be paid off – there ’s more deleveraging coming .
There are probably many years of value declines ahead .
Ilene :
Do you think the recession is over ?
Mr. Solomon :
No , we will be in it for a number of years .
Assuming the GDP is up in the short term , it does n’t matter .
It ’s due to more debt expansion .
The real world debt must eventually decline .
It ’s a government induced blimp that cannot go on , it ’s not sustainable .
Ilene :
Are there any areas where you would be building now ?
Mr. Solomon : Regions will do better in the lower tax states that are less unionized , with less government regulation , for example Texas .
Ilene : I know many of your projects are in CA , how is that state doing ?
Mr. Solomon : The California government is dysfunctional , too little revenue and too much expenditure .
Compared to WA , there are more people , more speculation , more bureaucracies , and now more contraction .
CA also has extra political risks , the state is bankrupt .
The U.S. is also bankrupt .
If there were no restrictions due to traveling and language , many people would be going elsewhere .
All things being equal , I ’d be building where opportunity is greatest , taxes are lower , and there ’s less regulation .
I ’d be more apt to buy something in TX because the economy is stronger than in CA , there is less regulation , no income taxes and the budget is better balanced .
Ilene :
Does it matter that we ’re bankrupt ?
Mr. Solomon :
We seem to be functioning as though we ’re not .
There ’s no question that only two trillion of revenue can’t service $ 100 trillion of debt .
It ’s pretty clear that there ’s a major problem .
Ilene :
In your business , would you be hiring people any time soon ?
Mr. Solomon : No hiring .
Due to the economy and health care issues , we ’re not hiring anyone .
Hiring is a liability , might be taking on a life - long obligation .
We prefer to be firing now , decreasing the number of employees .
“ Jersey Shore , ” a recent addition to MTV ’s fine family of reality shows , resembles the network ’s pioneering series “ The Real World , ” which is now almost twenty years old — a human chemistry experiment with explosions guaranteed .
In both shows , a group of carefully , cannily chosen people with big personalities — or personality disorders — are thrown together to live for a period of time with few obligations and all kinds of ways to create a lifetime of regrets , not least for viewers .
The logo of these shows might be one of those large red plastic cups used for beer ( and beer pong ) at frat parties , and in evidence in many teen - agers ’
Facebook photos , signalling the overflow of alcohol and expectations that happens at large gatherings and the nausea that often results the next day , triggered partly by the fact that someone caught it all on camera .
In “ Jersey Shore , ” which takes place in the scruffy resort town of Seaside Heights , about a quarter of the way down New Jersey ’s coastline , the explosions began even before the show premièred , in early December .
Promos showing a group of young men and women of Italian heritage making entertainingly ridiculous statements about themselves and whooping it up on the boardwalk at night — dancing , throwing punches , that kind of thing — advertised “ Jersey Shore ” as set in a “ house like you ’ve never seen , full of the hottest , tannest , craziest Guidos , ” and Italian - American groups , and eventually New Jersey tourism officials , protested and some of them called for MTV to cancel the series .
Despite such dreamy free publicity , the first episode did n’t get good ratings .
But a sneak preview that ran at the end of the episode showed one of the women in the house being punched by a drunken galoot at a bar , locking in more controversy and more viewers — fifty per cent more , in fact , for the second episode .
“ Jersey Shore ” makes us feel as though we were anthropologists secretly observing a new tribe through a break in the trees .
Illustration By Steve Brodner
This is where I say , “ MTV had a situation on its hands , ” and people who have seen the show chuckle or groan , because they get the joke .
One of the cast members , Mike , a voluble , occasionally charming Staten Islander ( only one of the eight housemates is originally from New Jersey — go figure ) , is so proud of his gym - cut abdominals that he calls them The Situation .
The nickname , he explained on the “ Tonight Show , ” came from an incident in a club when a couple walked by him and the woman was so captivated by his abs that she pointed at them .
Mike ’s friends said to him , “ Dude , that ’s a situation right there . ”
“ And I said , ‘ Yeah , I guess that is a situation , ’ and it stuck . ”
We both do and do n’t know what he means — I take it to mean that his abs have magnetic qualities and that his mere appearance in a room can have tectonic consequences .
In fact , Mike has synecdochically enlarged that concept to denote his entire being :
The Situation is n’t only what he calls his abs ; it ’s also his nickname for himself .
“ I just have unbelievable mass appeal , ” he tells the camera in the second episode , though we ’ve seen by then that his appeal is rather more of the niche kind .
Our ability to take any pleasure , or even interest , in shows like this — in which participants are depicted as energetic but essentially aimless , oblivious of their own deficits , and delusional about their attractiveness and their importance in the world — hinges not on our ability to identify with them but on our ability to distinguish ourselves from them .
Unless the show manages to make us feel as though we were anthropologists secretly observing a new tribe through a break in the trees , it has n’t done its job .
MTV has succeeded on that score ; it can give itself a pat on the back for enabling viewers to feel superior to at least eight other people .
( Then it can stop patting itself and slap its forehead for not having realized that nobody says “ Jersey Shore , ” and that the title should have been “ The Jersey Shore ” or “ The Shore . ”
And then it can go buy a dictionary and figure out what ’s wrong with the following line , which appeared on the screen during the second episode , as a subtitle for what a doctor is saying to one of the housemates , who has pinkeye : “ You can see where all the puss is forming . ” )
And yet we never have to feel any guilt over our condescension , because it ’s so obvious that the cast members are in on the joke , too .
They embrace their “ Guido ” identity , and insist that you do n’t even have to be Italian to be a Guido or — the word for the female of the species — a Guidette .
( Not all of the housemates are of Italian background , as it happens . )
In any case , it ’s something they ’re proud of .
Mike says that “ girls love Guidos . ”
Pauly D , a d.j. from Rhode Island with an awesome straight - up hairdo that , according to him , takes about twenty - five minutes to perfect , says , “ I was born and raised a Guido ; it ’s just a life style , it ’s being Italian , it ’s representing family , friends , tannin ’ , gel , everything . ”
Like all reality - show participants , Pauly D , The Situation , and the others speak in categorical certainties .
They know things for sure , then those things blow up in their faces , then they hate those things and take about three seconds to find new things to believe in .
The series is full of lines like : “ My ideal man would be Italian , dark , muscles , juicehead , Guido .
If I found that guy , I ’d snatch him like that ” ; “ I am the Kim Kardashian of Staten Island , baby ! ” ; “ My only rule : Never fall in love at the Jersey Shore .
Never .
Ever ever ever ” ; and “ I am the fucking princess of fucking Poughkeepsie . ”
( The modifiers for “ princess ” and “ Poughkeepsie ” are bleeped , but there ’s no doubt about what ’s being said .
There ’s more swearing on TV these days than there used to be , and , at the same time , the length of the bleeps has been reduced , giving us a clear aural outline of the words to assist us in our lip reading .
Like pasties in a burlesque show or thong underwear , bleeps are a saucy wink at the rules . )
One housemate ’s characterization of her own mating habits has become a viewer favorite , and it ’s repeated during the credits of every episode : “ I am like a praying mantis — after I have sex with a guy , I will rip their heads off . ”
Snooki , the princess of Poughkeepsie , is a tiny and very peculiar twenty - two - year - old who is out of control in so many ways ( she had the distinction of being the first housemate to overdrink and then vomit ; that happened within the first twenty - four hours ) that she ’s doomed to have her own show one day .
And that ’s what she ’s angling for .
She has already come up with a title : “ Snookin ’ for Love , ” as she said to Conan O’Brien .
Snooki ( her real name is Nicole ) is the woman who is punched in the face by a guy in a bar ; it ’s an ugly scene , and MTV has milked it with cool proficiency .
But we ca n’t hold MTV responsible for Snooki ’s signature hair pouf — that ’s all Snooki ’s doing .
It ’s quite a situation .
Who knows how many hours of dull footage had to be thrown away in order to get such gems ?
Many hundreds , I ’m guessing ; even the biggest narcissist needs coaching when it comes to appearing on camera .
But , to a great extent , the people on the show seem to have neither underpacked nor overpacked their crazy suitcases .
They knew , instinctively or consciously , what to bring : a little swearing , a little temper , a need for attention , a large bottle of immodesty , and the ability to deliver a sound bite .
This makes them fascinating , though no more so than any of the other reality - show characters we ’ve come to know in the past ten years .
( Yes , my friends , it will be ten years this summer since nearly sixty million of us watched wily Richard Hatch , the first reality - show contestant to become a household name , win the million - dollar prize in the first season of “ Survivor . ”
And guess where I was that August evening ?
In a bleeping summer rental at the Jersey bleeping Shore , and that ’s a legit bleeping fact . )
We ’re so aware of the drag on people who go on TV now : they ’re pulling several decades of popular culture behind them .
The “ Jersey Shore ” housemates have a particularly heavy load , consisting of all the attitudes , looks , poses , burdens , and aromas of Italian - American culture , from “ The Sopranos ” back to Sinatra and including “ Grease ” and the Fonz and “ Goodfellas . ”
Silvio , Tony Soprano ’s consigliere , was known among the gang for his imitation of Al Pacino in “ The Godfather : Part III ” ; it was a case of an Italian - American TV writer giving a fictional gangster lines that came from a real movie that was a sequel to a movie that was based on a novel that was based on real people .
Then there are the further Garden State echoes .
Steven Van Zandt , who played Silvio , grew up in New Jersey and is in Bruce Springsteen ’s band — a band that was shaped by the Jersey Shore and is now its proudest product .
So “ Jersey Shore ” is itself an amusement on the boardwalk at Seaside Heights , a Ferris wheel of quotation marks , and yet it really is n’t fun to watch .
It just goes around and around .
A little digging into the concept of Guidoism brought me to an amateur documentary on YouTube .
Shot last year somewhere on the Jersey Shore , it told me in less than seven minutes more about Mondo Guido than five episodes of “ Jersey Shore ” have .
Even now , I know almost nothing about Mike , Pauly D , Snooki , and the rest of them .
They ’re a wearying bunch , who somehow became notorious in less than a month ’s time , showing up on talk shows , appearing in Times Square on New Year ’s Eve , and — more quotation marks — making a video in which they pretend that they ’re proper actors who are merely playing Guido roles .
On the show , they do n’t do anything except sleep and party and drink and hook up and spend quality time with their hair .
They ’re a few minutes ’ walk from the ocean , yet we ’ve never seen them go swimming — they just slop around in their rooftop Jacuzzi , whose presence is so central to the men ’s seduction rituals that it ’s practically a character in the show .
As such , it fits right in , being both of Italian - American descent and an embarrassing reality - show cliché . ♦
A Russian journalist who was thrown into a Siberian drunk tank and savagely beaten by a young police officer died Wednesday , in a case that has sparked a national conversation about the latent alcoholism and casual violence that wind their way through life in this winter - hardened land .
Konstantin Popov was a little - known journalist who specialized in writing about economics .
A few days into the new year , in the thick of a 10 - day Russian holiday known for its debaucheries , the 47 - year - old was arrested and placed in the police holding cell reserved for the drunk and disorderly .
He was taken home the next day , but he had been beaten so badly that his wife grew alarmed and took him to a hospital .
His internal organs had been damaged , and he soon lapsed into a coma .
Attacks on journalists are not uncommon in Russia , and Popov ’s death drew national attention .
News conferences were called .
The Tomsk drunk tank was closed down .
The deputy police chief resigned , along with the supervisor of the holding cell .
The police chief apologized .
The young officer was arrested and confessed .

But human rights activists warn that the case is just one small story in a tapestry of alcoholism , police brutality and expected impunity for authorities that bedevils today ’s Russia .
“ The only thing different about this case is that he happened to be a journalist , so it became a high - profile public case .
But the same thing happens every day , ” said Svetlana Gannushkina , a human rights lawyer and chairwoman of Russia ’s Civic Assistance committee .
“ Usually the cases are just closed down because there ’s no evidence , nobody testifies , and it ’s impossible to get to the bottom of it . ”
There ’s no indication that Popov ’s death was the deliberate killing of a journalist .
He had worked for years as a spokesman for the now - bankrupt Yukos oil company ; more recently he had opened a publishing company and printing plant , and wrote columns about economics .
“ Anybody could be beaten like that , ” said Konstantin Karpachyov , editor of the Tomsk edition of the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper .
“ He was not a high - profile journalist and he was not publicly known .
We ca n’t say he had a big name in local journalism . ”

Popov wound up in one of the many drunk tanks that exist across Russia , holding pens for people who have drunk themselves blind , beaten up their wives or girlfriends -- or both .
The tanks are notoriously harrowing places .
People who wash into police custody during the wee hours are sometimes beaten , forced into cold showers or lashed to cots ; they often lose their wallets or cellphones for good .
The 26 - year - old police officer told investigators that he lost control of himself because of stress , a Tomsk investigator said at a news conference Wednesday , according to the Interfax news agency .
The policeman , Alexei Mitayev , will undergo a string of psychiatric tests next month .
The investigator told reporters that Mitayev was suffering “ a lengthy , traumatizing situation ” because he had fathered children with two women .

“ Essentially , he lived between two families , ” investigator Andrei Gusev told reporters .
“ He says the stress is due to family problems . ”

Our nation 's founders came here to escape religious persecution .
They made sure that our Constitution prohibited the formation of a national religion , but to this teabagger from California , forcing Christmas music on children is patriotic .
More from The Huffington Post :
The Tea Party movement is supposed to be all about keeping the government out of your business .
But if some California members get their way , the state will force public school children to sing Christmas carols .
It 's called the " Freedom to Present Christmas Music in Public School Classrooms or Assemblies " initiative .
Merry Hyatt , a substitute teacher and member of the Redding Tea Party Patriots , is behind the push .
The Record Searchlight reports :
The initiative would require schools to provide children the opportunity to listen to or perform Christmas carols , and would subject the schools to litigation if the rule is n't followed .
" Bottom line is Christmas is about Christmas , " said Erin Ryan , president of the Redding Tea Party Patriots .
" That 's why we have it .
It 's not about winter solstice or Kwanzaa .
It 's like , ' Wow you guys , it 's called Christmas for a reason . ' " Read on ...
This goes against the Tea Party movement 's anti-government intrusion platform , but consistency or historical accuracy has never been their strong suit .

Lots of coverage in today ’s English press about glaciers .
David Rose in the Daily Mail here .
Among other points , he reports that Georg Kaser says that he notified WG2 Lead Author Lal of the error several months prior to publication .
Lal denied receiving the letter .
Last week , Professor Georg Kaser , a glacier expert from Austria , who was lead author of a different chapter in the IPCC report , said when he became aware of the 2035 claim a few months before the report was published , he wrote to Dr Lal , urging him to withdraw it as patently untrue .
Dr Lal claimed he never received this letter .
‘ He did n’t contact me or any of the other authors of the chapter , ’ he said .
Cristopher Booker in the Daily Telegraph here .
An interesting addition to the backstory from North / Booker , tracing the language in IPCC WG2 to almost identical language in an interview with an Indian environmental magazine .
In fact Dr Hasnain had first made his own controversial claim two months earlier , in a much longer interview with an Indian environmental magazine , Down to Earth , in April 1999 .
It was the wording of this interview which the IPCC was to quote almost exactly in its 2007 report .
Jonathan Leake in the Sunday Times here discusses TERI ’s role , observing that Pachauri repeated the claim in a TERI press release issued on January 15 , announcing a joint venture between TERI , Iceland and Ohio State University :
“ According to predictions of scientific merit they may indeed melt away in several decades . ”
And , needless to say , more new posts from Richard North at his blog .
All worth a read .
“ I think it ’s all good and well that these people are finally stepping up to support education , ” said Michael Mulgrew , president of the United Federation of Teachers , referring to wealthy hedge funders .
“ But I would wish they would do it in a more foundational way , a way that would help all the children instead of just a small group . ”
Charter schools often have a longer school year , Saturday classes , uniforms and a passion for measuring results .
Most of them are in the city ’s poorest neighborhoods and admit children by lottery .
Approximately 30,000 , or 2.5 percent of the city ’s public school students , attend charters , although in Harlem and parts of Brooklyn the figure is closer to 20 percent .
The schools present the kind of opportunity that “ electrifies ” hedge fund managers , said Mr. Tilson , 43 , who is on the board of the Knowledge Is Power Program , which manages charter schools around the country .
A founding member of Teach for America in the late 1980s ( before earning an M.B.A. ) , Mr. Tilson also blogs about charters at edreform.blogspot.com .
“ It ’s the most important cause in the nation , obviously , and with the state providing so much of the money , outside contributions are insanely well leveraged , ” he said .
Charter schools ’ reliance on metrics and tests to measure progress is another attraction for hedge funders .
Mr. Petry , who cultivates a schlumpy aura that is more headmaster than Master of the Universe  he carries an eight - year - old Blackberry the size of a Stephen King paperback stuffed in a nylon backpack and favors fleece pullovers  said he reads spreadsheets of education statistics as much as those for new investments he ’s chasing .
“ I ca n’t understand how anyone could look at the raw numbers and not see what ’s at stake , ” he said during an interview in a restaurant near the Upper West Side apartment where he lives with his wife , a former teacher , and three young children .

Whether charters do a better job of educating children , even with the extra help from private donors , is much debated .
A study released in September by researchers headed by Caroline M. Hoxby , an economist at Stanford who is a fellow at the Hoover Institution , concluded that on average New York City charters outperform local schools .
But another study by a different group of Stanford researchers last summer suggested that nationally the numbers are muddier .
CARACAS ( Reuters ) - President Hugo Chavez devalued Venezuela ’s bolivar currency on Friday , attempting to resuscitate local production but running the risk of worsening inflation in the South American oil - exporter ’s flagging economy .
Facing a recession and galloping prices in the 11th year of his presidency , Chavez had long been pressured by business for an adjustment of the over - valued exchange rate , but was not expected to make the move so close to an election .
Venezuela votes for a new National Assembly in September .
The move will likely boost the state ’s bolivar revenues from oil and help local exporters , but add pressure on prices , which soared 25 percent in 2009 , the highest in the Americas .
The bolivar had been fixed at 2.15 to the dollar since 2005 as part of Chavez ’s strict controls of Venezuela ’s economy in line with his “ 21st century socialism ” policies .
But Chavez , in a live address on state TV , said the bolivar would now have two levels -- a preferential rate of 2.6 per dollar for essential imports like food , health and machinery and a 4.3 “ petro - dollar ” rate for other things .
“ This has several objectives , to revive the productive economy , strengthen the Venezuelan economy , slow imports that are not strictly necessary and at the same time ... stimulate production for exports , ” he said .
“ Venezuela has to be a country which exports more than just oil . ”
Widely considered to have been overvalued for several years , the bolivar also trades on a tolerated parallel black market and will continue to do so .
Ahead of Friday ’s announcement , the bolivar weakened during the day from about 5.90 to 6.10 to the dollar in parallel trade , on the rumors of a devaluation .
ELECTION COMING
Chavez , whose self - styled revolution since coming to power in 1999 has sharply polarized Venezuela ’s 28 million people , hopes to stave off an opposition effort to overturn his majority in the September vote .
The devaluation could stoke social tensions and weigh on his ratings , now at about 50 percent .
Asked how the devaluation would impact inflation , Venezuelan Finance Minister Ali Rodriguez told state TV it could add “ three to five ” percent to the annual rate .
It was not clear if he meant percentage points .
Local economists said the main risk from the devaluation was further price pressures .
“ Among the disadvantages is the inflationary effect , ” said Pavel Gomez , of local business institute IESA .
But the government hopes the inflationary impact of the devaluation will be offset by subsidies to food and gasoline prices , provision of some free services including health clinics , and frequent increases to the minimum wage .
At the 4.3 percent rate the bolivar is 50 percent weaker , while the 2.6 rate represents a devaluation of 17.3 percent .
Venezuela last devalued its currency in 2005 , to 2,150 bolivars per dollar from 1,920 bolivars .
In 2008 , it re-denominated the currency , lopping off three digits .
Venezuela ’s economy is estimated to have shrunk 2.9 percent in 2009 , and officials are hoping for moderate growth at the very best this year .
“ When you depend on oil and you keep increasing spending on social programs and you hold the exchange rate at that level , you are clearly going to have monetary and fiscal deterioration , ” a New York - based source at a major global bank said just before the devaluation as rumors grew .
“ Maybe he did n’t want to do this sooner because he does n’t want to show weakness . ”
The devaluation will affect neighboring Colombia ’s economy , already hit hard by diplomatic strife with Venezuela as Chavez has clamped down on bilateral trade in protest over a military cooperation deal signed by Washington and Bogota in October .
“ All our exports to Venezuela will increase in price overnight , ” said Camilo Perez , chief economist at Banco de Bogota in Colombia .
“ This will be true of all countries that export to Venezuela , but Venezuela is Colombia ’s second biggest trade partner , so the impact will be significant here . ”
The waiting is finally over for some of the District of Columbia 's most ambitious school children and their parents .
Democrats in Congress voted to kill the District 's Opportunity Scholarship Program , which provides 1,700 disadvantaged kids with vouchers worth up to $ 7,500 per year to attend a private school .
On Sunday the Senate approved a spending bill that phases out funding for the five - year - old program .
Several prominent Senators this week sent a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid pleading for a reconsideration .
Signed by Independent - Democrat Joe Lieberman , Democrats Robert Byrd and Dianne Feinstein , and Republicans Susan Collins and John Ensign , it asked to save a program that has " provided a lifeline to many low - income students in the District of Columbia . "
President Obama signed the bill Thursday .
The program 's popularity has generated long waiting lists .
A federal evaluation earlier this year said the mostly black and Hispanic participants are making significant academic gains and narrowing the achievement gap .
But for the teachers unions , this just can't happen .
The National Education Association instructed Democratic lawmakers to kill it .
" Opposition to vouchers is a top priority for NEA , " declared the union in a letter sent to every Democrat in the House and Senate in March .
" We expect that Members of Congress who support public education , and whom we have supported , will stand firm against any proposal to extend the pilot program .
Actions associated with these issues WILL be included in the NEA Legislative Report Card for the 111th Congress . "
Senator Dick Durbin , who heads the subcommittee that oversees funding , has been saying for the better part of a year that he 's open to supporting the program 's continuation if certain conditions were met .
In retrospect , this looks like bad faith .
I never realized we were such pillow fans : iPhone icon pillows , pillow blankets , TV pattern pillows , laptop pillows , pillow rings , extra - terrestrial pillows , wiimote pillows ... it never stops .
Until now .
Here 's the pillow to rule them all : The Condom Pillow .

Hand silk - screened , the Condom Pillow has a small pocket to put real condoms inside .
Genius ?
I think so .
It 's a great reminder , in any case .
You do n't really want to have to use the undo pillows one day .

An Irish art student based in a warehouse in east London has invented a product already being described as the best thing since Sellotape and Blu - Tack .
Sugru is a silicone , which can be used to glue things together , patch leaky boots , or create a variety of custom - made handles , hooks , and feet for wobbly chair legs .
It has the appearance of children 's modelling clay , which once out of its airtight packet , can be moulded into any shape and fixed onto leather , metal , ceramic , wood and plastic .
After about 24 hours it " cures " and will adhere to any substance with the strength of ultra strong glue but it does not become rock hard .
Instead , it stays slightly flexible .
Sugru , Irish for play , has been invented by Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh , a former art student determined to give old and broken household objects a new lease of life .
" I was inspired by the internet and the whole idea of user - generated content .
I wanted something that people could make their own and use in their own way .
" A lot of stuff gets thrown away not just because it is broken but because it has stopped being useful or fashionable .
If you can adapt it or hack it that 's got to be better than putting it in the bin . "
The product goes on sale this week but it has already caught the eye of design experts who have tested it out and hailed it as the most exciting product since Sellotape or Blu - Tack .
Guy Robinson , the head of the design consultancy Sprout Design , said : " I think this will really take off .
I just hope people realise how great it is .
" It allows you to customise your own stuff by making it ergonomic .
Too much industrial design is not ergonomic enough . "
He said that he had already used it to make custom - made handles for hospital crutches .
The silicone is made from a new product trademarked as Formerol , which is far more flexible than the mouldable epoxy resins on the market , which tend to go rock hard when dry .
The material , once cured , is dishwasher proof and heat resistant to 180C ( 356 F ) .
A packet , containing 10 sachets of Sugru , costs £ 7 ( €7.70 ) .

Like all human endeavours , the IPCC is not perfect .
Despite the enormous efforts devoted to producing its reports with the multiple levels of peer review , some errors will sneak through .
Most of these will be minor and inconsequential , but sometimes they might be more substantive .
As many people are aware ( and as John Nieslen - Gammon outlined in a post last month and Rick Piltz goes over today ) , there is a statement in the second volume of the IPCC ( WG2 ) , concerning the rate at which Himalayan glaciers are receding that is not correct and not properly referenced .
The statement , in a chapter on climate impacts in Asia , was that the likelihood of the Himalayan glaciers “ disappearing by the year 2035 ” was “ very high ” if the Earth keeps warming at the current rate ( WG 2 , Ch. 10 , p493 ) , and was referenced to a World Wildlife Fund 2005 report .
Examining the drafts and comments ( available here ) , indicates that the statement was barely commented in the reviews , and that the WWF ( 2005 ) reference seems to have been a last minute addition ( it does not appear in the First - or Second - Order Drafts ) .
This claim did not make it into the summary for policy makers , nor the overall synthesis report , and so cannot be described as a ‘ central claim ’ of the IPCC .
However , the statement has had some press attention since the report particularly in the Indian press , at least according to Google News , even though it was not familiar to us before last month .
It is therefore obvious that this error should be corrected ( via some kind of corrigendum to the WG2 report perhaps ) , but it is important to realise that this does n’t mean that Himalayan glaciers are doing just fine .
They are n’t , and there may be serious consequences for water resources as the retreat continues .
See also this review paper ( Ren et al , 2006 ) on a subset of these glaciers .
East Rongbuk glacier just below Mt. Everest has lost 3-400 ft of ice in this area since 1921 .
More generally , peer - review works to make the IPCC reports credible because many different eyes with different perspectives and knowledge look over the same text .
This tends to make the resulting product reflect more than just the opinion of a single author .
In this case , it appears that not enough people with relevant experience saw this text , or if they saw it , did not comment publicly .
This might be related to the fact that this text was in the Working Group 2 report on impacts , which does not get the same amount of attention from the physical science community than does the higher profile WG 1 report ( which is what people associated with RC generally look at ) .
In WG1 , the statements about continued glacier retreat are much more general and the rules on citation of non-peer reviewed literature was much more closely adhered to .
However , in general , the science of climate impacts is less clear than the physical basis for climate change , and the literature is thinner , so there is necessarily more ambiguity in WG 2 statements .
In future reports ( and the organisation for AR5 in 2013 is now underway ) , extra efforts will be needed to make sure that the links between WG1 and the other two reports are stronger , and that the physical science community should be encouraged to be more active in the other groups .
In summary , the measure of an organisation is not determined by the mere existence of errors , but in how it deals with them when they crop up .
The current discussion about Himalayan glaciers is therefore a good opportunity for the IPCC to further improve their procedures and think more about what the IPCC should be doing in the times between the main reports .
Update :
This backgrounder presented by Kargel et al AGU this December is the best summary of the current state of the Himalayas and the various sources of misinformation that are floating around .
It covers this issue , the Raina report and the recent Lau et al paper .

Sony as of this time has not confirmed the service but are looking into it .
For civilizations in Europe and the Near East , the Bronze and Iron Ages — when metalworking was first developed — have been viewed as times when simple societies struggled through technological upheaval , famine , and sickness .
But new findings are revealing surprising social and cultural complexity .
Around 2000 B.C. , as Scandinavia was poised to enter the Bronze Age , settlements were thought to consist of scattered farms , with little cooperation between them .
Instead , a study by archaeologist Magnus Artursson of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden suggests that these societies formed hierarchical chiefdoms some 800 years before such social structures were believed to have emerged .
Artursson examined graves and found wide variations in wealth ; the presence of imported high - status metals indicated contact between distant settlements .
Early Iron
Age societies are also turning out to be more advanced than scholars previously realized .
University of Toronto archaeologist Timothy Harrison and colleagues are excavating a temple in the Tell Tayinat region of Turkey , built around 800 B.C.
Though this time was thought to be a dark age when trade between Greece and the Middle East nearly ground to a halt , Harrison says that his finds — including ivory carvings , precious metal foils , and pottery — are a clear indication of cultural and economic exchange among cultures such as the Hittites , Aegeans , and Semites .
Harrison ’s team will continue excavating the temple ’s inner sanctuary this year .

Rising temperatures on the slopes of Mount Kenya have put an extra 4 million people at risk of malaria , research funded by the UK government warned today .
Climate change has raised average temperatures in the Central Highlands region of Kenya , allowing the disease to creep into higher altitude areas where the population has little or no immunity .
The findings by a research team funded by the UK Department for International Development ( DfID ) , showed that seven times more people are contracting the disease in outbreaks in the region than 10 years ago .
The team from the Kenyan Medical Research Institute ( Kemri ) said that while similar outbreaks elsewhere have been attributed to multiple factors including drug resistance and changes in land use , the only change on Mount Kenya is a rise in temperature .
The average temperature in the Central Highlands was 17C in 1989 , with malaria completely absent from the region .
This is because the parasite which causes malaria can only mature above 18C .
But with temperatures today averaging 19C , mosquitos are carrying the disease into high altitude areas and epidemics have begun to break out among humans .
Kemri is using climate models to predict when epidemics might occur up to three months in advance , giving authorities time to stock up on medicine and warn the public of the dangers .
The institute is also using church meetings and local health clinics to educate people in high - altitude areas on how climate change could be leading to the spread of malaria into their area .
In the west Kenyan highlands , where malaria has been present since the late 1980s , programmes have been providing mosquito nets for people to sleep under - with DfID providing 14 m bed nets since 2001 .
But because malaria is a relatively new phenomenon , less than half of those who own bed nets use them , DfID said .
In areas where researchers have been encouraging people to use them the incidence of malaria has dropped markedly and epidemics have been all but eradicated .
The international development secretary , Douglas Alexander , said : " The spread of malaria in the Mount Kenya region is a worrying sign of things to come .
" Without strong and urgent action to tackle climate change , malaria could infect areas without any experience of the disease .
" That 's why we need to make sure vulnerable , developing nations such as Kenya have the support they need to tackle the potentially devastating impacts of climate change . "
This is a guest post by Seismic Shock .
As some people have noticed , I ’ve been rather quiet in blogging about the Reverend Stephen Sizer ’s activities of late .
After all , what more can be said of a man who forwards emails from Holocaust deniers , shares platforms with Holocaust deniers , and shamelessly flauntshis anti-Zionist theology before Iran ’s apocalyptic Holocaust - denying regime ?
As Iranian pastors are arrested and house churches closed down , why is the Khomeinist regime translating Sizer ’s book on Christian Zionism into Farsi ?
How many more times can I point all this out ?
Yet there ’s another reason why I ’ve been quiet , and whilst I ’ve held my tongue and my pen for a while , now is time to speak .
At 10 am on Sunday 29th November 2009 , I received a visit from two policemen regarding my activities in running the Seismic Shock blog .
( Does exposing a vicar ’s associations with extremists make me a criminal ? , I wondered initially ) .
A sergeant from the Horsforth Police related to me that he had received complaints via Surrey Police from Rev Sizer and from Dr Anthony McRoy – a lecturer at the Wales Evangelical School of Theology – who both objected to being associated with terrorists and Holocaust deniers .
( Context : Sizer has associated with some very nasty terrorists and Holocaust deniers ; McRoy has delivered a paper at a Khomeinist theological conference in Iran comparing Hezbollah ’s struggle against Israel via suicide bombing with the Christian ’s struggle against sin via the atoning death of Jesus , and describes the world ’s most prominent Holocaust denier as an “ intelligent , humble , charismatic , and charming ” man who “ gives quick , extensive and intelligent answers to any question , mixed with genial humour ” ) .
The sergeant made clear that this was merely an informal chat , in which I agreed to delete my original blog ( http://seismicshock.blogspot.com) but maintain my current one ( http://seismicshock.wordpress.com).
The policeman related to me that his police force had been in contact with the ICT department my previous place of study , and had looked through my files , and that the head of ICT at my university would like to remind me that I should not be using university property in order to associate individuals with terrorists and Holocaust deniers ( I am sure other people use university property to make political comments , but nevermind ) .
With my research on Reverend Sizer ’s associations with terrorists and Holocaust deniers making its way into a publication of the Society of Biblical Literature , I was quite content to hold my peace .
However , now that Reverend Sizer is now misrepresenting what has happened in my case in order to intimidate others , now is the time to speak up .
A Christian blogger – “ Vee ” of LivingJourney , who is based in Australia – linked to my blog as a resource for Christians to learn about anti-Semitism in the Church , including “ lots of info on Stephen Sizer and Sabeel ” .
Rev Sizer left her this comment :
Dear Vee ,
You must take a little more care who you brand as anti-semitic otherwise you too will be receiving a caution from the police as the young former student of Leeds did recently .
One more reference to me and you will be reported .
Blessings
Stephen
Sure , Stephen Sizer managed to somehow arrange a police visit to me from within the UK , but does Sizer genuinely think he can use police on the other side of the world to this effect ?
Why is Reverend Sizer claiming that I received a police caution , when the police stressed I did not receive a caution ?
Is Sizer deliberately misrepresenting the same police force that he originally used to his advantage ?
Who is Reverend Sizer reporting to , and why does Reverend Sizer genuinely feel he has the power to close down debate by threatening police action ?
Why call the cops rather than answer his critics ?
Political and theological disagreements should never be accompanied with threats of litigation or police action , but instead with logic and open debate .
***
habibi adds :
Who in the UK might like to hear from a character as dubious as Stephen Sizer ?
The Federation of Student Islamic Societies ( FOSIS ) , that ’s who .
He will speak at FOSIS ’s “ Palestine Week ” at the University of Manchester on 13 February .
He will have the kind of company he has become accustomed to at the extremist events he attends .
Here ’s the roster :
– Hamas supporter and deputy secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain Daud Abdullah , who thinks Israel controls American foreign policy and is trying to destroy the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem with chemicals and tunnelling .
– Anas al - Tikriti , who has expressed support for the murderers of coalition troops in Iraq .
His Cordoba Foundation sponsored last year ’s Cageprisoners ’ fundraiser , where al Qaeda preacher Anwar al Awlaki was to be to be the star speaker via video link from Yemen .
Alongside Daud Abdullah ’s Middle East Monitor , Cordoba also sponsored a recent London event for the Christisons , a pair of strange Israel haters and 9/11 troofers .
– Azzam “ Kaboom ” Tamimi , who supports the Taliban as well as Hamas and repeatedly paints Zionists as less than human .
– Ismail Patel , another Israel hater who publishes and promotes the work of Holocaust deniers .
You will find Stephen Sizer ’s work in his “ Friends of al Aqsa ” journals too .
– John Rose of the SWP , who helped tour South African inciter of hatred and violence Bongani Masuku around UK universities last month
Sizer will be in his element .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
As Pakistani soldiers fought their way into the forbidding heartland of the Mehsud tribal territory on Tuesday against Taliban and Al Qaeda militants , they faced the most ferocious fighters in Pakistan , men whose ancestors were legendary for never succumbing to the British .
A British governor of Waziristan , Sir Olaf Caroe , once wrote that the Mehsud tribesmen were the toughest opponents because , like wolves , they hunted and fought in packs .
On the fourth day of their offensive , the Pakistani soldiers continued to meet heavy resistance , particularly around the peaks of Kotkai , the hometown of the leader of the Pakistani Taliban , Hakimullah Mehsud .
Seven soldiers were killed when militants attacked a checkpoint there , an intelligence official from the area said .
One thing was working in the army ’s favor , however .
In the time - honored tradition of the mercurial relationships in the tribal areas , the military has sealed alliances with two Taliban commanders of the Waziri tribe , winning deals that they would not attack the army on their southern and eastern flanks .
AIG had to be rescued in 2008
The US bail - out watchdog has announced it is launching two investigations into the government 's rescue of insurer AIG .
Neil Barofsky , special investigator general for the US 's Troubled Asset Relief Program ( Tarp ) , questioned the government 's role in the bail - out .
He is appearing before a House Committee looking into the AIG bail - out in 2008 on Wednesday .
AIG was initially bailed out for $ 85 bn ( £ 52bn ) , but its total rescue package has since amounted to more than $ 180 bn .
" Issues have come to light that call into question whether the government has been , and is being , as transparent as possible with the American people , " said Mr Barofsky in a prepared testimony .
" Documents have come to light that were not provided to the [ watchdog ] audit team during the course of the audit . "
Transparency sought
The committee is investigating why the New York Federal Reserve , then headed by US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , paid AIG business partners face value for assets so they would cancel contracts with the insurer .
A report published by Mr Barofsky 's office in November last year criticised both the New York Fed and the US Federal Reserve for not using their " considerable leverage " to force AIG 's counterparties to accept less for these assets , thereby wasting taxpayer money .
As a result , 16 banks , including Goldman Sachs , Deutsche Bank , Societe Generale and Royal Bank of Scotland , were paid more than $ 62bn .
" If anyone at the Fed thought that this investigation will stop after Wednesday 's hearing , they are completely mistaken , " said committee member and California Republican Darrell Issa .
" There has been a widespread effort by officials at the New York Fed to thwart transparency , and we will continue to pursue this investigation for as long as it takes to get the truth . "

Who is the person of the decade ?
As we enter the last few weeks of the 2000s , the Magazine is enlisting readers to tell the story of the last 10 years , based on five themes .
On the second day of the series , the team from biographical book Who 's Who suggests some " people of the decade " .
The summing up of a decade is not an easy task .
Countless people who represent us , who interest us and who influence our lives have shaped the Noughties .
While the period has been overshadowed by war and terror attacks , we have seen an explosion of connecting , communicating and consuming , thanks to those who brought us Google , Wikipedia , Facebook , YouTube , Amazon and eBay .
WHAT IS 'PORTRAIT OF THE DECADE ' ALL ABOUT ?
We want readers to help us to create a portrait of the decade Each day this week we focus on a different theme - words , people , news , objects and culture Readers can make their suggestions using the form below Try to be original
It is not a vote - an expert will pick 20 in each category
The final 100 things about the Noughties will be revealed on Monday , 14 December An artist will illustrate them on a colour poster for readers
Our guidelines for Portrait of the Decade We admired the achievements of our sporting heroes and we have been entertained by the like of James Bond .
We have developed an obsession for celebrities , reality shows and talent contests , while 24 - hour news brought us the McCanns in the search for their missing daughter , Madeleine McCann .
The world changed forever after 11 September 2001 when terror attacks prompted George W Bush , former US president , to launch his " War on Terror " and the hunt he launched for Osama bin Laden still goes on .
Inclusion on this list does not confer honour on that person , merely recognise their impact , and in that sense Saddam Hussein could also be mentioned .
Although the way people consumed media changed in many ways , Rupert Murdoch remained as one of the industry 's giants .
One of the innovative leaders of the digital music revolution was Steven Jobs , CEO of Apple , while Shawn Fanning paved the way for illegal file - sharing when he created Napster .
Simon Cowell became a household name after appearing on Pop Idol , and creating X - Factor and Britain 's Got Talent - with their spin - offs across the globe - in which viewers were invited to participate in the judging process .
Footballer David Beckham became the face of soccer in the US , while little - known German football coach Otto Rehhagel stunned the world of football by taking Greece to the European title in 2004 .
The creator of Harry Potter , JK Rowling , has broken records for the fastest - selling book in history and encouraged millions of children to read .
But one of the literary phenomena of the decade was undoubtedly " misery literature " , one of the early exponents of which was American writer Dave Peltzer .
MEET THE EXPERT Chatham House , home of the Royal Institute of International Affairs , is a world - leading institute for the debate and analysis of international issues .
Associate Fellow , Professor Richard G Whitman has stepped up to take a look at your suggestions and pick those the institute thinks best define the Noughties .
Since chef Jamie Oliver first came on to our television screens as The Naked Chef , he has helped disadvantaged young adults through his Fifteen Foundation , he has campaigned for healthier school dinners and encouraged people to think about what we eat and the way we produce our food .
The recession has been a bit of a " faceless " story but Sir Fred Goodwin , former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland , was vilified for his part in it .
He presided over the bank 's rise to global prominence and its rapid fall .
Now it 's your turn .
Pick one of these names or come up with one of your own .
Tell us your person or people of the decade using the form further up the page .
If you missed the first part in our series - on words of the decade - you can read it here .

Soldiers have surrounded the hotel where Gen Sarath Fonseka is staying President Mahinda Rajapaksa has won Sri Lanka 's first election since Tamil Tiger rebels were defeated after 25 years of civil war , state TV reports .
Although the final results are yet to be declared , Mr Rajapaksa appears to have won more than half the votes cast .
But his election rival , Gen Sarath Fonseka , has rejected the reported result and said he will challenge it .
About 100 armed troops have surrounded the hotel in the capital , Colombo , where Gen Fonseka is staying .
A government spokesman told the BBC they did not intend to hold Gen Fonseka but were looking for army deserters .
The BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan , who is in the same hotel as Gen Fonseka and other opposition leaders , says the troops ' presence has created a very tense atmosphere .
A military spokesman said their deployment was a " protective measure " .
AT THE SCENE Anbarasan Ethirajan , BBC News , Colombo I 'm now inside the hotel where the main opposition candidate and other opposition leaders are staying .
It is surrounded by heavily armed troops and commandos .
There is a tense atmosphere .
One of the opposition alliance leaders said it was intimidating and that the alliance has appealed to the government to withdraw the troops .
The opposition leader said he was willing to accept the result of the election as legitimate as they had not seen any large - scale malpractices or rigging on election day .
The military had earlier said they were looking for about 400 army deserters and ex-soldiers staying in the hotel and that they should surrender immediately .
Udaya Nanayakkara said that some 400 people had gathered inside the Cinnamon Lake Hotel in the capital .
" We do n't know what is their motive and , as a protective measure , we have deployed troops around the hotel , and people who go in and come out are being checked , " he said .
Gen Fonseka said he feared the troops planned to arrest him if he won the election , a claim denied by officials .
An opposition spokesman , Rauf Hakeem , said opposition members had appealed to the government over what he said were " high - handed tactics " intended to intimidate them .
He told reporters there were no deserters inside the hotel .
With nearly all the results in , Mr Rajapaksa had 5.9 million votes - or 58 % of the total - to 3.39 million for his rival , state TV reported .
Some 70 % of Sri Lanka 's 14 million - strong electorate turned out to vote .
However , turnout in the Tamil areas in the north - east , where the fiercest fighting occurred during the conflict , was less than 30 % .
Lucien Rajakarunanayake , a spokesman for Mr Rajapaksa , told the Associated Press news agency that the president had " won a historic and resounding victory in the first free and fair elections held throughout the country since the defeat of terrorism " .
In pictures : President claims victory Supporters of Mr Rajapaksa celebrated in the streets of Colombo , waving Sri Lankan flags and setting off fireworks .
Under Sri Lanka 's electoral rules , if no candidate wins 50 % of ballots cast in the first count , then voters ' second - or even third - preferences are tallied to determine the winner .
The BBC's Charles Haviland , in Colombo , says it is probably only a matter of time before Gen Fonseka 's team concedes , but the opposition may raise certain objections as to how the election campaign was conducted .
Independent observers have been perturbed by two main elements , our correspondent says , one of which is the amount of violence in the run-up to the election - with most complaints about the perpetration of violence laid at the door of the president 's side .
The other is what monitors say is the misuse of public resources and state media .
State TV in particular gave blanket coverage to Mr Rajapaksa , our correspondent says , with Gen Fonseka more or less a footnote , and public buses were used to ferry around the incumbent 's campaign material .
The government has said it paid for the use of buses and other state resources but the independent election monitoring bodies are not convinced , our correspondent says .
Bitter fight
After a violent and acrimonious campaign , during which four people died and hundreds were wounded , Tuesday 's election was largely peaceful .
In pictures : Sri Lanka votes Profile : Mahinda Rajapaksa Profile : Gen Sarath Fonseka
But there were serious exceptions , especially in the Tamil - populated north .
In the city of Jaffna , the private Centre for Monitoring Election Violence said there were at least six explosions before and just after voting began .
Later there were two blasts in Vavuniya , the town near the huge camps for people displaced by the war .
The organisation said it feared this was a systematic attempt to scare people away from voting .
There were also grenade attacks in the Sinhala - dominated centre and south where the fight between the two candidates has been especially bitter , our correspondent says .
It later turned out that Gen Fonseka had not been able to vote because his name was not on the register .
The two men were closely associated with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers last May but fell out soon afterwards .
Gen Fonseka quit the military , complaining that he had been sidelined after the war .
The president 's side accuses the general of courting separatists .
The general has accused the president of plotting vote - rigging and violence , something his rival denies .
Both main candidates have promised voters costly subsidies and public sector pay rises .
However , economists say this will make it hard for the country to meet cost - cutting obligations imposed under the terms of a $ 2.6 bn ( £ 1.6 bn ) International Monetary Fund loan .

And whereas , it is the duty of nations as well as of men to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God , to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon , and to recognize the sublime truth , announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history : that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord .
Abraham Lincoln , March 30 , 1863 Proclamation appointing a National Day of Prayer and Fasting
May Day 2010 – A Cry to God for a Nation in Distress
When : May 1st 2010 – Starting at Sunrise
Where : The Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C .
Join with Christian leaders of all denominations who love God to humble ourselves , pray , seek the face of God , and turn from our wicked ways — individually and as a nation .
This event is not to impress the media or those in Washington , but to reach the heart of God .
Publically repenting and crying out to God for
His mercy instead of the judgment our many sins deserve .
“ But He took note of their distress
when
He heard their cry ;
for their sake
He remembered His covenant
and out of His great love He relented . ”
– Psalm 106:44 , 45
The Mayday holiday refers to a variety of festivals and gatherings that are celebrated on or around May 1 , typically for cultural or political reasons .
Today , the cultural and religious festivals are celebrated in many countries , most notably Great Britain , by dancing around the Maypole to herald the coming of spring fertility ushering in the season of summer and the growth of crops .
The celebrations also involved a chosen May Queen who represents the goddess of fertility .
Meanwhile , the political facet of the celebrations is observed as a public holiday in many countries commemorating the struggle and victory to implement the 8 - hour work day for workers all around the world .
This holiday is commonly referred to as Labor Day .
The history of the cultural celebrations of the Mayday festival is rich and vibrant .
It dates back to ancient times where it featured heavily in many religions .
The Romans honored Flora , the goddess of flowers , every 1st of May by organizing a parade around their grandest cities .
This tradition eventually became incorporated into Catholicism at the turn of the 5th century and to this day is still heavily celebrated in countries that are predominantly Catholic .
In other European cultures most notably those of Germanic origin , Mayday holiday is celebrated as heralding the arrival of spring and was called Walpurgis Night .
It featured bonfires , torches and dancing and scheduled to happen exactly six months before Halloween .
Today , some countries in Europe still schedule a massive party in a local park where people stay over for the night awaiting the arrival of the “ first day of spring . ”
For the Druids of the British Isles , the turn of May heralded the celebration of Gaelic Beltane and was used to depict the splitting of the year in half .
The newly lit fires were thought to give energy to the young springtime sun and it was used as a time for blessing crops , newlyweds and new property to signify luck and good fortune .
In modern times , most of the public gatherings around the 1st of May have become political in nature and is popularly known as the International Workers ’ Day or Labor Day .
It is celebrated with parades , rallies , and worker strikes that serve to uphold the rights of the common worker when it comes to compensation , privileges , benefits , and fair working conditions .
National and local labor organizations collectively gather in the streets to air their grievances towards government and company policies .
One of the latest examples of organized labor movement on Mayday festival happened in May 1 , 2006 in the United States when Latino Immigrant Labor Groups collectively marched to voice their displeasure over the immigration reform law which was under deliberation in Congress during that time .
In summary , the 1st of May will always hold significance in many communities as both political and cultural traditions intersect to give special importance to Mayday holiday as a day of unity , celebration , collective gathering , and bonding .
May the gatherings continue to be that of a peaceful and joyous nature as cultures and countries work together to achieve the common good of both workers and religious followers alike .
And in that sense , the Mayday holiday will always be a day of observance to something that is collectively greater than the sum of its parts ; the common goal towards bettering human situations wherever they may be in the world .
A Brief Overview of Mayday
Mayday is the festival that is being celebrated at the beginning of the month of May of each year .
Having traced itself to celebrations with paganistic origins , Mayday or the May Festival has lost connections in certain cultures but continues to exert a strong influence in others .
Particularly in North America and Europe where ancient traditions continue to find root and have taken on more modern twists , the celebration of Mayday remains a much awaited date on the calendar and widely treated with wow gold respect and observance all throughout many counties .
To understand the evolution of Mayday from the ancient to the modern festival that it has become today , a little trip down history isle might be necessary .
The popularity of the festival itself is traced to the full arrival of spring .
To this many cultures annexed celebrations such as the Celtic Beltane and the Germanic Walpurgis .
A common theme is also that of the “ flower ” festival when the bloom of colorful plants ushers in the arrival of spring .
To the ancients , you can liken this moment to a Carlsbad therapist who eases your cares away .
In the countries that continue to celebrate a more ancient form of the festival , particularly in the English territories , rites and celebrations using the Maypole and other similar traditional artifacts continue to happen .

In other cultures , however , the 1st of May is declared a holiday for an altogether different reason .
It is because the celebrations pertain to the International Worker ’s Day or Labor Day .

What Is The Real MayDay ?
The coming of a new vivid spring always brings to us tons of holidays we can enjoy : Mother ’s Day , May Day , let ’s face it – we ’re as excited to know they ’re approaching pretty much as we would be excited to hear that there was someone giving away a free cell phone to any passer - by wearing a red T - shirt out in the street .

We are also going to put special emphasis on the American May Day and the means of celebration here .
May Day is a spring festival and it is also considered a public holiday all across the world ; the end of the 19th century has transformed the holiday into the International Workers ’
Day , also referred to as Labor Day .
Certain political parties such as socialists or communists were imposing this holiday , but , in the past , May Day was actually being celebrated through hard work and no days off .
Today , the tradition is for workers to receive a day off as a reward for their hard work during the entire year .
During this day , most workers around the world usually sit in the sun and have barbecues , just like professional solar installers are sitting on a rooftop , doing their job .
No business deals are usually being completed during the day , as most , if not all offices are closed .
Also , drug rehab patients are usually visited by their loved ones and they go out for picnics together , taking advantage of the fact that the whole family can reunite .
To gain a better view on the way a normal Labor Day in America looks like , picture one individual sitting in one of those crazy inversiontables ; in other words , pretty much everything is being turned upside down , no one goes to work – from any SEO San Antonio company to any New York law firm ; no one does work around the house , no one stresses out about picking up dog toys off the floor and students organize all sorts of crazy festivals around their campuses .
Therefore , May Day is highly appreciated all across the American soil , just like an Xbox 360 hard drive of 360 GB is being highly appreciated by any connoisseur .
There are different ways of celebrating May Day in the U.S. , and most regions are quick to bring together a pagan and a labor tradition – Green Root and Red Root .
Parades such as the May Day Parade and Pageant have an extremely rich history and they manage to gather tens of thousands of people every year – picture a lawn full of used cars Las Vegas based , but instead of cars , imagine there were Americans celebrating Labor Day .

Previous Mayday Festivals
Maydays is one of the festivals celebrated today that traces its roots to many other celebrations in history .
While it is not as grandiose and as recognized as the twinkle Christmas lights during December , it is widely celebrated by many countries and cultures who continue to recognize the significance of May 1 as a date on the calendar .
The most notable historical precedence of Mayday is traced to the Germanic Walpurgis Night and the Beltane festival in Celtic lore .
These festivals are celebrated as a mirror opposite of Halloween which comes exactly 6 months after Mayday .
In historical calendar terms , the Mayday festival is celebrated to denote the arrival of spring and the end of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and therefore was a big moment for many cultures .
Whatever was the equivalent of the mesothelioma lawyer or the property management York specialist in those times , they knew that the changing of the seasons from winter to spring brought forth the potential for new businesses and a send - off to the old , cold sights of winter .
Another popular precedent to mayday was the festival of the Flora which up to today still permeates Roman Catholic religious culture .
In the old times , Flora was the Roman goddess of flowers and the bearer of spring .
Today , Roman Catholics recognize the month of May as the month of flowers and celebrate it with flower offerings to Mary , mother of Christ .
Any Helen Pastorino would be able to associate the two festivals as close synonyms of the other and as such continues to be a reflection of the Mayday celebrations from Roman times up to today .
All of these paved the way for the Mayday festival that we see today from a cultural and social point of view .
These celebrations highlighted the reconciliação of the old and new cultures , a marrying of what was and what is .
Both socio-cultural and religious aspects of the festival continue to permeate modern society in ways that have made it an essential aspect of life and one that will continue to grow in years to come .
Consequently , other precedents to the Mayday festival had their roots in the struggle for labor rights , the fight for salary scales , and the championing of remodeling estimates towards recognition of the labor union cause .
In many countries today , May 1 is celebrated as Labor Day and is a reflection of the efforts done years before to implement the 8 - hour workday , the right to unionize , and the right to assembly to uplift worker ’s rights .
In this regard , Mayday is recognized as the International Worker ’s Day and today remains to be a rallying point for many who still believe that labor rights are not adequately upheld and that pay is still not fairly administered .
Through all of this , it is always guaranteed that May 1 will be celebrated , in one way or another , in various cultures .
It remains to be the anti-thesis to immobilier movements , a stirring symbolism of the right to gather and recognize the historical and the current plight of cultures and societies .
It transcends the modest issues the depuy hip recall and the truism of the Meladerm review .
And all of these are possible because of previous Mayday festivals that have set the precedence for what is happening today .
On May 1 , we all look back at history as a mirror for what is happening in the present .
And in that we rally , we celebrate , we protest , and we rejoice towards common causes of socio-cultural , religious , and labor origin that remain important to the common man .

2012 ‘ May Day ’ Protests From Coast to Coast !!!
MayDay happenings in NYC !
MayDay 2012 : Protests Throughout U.S.A .
In solidarity with other protestors throughout Europe and other parts of the world , Occupy May Day crowds thronged major cities throughout the US , causing disruptions , but not much violence .
Around 50 protestors were arrested during the day .
The full article for the ebevts , as they unfolded , can be read below .
For most students , rather than seek their Masters in education online , they preferred to join in the protests , aimed at raising awareness against unfair practices dictated by the financial practices in wake of the global recession .
The Occupy Wall Street movement , which initiated its campaign of protests some months ago , was also heavily involved in yesterday ’s protests and promised that there was more to come .
The largest demonstration occurred in New York , the heart of the US financial industry .
Thousands of people joined in and marched from Broadway to Wall Street in bright sunshine .
Blogs and commenters sites reported sporadic violence throughout California , where activists have recently stepped up their campaign of protests .
Four arrests were made after youths dressed in black clothing ( which has come to symbolise the image of violent protests worldwide ) threw bricks and attacked police with long sticks .
In San Francisco , for example , night - time riots a day before caused the destruction of cars and small shops .
There was also violence reported in Seattle which erupted after police dogs attacked and ravaged a great dane who was being taken for a walk by an elderly woman .
The woman was left unscathed but the dog had to be put down .
A veterinary technician , who was close by , administered the lethal dose .
This sparked off a violent melee in which both police officers and protestors were injured , some of them seriously .
There were also reports of white powder , later believed to be corn starch , being sent in envelopes to major corporations in New York , who the protestors believe are compliant with authorities in relation to the global recession .
The authorities , however , were adamant in their tough stance against the protests , and declared victory after learning that disruptions , as a whole , were minimal and had little impact on the cities involved .
The brutality of the Police , however , reared its ugly head once again , as protestors were pulled by their hair , thrown to the ground and manhandled , before being arrested .
It is scenes like this that have enraged many people , who believe that there is no need for such brute force to confront peaceful protests .
The Police however have claimed that , on the contrary , they have evidence of violence being instigated by the protestors themselves and invited everyone to visit website belonging to the NYPD to judge for themselves .
The NYPD said in a statement , that they have video surveillance footage of the incidents .

How Technology
Is the Driving Factor of Political Revolutions
In recent months , the news over political revolutions erupting in various parts of the world has caught the interest of not just political experts but the collective masses at large .
One could say this may be because people have become fed up with old forms of government and political leaders sitting unchecked for decades .
However , an equally telling perspective to all these mass uprisings is the role that technology plays in raising the political interest of citizens , not to mention its power to mobilize people .
Akin to the explosion of Melaleuca fireworks , this perspective is well worth examining given the role that it purportedly plays in the Middle East and in other countries world wide .
The obvious thing to examine , first and foremost , is the role of technology in information dissemination .
Going here , it ’s hard to get passed the role that the internet plays in stirring up public consciousness towards the relevant issues .
Before the advent of the internet , finding perspective on various issues was like pulling teeth especially in countries where information is tightly controlled by oppressive , dictatorial regimes .
Today , one can visit website from virtually anywhere in the globe .
Facebook , for example , is an excellent platform for sharing information .
You can start here and before long , you ’ll find yourself reading somebody else ’s blog .
The interconnectivity cuts through all spectrum of information dissemination allowing everyone to get the message almost instantaneously .
Today , there ’s no more waiting ; you do not have to sit on a plane if you plan to explore or try out South Africa travel ; a few clicks here and there and you ’re looking at the best that South Africa has to offer .
And then , there ’s social media .
Facebook and Twitter are primary driving factors in that they not only simplify information sharing , but also empower everyone to participate in the discussion .
Facebook and Twitter are excellent sounding boards for personal opinion .
Before long , everyone is part of the discussion and people are talking about all things important to them .
But perhaps the most pressing indicator of how technology is becoming a driving factor in political revolutions is that it simplifies information dissemination , something that we have touched prior but not fully expounded on .
A virtual phone service , for example , allows you to send text messages to hundreds of friends regarding rally schedules .
Twitter and Facebook does the same thing .
Before , you ’d have to rely on word - of - mouth to get people to come to an event .
Today , a mere text or Facebook status reaches a very wide audience .
In a few hours , you can mobilize an entire city to participate in a protest .
There is no doubt that technology is becoming a very powerful driving factor for the rise of political revolutions .
It is empowering citizens to air out their concerns , to gather in masses to protest their ails and to give them a voice where they would have otherwise been drowned out or suppressed .
It is a very powerful medium for overcoming apathy , getting the message across , and inviting everyone to take arms .
Without it , there would have been lesser political upheavals in the world .
You can very well say the rise of technology is the death of dictatorships .
Now , is n’t that a well - received message that ’s worthy of all commendation ?
Young Generation Loosing Interest in English Literature
When one would try to compare the older generation with the younger one , an obvious answer will come out – the generation of today have lose some sense of interest with things that the older people are into .
Typically , the fashion down to the interests on literature and the arts of the younger generation indicates how things have changed a lot as one would read here .
Many things have distracted the young generations of today .
Technology is one example which has diverted the attention of the people of young ages .
Modern gadgets have come out in the market which has fascinated the young ones .
And so , some subjects which are being offered in schools are being disregarded and are not given so much important as the attention of these people are now being caught in the realm of advancement , modernity , and technology .
English literature for one is a subject that is being offered in school which students would have to take yet their interest on the subject is really not much compared to the amazing applications which android tablets , cellular phones , iPad , PSP , and other gadgets offers .
People are willing to do some cash advance in order to purchase modern gadgets and will not even think of buying books which will enhance their knowledge on English literature .
Students today are being mechanical as to the study of English literature .
Unlike in the past where people would familiarize by heart all areas being covered by the subject matter .
Today , people would know about Shakespeare and his works yet lost the touch and connection of those amazing part of the English literature as part of their life .
Unlike cellulite removal which people today would invest to have it done , Shakespeare and other literary people ’s work are being set aside .
People would study about English literature for a moment while they are taking the course but totally forgetting about it once it is over .
People today have no sense of literary feeling since they are being clouded by their thought of things found in the internet that even quibids scam has become known to people .
But when it comes to English literature , younger people would not have fuzz about it most of the time .
Certificate info on different brands and packages of great things that are being offered by the worldwide web has attracted the attention of people yet English literature books and other writings have been dodged on the side to give way to the knowledge on different applications and icons being offered in the net .
Technology has taken its tool .
Fascination on the things which modernity and technology have been offering is a great contributing factor to the fact that the younger generation do not care so much about English literature now .
Reading good works of literary geniuses is not linger the “ in ” thing and people would tend not to mind if they know a lot of literary works and become inspired by them .
As long as they are being connected to the world through its amazing technology , English literature is somehow nearing its death and the interest of people on it deteriorates .

Social Media : Cause of Decrement in Physical Interactions
The social media phenomenon is one of the most revolutionary things to have happened from the perspective of digital interactions .
Consider ; before the emergence of Facebook and Twitter , long - lost friends who have moved to far - away addresses would have remained separated from us .
It ’s not as if we can easily go there to meet them ; travelling is expensive .
Social media rendered all those problems obsolete because now we can talk to people near and far with just a few keystrokes on the keyboard .
But like every other major invention or phenomenon in the last 200 years , there is a downside to social media .
Ironically enough , that downside is the claim that our ever increasing digital contentedness has led to the decrements of physical interactions .
At the surface , it may feel like we are applying skin moisturizer to soothe our needs for contact .
But the underlying reality says otherwise ; now that we are talking to people behind computer screens and cellphone monitors , we have given up on the effort of physically connecting with the people important to us .
Before the arrival of Facebook and Twitter , relationships were nurtured the old - fashioned way through dinners , talks over coffee , reunions and get - togethers .
We were not contented with sitting on the sidelines ; we wanted to be a part of the action .
In sports parlance , we were “ canlı maç izle ” simply because there was no other way .
Now , the convenience of Facebook and Twitter has made physical interactions an option rather than a necessity .
Why would you be compelled to see a friend if you can message them via Twitter every hour of every day ?
As the thinking goes , does n’t that qualify as caring and reaching out ?
If we can buy swtor credits and send them digitally , then there is no need to see them face - to - face unless it ’s a truly important occasion .
The truth is that this convenience and accessibility has made us believe we are still doing the same things that good friends do except that this is actually not true anymore .
In life , there are plenty of things that are best left unsaid .
A hug , a kiss , a poignant eye contact , a pat on the back , a back - rub ; these are things that trump all efforts to buy Kratom capsules for personal health because often , friends mean so much more than medicines .
The comfort that a friend or loved one can provide physically is so much more meaningful than words that you type on a computer screen .
Even children suffer from the same , if not worse , fate .
Now , kids who spend a lot of time in - front of the computer screen are missing out on the valuable lessons that can be learned by actually going out and making friends .
Once that period has passed , you cannot bring it back again .
You ca n’t turn back the time to make them experience what they ought to have experienced as kids .
It ’s not a PPI claim that you can always fall back to as Plan B .
So there are plenty of benefits with the explosion of social media but the decrement of physical interactions , the loss of the meaning of physical interactions in particular , is not one of it .
The hope is that in the future , we become more responsible in using social media to enhance our relationships , not kick it to the curb .
Until then , we are trapping ourselves behind the monitor , each keystroke bringing us farther from the relationships that make a difference .
Surely , that ’s not how we envision our social lives tobecome , right ?
What is the purpose of Celebrating May Day ?
May is a month of spring in the Northern Hemisphere or summer in Europe .
On the other hand , it ’s a month of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere .
May is full of colorful festivities .
One celebration that is common to Europe , North America , and Oceania is the May Day .
What could be the purpose why these countries celebrate May Day ?
May Day , which is celebrated on May 1st , is an ancient spring festival in the Northern Hemisphere .
Many countries also commemorate on May 1st the International Workers ’
Day which is also referred to as “ May Day . ”
May 1st is a public holiday in several countries where Labor Day is observed .
It is a day set aside to give importance to all laborers around the world .
Even writers who make Dentist Reviews are included .
May Day is associated with Beltane , a pagan Celtic festival , and Walpurgis Night , a traditional Germanic spring festival .
Both festivals are observed from April 30th to May 1st .
The festival of Flora , the Roman goddess of flowers , is the earliest known May Day celebration in the pre-Christian history .
Although May Day has traditionally been an event for people to have noisy merriment , it is nonetheless very popular .
The ancient May Day rituals customarily signified the transition from winter to summer .
In some countries , May 1st is the first day of summer .
The rituals involved offering of flowers , building of bonfires , playing folk music , singing , and dancing .
Of course , a feast would n’t be complete without some sumptuous food for the people to partake with .
The Christianization of Europe caused the people to abandon their ancient but pagan beliefs and rituals .
Many rituals , which were believed to be intrinsically good and beneficial to the unity of the people , were Christianized .
A significant Christianization of May Day happened in Germany where May 1st was used to give honor to St. Walburga , who is given credit of introducing Christianity to Germany .
Thus , the current festival is named Walpurgis Night .
In Europe , May Day is observed in Great Britain , Finland , France , Germany , Ireland , Bulgaria , Romania , and Sweden .
Dancing is popular during May Day .
For instance , Great Britain has Morris dancing while Germany has May pole dancing .
It has also been the custom to crown a May Queen in Great Britain .
Immigrants to North America brought their May Day customs and traditions with them .
As a result , May Day can be seen celebrated in different parts of Canada , the United States , and Hawaii .
Children and adults alike can be seen dancing around May poles during May Day .
May Day has even reached the Northern Territory of Australia where it is celebrated as a public holiday .
In this modern age of the Internet and mobile devices , people still cling to ancient traditions and practices that have stood the test of time .
May Day is a time for people to celebrate life and unity .
That ’s why it is still celebrated up to now .

Capacity of wind power base in NW China hits 2 GW ( Xinhua )
Updated : 2009-12-25 20:14
YUMEN , Gansu :
The installed capacity of China 's first massive wind power base in northwestern Gansu Province reached two gigawatts , local authorities said Friday .
The Jiuquan wind power base achieved the landmark capacity as China Datang Corporation , one of China 's power giants , installed a 200 - megawatt wind power unit in Yumen City under the jurisdiction of Jiuquan City , said Wu Shengxue , deputy head of Jiuquan 's Reform and Development Commission .
The wind power base , which consists of 8 groups of power plants , is planned to be the first of its kind to have a capacity of more than 10 gigawatts .
According to a plan of China 's National Energy Administration , its capacity is expected to reach 12.71 gigawatts in 2015 .
The plan included five other wind power bases of over 10 - gigawatt capacity .
A wind power base of 20 gigawatts and another of 30 gigawatts are to be built in east and west Inner Mongolia .
Two other bases , each having a 10 - gigawatt capacity , are respectively planned in eastern Jiangsu Province and northern Hebei Province .
One more wind power base of 20 gigawatts is to be built in northwestern Xinjiang .
China would have a wind power capacity of more than 100 gigawatts or 3 percent of the country 's overall consumption by 2020 , said Shi Pengfei , deputy president of Chinese Wind Energy Association .

With the SEC leveling 86 counts of fraud at Scrushy , it 's unsurprising that Hervey sucked at his job .
What is very , very surprising is that the CEO apparently hired Hervey just so he could say he hung out with the guy who once played Wayne Arnold from The Wonder Years .
HealthSouth eventually fired Hervey , who in turn sued the company for $ 400,000 .
We assume Hervey 's case was settled after an intense meeting involving wedgies , charley horses and swirlies .

Boundary Street in West End has been spared high - rise development after changes were made to the draft planning document designed to guide future planning in the area .
The two - storey shopping centre strip - often referred to as the heart of West End - had faced extensive redevelopment of up to five storeys .
But Brisbane City Council 's Neighbourhood Planning Chair Amanda Cooper said late yesterday the maximum building height would now be lower .
" The draft Renewal Strategy proposed increasing building heights on Boundary Street to five storeys but due to the number of submissions received , Council will retain the current three storey limit along the majority of Boundary Street , " she said .
But local Labor councillor Helen Abrahams said the decision to preserve the majority of Boundary Street 's height limits did not include two large sites , which were closer to the CBD near Mollison Street .

Relations between the US and Israel have been tense over settlements Israeli officials have shrugged off a suggestion that the US could withhold loan guarantees to pressure Israel over the Middle East peace process .
The finance minister said Israel did not need the guarantees , while the prime minister accused the Palestinians of holding up peace negotiations .
US envoy George Mitchell said this week the US could withhold loan guarantees to extract concessions from Israel .
The guarantees allow Israel to raise money cheaply overseas .
' Doing fine ' Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz reacted by saying the Israeli economy was doing well .
Under American law , the United States can withhold support on loan guarantees to Israel
George Mitchell
US Middle East envoy " We do n't need to use these guarantees , " he was quoted by Israeli media as saying .
" We are doing just fine .
But several months ago we agreed with the American treasury on guarantees for 2010 and 2011 , and there were no conditions . "
In response to Mr Mitchell 's comments , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office said : " Everyone knows that the Palestinian Authority is refusing to renew the peace talks , while Israel has taken important and significant steps to kickstart the process . "
Palestinian officials say Israel must completely halt settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , which it occupied during the 1967 Israeli - Arab war , before negotiations can resume .
Since he came to office in 2009 , President Barack Obama has focused closely on trying to get Israeli - Palestinian peace talks moving , but with little success .
Mr Mitchell , who is due to return to the Middle East this month in his latest attempt to restart negotiations , was asked on Wednesday in an interview with America 's PBS how the US could bring pressure to bear on Israel .
" Under American law , the United States can withhold support on loan guarantees to Israel , " he said .
Precedents
He noted that support for the guarantees had been reduced in 2003 , but added that no sanctions were being considered and that he preferred persuasion .
Former US President George W Bush 's administration whittled down backing for the guarantees after Israel built part of its West Bank barrier .
In 1991 , $ 10bn of loan guarantees were withheld under former President George H W Bush to pressure Israel over the peace process .
The Israeli comments on the loan guarantees came after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signalled a shift in the US approach by saying that agreeing the borders of a future Palestinian state would deal with Palestinian concerns about settlement building .
Both sides should resume peace talks as soon as possible and without preconditions , she said .
But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat played down the chances of peace talks , citing settlements .
The Israeli government has refused Palestinian demands for a complete halt to settlement building .
It has limited building work for 10 months in the West Bank , but not in East Jerusalem .

Two days after Republican Scott Brown ’s upset win in Massachusetts , the Obama administration proposed two new measures that would limit the ability of big financial institutions to wheel and deal .
In announcing these initiatives — one of which would prevent investment banks from playing the market with their own cash — President Barack Obama got rather feisty :
What we ’ve seen so far , in recent weeks , is an army of industry lobbyists from Wall Street descending on Capitol Hill to try and block basic and common - sense rules of the road that would protect our economy and the American people .
So if these folks want a fight , it ’s a fight I ’m ready to have .
And my resolve is only strengthened when I see a return to old practices at some of the very firms fighting reform .
Ready for a fight — that was the message .
White House reporters later that day grilled press secretary Robert Gibbs and economic aide Austan Goolsbee on why the administration was poking at the banks at this particular moment , implying that Obama was revving up a populist attack in response to the Democrats ’ demoralizing loss in the Bay State .
Gibbs and Goolsbee insisted that the release of these proposals had been planned since before Christmas .
Gibbs also noted repeatedly that the president was committed to “ fighting for what ’s important to the middle class . ”
Whether or not the Obama crew rushed out these measures , the more important question is this : if Obama now intends to be a populist battler , how hard will he fight ?
Obama and his aides certainly believe he ’s been pounding away for the past year — to pass the stimulus bill , to win congressional approval of his budget , to expand the children ’s health insurance program , to cut several wasteful Pentagon programs , to enact credit card reform , to win support for climate change action , to advance financial reform , to win passage of a jobs bill , to move health care reform through the House and Senate .
In the prepared remarks for a town hall meeting he held in Elyria , Ohio , on Friday , Obama declared 14 times that he ’s been “ fighting . ”
He vowed , “ I ’ll never stop fighting for you . ”
A few hours later , Obama tweeted to his 3.1 million Twitter followers , “ So long as I have the privilege of serving as your President , I ’ll never stop fighting for you — on # HCR [ health care reform ] and so much more . ”
And in his weekly address — finalized on the same day — he decried the influence of “ special interests ” and promised , “ I ’ll never stop fighting to make sure that the most powerful voice in Washington belongs to you . ”
Yet Obama has rarely come across as a fighter during his first year in office .
He frequently seemed more preoccupied with working an insider ’s game than confronting the interests and legislators standing between him and his policy objectives .
With health care in particular , it looked as if he was playing three - dimensional chess in a mud pit .
Proceeding as a calculating operator , rather than as an in - your - face brawler , Obama has indeed won legislative tussles and remains close to sealing a deal on health care .
But if he wants voters to believe he ’s a fighter , Obama needs to show them , not tell , them .
Obama is not naturally combative .
The week before his populist eruption , he presented a less confrontational attitude toward the banks .
While proposing a tax on big banks to cover the TARP bailout funds not being paid back , Obama did n’t explicitly pick a fight with the financial industry .
He entreated it to cooperate :
What I ’d say to these executives is this : instead of sending a phalanx of lobbyists to fight this proposal , or employing an army of lawyers and accountants to help evade the fee , I suggest you might want to consider simply meeting your responsibilities .
And I ’d urge you to cover the costs of the rescue not by sticking it to your shareholders or your customers or fellow citizens with the bill , but by rolling back bonuses for top earners and executives .
Instead of clobbering banks and lobbyists seeking to block this initiative , Obama was attempting to convince them to back off .
That ’s been the typical style of this administration .
On Wednesday , I asked Gibbs about a recent Wall Street Journal report that Senator Chris Dodd , the chair of the banking committee , was considering dropping the White House ’s proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency .
“ Is that something that the President would actually get angry about , ” I inquired , “ and has he conveyed that sentiment to Christopher Dodd already ? ”
Gibbs replied :
He ’s conveyed that — well , Senator Dodd was here yesterday , as the [ press ] guidance suggested , and the President addresses this morning in his interview that financial reform has to include a consumer protection agency .
That ’s what he ’s talked about for quite some time , and that ’s what he continues to want .
Not exactly mad - as - hell rhetoric .
If the White House had come down heavier on Dodd , a fellow Democrat , Obama could have picked up easy points as a fighter .
The soundbite writes itself : “ We respect Senator Dodd and appreciate his various contributions to enacting the president ’s agenda .
But the President is clear on this : he will oppose any Democrat or Republican who sides with the big banks and tries to prevent us from setting up an agency to protect consumers from the sleazy practices of big banks and financial institutions . ”
Okay , maybe strike “ sleazy . ”
But it ’s not that difficult to display some fight .
The following day , Gibbs was asked if the White House was anticipating and preparing for a major political battle over the just - unveiled financial reform measures .
He again missed an easy opportunity to exhibit White House fire :
I do n’t doubt that — this happened before we broke for Christmas , that when some of these activities were being voted on , that scores of lobbyists were called to Capitol Hill to generate activity in opposition to financial reform .
I have not sensed a retrenchment by those lobbyists on this issue and I think the special interests , in order to protect the good that they have , will do all they can to derail what ’s good for the American economy .
There was nothing technically wrong with that answer .
But it was not exactly loaded with passion .
An hour or so earlier , Obama had proclaimed he was ready , even eager , for this fight , yet the White House did not seem to be on a war footing .
What happens in Washington — especially on complicated matters such as health care and financial reform — can , no doubt , appear like an incomprehensible swirl to voters who do n’t follow the ins and outs of the legislative rigmarole .
To these voters , Obama ’s role in this jumble probably seems confusing .
He ’s been sucked into the mess .
For instance , he ’s overseen the generous bank bailout and stocked his administration with Big Finance insiders , while also talking about cracking down on financial institutions .
He ’s refused to state clearly his preferences for critical aspects of health care reform , while the White House has engaged in closed - door dealmaking with legislators and industry representatives to win votes .
What Obama ’s really fighting for can be hard to discern .
Consequently , if Obama aims to be widely regarded as a warrior for the middle class , he will have to take some mighty swings that cut through the clutter .
Proclaiming “ I am a fighter ” will not be enough .
He will have to name his foes ( financial institutions , insurance companies , Republicans , and perhaps recalcitrant Democrats ) and truly exchange blows .
He may even have to lose a high - profile battle or two to persuade voters he is slugging away on their behalf .
Muhammad
Ali talked a good game , but he fought a better one .
A true populist pugilist is defined not by his words , but by his actions , and a year into his presidency , Obama has not yet lost one of the more valuable presidential assets : the ability to define himself .
He can still be a populist , if he acts like one .
Electrical blackouts impacting millions of people in Brazil in 2005 and 2007 were caused by hackers targeting control systems , according to the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes .
( Update : Brazilian Blackout Traced to Sooty Insulators , Not Hackers )
In a show set to air Sunday night , CBS blames a two - day outage in Espirito Santo in 2007 on a hack attack .
The blackout affected three million people .
Another , smaller blackout north of Rio de Janeiro in January 2005 was also triggered by computer intruders , the network claims .
Reports that hacker - extortionists triggered at least one blackout outside the U.S. first surfaced last year , based on comments made by the CIA ’s chief cybersecurity officer , Tom Donahue , who declined to identify any country or the specifics of the alleged attacks .
In an interview with Threat Level 's Kim Zetter last month , former cybersecurity czar Richard Clarke publicly named Brazil as a hack attack blackout victim for the first time , but did n't go into details .
60 Minutes has n't distinguished itself with its cyber reporting in the past : the show 's alarmist piece on the Conficker botnet showed a picture of a gang of ruthless Russian hackers that turned out to be a bunch of school kids from Finland , and the show 's recent report on internet piracy was rank with unchecked Hollywood talking points .
Earlier reports from other media sources about hacker - triggered blackouts within the U.S. proved false .
But it seems unlikely that CBS would pin itself to a claim like this – naming specific , and real blackouts – without solid investigative sourcing beyond the usual suspects in the U.S. intelligence community and cyber security vendors .
If they were wrong , their claims would be quickly disputed from within Brazil .
So Threat Level will be tuning in Sunday , and beginning Monday may have to be a little less snarky in its Cybarmageddon coverage .
We might even have to rethink those Finnish kids .
Update 11-08-09 1:45 pm : The Brazilian government and the local energy company Furnas are denying the CBS News claim , according to today 's edition of the Brazilian newspaper Folha .
Raphael Mandarino Junior , director of the Homeland Security Information and Communication of the Institutional Security Cabinet of the Presidency , also told the paper he 's investigated the claims and found no evidence of hacker attacks .
Update 11-08-09 11:55 pm :
The show has aired , and we now know that 60 Minutes ' extraordinary hacker blackout claim comes from " half - a - dozen " sources in the military , intelligence and security communities – not one of which is named .
That does n't mean the story is false , but the show did lead with former Bush intel chief Mike McConnell .
And , really , if you 're sourcing McConnell , you might as well just make it up yourself .
There was no mention in the broadcast that the power company and the Brazilian government dispute the claim .
After a public outcry , a plan to force computer manufacturers to put Green Dam on all computers sold in China was dropped .
However , discs containing the program were shipped with computers and Green Dam was installed widely across China 's schools .
As of last June , 56.5 million copies of Green Dam had been distributed across the mainland .

Women working in corporate finance are expected to adhere to sexist and objectifying dress codes , says Amica Lane
“ Womanliness therefore could be assumed and worn as a mask , both to hide the possession of masculinity and to avert the reprisals expected if she was found to possess it — much as a thief will turn out his pockets and ask to be searched to prove that he has not the stolen goods . ”
– Joan Riviere , ‘ Womanliness As Masquerade ’ , The International Journal of Psychoanalysis
Once upon a time , the articles of clothing one wore served a very practical purpose .
To shield us from the cold , allow us to work or hunt with ease and likewise .
Over the centuries of wearing garments ; the threads began to integrate into our skin , especially for women , and became a mask ; a way of extroverting our inner selves to the world through signified implications .
At some point in our history , image became a fundamental essence of our identity .
The importance of image has been in play for thousands of years .
In Ancient China , a woman ’s bound feet signified she had wealth and status and the colour purple has implied royalty since Ancient Greece .
I started working in corporate finance straight out of university at the age of 21 , and when it came to the corporate visage , I was brazenly clueless
Image has become a well - honed method to communicate messages to the observer , and to the present day , the practice remains mostly unchanged .
Social tribes use image as a way of identifying themselves .
Twin sets and pearls signifies the middle - class country club mother ; leather and fishnets , the rock ‘ n ’ roll girl ; and a black skirt suit and high heels can signify the corporate professional .
The objectifying notion of woman as a ‘ seen ’ object has not disappeared .
Women have struggled hard to make it into the work place amongst men .
They have fought for education and votes , to be given the same opportunities as their male counterparts .
But , unfortunately , the work place can still be a hub of institutionalised sexism , which , in many cases , is carefully masqueraded as ‘ professional image ’ .
I started working in corporate finance straight out of university at the age of 21 , and when it came to the corporate visage , I was brazenly clueless .
Even at school , the concept of uniform made no sense to me and I frequently violated the code on the basis that it seemed completely illogical .
What difference could attire possibly make towards my education ?
It was trivial nonsense and I rebuked it from the get - go .
Corporate finance was never destined to be my niche .
A vivid memory of my early days involved meeting a high - powered female executive in the women ’s bathroom .
I knew her by reputation already ; she was a maverick businesswoman with a razor - sharp intellect .
“ Have you got any straighteners ? ” were her first panicked words to me , as she tore through the contents of her bag and emptied it onto the floor .
“ Umm , no . ” I replied , a bit dumbfounded .
Why the hell would I be carrying straighteners around with me ?
This was supposed to be corporate finance , not Miss World .
“ I have a HUGE meeting in five minutes , and I ca n’t go in looking like this ! ”
She grabbed a lock of curly hair in a fit of frustration and glared into the mirror as if her head was infested with snakes .
“ Why ? ” I responded , still wondering what the hell was going on .
“ Curly hair does not look professional .
I look like I ’ve just fallen out of bed . ”
She wailed , and disappeared off to Boots to amend the situation .
I had expected a lot of things walking into such a foreign hostile environment as finance , but that was definitely not one of them .
Unfortunately it was n’t going to be last .
I was told I looked like a whore and that my dress had caused complaints from male co-workers who insisted that I was ‘ distracting ’ them from work and they could n’t focus with such an outfit in the office
I wondered , what did her hair have to do with her meeting ?
Was it neurosis ?
Was anybody really going to judge her on her hair ?
( Yes – they would have done ) and the real thing that bothered me was , why is it relevant ?
She has a sterling educational background , makes an obscene amount of money , and yet ; when it comes down to it , her outward appearance still carries enough weight to delay the meeting in order to sort out her curls .
During my tenure in finance , I saw men walk into meetings in sweaty tennis gear and a week ’s worth of stubble without so much of a bat of the eyelid .
I never saw a woman imitate this .
And I soon found out why .
When I started , I was treated by my manager to an introductory lecture about dress code .
She presumed this would be sufficient to educate me in ‘ professional ’ and ‘ non-professional ’ work attire .
“ Look glamorous , with immaculate hair and makeup and plenty of flirty smiles !
But do n’t come to work dressed as if you ’re going to a club .
Look sexy , but not slutty .
Professional . ”
She may have well conducted the lecture in Finnish for all I understood .
What was sexy over slutty ?
What did glamorous mean exactly ?
And what in the hell was a flirty smile ?
And the big question that would proceed to get me into a lot of trouble : why did it matter ?
Could n’t I just wear normal clothes , do my job well , and go home ?
All these buzzwords such as glamour , immaculate and professional were completely off my radar of comprehension .
I wanted to change the world and go to law school , damn it !
Not strut around like a pageant contestant .
Regardless , I tried to follow protocol .
I wore a black dress the next day with flats , as I figured that was pretty unassuming .
How wrong I was .
Hauled into her office , I was told I looked like a whore and that my dress had caused complaints from male co-workers who insisted that I was ‘ distracting ’ them from work and they could n’t focus with such an outfit in the office .
That should have been a warning sign to economic forecasters .
My dress was apparently enough to send Oxbridge - educated men into such a frenzy , the whole capitalist system was at a serious risk of tail spinning into a meat grinder .
Maybe they had a point – the economic situation is probably the fault of women everywhere who dress inappropriately .
But instead of telling these men to apply their imagination to earning that triple digit bonus at Christmas , I was merely expected to accommodate .
Although it is a strict requirement to dress a certain way , high - powered businesswoman would certainly face criticism if they voiced these concerns to a male colleague .
‘ Well , I ’m sorry I ’m late for the presentation , I had to do my hair ’
So the next day , I went into work wearing no makeup , trousers and a suit jacket .
Once again , I was called into my manager ’s office .
“ You ca n’t dress like this .
You have no makeup on .
You ’re supposed to be the face of the company . ”
“ If the face of a multi-billion dollar hedge fund is a 21 - year - old blonde from Hounslow , then the company has a bigger problem than the Lehman situation , ” I replied , and was served promptly with a written warning .
“ Sexy , not slutty , ” became the mantra .
“ Sexy enough for the men to feel happy , but not too sexy as so to intimidate the other women . ”
My manager was the enforcer , but ultimately she was voicing the customs of the system , which in itself was corrupt and wrong .
Custom , especially in finance , states that employees must follow certain criteria when it comes to uniform .
There is a level of conformity expected in such environments , but it becomes a question of misogyny in the workforce when the imbalance occurs .
Women are expected to look a certain way ; made up , groomed and well - dressed ‘ sexy ’ professionals , whereas men are not .
Clean - shaven and a simple suit is enough to appear professional and smart .
If women were allowed more freedom in terms of appearance , they could spend more time in the boardroom and less time in the bathroom worrying about their hair .
Although it is a strict requirement to dress a certain way , high - powered businesswoman would certainly face criticism if they voiced these concerns to a male colleague .
“ Well , I ’m sorry I ’m late for the presentation , I had to do my hair . ”
Not to mention look after the kids , keep the husband entertained , work an 80 - hour week in a high - powered job and look like a supermodel at all times .
It ’s no secret that women still suffer from terrible inequality in the workplace , from the wage gap to being passed over for promotions in favour of male colleagues .
And I doubt it ’s even bare - boned misogyny at fault .
With the intense pressure on the professional woman , it ’s no wonder that savvy businessmen will give the promotion and the salary to the more committed and concentrated employee , which is likelier to be the man who merely has to have a shower , get dressed and turn up .
In order for women to have the same career opportunities as men , equality has to be enforced .
Mixed messages should be eliminated and the definition of ‘ professional ’ needs to be readdressed .
Words like ‘ glamour ’ and ‘ sexy ’ have no place within office lexicon unless equally applied to all workers .
If a company values glamorous and sexy employees as part of it ’s ethos ; then men need to be penalised under the same standards as women .
A perfect example of sexism in workplace image can be found in this recent Marie Clare article , ‘ How does your makeup affect your career ’ , where employment experts analyse different “ makeup looks ” .
Wearing minimal makeup elicited the following comment a professional image consultant :
“ Oh dear , you still look like rather a reserved person when perhaps that is n’t the case .
Looking so plain means you will need to work harder to convince the interviewer of your true capabilities . ”
Whereas wearing too much makeup elicited this response from recruitment consultant Julia Ross :
“ You ’re ready for a night out , not an office environment !
This look may not suit a wide variety of employers , and may distract due to the inappropriate hairstyle . ”
The happy medium , according to these career experts , is the ‘ sexy not slutty ’ approach which was approved with :
“ I really like this look – the makeup under the eyes is perhaps too heavy , but I immediately get the sense you are capable , assertive and confidant .
I feel you would pay attention to detail .
Looking so polished suggests you can get the job done . ”
The only clear message deducted from these misogynistic soundbites , is that when it comes to your career , image can play as important a part as your CV .
In conclusion , the misogynistic attitude towards female image in the workplace is a serious obstacle in the fight to ascertain gender equality .
Whilst the archaic practice of making a triviality ( such as makeup and wardrobe ) a serious job requirement , larger issues such as the wage gap and promotions will continue to suffer as a result .
Women are just as capable as achieving success as men , but whilst the shackles of institutionalised objectification remain so firmly embroiled within companies , this will never happen .
By standing together and calling out such blatant overtones of sexism , we have the power to change this .
But in our unified silence and accommodation , we continue to suffer professionally .
The office is not a fashion show , a magazine layout or a swimsuit calendar .
The office is a place to use the brain , not the eye shadow .
I sincerely hope that one day , CEOs and executives will come to understand that when it comes down to it , it ’s what ’s on the inside that truly counts .

Personal injury can include a range of many situations and conditions .
Some examples are filing a claim for : slip and fall injuries , car accidents , wrongful death , occupational injuries , nursing home abuse , medical negligence , exposure to toxic materials , product defect injury , and many more .
Solicitors practice in many fields and those who deal only with personal injury claims are known as personal injury lawyers .
It is essential to hire such a professional who is highly experienced with personal injury claims so you get the compensation you deserve .

Think of Douglas MacArthur and the picture that likely comes to mind is of the stoic , erect , and always in control General with his trademark pipe hanging from that tip - lipped , chiseled face .
The two are seemingly inseparable in our memories .
MacArthur ’s been photographed over the years smoking several different styles of corncob pipes , but the one he ’s most often associated with ( an extra - long stem and tall bowl ) is known as the “ Mac ” , and is still produced to Macarthur ’s original , exact specifications by America ’s first and largest corncob pipe producer– Missouri Meerschaum Company of Washington , Missouri .
Pipe smoking is n’t quite what it used to be in terms of popularity ( I ’d be interested to know how tobacco pipe sales have faired over the last few decades … ) , but in proper hands it can add a certain something special and distinguished to a man ’s mystique .
Kids– do n’t try this at home .

Said Mark
Twain , “ I always hire a cheap man–a man who does n’t amount to much , anyhow –who would be as well–or better–dead , and let him break in the pipe for me .
I get him to smoke the pipe for a couple of weeks , then put in a new stem , and continue operations as long as the pipe holds together . ”

In the just - so story of the evolution of our economy , our old manufacturing based economy has been replaced by an innovative knowledge economy .
That 's not quite true .
In fact , the decline of the jobs in goods producing sectors of the economy -- construction , manufacturing , mining and agriculture -- has largely been met with an increase in jobs on the government payroll .
We 've gone from providing jobs in profit - making private industry to providing jobs in profit - eating government work .
Toward the end of 2007 , the total number of government jobs exceeded the total number of goods producing jobs .
Welcome to the government payroll economy .

Ugh , the Paco Rabanne one is on UK TV all the time - it never fails to make me scream at my TV in rage .
There was another , similar one that was on telly maybe a year ago - something like a guy undoing whatever the product was , and as he did a girl 's shirt / trousers / etc came off .
Really , really sexist and annoying and stupid .
Ugh .

Another advert like that which has got me riled up is the recent one for Lynx Chocolate ( I 'm not too sure what the product 's called in other countries but that 's what it 's called in the UK ) with the chocolate man being followed by all these women ( * shudders * that Guinness advert is just utterly revolting .
Really revolting .
And thank you for the insight on the Paco Rabanne advert : I 'm from the UK as well and we get that advert a lot on our TVs but normally I do n't bother watching it becuase it 's just stupid but thanks for the insight about that .
Of course they just choose those kind of concepts for adverts to appeal to the product 's audience - young , stupid moronic men whose life picture involes getting drunk as often as possible and treating women like crap .
It 's just pathetic .

That Beer ad is terrible :< I do n't thik it would be allowed here but Im surprised that crap is allowed in more developed countries .
It 's on the border of being insulting , to be honest .
The second one basically puts women along with cars , money and gambling .
Cars and dices are things , women obviously are n't but makers of TV advertisements seem to be constantly forgetting it .

That Guinness ad is terrible and something I 'd definitely be embarrassed watching with men ( or little boys asking questions ) in the room .
Or my mother or grandmother .
Or any living being , actually .
It 's pretty much suggestive porn being sold , not beer .
I think the cologne ad is n't quite as outright terrible as the beer ad , because it does require some reflection on the part of the audience , whereas the Guinness ad is right in your face with it 's ugliness .
Ick .

That Guinness clip ist one of the most atrocious spots I 've ever seen .
A woman serving a man like a slave with sex and as a place where he can put his beer .
WTF ?!
Apart from that , it 's almost pornographic .
Disgusting .
I 'm so glad I have no telly and I barely go the movies .
I 'd probably lose all interest in the movie itself if they showed something like that before it .
The second clip is n't much better .
It 's subtler , but the message is basically the same .
Such spots do not only reduce women into ( sex ) objects , they also create an image of men most of my male acquaintances would consider extremely insulting .
The sexism works in both ways here .

That does n't necessarily mean anything much , because they 're distancing themselves due to the sex and not the objectification ( from the sounds of it ) but I thought it was something at least .
I found the first ad to be really offensive , so I did a quick google of it and found this article :

OMG that commercial is the WORST .
Ever !
WASHINGTON — Democratic Sen. Al Franken took the unusual step Thursday of shutting down Sen. Joe Lieberman on the Senate floor .
Lieberman , a Connecticut independent , currently is the target of liberal wrath over his opposition to a government - run insurance plan in the health care bill .
Franken was presiding over the Senate Thursday afternoon as Lieberman spoke about amendments he planned to offer to the bill .
Lieberman asked for an additional moment to finish -- a routine request -- but Franken refused to grant the time .
" In my capacity as the senator from Minnesota , I object , " Franken said .
" Really ? " said Lieberman .
" OK . "
Lieberman then said he 'd submit the rest of his statement in writing .
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona came to his friend Lieberman 's defense , saying he'd never seen such a thing occur .
" I must say that I do n't know what 's happening here in this body but I think it 's wrong , " McCain said on the floor .
Franken 's spokeswoman , Jess McIntosh , said that the Minnesota senator would n't allow Lieberman to continue because time limits were being enforced by Senate leaders rushing to finish a defense spending bill and get to the health bill .
( This version CORRECTS Lieberman asked for an additional moment to speak , not 30 seconds . )

Christmas , Hanukkah , Kwanzaa , whatever you celebrate , they all make this time of the year profoundly unpleasant .
Those who travel witness the worst of humanity , including people who use black garbage bags as carry - on luggage despite apparently being able to afford airfare .
Then there ’s shopping .
And , for students with exams , there ’s shopping that must be done during the final five - day rush before the holidays , or even in their midst .
The worst part of the season , however , is the people .
Holiday shopping draws everyone out from under the rocks of their hipster covens , gated communities , gentrifying neighborhoods and bucolic suburbs , and shoves them into one mall .
The shopping experience becomes a melting pot of class resentment , as history tells us time and again that proximity + diversity = war .
My internal reaction to this validates the equation :
First , I ’m not at all surprised to see smug environmentalist self - promotion on a Subaru station wagon .
I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen that bumper sticker on another car ( and in fact might come with that model ) .
Second , note the italicization of “ is . ” I was n’t aware that there was a controversy about environmental protection being a family value , but thank you for clearing that up for me .
I hope there are other unasked questions that can be answered so conclusively with slanted capital letters .
Finally , what ’s with the dings on the back bumper ?
Do n’t tell me that refusing to look back when driving in reverse is a family value , too .
The driver seems to have confused environmental protection and conservation .
Conservation can relate to conserving money as well as the environment .
It occurs in many forms , such as turning the lights off when leaving a room and taking quick showers , or larger displays like controlled burns of forests at risk of burning down , clearing flammable underbrush , or controlling too - large wildlife populations .
In contrast , environmental protection is anti-family and precludes human growth .
Real environmentalists , the people who have actually thought about the issue , understand that human overpopulation is the source of many environmental problems .
The effects of global warming , whether anthropologic or natural , would be minimized if the human population had n’t swollen by around 5 billion people within 250 years .
The consequences of ecosystem death , such as colony collapse disorder and massive phytoplankton die - off , would be less significant if 6 billion people ’s lives were n’t hanging in the balance .
Worse , this burgeoning population may be exacerbating their own problems .
The debate over anthropological global warming is well documented and does not need to be addressed here in thorough detail .
Some other crises , such as peak oil , have been caused solely by human consumption .
Cow flatulence , a commonly cited source of emissions , would be a non-issue but for human mass production of these animals for consumption of dairy and meat products .
So no , environmental protection is not a family value .
It does n’t even pass the euphemism test , such as “ family planning , ” which involves abortion and contraceptives .
The best source of environmental protection is not having children , ensuring reduced competition for fundamentally limited resources .
The kind of people who have bumper stickers like the one discussed here do n’t actually care about the environment – just their appearances .
Instead of increasing awareness of overpopulation , they narcissistically drink water from steel canteens , clucking their tongues and stroking their thin hipster beards while parroting Al Gore ’s An Inconvenient Truth , trying to sound stoic .
This guy is n’t even in the cool kids ’ club of Prius and hybrid owners .
Finally , these are the kinds of unthinking , uncritical nitwits who ca n’t see the irreconcilability of environmentalism with their view that humans should have the unlimited right to reproduce at will , and impinging on that “ right ” would be unthinkable .
Except that eugenics is quite “ thinkable ” and something done in the United States until the 1970s !
David Plotz ’s
The Genius Factory provides a good overview of eugenics in the America , which lost support after World War II and the practice ’s inevitable association with Josef Mengele .
While never targeted at the problem of overpopulation , these policies at least promoted a less idiocratic society by preempting the reproduction of the most criminal and least productive .
This in turn would regulate the population , as high IQ people have fewer children .
Some legal codes exist specifically to address the problems of overpopulation .
China ’s one - child policy is famous for pursuing that goal , but arose to limit the state ’s liabilities in providing for its citizens , rather than any specific concern over environmental issues .
India , another nation with more than one billion inhabitants , has taken measures to limit its population due to similar concerns .
As fertility decreases within the nation , the first signs of this plan ’s success are becoming clear .
Despite not having a strict one - child policy , India ’s 11th five - year plan emphasizes the importance of offering condoms , contraceptives and sterilization to women and men .
But in America , the world ’s largest economy , no similar provisions exist .
Beyond the environmental effects , overpopulation leads to increased competition for housing and food , both of which saw dramatically increased prices over the last decade , whether warranted by the market or not .
Bringing it back to Christmas , overpopulation leads to intensified demand for products within a limited time frame , increasing the distortion that holiday shopping has on the business cycle .
Without such tremendous demand , there would n’t be a need for retailers to center their entire year around holiday shopping and spend almost a full quarter operating at a loss .
This is to say nothing of the environmentally harmful and largely frivolous consumption that ’s part and parcel of the season , from lights to wrapping paper to packaging .
Each new member of the consumption orgy only worsens its impact , no matter how conscientious he or she tries to be in using natural resources .
So go forth and spread the word , sons and daughters of the law .
Drink and be merry .
And if someone asks you what you ’re doing to save the environment this holiday season , ask them why they have a kid .

51 health policy experts have signed a letter to the House leadership urging them to pass the Senate bill now -- with cc's to President Obama and Harry Reid .
So it comes down to this .
We have to take the climate crisis approach and simply compile a growing list of experts in order to hammer home the message .
As though 30 million uninsured , 44,000 deaths per year , and a new medical bankruptcy every 30 seconds were n't enough names for a convincer .
Anyway , odd that there are too many progressives lining up on the " denier " side of this metaphor .
It 's a sad fact of life that no Windows PC performs faultlessly over time .
Many of these problems are outside your control , but others can be introduced through user error .
It does n't matter how much simpler Microsoft makes Windows with each successive release : problems , glitches and bugs will always be a part of it .
Each month PC magazine from Future Publishing answer dozens of reader questions , so we 've trawled our extensive archives and dug out 52 of the most relevant fixes to Windows problems .
Where possible we avoid referring to software that promises to fix these ; these " miracle " cures often introduce problems of their own .
Instead we try to concentrate on explaining how to fix various problems using only the tools in Windows itself .
01 . Missing Taskbar icons
Version : XP , Vista , 7
If icons have disappeared from the Taskbar 's notification area , there are two things to try : first , press the Windows key and [ R ] , type " regedit " and press [ Enter ] .
Browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER \
Software \Classes \Local Settings \Software \Microsoft \Windows \ CurrentVersion \TrayNotify , and delete both IconStreams and PastIconsStream values .
Reboot , or log off and back on again .
If the problem persists in XP , and you can live without it , open the Add or Remove Programs Control Panel , click Add / Remove Windows Components , expand Networking Services , and untick " UPnP User Interface " .
Then click OK > Next .
02 . PC wo n't sleep
Version : XP , Vista , 7
If your PC wo n't stay asleep it 's often because a device is configured to bring it out of standby when triggered .
Identify the culprit by pressing the Windows key and [ R ] , type " cmd " and press [ Enter ] .
Type the following line and press [ Enter ] : powercfg –devicequery wake_armed
Now press the Windows key and [ R ] again , but this time type " devmgmt.msc " to open Device Manager .
Find any devices listed earlier , then double - click them and look for an Advanced or Power Management tab .
Check if the device is allowed to bring the PC out of standby – if it is , untick all the boxes that wake it .
Click OK , close Device Manager and test it worked ; repeat the process if necessary .
03 . Quick fixes
Version : XP , Vista , 7
Microsoft has developed the Fix It Center tool , which includes all of the automated fixes for various Windows problems it has released over the last few years .
Download and install it from http:// fixitcenter.support.microsoft.com , then launch the tool from its desktop shortcut .
A list of available troubleshooters for your version of Windows will be listed ; if one describes the problem you 're having then click the Run button next to it and see if it can resolve your problem .
04 . Remove printer drivers
Version : XP , Vista
To ensure all traces of an old printer are removed from your PC , open Printers or Printers and Faxes .
Right - click blank space in the Printers Control Panel and choose Server Properties ( in XP ) or Run as Administrator > Server Properties > Continue ( in Vista ) .
Switch to the Driver tab – if your driver is still present , select it and click Remove .
If you 're using Vista you should leave " Remove driver only " selected only if the drivers were provided by Windows .
Click OK followed by Yes >
Close .
05 . Verify system files
Version : XP , Vista , 7
The System File Checker ( SFC ) tool enables you to scan for – and replace – corrupt and missing fi les .
If you use XP you can use it to scan your entire drive , while in Vista and Windows 7 it can verify individual fi les and folders too .
If you have an installation CD , keep it handy in case it 's needed .
Step 1 . In Windows XP
Click Start >
Run , type " sfc / scannow " and press [ Enter ] to check your entire drive for errors .
Have your installation CD handy in case you 're asked for it .
Step 2 . Vista and Windows 7
Click Start , type " cmd " , then right - click cmd.exe and choose Run as Administrator > Continue .
Type " sfc / scannow " and press [ Enter ] to check your entire drive .
Step 3 . Scan and replace
Alternatively , type " sfc / SCANFILE=path \ fi lename " and press [ Enter ] , replacing path\fi lename with your chosen fi le – such as c:\windows\system32\riched32.dll .
06 . Program compatibility problems
Version : XP , Vista , 7
If you have issues with a program check its website or Google the program 's name , version number and your version of Windows to see if there are any issues with it .
Avoid installing system software not listed as compatible with your version of Windows , otherwise try installing it as normal ; if it fails , Windows 7 may offer to apply compatibility settings to it – see if these work .
If the program installs but wo n't run , right - click its program shortcut and choose Properties > Compatibility Settings .
Select your old version of Windows from the list and click OK .
If this fails , try ticking " Run this program as an administrator " ; in Windows 7 you can also click " Help me choose the settings " to gain access to the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter .
07 . PC keeps rebooting after Windows Update
Version : XP , Vista , 7
If your PC gets stuck in a cycle of rebooting during the update process , you need to undo the updates using System Restore .
If your computer came without a Windows disc , look for an option to access recovery options , or tap [ F8 ] before Windows starts loading , and then choose " Repair your computer " .
If you have an installation disc , boot from it , select your language and then choose " Repair your computer " .
In both cases , when the menu appears , choose System Restore to undo the update .
08 . System Restore not working
Version : XP , Vista , 7
If you 're having problems restoring your computer to an earlier state , try booting into Safe Mode ( tap [ F8 ] as your PC restarts ) and running System Restore from there .
In Vista and Windows 7 there 's also another option : you can also run the tool directly from your Windows disc ( see tip seven , above ) if you can't access Windows .
09 . Windows Media Player missing songs
Version : XP , Vista , 7
Tracks missing from Windows Media Player ?
Try clicking Start > All Programs >
Accessories .
If you 're using XP you should select the Command Prompt , or in Vista or Windows 7 right - click it and choose Run as Administrator .
Switch to the folder containing your music using the cd command ( for example , cd music cd my documents \my music ) , then type " attrib -s *.* /d /s " and press [ Enter ] .
Once complete , open Media Player and press [ F3 ] , or choose Tools > Advanced > Restore Media Library ( in Windows 7 ) to access all your music again .
10 . Action Center
Version : 7
Click the flag icon in the Taskbar 's notification area to access the Action Center .
Here you can get an at - a - glance look at problems , plus launch a series of troubleshooters to help quickly fix the problems that plague you , without getting your hands dirty .
11 . Show printer ink levels
Version : XP , Vista , 7
If you 've just upgraded to a new version of Windows and can't access your printer 's ink levels , the bad news is that Windows installed a basic driver without the function .
Check the manufacturer 's site for a dedicated driver and – if it exists – install that .
12 . Fix Windows driver problems
Version : XP , Vista , 7
Most hardware problems can be traced to the drivers , the software that enables them to work with Windows .
When it comes to tracking down problems , the first port of call should be Windows ' own Device Manager – here 's how to troubleshoot problems using this useful tool .
Step 1 . Open Device Manager
Press [ Windows ] + [ R ] , type " devmgmt . msc " and press [ Enter ] .
Look for yellow exclamation marks next to troublesome hardware devices and double - click one .
Step 2 .
Get error details
Look on the General tab for an error code and description of the problem – if a troubleshoot button is present , click it to see if you can fi x the problem easily .
Step 3 . Search online
If no fix is forthcoming , use the error details as part of your web search – try a general search first , then add your hardware 's make and model if necessary .
13 . Resolve ReadyBoost conflict
Version : Vista , 7
Your PC can only use one ReadyBoost device at a time , and some computers come with built - in flash memory already configured for use with ReadyBoost .
To resolve this conflict click Start , rightclick Computer and select Manage , then under Storage choose " Disk Management " to verify the existence of such a drive .
Look for a program called Intel Turbo Memory Console ( type " Intel " into the Start menu 's Search box ) and open this to disable the built - in drive in favour of your own .
14 . Folder settings not remembered
Version : XP , Vista , 7
If you find you can no longer customise folders to look and behave how you want , the solution involves some editing of with two Registry subkeys – BagMRU and Bags – which are found in two separate locations : Shell and ShellNoRoam under HKEY_ CURRENT_USER \Software\ Microsoft \Windows .
Think this sounds like too much hassle ?
No problem , just open the Microsoft Fix It Center tool ( see tip three ) and run the " Diagnose and repair Windows Files and Folder Problems " wizard .
This will do the hard work for you .
15 . PC keeps rebooting
Version : XP , Vista , 7
If your PC restarts unexpectedly after briefly displaying a blue screen , then it 's encountered a STOP error .
If this keeps occurring you need to identify it .
In Vista and Windows 7 you can stop Windows automatically restarting from the Windows boot menu that should appear ; if you use XP click Start , right - click My Computer and select Properties >
Advanced tab .
Click Settings under " Startup and Recovery " and untick " Automatically restart " before clicking OK twice .
Now when the STOP error occurs you 'll see a blue screen with details of the error message ; note down the description , any files it refers to , and the STOP error code .
Then search the web for these terms to hopefully find a solution .
16 . Blocked startup programs
Version : XP , Vista , 7
If you get this message after starting Windows , it means one of the programs set to start with it is attempting to work with elevated privileges .
This is symptomatic of older programs , so either source an update or an alternative program if you can .
Right - click the message , choose " Run blocked program " and select the errant tool in question .
Then click Continue when prompted .
17 .
Fix file - sharing problems
Version : XP , Vista , 7
Verify your PCs are on the same network – wireless or wired – and all on the same workgroup ( click Start , right - click Computer and select Properties ; in XP you need the Computer Name tab ) .
Is File and Printer Sharing enabled ?
Check from the Network and Sharing Center in Vista / Windows 7 – ensure your network is Home or Work .
In Windows 7 click Choose homegroup and sharing options >
Change advanced sharing settings ; in XP right - click a folder and choose Properties >
Sharing tab .
Disable password protected filesharing in Vista or Windows 7 if sharing with PCs running XP , and check your firewall has placed your network in a trusted zone .
18 . Access denied error on system files
Version : XP
Not long ago dealing with " access denied " errors relating to system files or the Registry involved downloading a tool and typing out a complex script .
Now you can resolve this issue – sometimes found when installing SP3 – by downloading a dedicated fix - it tool from http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9730795.
19 .
Low memory error
Version : XP , Vista , 7
Fix this problem by making sure Windows is set to handle your virtual memory settings ; open the System Control Panel and either click " Advanced system settings " or switch to the Advanced tab .
Then under Performance click Settings , select Advanced and click Change .
You need to verify that either " Automatically manage paging file for all drives " ( in Vista or Windows 7 ) or " System managed size " ( in Windows XP ) is selected , then if necessary click Set >
OK , rebooting when prompted .
20 .
No sound in Windows
Version : XP , Vista , 7
Before running the Microsoft Fix It Center tool ( see tip three ) , open the " Sound " or " Sounds and Audio Devices " Control Panel .
Select the Playback or Audio tab , and verify the device is set to be the default ; if not , select it from the list to fix the problem .
21 . Create a repair disc
Version : 7
If your PC did n't come with a Windows installation disc , click Start , type " backup " and click Backup and Restore .
Select " Create a system repair disc " and put a blank CD or DVD in your writeable drive to create a bootable disc with the " Repair your computer " options on it .
22 . Where 's GPEDIT ?
Version : XP , Vista
If you 're running one of the Home editions of Windows , you 'll find the gpedit.msc tool is missing .
If you 're instructed to fix a problem using this tool and you 're running Windows XP , visit here to find the equivalent setting in the Registry .
Alternatively , for the Home edition of Vista you can download an Excel spreadsheet with the various settings from here .
23 . System Restore problems

Restore points are cumulative in reverse – each new one only saves what 's changed – so old points rely on newer ones to work ; if one corrupts then all older ones are lost .
That means the older a Restore point , the less reliable it is , so avoid using anything but the most recent one .
Open Disk Cleanup ( Start > All Programs > Accessories > System tools ) and – if prompted – choose " all users " .
On the More Options tab delete all but the newest Restore point .
If all else fails , disable System Restore and lose all Restore points , then re-enable it .
For XP use the tool here ; in Vista and Windows 7 open System Protection , untick all the boxes and click Turn off System Restore > Apply .
Tick your system drive again and click Apply to switch it back on .
If you 're plagued with specific error messages , or System Restore does n't work well , you 'll find useful solutions here .

Many find it interesting to glimpse inside the lives of famous thinkers in an effort to understand where such thought and intelligence is rooted .
In that vein , here is a peek into the routines and rituals that writers , philosophers , and statesmen have depended on to keep their work on track and their thoughts flowing .
Whether you need inspiration to make it through the next college semester of your bachelor 's degree , finishing up your master 's degree program , or are working on a future best - selling novel , explore these daily rituals you may want to incorporate into your life .
CS Lewis .
Writer and thinker CS Lewis had a very clear schedule of his day , with activities such as work , walking , meals , tea , and socializing down to the very hour they should be done .
He even describes when beer should be enjoyed ( not at 11:00 for fear of running over the allotted 10 minutes for the break ) .
John Cheever .
American writer John Cheever wore his only suit of clothing each morning as he rode the elevator down to a basement room where he worked .
Upon arriving there , he would undress to his underwear , hang up his suit , and get to work .
He would dress to go back upstairs for lunch and again at the end of his day when he would ride the elevator back home .
Fred Rogers .
Do n't doubt that Fred Rogers was indeed a great thinker , despite the fact that he is best known as the familiar Mr. Rogers from the long - lasting PBS children 's show .
His television show was a safe place for many young children , by his design , and he fought hard , in his quiet manner , for the show to stay on the air .
The famous routine that started and ended his show was not the only routine in his life .
Each day he would wake at 5:30 and begin his day with reading , writing , study , and prayer .
He would take a swim most days of his life , take a late - afternoon nap , and go to bed at 9:30 each night .
Perhaps the most idiosyncratic of his rituals was that he kept his weight at 143 pounds his entire adult life .
He saw his weight one day and realized it aligned with the number of letters in " I love you " and vowed to maintain that weight , which he did .
Stephen King .
This famed writer keeps to a strict routine each day , starting the morning with a cup of tea or water and his vitamin .
King sits down to work between 8:00 and 8:30 in the same seat with his papers arranged on his desk in the same way .
He claims that starting off with such consistency provides a signal to his mind in preparation for his work .
Gertrude Stein .
This famous writer discovered inspiration in her car .
Apparently she would sit in her parked car and write poetry on scraps of paper .
Immanuel Kant .
Kant would begin his day with one or two cups of weak tea and a pipe of tobacco .
While smoking , he would meditate .
He would then prepare for his lectures , conduct lectures from 7:00 to 11:00 , write , then have lunch .
Lunch would be followed by a walk and time with his friend .
The evening would consist of a bit more light work and reading .
Barack Obama .
Taking care of physical fitness and family are two important elements of President Obama 's daily ritual .
He starts his day with a workout at 6:45 , reads several newspapers , has breakfast with his family , and then starts his work day just before 9:00 in the morning .
He may work as late as 10:00 some evenings , but always stops to have dinner with his family each day .
Alexander Dumas .
Whether or not he had heard the adage about keeping the doctor away , the writer of The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers , Dumas started each day eating an apple under the Arc de Triomphe .
Benjamin Franklin .
Franklin kept to a tight schedule , starting his day waking at 4:00 am .
Until 8:00 , he would wake , wash , eat breakfast , and think about what he would accomplish for the day .
From 8:00 to 12:00 , he worked .
Lunch was from 12:00 - 1:00 , where he ate , read , or looked over his accounts .
He then worked until 5:00 .
The evening was filled with dinner , cleaning up , music or conversation , a look back over his day , and then bed at 10:00 .
Haruki Murakami .
This popular Japanese novelist sticks to a specific daily schedule that begins at 4:00 when he awakes .
He writes for five or six hours , then either runs 10 k or swims 1500 meters ( or sometimes , both ) .
After his workout , he reads and listens to music until he goes to bed at 9:00 .
Murakami claims that writing a novel requires both the physical and mental strength that his routine provides .
Franz Kafka .
Kafka started his day at his job at the Workers ' Accident Insurance Institute from 8:30 to 2:30 .
Afterward he would lunch until 3:30 , then sleep until 7:30 .
Upon waking , he would do exercises and have dinner with his family .
He began writing at 11:00 in the evening , usually working until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning –sometimes later .
Toni Morrison .
Writer Toni Morrison describes not only her daily routine , but the importance of rituals to writers .
Morrison describes her own ritual involving making a cup of coffee and watching the light come into the day .
Her habit of rising early was first formed as the mother to three children , but after her children left home , she discovered a routine of her own –that still includes early mornings .
Morrison urges all writers to look at what time of day they are most productive and what type of surrounding is most conducive to their work to help form rituals that will promote creativity .
Ingmar Bergman .
This famous director , writer , and producer of film and drama demanded quiet and set schedules .
While working on a play in 1996 , he was reported to stand outside the rehearsal hall half an hour before rehearsal to ensure the actors were not socializing .
He had a set time for beginning work , taking lunch , and ending work .
He disliked noise , meeting new people , and crowds of people .
While he aspired to a quite life of writing without deadlines on the island of Faro , he could not actually stay with his retirement , and returned to the scheduled life of work .
He was still working just a few years prior to his death in 2007 .
Charles Darwin .
In his middle and later years , Darwin stuck to a very rigid schedule that started at 7:00 in the morning with a short walk , then breakfast .
He would then work throughout the morning .
Lunch , at 12:45 , was his biggest meal of the day .
His afternoon was also scheduled and consisted of two walks , reading , and backgammon .
Darwin could not tolerate much socializing , and kept it to a maximum of 30 minutes at a time .
Kingsley Amis .
This British comic novelist and poet was also famous for his love of alcohol .
He kept to a strict routine of writing in the morning until about 1:00 , when he would take care of his dressing and shaving , then begin the afternoon with a drink and a smoke .
He would work until lunch at 2:00 or 2:15 , sometimes going back after lunch to work and sometimes not .
He considered any work accomplished in the afternoon a bonus .
When the bar opened at 6:00 , he would fortify himself with more alcohol and work again until 8:30 .
Winston Churchill .
While Churchill 's routine may not be for everyone , it seemed to revolve around lots of food and drink .
He would rise at 7:30 and stay in bed until 11:00 where he would eat breakfast , read several newspapers , and dictate to his secretaries .
When he finally got out of bed , he would bathe , take a walk outside , then settle in to work with a weak whisky and soda .
Lunch began at 1:00 and lasted until 3:30 , after which he would work or play cards or backgammon with his wife .
At 5:00 he napped for an hour and a half , then bathed again and got ready for dinner .
Dinner was considered the highlight of his day , with much socializing , drinking , and smoking that sometimes went past midnight .
After his guests left , he would then work for another hour or so before heading to bed .
Aldous Huxley .
This famous thinker and writer would start early each day sharing a breakfast with his wife .
He would work uninterrupted until lunchtime .
After lunch , he and his wife would go for a drive or a walk , then he would return to work again from 5:00 to 7:00 , then have dinner .
After dinner , his wife would read to him until almost midnight .
Due to an eye illness early in life that left Huxley with very poor eyesight , he relied heavily on his wife to do many activities for him besides reading .
She often typed his manuscripts and was even reported to have cut his steak for him at dinner .
James Thurber .
Another writer with difficulties seeing , Thurber would often compose his work in his head at almost anyplace he found himself .
His wife would recognize the look in his eyes and interrupt him mid-paragraph while they were socializing at a party , and his daughter saw him retreat into his private world over dinner .
His method later in life was to spend all morning composing his text in his head , then between 2:00 and 5:00 he would dictate about 2,000 words to his secretary .
Gunter Grass .
This German writer starts his day at 9:00 or 10:00 with a long breakfast that includes reading and music .
Afterwards , he begins working , taking only a break for coffee in the afternoon , and finishes at 7:00 in the evening .
He claims that he needs daylight to work effectively .
When he writes at night , the work comes easily , but upon reading it in the morning , appears to be of lesser quality .
John Grisham .
When Grisham first began writing , he still had his day job as a lawyer .
In order to do both , he stuck to a ritual of waking at 5:00 and shower , then head off to his office , just five minutes from home .
He had to be sitting at his desk with a cup of coffee and a yellow legal pad by 5:30 .
He gave himself a goal of writing one page per day .
Sometimes this page went as quickly as ten minutes while other days required one or two hours .
After finishing his daily page of writing , Grisham would then turn his attention to his day job .
Gerhard Richter .
Famous German artist , Gerhard Richter , sticks to the same basic routine he has for years .
He wakes at 6:15 and makes breakfast for his family , then takes his daughter to school .
By 8:00 he is in his studio , where he stays until lunch at 1:00 .
After lunch , he returns to this studio until the evening .
He claims that his days are not usually filled with painting , but with the planning of his pieces .
He puts off the actual painting until he has created a kind of crisis for himself , then pours himself into it .
Simone de Beauvoir .
French writer and lifelong companion to Jean - Paul Sartre , Simone de Beauvoir reported that she got bored if she did n't work and tried to work every day except the few months she would take off to travel .
While writing , she woke with tea , then began her work around 10:00 .
She would work until 1:00 , then have lunch and socialize with friends .
At 5:00 , she would resume working , usually at Sartre 's apartment , until she would stop for the day at 9:00 .
Jean - Paul Sartre .
In a letter Sartre wrote to de Beauvoir some thirty years before her recounting of her daily working routine , Sartre describes his days , which is noticeably similar to the pattern later described by de Beauvoir .
Sartre writes about waking early and having coffee in a cafe , then reading , teaching classes and private lessons , then lunch .
After lunch , he would do more reading and letter writing .
Jacques Barzun .
This French - born American historian and cultural critic celebrated his 100th birthday just two years ago and still enjoys a life of routine and work .
He starts his day at 6:00 with coffee and the local newspaper , followed by 45 minutes of exercise , then a morning of work in his study .
He spends his afternoon reading .
Cocktails are at 6:30 , followed by a light dinner .
Barzun 's evening is spent reading the New York Times , no TV , and bed by 9:30 .
Ernest Hemingway .
Hemingway described his writing ritual as starting just as the sun began rising , then working straight through until whatever he had to say was said .
He likens completing his morning of writing to making love to someone you love–being both empty and fulfilled at the same time .
Upon completing that morning 's work , he would wait until the next morning to begin again , going over his ideas in his head and holding on to the anticipation of starting again the next day .
Allison Henry had a rough year .
A lot of bad shit went down , but long story short , her vagina fell out .
Today , Ami Angelowicz at The Frisky detailed Henry ’s story .
“ I am going to spare you the details because I am squeamish and feel too pukey to write about them , ” explains Angelowicz .
She does pass along this little tidbit about Henry ’s lady - bits , however : “ As a consolation prize for all of her suffering ( and it was a lot of suffering ) , she now has the vagina of a 13 - year - old with perfect - looking labia . ”
Allow me to list all the horrific medical details of Henry ’s vagina - falling - out that are far , far less puke - tastic than the phrase “ the vagina of a 13 - year - old with perfect - looking labia . ”
From Henry ’s testimony on MomLogic.com ( emphasis mine ) :
“ About ten weeks into my pregnancy , I was doing prenatal yoga and it felt like someone had rammed a pitchfork up my butt . ”
“ when I ran to the bathroom , I saw I was gushing blood everywhere . ”
“ I kept bleeding for 15 weeks straight . ”
for 15 weeks straight . ”
“ One day in the bathroom , I felt something kind of strange when I was wiping .
There was n’t really a hole there — - it felt kind of flat . ”
— - it felt kind of flat . ”
“ I had a massive emergency appendectomy , I got gangrene , and I was hospitalized . ”
, and I was hospitalized . ”
“ One night , I took a look down there , and it was like my insides were on the outside and they were coming out . ”
and they were coming out . ”
“ I went to my doctor and said , ‘ My vagina is falling out of my body ! ‘”
‘” “ It was literally falling out of my body . ”
of my body . ”
“ It turned out I had complete uterine prolapse , where the uterus is falling out of the body .
I also had rectocele , where the walls of the vagina are weakened , and your rectum is pushing into the back wall of your vagina .
That explained why I had been constipated for months . “
“ “ I had to have surgery , and they took my uterus out .
All the ligaments that hold the uterus in place were completely shredded by all the blood I ’d lost in my second pregnancy . ”
in my second pregnancy . ”
“ My doctor . . . had to untwist my bladder and place it right - side - up .
It had twisted and turned upside down . ”
and place it right - side - up .
It had twisted and turned upside down . ” “ seven days after my surgery , I was watching ‘ Snow White ’ with my daughter when my son came into the room .
He did n’t like the seating arrangement and sort of lunged on top of my daughter .
I had to push him off her , and when I did , I heard a loud ripping sound .
Oh , no .
I looked under the comforter , and my entire bed was covered with blood .
It was like a horror movie — - you could see the blood filling the entire white bed . ”
.
Oh , no .
I looked under the comforter , and my entire bed was covered with blood .
— - you could see the blood filling the entire white bed . ”
“ In 15 minutes , I had passed 10 huge palm - sized blood clots . ”
. ” “ the ER doctor was trying to figure out where the blood was coming from , but could n’t see because there was too much blood gushing out .
. .
He called my doctor and said : ‘ I ca n’t see where it ’s coming from .
She ’s bleeding so fast and so much , I ca n’t see .
I ’m killing her ! ' ”
! ' ”
“ They put me on an antibiotic that I was allergic to — I got a full body rash and was covered in red bumps from my head to my ankles . ”
and was covered in red bumps from my head to my ankles . ”
“ Six months later , I started having this weird discharge that had a funky odor .
I was still in pain .
It turned out my body was now rejecting the second set of sutures . ”
Yep !
I would rather hear about gangrene , hand - sized blood clots , full - body rashes , twisted bladders , loud internal ripping , weird discharge , anal pitchforks , month - long genital bleeding , and vagina loss than the happy ending that comes at the conclusion of this medical horror :
“ The experience has been a total nightmare , but I ’m happy to say I ’m on the mend .
We just had a cocktail party to celebrate me feeling healthy .
And I do have the vagina of a 13 - year - old virgin , with a perfect labia , as a bonus . ”
Listen , Henry .
I ’m happy for you .
I am .
You went through some bad shit , and now your vagina is back inside your body , and I think that ’s wonderful .
But I never , ever , ever , ever again want to have to think about a grown woman having a “ the vagina of a 13 - year - old virgin . ”
That ’s some messed up heebie - jeebies shit .
I do n’t even want to Google that phrase , ever , for fear of what I might find .
Apparently , virginal pre-teen is kind of the gold standard for new vaginas on MomLogic.com .
Hear the testimony of “ Sara , ” a 37 - year - old woman who recently became “ a virtual born - again virgin ” with her brand - spanking - new genitalia :
So now I ’m on the mend , with a teenage - sized vagina .
My husband has been such a doll since I ’ve been home ; cooking , vacuuming , cleaning and dressing the kids , taking them to and from school , buying me chocolates and cheerleader costumes . . . how sweet .
My sister replied to this , “ Well , how many husbands get two vaginas out of the same old wife ? ”
As far as how this new organ is going to work in six weeks , when all restrictions are lifted , who knows ?
The way things are at present , no man ’s apparatus , even of the Fisher Price variety , could ever fit down there .
Still , I ’ll try to write a follow up report when it happens .
That is , if my husband and I ever leave the bedroom again !
Eww !
Earmuffs !
I know you ’re all excited about your new vaginas or whatever , but could you please refrain from referring to them as “ teenage - sized , ” admiring your newly “ virginal ” look , and especially — - I ’m begging you — - invoking Fisher Price ?

Australian rock musician Rowland S Howard has died .
The former Birthday Party guitarist is believed to have been battling liver cancer and was awaiting a transplant .
Howard 's career spanned three decades , in which he released a number of solo albums and had a number of collaborations with acclaimed Australian musician Nick Cave .
As we count down to end of 2009 , the emerging star of this year 's holiday shopping season is shaping up to be the electronic book reader ( or e-reader ) .
From Amazon 's Kindle to Barnes and Noble 's forthcoming Nook , e-readers are starting to transform how we buy and read books in the same way mp3s changed how we buy and listen to music .
Unfortunately , e-reader technology also presents significant new threats to reader privacy .
E-readers possess the ability to report back substantial information about their users ' reading habits and locations to the corporations that sell them .
And yet none of the major e-reader manufacturers have explained to consumers in clear unequivocal language what data is being collected about them and why .
As a first step towards addressing these problems , EFF has created a first draft of our Buyer 's Guide to E - Book Privacy .
We 've examined the privacy policies for the major e-readers on the market to determine what information they reserve the right to collect and share .
( Updated Jan 6 2010 : We 've updated and corrected this guide .
Please read the latest version instead . )
* Based on the proposed Google Books Privacy Policy .
The policy is subject to change prior to final acceptance of the Google Books Settlement .
** The Nook will not ship until January 2010 and as yet has no publicly available product - specific Terms of Use or Privacy Policy .
Results based on the general Barnes and Noble Privacy Policy .
-->
For example , Google 's new Google Book Search Project has the ability to track reading habits at an unprecedented level of granularity .
In particular , according to the proposed Google Books Privacy Policy , web servers will automatically " log " each book and page you searched for and read , how long you viewed it for , and what book or page you continued onto next :
When you use Google Books , we receive log information similar to what we receive in Web Search .
This includes : the query term or page request ( which may include specific pages within a book you are browsing ) , Internet Protocol address , browser type , browser language , the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser .
In addition , because users must have a Google Account in order to purchase and view books , Google maintains a dossier , via its Web History service , of all books purchased unless the user gives up the right to view a book he or she already " bought . "
Physical e-reader devices pose similar threats to reader privacy .
For example , the Kindle does not sell , but rather licenses , the books , magazines , and other materials offered for wireless download through its Kindle Store , which can only be used on a particular device .
This implicitly requires Amazon to know what reading material a user has licensed at any given time .
Even more disturbing , however , is the broad latitude Amazon gives itself to keep track of how customers are using their device .
From the Kindle License Agreement and Terms of Use :
Information Received .
The Device Software will provide Amazon with data about your Device and its interaction with the Service [ i.e. the wireless connection , purchases through the Kindle Store , etc. ] ( such as available memory , up - time , log files and signal strength ) and information related to the content on your Device and your use of it ( such as automatic bookmarking of the last page read and content deletions from the Device ) .
Annotations , bookmarks , notes , highlights , or similar markings you make in your Device are backed up through the Service .
Information we receive is subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice .
In other words , your Kindle will periodically send information about you to Amazon .
But exactly what information is sent ?
Amazon 's wording — " information related to the content on your Device and your use of it " — reads so broadly that it appears to allow Amazon to track all content that users put on the device , regardless of whether that content is purchased from Amazon .
Some security researchers have indicated that the Kindle may even be tracking its users ' GPS locations .
Is this the future of reading ?
Thankfully , there are some e-reader options that do not connect wirelessly , nor include any privacy or " terms of use " provisions that allow monitoring of what you put on the device or how you use it .
Sony 's Reader , for example , may collect information about what books you buy from its own eBook Store , yet the Reader also works with books purchased from other sources as well .
Even safer still , popular e-reader software programs , such as open - source FBReader , allow users to download content from a number of sources onto a multitude of devices , including one 's computer or mobile , without handing over all information about their reading habits to one source , or anyone for that matter .
Still , there are no perfect options this holiday season for the many shoppers who consider Internet - connectivity to be a must - have feature for their e-readers .
Let 's hope that by this time next year , e-reader manufacturers have stepped up to the challenge of taking their users ' privacy seriously .

Advertisement Google has unveiled an own - brand smartphone called the Nexus One .
The wraps were taken off the handset at an invitation - only event held at Google 's Mountain View HQ .
The Nexus One is a slim , touchscreen phone built in partnership with Taiwanese manufacturer HTC and runs Google 's Android operating system .
It will be sold via Google 's website and initially be available on T - mobile in America followed by Vodafone in Europe and Verizon in the US .
Direct from Google it will cost $ 529 ( £ 331 ) and on contract with T - Mobile $ 179 ( £ 112 ) .
Google said the phone would ship from launch day .
Mario Queiroz , Google vice president for product management , described the unveiling as " the next stage in the evolution of Android " .
Mr Queiroz said there were now more than 20 Android phones available from 59 carriers in 48 nations .
The release of the Nexus One is seen as a move to ensure Google remains relevant as people search the web using mobile phones rather than typing queries into a PC .
Google makes the lion 's share of its revenue by selling adverts linked to those queries .
NEXUS ONE HANDSET 3.7 inch touchscreen 1GHz snapdragon processor 5 Megapixel camera with LED flash GPS and compass Accelerometer Noise cancellation technology Voice recognition can be used with all applications Light sensor changes screen brightness to conserve power 512MB
Flash memory with SD card slot ( expandable to 32GB )
At the briefing , Google said the Nexus was " a point of convergence where the web meets phone and is an example of what is possible on mobile through Android . "
" You will see it pushes the limits of what is possible on a mobile phone today , " said Peter Chou , HTC chief executive .
Google has set up its own phone portal through which people can get a handset tied to one of several mobile operators or untethered direct from the search firm .
Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi said this could be its main selling point as it would mean owners could decide which network to sign up with .
" You buy the phone and then choose what sim card you want to put in , " she said .
Those buying an unlocked phone would be able to use it as a GSM phone on almost any network .
A spokesperson for Vodafone told BBC News that it was the first operator to " bring the Google phone to the UK " but stressed that it was a " non-exclusive agreement " , meaning other networks could also offer the phone soon .
He said it would be available " in the coming weeks " but only from Google 's website .
Figures from Gartner suggest that Android has about a 3.5 % share of the global smartphone market .
By comparison Nokia has a 39 % share and Apple 17 % .
It emerged on 5 January that Google sent out Nexus One phones to some industry figures in mid-December so they can try them out .
Recipients were asked to keep quiet about their experiences until 5 January .
" The Google phone is n't much different than the iPhone , " wrote VC Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures on his blog .
" It 's basically an Android clone of the iPhone . "
Google also announced on 5 January a plan to launch " pay to call " adverts that would appear on mobile phones .
These would work in a similar way to the " pay to click " adverts that populate many websites and which form a significant chunk of Google 's revenue .

A short while ago I wrote about my work on DirectWrite usage in Firefox .
Next to DirectWrite , Microsoft also published another new API with Windows 7 ( and the Vista Platform Update ) , called Direct2D .
Direct2D is designed as a replacement for GDI and functions as a vector graphics rendering engine , using GPU acceleration to give large performance boosts to transformations and blending operations .
Why GPU acceleration ?
First of all why is GPU acceleration important ?
Well , in modern day computers , it 's pretty common to have a relatively powerful GPU .
Since the GPU can specialize in very specific operations ( namely vertex transformations and pixel operations ) , it is much faster than the CPU for those specific operations .
Where the fastest desktop CPUs clock in the hundreds of GFLOPS ( billion floating point operations per second ) , the fastest GPUs clock in the TFLOPS ( trillion floating point operations per second ) .
Currently the GPU is mainly used in video games , and its usage in desktop rendering is limited .
Direct2D signifies an important step towards a future where more and more desktop software will use the GPU where available to provide better quality and better performance rendering .
Direct2D usage in Firefox
A while ago I started my investigation into Direct2D usage in firefox ( see bug 527707 ) .
Since then we 've made significant progress and are now able to present a Firefox browser completely rendered using Direct2D , making intensive usage of the GPU ( this includes the UI , menu bars , etc. ) .
I wo n't be showing any screenshots , since it is not supposed to look much different .
But I will be sharing some technical details , first performance indications and a test build for those of you running Windows 7 or an updated version of Vista !
Implementation
Direct2D has been implemented as a Cairo backend , meaning our work can eventually be used to facilitate Direct2D usage by all Cairo based software .
We use Direct3D textures as backing store for all surfaces .
This allows us to implement operations not supported by Direct2D using Direct3D , this will prevent software fallbacks being needed , which will require readbacks .
Since a readback forces the GPU to transfer memory to the CPU before the CPU can read it , readbacks have significant performance penalties because of GPU - CPU synchronization being required .
On Direct3D10 + hardware this should not negatively impact performance , it does mean it is harder to implement effective D2D software fallback .
Although in that scenario we could continue using Cairo with GDI as our vector graphics rendering system .
Internally here 's a rough mapping of cairo concepts to D2D concepts :
cairo_surface_t - ID2D1RenderTarget
cairo_pattern_t - ID2D1Brush
cairo clip path - ID2D1 Layer with GeometryMask
cairo_path_t - ID2D1 PathGeometry
cairo_stroke_style_t - ID2D1StrokeStyle
More about the implementation can be learned by looking at the patches included on the bug !
Now to look at how well it works .
Website Benchmarks
First of all let 's look at the page rendering times .
I 've graphed the rendering time for several common websites together with the error margin of my measurements .
The used testing hardware was a Core i7 920 with a Radeon HD4850 Graphics card :
There 's some interesting conclusions to be drawn from this graph .
First of all it can be seen that Direct2D , on this hardware , performance significantly better or similarly on all tested website .
What can also be seen is that on complexly structured websites the performance advantages are significantly less , and the error margin in the measurements can be seen to be larger ( i.e. different rendering runs of the same site deviated more strongly ) .
The exact reasons for this I am still unsure of .
One reason could be is that the websites contain significant amounts of text or complex polygons as well , for those scenarios with few transformations and blending operations the GPU will show smaller advantages over the CPU .
Additionally the CPU will be spending more time processing the actual items to be displayed , which might decrease the significance of the actual drawing operations somewhat .
Other Performance Considerations
Although the static website rendering is an interesting benchmarks .
There are other , atleast as important considerations to the performance .
As websites become more graphically intense dynamic graphics will start playing a larger role .
Especially in user interfaces .
If we look at some interesting sites using fancy opacity and transformation effects ( take for example photos.svg ) , we can see that D2D provides a much better experience on the test system .
Where on sizing up photos GDI will quickly drop in framerate to a jittery experience , Direct2D will remain completely smooth .
Another interesting consideration is scrolling .
Since on scrolling only small parts of the website need to be re-drawn , it has the potential of creating a much smoother scrolling experience when using Direct2D .
This is also the feedback we 've received from people utilizing the test builds .
Conclusions
Although the investigation and implementation are still in an early stage , we can conclude that things are looking very promising for Direct2D .
Though older PCs with pre-D3D10 graphics cards and WDDM 1.0 drivers will not show significant improvements , going into the future most PCs will support DirectX 10 +.
PCs in the future could allow providing extremely smooth graphical experiences for web - content like SVG or transformed CSS .
Interestingly , Microsoft has also announced IE9 will feature Direct2D support as well only shortly ago .
Feel free to download and try a build of Firefox with Direct2D support here .
There are several known issues and in some cases some rendering artifacts may appear .
In general it should be quite usable on D3D10 graphics cards .
It may or may not work on D3D9 graphic cards , depending on exact graphics card specifications .
Well , that 's it for now , I hope I 've given you an interesting first glance into the future of desktop graphics .
NOTE : If you want to do your own performance analysis , please see my other blogpost about the subject here
NOTE2 : For those not used to running experimental builds .
If you would just execute this .exe while having normal firefox running .
You will get another window of your normal firefox .
You need to either close your normal firefox , or run it from the command line on a different profile , using : ' firefox - no - remote - P d2d ' .
Lord Hutton has responded to reports that a 70 - year gagging order he imposed on records and photos relating to the death of the government scientist Dr David Kelly could be challenged by stating that the documents could be revealed to doctors .
In a U - turn , Hutton said the information could be released to five doctors who are seeking to reopen the inquest into Kelly 's death .
" I requested that the postmortem report should not be disclosed for 70 years as I was concerned that the publication of that report would cause [ Kelly 's ] daughters and his wife further and unnecessary distress , " Hutton said .
" I consider that the disclosure of the report to doctors and their legal advisers for the purposes of legal proceedings would not undermine the protection which I wished to give . "
Kelly 's body was found in woods close to his Oxfordshire home in 2003 , shortly after it was revealed that he was the source of a BBC report casting doubt on the government 's claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that could be fired within 45 minutes .
An inquest was suspended by Lord Falconer , then lord chancellor , before the Hutton inquiry , and then not resumed after Hutton 's report in 2004 concluded that Kelly killed himself by cutting an artery in his wrist .
News that the secrecy ruling would be lifted came after the Guardian reported that five doctors were considering a legal challenge to the decision to keep the material secret .
" Lord Hutton made a request for the records provided to the inquiry , not produced in evidence , to be closed for 30 years , and that medical ( including postmortem ) reports and photographs be closed for 70 years , " the doctors were told in a letter .
The doctors ' request came in response to continuing questions about the Hutton inquiry 's finding that Kelly killed himself .
" We do not suggest his suicide was impossible , but it was so improbable as to demand a much more detailed investigation of what happened , " said Michael Powers QC , who has been working with the doctors who requested the material from the coroner .
" A coroner would not have concluded Kelly 's death was a suicide unless it was proved beyond reasonable doubt .
From that point of view , and from a lawyer 's and a medical professional 's point of view , there is a justifiable concern that there was not sufficient inquiry into those circumstances , " he added .
Hutton 's ruling was not made public at the time .
Lawyers said they were unsure of the legal basis for his decision to keep the material secret and to choose a period of 70 years .
Multitasking messes with the brain in more than one way .
But there is another aspect : the inability to meet deadlines .
Multitasking may seem more efficient on the surface , but actually takes more time in the end .
Imagine three tasks A , B and C , that would require 10 minutes each ( or 10 hours or 10 days ) .
If they are executed consecutively , the first is complete at H+10 , the second at H+20 , the third at H +30 .
Now imagine that you spend 5 minutes alternately on each task .
The result speaks for itself : You will not save time in completing task C , you will have a 5 minutes ( or hours or days ) delay in completing task B , and a 10 minutes delay in completing task A.
If you take into account the time required for the individual reconcentration between two tasks , multitasking leads you to a much larger delay .
Fire is a very powerful element .
Fire in its physical form can do for you what the sun itself does for our planet .
The time fire was discovered , it changed human life forever .
Just think about the times you sat facing a bonfire or fireplace .
There ’s something enchanting about the way the blaze sizzle and pop .
Then suddenly , you started staring .
That ’s how hypnotic it is .
Below are some cool or should we say hot collection of captivating fire photography shots .
Fire dancing is a performance art form which combines equipment on fire into a spectacular dance .
Many ethnicities have practiced fire dancing in a variety of forms , and fire dancing performance are growing very popular in the West , where many people are fascinated to the mixture of beauty and danger .
When done properly , fire dancing is an impressive thing to gaze at , and is usually performed at night so that spectators can see fine distinctions of the presentation .
Let ’s view now some of this stunning photography shots of skillful fire dance performers .

If anyone 's interested ...
I titled this blog " if anyone 's interested " , and the web address says " thoughts just for thinkers " .
And that kind of describes what this blog 's about .
Are you in the wrong place ?
I do n't know .
I cordially invite you , however , to find out for yourself by clicking around and reading .
I ’ve long believed in a diversity of political viewpoints , and consider myself excited to include a wide variety of anarchist beliefs under the no-state spectrum .
Hell , I ’m even soft on anarcho - capitalists , because agorism is kind of interesting ( not that I am anarcho - capitalist , mind you .
I identify as anti-capitalist ) .
But nationalist anarchism is not anarchism .
It is repackaged fascism .
I want to talk about this because I believe that fascist leaders have adopted the sexy , sexy characteristics of anarchism in order to entice young , rebellious folks into being their footsoldiers , to delude them into thinking that the problems they face are racialized .
Or to trick people into thinking that being proud of your culture means that you need to keep it “ pure , ” that the white race is somehow threatened by multiculturalism .
here are the facts :
* anarchism seeks to end the nation - state and destroy borders
* anarchism has always been , and will always be , multicultural .
Although most of the “ famed ” anarchist thinkers in the western world were white , many of them were not considered white at the time , and anarchism has found its way onto every continent .
In America , anarchist papers were printed in all sorts of languages .
* whiteness is a social construct : that is to say , it is as manufactured by our society as gender is .
Yes , some people have different racial characteristics , but the definition of what makes one “ white ” or “ black ” is a matter of social opinion , an opinion that has long been shifting .
By this understanding , anarchists do indeed intend to destroy whiteness .
Or “ whitey . ”
But we ’re not talking about killing white people for being white .
* fascism is the polar opposite of anarchism .
Fascism is totalitarian , and beats the race - war drum mostly so as to inspire morons into doing their bidding .
* the nazis rounded up the anarchists and other leftists pretty much first and foremost .
National Socialism had every intention to exterminate us as well as everyone else .
Birds Before the Storm
I prefer to be proud about things i did or am responsible for , but I never ever could feel pride for things I could not even decide upon .
I can be proud about my music for example , but never that I was born in Austria .
I am of course happy to live in a country like Austria instead of a poor country , but I am definitely not proud about that .
It seems for me that Nazis have nothing else to be proud of than the coincidence that they were born in their father - land .
Even if you are proud of your country , that does n’t naturally mean you ’re a Nazi .
But if national pride is your most important pride , and probably the only pride you have , then it starts getting a bit weird .
…
If you think you are an individualist or rebel because you like fascism then you are wrong .
There is no space for individualism in fascist regimes .
In fascism conformity and obedience are the most important value .
This goes for Nazi Germany as well as the Stalin - Soviet Union .
Fascism means extreme conformity and following orders and leaders .
You have to be a working component in the huge fascist system - thinking for yourself will disturb this system .
First , if you tolerate all political beliefs , that means you tolerate all political beliefs .
Because anarchism is a big umbrella , it easily allows you to tolerate anything -- except anti-anarchism .
So it 's clear that anarchists are not going to tolerate their opposite , which makes me wonder why they'd hide behind the passive - aggressive excuse of " we 're tolerant , they 're not . "
You 're not tolerant .
In fact , no political view tolerates its opposites .
Fascism and National Socialism ( he confuses the two , being a typical liberal who gets his " research " from emotive ideologes and Jon Stewart ) are against the nation - state as well .
In fact , that 's the whole point of nationalism : replace the nation - state and its oppressive bureaucratic governments , which formulate a single standard and impose it on the populace , with an organic order , that gives each person a place and lets them find their balance with it .
Equality equals uniformity because it means the same rules are applied rigidly in every situation regardless of the details or the specifics .
Organic states allow for small local communities , united by culture and not government rules enforced by the police , but can only happen when there 's a shared culture , language , values system and heritage .
What does multicultural mean ?
He seems to suggest that having publications in many languages qualifies .
Fascist and National Socialist governments occurred in many nations , and their words were printed in many languages , and they even had non -white people fighting with them , because each realized that national autonomy and ethnic self - determination led to a better way of life than bureaucratic , culture - destroying , heritage - destroying modernity .
National Socialism and Fascism are opposed to modernity in all of its forms , and believe in having a social order , which requires consensus .
Fascism and National Socialism are also a revolt against inspecific racial indicators like " whiteness . "
Germany for Germans , France for the French , and so on .
I do n't believe anything is a " social construct " except the idea that genetic differences do n't exist , and that we 're all equal .
He did not consider those as social constructs .
I wonder why ?
" fascism is the polar opposite of anarchism .
Fascism is totalitarian , and beats the race - war drum mostly so as to inspire morons into doing their bidding " --
Any sense of centralized or hierarchical leadership is the polar opposite of anarchism .
He is also confusing a method of government , totalitarianism , with a whole type of organization of societies , which Fascism and National Socialism both are .
Further , Fascism and National Socialism do not beat the race - war drum , but tend to encourage warfare against Leftists , for the following reasons : ( a ) leftists destroy everything they touch ( b ) constant conflict keeps nations on their toes , at peak performance , and united toward a goal ( c ) until there is theatre dominance , there will be constant hegemonic squabbles between empires , like the cold war .
Further , the emphasis on ethnicity ( more exact term than race ) in Fascist and National Socialist societies differs .
For Fascists , race is less important than having a racial ideal ; for National Socialists , it is akin to a religion whereby they unite all of their people around a common ideal , enforce that ideal , and therefore DO NOT need excessive law enforcement and curtailments of freedom , because people are heading in the same direction , with the same values and inherent genetic affinities .
How many anarchists were exterminated by the National Socialists and Fascists , and did they have other attributes -- drug addiction , perversity , criminal behavior -- that might make them undesirable ?
As I recall , in the 1920s many nations were getting rid of anarchists because they have a habit of throwing bombs at pregnant women and crowds .
In his muddled thinking , he forgets to mention that National Socialist and Fascist governments were both elected by their people , did many good things , and only succumbed in warfare after the rest of the world united against them -- out of blind fear .
And today we have speech codes in the west where no public figure can say anything positive about either one , or they are immediately drummed out of office , a job , friend groups , etc .
Which do you think is more intolerant , in that light ?
First , Fascism and National Socialism are a replacement for modern society , not another flavor of it .
In them , society is not deconstructed with different institutions ( bureaucracies ) applying abstract rules to an equal populace rendered into little more than a mob , but a complex hierarchy where religion , values , philosophy , government and culture work together and while discourse happens internally , those who wish to throw away discourse and create a society of oppositional , paranoid , neurotic critique are not tolerated .
The fundamental theme of these societies is that our goal is to adapt to nature , to accept how nature works as ideal , and that as a result , some truths are eternal and do not belong to any one age .
These truths , such beliefs argue , should be applied in every age for optimal health .
This corresponds to what Plato said about the cycle of civilizations and how they govern themselves in The Republic ; in Fascist and National Socialist eyes , these beliefs are a conduit back to a healthier state of humankind , in which aristocracy rules , a caste system directs people toward tasks appropriate to their ability level , and we trade off some " freedom " for order but in turn gain freedom from the constant chaos , infighting , deconstructive discourse , neurotic critique , bad meaningless art and hateful interpersonal politics of democracies .
; in Fascist and National Socialist eyes , these beliefs are a conduit back to a healthier state of humankind , in which aristocracy rules , a caste system directs people toward tasks appropriate to their ability level , and we trade off some " freedom " for order but in turn gain freedom from the constant chaos , infighting , deconstructive discourse , neurotic critique , bad meaningless art and hateful interpersonal politics of democracies .
Protector ( from Summoning ) never takes into account the obvious : you can be proud both of what you have done , and what your ancestors have done .
Even more , pride is a way of maintaining quality control , and keeping beliefs that have worked for millennia .
He also thinks National Socialists ( " Nazis " ) have pride in their nation only because they have none in themselves .
He has made a poor observation of low self - esteem people , who have no reason to have pride in themselves : instead of taking pride in their nations , they seek to destroy any other sources of pride so as to feel themselves lifted up .
If I have five dollars , and my neighbor ten , and I burn five of his dollars , we 're equal and there 's no reason to feel bad about my former impoverished status .
Low self - esteem people in fact gravitate toward neurotic beliefs , like anarchism , where they are accepted and in fact valued for having done nothing and having nothing to be proud of .
If you have something to be proud of , however , you are going to work to protect it and make sure there 's a coherent social order so others can esteem what you did not just for its popularity or profit value , but its fulfillment of goals shared in common .
Next , Protector engages in a false dichotomy between individualists and totalitarian states .
He neglects to mention that the greatest of totalitarian states have been created by individualists who wanted to accepted on the basis of their individuality , thus demanded more tolerance and more equality , and when the ensuing social order was chaos , implemented strict police states .
You can be an individualist in a Fascist and National Socialist state , if by individualist you mean " does the right thing according to his or her own interpretation , and acts independently of others toward a goal . "
This is a saner definition than the neurotic modern one , which is " someone who does random things to make themselves appear unique , when they 're not at their functionary jobs . "
Finally , as mentioned above , Protector is not arguing politics -- he 's making a public statement , akin to marketing , assuring us that he has the right beliefs and therefore we can guiltlessly buy his product .
It 's no different than a record label claiming they use recycled plastic in their CDs .
In this society , a band with explicit Nazi leanings is not going to be sold on Amazon.com , in local record stores , or via most mail order distros .
So it 's best to play the game and be anti-fascist , even if you have to make a statement full of logical holes to do so .
Some of the usual buzz from angry people with not enough to do :
He in turn quotes Summoning , who made a statement of political independence that was actually disguised fascist bashing , because when you work in entertainment , it 's not enough to disagree :
Let me take these one point at a time :
Now on to the statement from Summoning , which is thoroughly debunked elsewhere , but we could use a refresher :
There 's two types of people in politics : those who argue for something , and those who argue against everything else , so that they can feel better about their lot in life .
Anarchists tend to be people with nothing because they do nothing important , or even all that popular , and so they have to form a little in - group where they can convince each other they 're cool for their boring music , illogical pamphlets and angry views of society that end up being mere excuses for why they failed at various things .
Have you seen an anarchist society lately ?
Neither have I , although they 've been tried , and anarchists hate it when you mention that .
A wave of ideological settlements passed over the US and Europe from 1900 - 1975 or so , and all of them failed because in anarchist states , there 's no consensus as to a goal , so people do what is convenient and unless they have a trust fund , they end up starving and bitterly infighting .
But anarchists do n't tend to mention this because , having made themselves social outcasts , they 're now dependent on selling you their stuff .
The rant by our anarchist above fits that pattern as well : he 's picked a known touchstone issue , and has made a snake oil salesman / traveling preacher style appeal to you all , looking for sympathy with a touch of the mob mentality that 's looking for an excuse to bash and mangle someone else so each person in the mob feels better .
Search your feelings , Luke .
Are you an anarchist from love of something , or hatred of everything else ?
There are many of us out here who feel that modernity is a wrong turn .
In our quest for ideology , we destroyed the ability to rule ourselves , and now we have an overpopulated , polluted planet , billions of neurotic and lonely angry and bitter people , and even more powerful governments .
This kind of totalitarianism did not come about under aristocracy , but under government by the people for the people .
So what 's the weak link ?
Anarchists would like you to make excuses and pretend that a giant corporate / fascist / religious conspiracy has done you wrong .
More realistically , what 's done you wrong is yourself and others around you .
You 're the ones buying Big Macs , driving SUVs , demanding government lower crime and so on .
Why are we so easily fooled ?
Politics is complex and involves facing difficult truths .
Popularity contests like democracy do n't do that so well , causing many long - term problems which they can never solve .
Most people do n't have the time , the inclination , the education and the ability to make quality decisions -- as Winston Churchill said ( and surely you 're not going to call him a Nazi ) , " The best argument against democracy is a five - minute conversation with the average voter . "
Voters are fundamentally ignorant , too busy to change that , and so they vote with their hearts and impulses and so hand power over to corrupt manipulators .
Anarchy will do the same except even more rapidly .
It 's a force of decay and hatred , not of growth .
If you want a force of love , it 's going to defend itself strongly , and be honest about what it tolerates -- unlike anarchists , who pretend to tolerate everything so to get popular among those who feel the world has done them wrong .
If you want a society based on love , it 's going to choose to unite itself around the things that it loves , and then work hard toward those things , including smashing its enemies .
Personally , I identify myself as an anti-racist .
That means that I think no one should look down on someone else for their race and / or ethnicity .
As part of that , I recognize that each ethnic group needs its own space and the ability to toss out outsiders .
That way , the ethnic group continues to exist .
If we move all people of all races to all places , we end up with a uniform gray race everywhere , which is racism because it destroys indigenous and unique groups and replaces them with the generic .
Yet this is what anarchists want you to do , under the guise that it 's anti-racism .
If you look closely , you 'll see that instead , it 's racism against anyone who has any culture and heritage they belong to .
And why would someone do that ?
Hatred , again : if you do n't have that , and wish you did , you can either work toward it , or try to destroy what others have so you feel better about yourself .
Modernity is a failure , and those of us who have awakened are willing to look past the " free " / " not - free " dichotomy that Republicans , anarchists , large corporations , hippies , leftists , liberals , libertarians and even most far - right groups think is important .
Freedom is an illusion in every government .
What we want is a sensible social order that rewards the good and gets rid of the bad .
We want to know that if we do well , we will see reward and be acknowledged by our neighbors ; if someone does bad to us or another person , they 'll be kicked out or hung before they can do it again .
That 's fairness , where " freedom " -- no one ever bothers to define this term -- means lots of people acting selfishly , causing chaos and then the good people suffer from the crime and disorder and the police state that results .
If you want an end to the totalitarian state , the best way to do it is to create a strong state that believes in order .
Hitler tried to ban cigarettes and was unable to do so ; in WWII Germany , people faced less rationing and privation than they did in the West .
It was not a total state .
True , enemies of the state were persecuted -- and let me be first to say I think the Holocaust was a big wrong and a big mistake -- but those who disagreed with the state but kept within the bounds of civil discourse felt no persecution .
What would an anarchist state be like ?
A mob of people killing anyone accused of having anti-freedom opinions , no doubt , probably while accusing them of being a witch .
Our anarchist 's behavior in his blog post shows us that 's exactly the psychology he has .
The guy from Summoning is trying to keep his band afloat .
Both are essentially trying to fool the mob , one to gain a following and the other to keep the mob from lynching him and his band for political thoughtcrime .
If the anarchists were honest , they 'd admit they are the lynch mob he fears and present a far greater danger and worse option than a Fascist or National Socialist state .

Twenty - two executives at military and law - enforcement supply companies have been arrested in a sting operation by federal authorities .
It is billed as the nation ’s largest effort to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , the Justice Department announced on Tuesday .
The business representatives were charged with attempting to pay bribes to win lucrative overseas contracts worth $ 15 million .
The defendants were snared in an undercover operation run by the Federal Bureau of Investigation , in which two undercover agents posed as representatives of the ministry of defense of an unidentified African nation .
Under the alleged scheme , the supply company executives agreed to submit invoices inflated by 20 percent to cover agreed upon bribes and kickbacks that were to be paid to the middlemen and the minister of defense .
Rather than walk away from the business opportunity , the charged businessmen allegedly agreed to inflate their invoices and pay the kickbacks .
“ This ongoing investigation is the first large - scale use of undercover law enforcement techniques to uncover FCPA violations and the largest action every undertaken by the Justice Department against individuals for FCPA violations , ” said Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer , who called the actions " a turning point . "
How the sting worked
In all 16 separate indictments have been returned in the case .
One of them charges Daniel Alvirez and Lee Allen Tolleson , president and director of acquisitions at a Bull Shoals , Ark. , military - equipment supplier .
Mr. Alvirez ’s company is not identified by name in the indictment .
The indictment says the two men met with the undercover agents in Miami ’s Mandarin Orient Hotel in May and agreed to add a 20 percent “ commission ” to the deal .
The proposed sale by Alvirez involved 25 grenade launchers and 70,000 grenades .
According to the indictment , the two men caused a wire transfer for $ 16,200 from a bank account purported to be controlled by the African country to their company ’s bank account .
Two days later , the two executives sent a wire transfer of the 20 percent “ commission ” to a bank account controlled by one of the undercover FBI agents .
The indictment says the money was a bribe to the minister of defense and kickbacks to the two undercover agents .
In October , the two executives again met with the undercover agents , this time at Clyde ’s restaurant in Washington , DC .
The meeting was allegedly conducted to set up a second , more lucrative , transaction .
Twenty - one of the suspects were arrested in Las Vegas where they were set to attend a trade show .
One was arrested in Miami .
The complete list of the people indicted is available here .
The defendants face up to five years in prison for each FCPA charge and up to 20 years in prison for alleged money laundering .

" Like every new mom , it takes time , it takes time , to get back in shape and be yourself again , " Gillibrand told the New York Daily News .
And then she Revealed Her Diet Secrets !

You know how yesterday we suggested that , just maybe , the culture was a leetle too interested in strangers ' " baby weight ? "
Like , more interested in " losing the weight " and " regaining the body " than , say , an upcoming primary battle ?
Well .
No one stands corrected .

On the one hand , as long as we must prolong this absurd conversation , at least Gillibrand 's comments on the subject are relatively wholesome .
" Most of us are not Heidi Klum and Angelina Jolie who look great the next day - for me , it took a good year and a half to get off all my Henry weight . "
( Henry is her baby .
Elsewhere in the article she refers to her " Theo weight , " too .
This is either better or worse than any alternative we 've heard . )
But , that said , the Senator still works out five mornings a week , runs and plays tennis .
The senator said she began focusing on her diet in August when she finished breast - feeding Henry .
She eats fruits , vegetables , whole grains , lean meats and fish , aiming for roughly 1,200 calories a day .
" I write down everything I eat , " she said .

Her goal , she says , is to " get back into the wardrobe she used before having her oldest child , Theo , 6 . " For a woman who 's achieved this level of public success , I 'm guessing she can achieve this , too - if she wants .
It 's somewhat dispiriting that given a public platform , such a visible woman not merely plays into a post - weight hysteria which is frankly none of anyone 's business and has even less to do with politics than Hollywood , but also subscribes to success - as - dress - size rather than general health and well - being .
And calorie - counting , for my money , should be banned from print .
We know people gain weight when they have babies ; that 's Nature .
The amazing thing is that each instance of public gain and loss is still met with wonder and fascination .
And that this piece will likely influence at least one voter .
Sen. Gillibrand Shedding Pounds - But Politics Is Not Reason For Fitness Kick , She Says [ NYDN ]
Après le vote de la loi Hadopi , le gouvernement avait mis en place une commission de trois " sages " ( le PDG de la maison de disques indépendante Naïve , Patrick Zelnik , l'ancien ministre Jacques Toubon , et Guillaume Cerutti , président de Sotheby 's France ) pour réfléchir à des mesures concrètes pour améliorer l'offre culturelle légale sur Internet .
Ces propositions , qui doivent désormais être arbitrées par Nicolas Sarkozy , doivent constituer un volet " incitatif " complétant le volet répressif de la loi Hadopi contre le téléchargement illégal .
Mais si l'essentiel des propositions de la commission consistent en des aménagements fiscaux et légaux ( crédits d'impôts , homogénéisation du droit d'auteur pour les services de streaming ... ) , la commission recommande également au gouvernement de s'attaquer à Google .
Le rapport Zelnik suspecte le moteur de recherche d'abuser de sa position dominante dans le secteur de la publicité en ligne , et de tirer les prix de la publicité en ligne vers le bas , ce qui rend plus difficile le fonctionnement des services culturels sur le Web .
Elle recommande donc au gouvernement d'entreprendre une double action : une saisie du Conseil de la concurrence , pour lui demander d'établir s'il y a ou non abus de position dominante , et l'instauration , à court terme , d'une " taxe Google " , qui frapperait les revenus de la publicité en ligne des gros opérateurs de publicité ( Facebook , Yahoo !... ) .
Les revenus de cet impôt – estimés à 10 à 20 millions d'euros par an pour un taux d'imposition de 1 % à 2 % – permettraient de financer en partie les autres mesures proposées .
Avec l'ensemble de ces mesures , la Commission espère récolter au total une cinquantaine de millions d'euros en 2010 , puis d'environ 35 à 40 millions d'euros par an au cours des deux années suivantes .
En complément , la fixation d'un seuil viserait à exonérer du prélèvement les sociétés ayant des revenus publicitaires modestes .
DIFFICULTÉS PRATIQUES
Mais comment taxer les revenus publicitaires des moteurs de recherche ?
Un tel dispositif poserait essentiellement deux difficultés , dont la première est d'ordre juridique .
Comment imposer une taxe en France , alors que les entreprises visées ont leur siège situé aux Etats - Unis ?
" Le dispositif pourrait s'inspirer des règles de territorialité s'appliquant à la taxe sur les conventions d'assurance , qui frappe toute convention couvrant un risque localisé en France " , répond le rapport de la Commission .
Le collège estime aussi que le prélèvement est compatible avec le droit communautaire , " qui n'impose de principe strict et général de territorialité que pour la taxe sur la valeur ajoutée ( TVA ) " .
Le second écueil concerne le calcul précis de la part des revenus publicitaires provenant effectivement de France .
Seul Google , par exemple , sait exactement combien d'internautes français voient ses publicités .
Le contrôle " ne pourrait reposer que sur un régime déclaratif , chaque opérateur de service en ligne connaissant la localisation de ses utilisateurs par l'intermédiaire de leur adresse IP " , note la commission .
Ces déclarations seraient recoupées par des mesures d'audience plus ciblées et indépendantes .
La perception de cette taxe serait d'autant plus complexe que le moteur de recherche est déjà accusé d'évasion fiscale en Europe .
Au Royaume - Uni , des députés estiment que le géant du Web ne déclare pas tous ses revenus générés en Grande - Bretagne au fisc britannique , mais en déclare une part importante au fisc irlandais , nettement plus avantageux .
Un argument repris , en France , par les éditeurs de presse en ligne [ Le Groupement des éditeurs de service en ligne est présidé par Philippe Jannet , PDG du Monde Interactif , ndlr ] .
C'est désormais à Nicolas Sarkozy de décider s'il souhaite s'attaquer au moteur de recherche .
Le président de la République doit donner ce soir , lors de ses vœux au monde de la culture , une première idée des orientations préconiséees par la mission Zelnik qui seront mises en place .

The impact on levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth 's atmosphere by the decaying remains of a group of marine creatures that includes starfish and sea urchin has been significantly underestimated .
" Climate models must take this carbon sink into account , " says Mario Lebrato , lead author of the study .
The work was done when he was at the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton ( NOCS ) and affiliated with the University of Southampton 's School of Ocean and Earth Science ( SOES ) ; he is now at the Leibniz Institute of Marine Science in Germany .
Globally , the seabed habitats occupy more than 300 million million square metres , from the intertidal flats and pools to the mightiest deep - sea trenches at 11,000 meters .
The benthos -- the animals living on and in the sediments -- populate this vast ecosystem .
Calcifying organisms incorporate carbon directly from the seawater into their skeletons in the form of inorganic minerals such as calcium carbonate .
This means that their bodies contain a substantial amount of inorganic carbon .
When they die and sink , some of the inorganic carbon is remineralised , and much of it becomes buried in sediments , where it remains locked up indefinitely .
Lebrato and his colleagues provide the first estimation of the contributions of starfish , sea urchins , brittle stars , sea cucumbers and sea lilies -- all kinds of echinoderm -- to the calcium carbonate budget at the seabed .
They estimate that the global production from all echinoderms is over a tenth ( 0.1 ) of a gigatonne of carbon per year -- that is , more than a hundred thousand million kilograms .
This is less than the total biological production in the main water column , or pelagic zone , which scientists believe to be between around 0.6 and 1.8 gigatonnes of carbon per year .
But echinoderms apparently deliver more carbon to the sediments than do forams , for example .
These microscopic animals live in vast numbers in the oceans and are traditionally regarded along with coccolithophores ( single - celled marine plants surrounded by calcium carbonate plates ) as one of the biggest contributors to the flux of calcium carbonate from the sunlit surface waters to the ocean 's interior -- the so - called ' biological carbon pump ' .
" Our research highlights the poor understanding of large - scale carbon processes associated with calcifying animals such as echinoderms and tackles some of the uncertainties in the oceanic calcium carbonate budget , " says Lebrato : " The realisation that these creatures represent such a significant part of the ocean carbon sink needs to be taken into account in computer models of the biological pump and its effect on global climate . "
There is a worry that ocean acidification due to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels could reduce the amount of calcium carbonate incorporated into the skeletons of echinoderms and other calcifying organisms .
However , different echinoderm species respond to ocean acidification in different ways , and the effects of rising temperatures can be as significant as those of rising carbon dioxide .
How this will affect the global carbon sink remains to be established .
Lebrato concludes : " The scientific community needs to reconsider the role of benthic processes in the marine calcium carbonate cycle .
This is a crucial but understudied compartment of the global marine carbon cycle , which has been of key importance throughout Earth history and it is still at present . "

In Thursday 's Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , the Court ruled that corporations should be treated the same as " natural persons " , i.e. humans .
Well , in that case , expect the Supreme Court to next rule that Wal - Mart can run for President .
The ruling , which junks federal laws that now bar corporations from stuffing campaign coffers , will not , as progressives fear , cause an avalanche of corporate cash into politics .
Sadly , that 's already happened : we have been snowed under by tens of millions of dollars given through corporate PACs and " bundling " of individual contributions from corporate pay - rollers .
The Court 's decision is far , far more dangerous to U.S. democracy .
Think : Manchurian candidates .
I 'm losing sleep over the millions -- or billions -- of dollars that could flood into our elections from ARAMCO , the Saudi Oil corporation 's U.S. unit ; or from the maker of " New Order " fashions , the Chinese People 's Liberation Army .
Or from Bin Laden Construction corporation .
Or Bin Laden Destruction Corporation .
Right now , corporations can give loads of loot through PACs .
While this money stinks ( Barack Obama took none of it ) , anyone can go through a PAC 's federal disclosure filing and see the name of every individual who put money into it .
And every contributor must be a citizen of the USA .
But under today 's Supreme Court ruling that corporations can support candidates without limit , there is nothing that stops , say , a Delaware - incorporated handmaiden of the Burmese junta from picking a Congressman or two with a cache of loot masked by a corporate alias .
Candidate Barack Obama was one sharp speaker , but he would not have been heard , and certainly would not have won , without the astonishing outpouring of donations from two million Americans .
It was an unprecedented uprising - by - PayPal , overwhelming the old fat - cat sources of funding .
Well , kiss that small - donor revolution goodbye .
Under the Court 's new rules , progressive list serves wo n't stand a chance against the resources of new " citizens " such as CNOOC , the China National Offshore Oil Corporation .
Maybe UBS ( United Bank of Switzerland ) , which faces U.S. criminal prosecution and a billion - dollar fine for fraud , might be tempted to invest in a few Senate seats .
As would XYZ Corporation , whose owners remain hidden by " street names . "
George Bush 's former Solicitor General Ted Olson argued the case to the court on behalf of Citizens United , a corporate front that funded an attack on Hillary Clinton during the 2008 primary .
Olson 's wife died on September 11 , 2001 on the hijacked airliner that hit the Pentagon .
Maybe it was a bit crude of me , but I contacted Olson 's office to ask how much " Al Qaeda , Inc. " should be allowed to donate to support the election of his local congressman .
Olson has not responded .
The danger of foreign loot loading into U.S. campaigns , not much noted in the media chat about the Citizens case , was the first concern raised by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who asked about opening the door to " mega - corporations " owned by foreign governments .
Olson offered Ginsburg a fudge , that Congress might be able to prohibit foreign corporations from making donations , though Olson made clear he thought any such restriction a bad idea .
Tara Malloy , attorney with the Campaign Legal Center of Washington D.C. says corporations will now have more rights than people .
Only United States citizens may donate or influence campaigns , but a foreign government can , veiled behind a corporate treasury , dump money into ballot battles .
Malloy also noted that under the law today , human - people , as opposed to corporate - people , may only give $ 2,300 to a presidential campaign .
But hedge fund billionaires , for example , who typically operate through dozens of corporate vessels , may now give unlimited sums through each of these " unnatural " creatures .
And once the Taliban incorporates in Delaware , they could ante up for the best democracy money can buy .
In July , the Chinese government , in preparation for President Obama 's visit , held diplomatic discussions in which they skirted issues of human rights and Tibet .
Notably , the Chinese , who hold a $ 2 trillion mortgage on our Treasury , raised concerns about the cost of Obama 's health care reform bill .
Would our nervous Chinese landlords have an interest in buying the White House for an opponent of government spending such as Gov. Palin ?
Ya betcha !
The potential for foreign infiltration of what remains of our democracy is an adjunct of the fact that the source and control money from corporate treasuries ( unlike registered PACs ) , is necessarily hidden .
Who the heck are the real stockholders ?
Or as Butch asked Sundance , " Who are these guys ? "
We 'll never know .

Global market share for Windows Mobile dropped about 3 percent since last year , while Android captured 3.5 percent of the market , according to data from Gartner .
Global market share for Windows Mobile dropped about 3 percent since last year , while Android captured 3.5 percent of the market , according to data from Gartner .
Windows Mobile had 7.9 percent of the market in the third quarter of 2009 , down from 11.1 percent during the same time period last year .
Sales dropped from 4 million in the third quarter of 2008 to 3.2 million this year .
Symbian dominated global market share with 44.6 percent , followed by BlackBerry maker Research in Motion , with 20.8 percent .
Apple came in at number three with its iPhone OS , which captured 17.1 percent of the market .
Windows Mobile and Android rounded out the top five .
Android did not have any market share during the third quarter of 2008 since the first Android - based phone , the T - Mobile G1 , did not debut until October of that year .
This year , however , there have been several Android releases , including Sprint 's HTC Hero , T - Mobile 's MyTouch , and the Motorola Droid , among others .
That resulted in about 1.4 million in sales and 3.5 percent of the global market , according to Gartner .
Symbian 's numbers represent a 5 percent drop from last year .
RIM and Apple , however , saw gains in the last 12 months .
RIM 's market share was up about 5 percent , from 5.8 million in shares during the third quarter of 2008 to 8.5 million during this last quarter .
On the iPhone front , Apple was up about 4 percent , from 4.7 million sales last year to 7 million this year .
Palm 's Web OS , meanwhile , captured about 1.1 percent of the market this quarter .
Carolina Milanesi , research director for mobile devices at Gartner , said that Windows Mobile is likely faltering because most think of the OS as an enterprise - based business .
" Android has shown a lot of potential as a consumer space and that is where Microsoft has been struggling the most , " she wrote in an e-mail .
There is the perception that Microsoft " is more about enterprise than consumer , and therefore it is not seen as sexy , " Milanesi said .
There is also " a lack of an intuitive OS designed for use on a phone rather than on a PC . "
Milanesi believes that Windows Mobile 6.5 will help Microsoft " stabilize share loss " but does n't expect any major changes in the near future .
The open - source movement , witnessed with Symbian and Android , meanwhile , " leaves Microsoft at a cost disadvantage , " she concluded .
Against the opposition of their four colleagues , five right - wing Supreme Court justices have now guaranteed that big corporations can spend unlimited funds on political advertising in any political election .
In an opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito , Antonin Scalia , and Clarence Thomas , the Court overruled established precedents and declared dozens of national and state statutes unconstitutional , including the McCain - Feingold Act , which forbade corporate or union television advertising that endorses or opposes a particular candidate .
This appalling decision , in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , was quickly denounced by President Obama as “ devastating ” ; he said that it “ strikes at our democracy itself . ”
In his State of the Union speech of January 27 , he said , “ Last week , the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests — including foreign corporations — to spend without limit in our elections . ”
He is right : the decision will further weaken the quality and fairness of our politics .
The Court has given lobbyists , already much too powerful , a nuclear weapon .
Some lawyers have predicted that corporations will not take full advantage of it : they will want to keep their money for their business .
But that would still permit carefully targeted threats .
What legislator tempted to vote for health care reform or Obama ’s banking reorganization would be indifferent to the prospect that his reelection campaign could be swamped in a tsunami of expensive negative advertising ?
How many corporations fearful of environmental or product liability litigation would pass up the chance to tip the balance in a state judicial election ?
On the most generous understanding the decision displays the five justices ’ instinctive favoritism of corporate interests .
But some commentators , including The New York Times , have suggested a darker interpretation .
The five justices may have assumed that allowing corporations to spend freely against candidates would favor Republicans ; perhaps they overruled long - established laws and precedents out of partisan zeal .
If so , their decision would stand beside the Court ’s 2000 decision in Bush v. Gore as an unprincipled political act with terrible consequences for the nation .
We should notice not just the bad consequences of the decision , however , but the poor quality of the arguments Justice Kennedy offered to defend it .
The conservative justices savaged canons of judicial restraint they themselves have long praised .
Chief Justice Roberts takes every opportunity to repeat what he said , under oath , in his Senate nomination hearings : that the Supreme Court should avoid declaring any statute unconstitutional unless it cannot decide the case before it in any other way .
Now consider how shamelessly he and the other justices who voted with the majority ignored that constraint in their haste to declare …

Mohammed Atif Siddique will remain in custody until 9 February Appeal Court judges have overturned the conviction of a man branded a " wannabe suicide bomber " by prosecutors .
Mohammed Atif Siddique , 24 , a student from Alva , Clackmannanshire , was convicted of terrorism charges in 2007 .
But Lord Osborne said some directions given to the jury by the trial judge were a " material misdirection " and amounted to a " miscarriage of justice " .
Siddique will remain in custody until 9 February , when the Crown will say if it wants to seek a fresh prosecution .
The shopkeeper 's son was convicted in October 2007 after a four - week trial in Glasgow .
He was found guilty of two charges under the Terrorism Act 2000 , one under the Terrorism Act 2006 and a breach of the peace .
We note the decision of the appeal court and will be considering the judgement
Crown Office
The most serious charge related to the possession of articles that gave rise to " reasonable suspicion " they were connected to terrorism .
The jury found Siddique had amassed and distributed terrorist propaganda via websites and provided instructional material about guns and explosives over the internet .
His conviction on that allegation resulted in a six - year prison term .
The Crown Office will indicate at the next hearing in February if it wants to seek a fresh prosecution in relation to the terror charge .
A spokeswoman said : " We note the decision of the appeal court and will be considering the judgement . "
Giving the appeal judges ' decision , Lord Osborne criticised the way the trial judge explained the main Terrorist Act charge to the jury .
A scapegoat
The judge , sitting with Lords Reed and Clarke in Edinburgh , said the misdirection amounted to " a miscarriage of justice " .
His family has always insisted he was not a terrorist and was made a scapegoat by the legal system .
Siddique also protested his innocence throughout , claiming that when he downloaded material from the internet he was motivated only by curiosity .
He denied he was planning a terrorist attack .
During his appeal hearing last summer , defence lawyers argued that much of the material in his possession was widely available on the internet .
Defence QC Donald Findlay described the Terrorism Acts as " draconian " and advocate depute Derek Ogg QC , for the Crown , admitted that the legislation was " controversial " .
The charges followed Siddique 's arrest in April 2006 as he waited to board a plane to Pakistan .
Siddique 's lawyer Aamer Anwar said he would be making no comment until after the conclusion of the proceedings on 9 February .

WASHINGTON  Like about a dozen other states , Florida is debating a proposed amendment to its state constitution that would try to block , at least symbolically , much of the proposed federal health care overhaul on the grounds that it tramples individual liberty .
But what unites the proposal ’s legislative backers is more than ideology .
Its 42 co-sponsors , all Republicans , were almost all recipients of outsized campaign contributions from major health care interests , a total of about $ 765,000 in 2008 , according to a new study by the National Institute on Money in State Politics , a nonpartisan group based in Helena , Mont .
It is just one example of how insurance companies , hospitals and other health care interests have been positioning themselves in statehouses around the country to influence the outcome of the proposed health care overhaul .
Around the 2008 election , the groups that provide health care contributed about $ 102 million to state political campaigns across the country , surpassing the $ 89 million the same donors spent at the federal level , according to the institute .
Any federal legislation is likely to supersede state constitutional amendments .
But backers of the state measures say they want to send a message to Congress and also lay groundwork for fights about elements of the health care package that are expected to be left up to the states .

Khan may now choose to launch an assault on the United States Amir Khan needed just 76 seconds to defeat Dmitriy Salita in the first defence of his WBA light - welterweight title in Newcastle .
Salita was floored by a lightning - fast left - right combination after just 10 seconds and never recovered .
Salita rose , but he was forced to take a knee after another bombardment and the referee waved the contest off after he was decked by a Khan left hook .
Khan , 22 , now has 22 wins and 16 knockouts from 23 professional fights .
" It was very explosive , it was just what we asked for , " Bolton 's Khan told BBC Sport .
" We had too much firepower for this guy .
After the first shot I could see his legs buckling . "
The 27 - year - old Salita was unbeaten in 31 encounters going into the fight , and he was expected to at least make a contest of it at the Metro Radio Arena .
606 : DEBATE A good win ?
This guy is no better than the Willie Limonds that Khan was fighting years ago
Baggio But Khan jumped all over him from the opening bell , sending Salita to the canvas with a ramrod left followed by an irresistible overhand right .
Salita was still jelly - legged when Khan renewed his attack , and the American was hurt by a spiteful left and sent back - pedalling into a neutral corner .
Salita was forced to take a knee , and while he was brave enough to get back to his feet , Puerto Rican referee Luis Pavon called a halt to proceedings after he was knocked down for a third time .
Khan may now choose to fight in the United States , where he has had his training base since his defeat to Colombia 's Breidis Prescott last September .
That defeat , which seemed career - threatening at the time , saw him team up with legendary American trainer Freddie Roach , and Khan has looked a different fighter ever since .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Freddie is like a father figure to me and just having him in the corner gives me so much confidence , " added Khan .
" It was a blessing in disguise what happened to me against Prescott - I 've come back stronger and now I 'm a world champion and a world champion defender . "
Khan defeated Mexican legend Marco Antonio Barrera in March , before stepping up a weight and claiming the WBA light - welterweight crown with victory over Andriy Kotelnik in July .
Khan will now help Manny Pacquiao prepare for Floyd Mayweather at Roach 's fabled Wild Card gym in Los Angeles , after which he will weigh up his options .
There has been talk of a match with Manchester 's former light - welterweight king Ricky Hatton , while Dagenham 's Kevin Mitchell , who looked classy in defeating Prescott on the Newcastle bill , has made no secret of his desire to fight Khan somewhere down the line .

San Jose police , under fire for interactions with the public that have turned violent , on Friday launched a pilot project equipping officers with head - mounted cameras to record contacts with civilians .
Officers will activate the cameras , about the size of a Bluetooth device and attached by a headband above the ear , every time they respond or make contact with a person .
At the end of the officer ’s shift , the recording will be downloaded to a central server .
Chief Rob Davis said the devices , to be tested by 18 patrol officers , are a technological advance comparable to the advent of police cars , two - way radios and the 911 emergency system .
San Jose is the first major U.S. city to try out the devices , known as AXON .
Although officers are already bearing vests , weapons and radios , most of them welcome adding a camera to record their actions , Davis said .
In addition , he said , “ We ’re making it so it has cachet . ”
A leading critic of the department welcomed the cameras as a tool to provide useful evidence , but dismissed their significance as a solution to rocky police - community relations .
“ The AXON project is unfortunately a positive thing right now because the level of distrust is so high , ” said Raj Jayadev , director of the community organization Silicon Valley De-Bug .
“ But it does n’t address the more fundamental problem :
What stereotypes police may carry when they see people of color on the street and make assumptions about character . ”
The cost of the trial is being shouldered by maker Taser International of Scottsdale , Ariz .
But if the trial leads to full - fledged use , equipping the entire 1,400 - officer department will be expensive .
At $ 1,700 per kit and a $ 99 per officer monthly fee , the system could cost $ 2,888 per officer in the first year , or $ 4 million .
Davis said he expected the price would decrease , and he hoped that the department would be able to find grants to defray the cost .
The kit includes a camera , a control piece and a computer that can hang from the belt .
In the pilot project , officers have been directed to switch on the camera as they are about to contact a civilian .
The cameras , equipped with an audio recorder , align with the officer ’s vision , and can be later switched to standby mode .
Afterward , the officer can switch the camera to a “ buffer ” mode , where it still records limited segments of video , and a nonrecord mode .
The officer may review the tape at any time , but it may not be erased .
At the end of the shift , the device ’s memory is downloaded onto a central server .
Davis said commanders will randomly review the tapes , to evaluate the system and to gather information that could help assess police policies and procedures .
Officers , he said , welcomed the devices .
“ I used it this morning in making an arrest , ” said officer William Doane , one of the AXON test pilots .
“ It verified what I saw . ”
In the two days of testing , he generally remembered to turn on the AXON before incidents , but sometimes forgot to turn it off afterward , he said .
Overall , he said , “ It ’s a good system . ”
The devices could provide evidence of crimes , timely information about suspects , help with police training and be a resource in investigations of complaints against police and deterrence of public misbehavior , Davis said .
Critics , however , are interested in how the cameras might prevent police from overstepping bounds .
Over several months , groups representing Latinos , Asians and African - Americans have criticized San Jose police for too easily resorting to force .
Per capita , San Jose police make more arrests for resisting arrest than does any other major California city , according to a Mercury News investigation .
Criticism spiked after police fatally shot a mentally ill man , Daniel Pham , in May and after a cell phone video showed officers apparently beating Phuong Ho , a San Jose State University student from Vietnam .
A detailed review by the Mercury News showed that San Jose police have repeatedly used force in incidents that began as seemingly benign situations .
In response , Davis has formed a panel to review the department ’s use of force .
In 2008 , police received 117 use - of - force complaints , but said none of the complaints was justified .
Jayadev said he was concerned about who would have access to AXON tapes .
Given the department ’s reluctance to release evidence , such as 911 tapes , he said he fears the camera tapes might prove to be a tool for police but be denied to residents facing criminal charges or criticizing police conduct .
Davis said that the department will balance privacy concerns in making the camera footage available to the public .
Jayadev also pointed out that the trial of AXON mirrors the introduction of Tasers in 2004 , soon after police killed a knife - wielding woman in her kitchen .
When Davis became one of the first big city chiefs to arm all his officers with Tasers , the idea was to save lives and reduce violent contacts .
“ Of course , they did n’t , ” Jayadev said .
“ We ca n’t solve our problems with a new piece of gadgetry . ”

Felipe Jr , who is 49 cm tall and weighs 3.370 kg , is in " excellent health " according to reports , as is his mother .
Congratulations to the Massa family .
Young black people also had trouble finding work in the 1990s recession Almost half of black people aged between 16 and 24 are unemployed , compared with 20 % of white people of the same age , a think tank has claimed .
The left - leaning Institute for Public Policy Research said a survey of 7,200 young people showed a wide variation in unemployment by ethnic group .
Black unemployment had risen 13 % since March 2008 , compared with 8 % among white people and 6 % among Asians .
Campaigners said action was needed from government to help the black community .
The IPPR report came as official figures showed that the total number of people out of work had unexpectedly fallen by 7,000 in the three months to November .
' Lost generation '
The think tank looked at data from the Labour Force Survey - a quarterly sample of about 60,000 households .
Within that , it examined the responses of 16 to 24 - year - olds - a total of 7,200 in November 2009 .
It said mixed ethnic groups had seen the biggest increases in youth unemployment since the recession began , rising from 21 % to 35 % in the period .
That trend echoed the recession in the early 1990s , it added , where unemployment among ethnic minorities rose by 10 % , compared with a 6 % increase overall .
If a quarter of adult males do n't work for 10 - 20 years , it does n't give communities much aspiration
Jeremy Crook Black Training and Enterprise Group
In terms of individual groups , 48 % of black people , 31 % of Asians and 20 % of whites reported that they were out of work .
Lisa Harker , co-director of the IPPR , said the findings were a " worrying reminder " that those from ethnic minorities or with fewer qualifications were " far more likely to become part of a generation lost to unemployment and disadvantage " .
The think tank said the government 's pledge to shield ethnic minorities had " not been effective " and urged the government to draw up alternative measures to prevent long - term unemployment .
The IPPR said unemployment was highest for those with no qualifications , standing at 43 % .
It said men fared worse than women , with 22 % of male graduates unemployed , compared with 13 % of females .
Jeremy Crook , director of the Black Training and Enterprise Group ( BTEG ) , said part of the problem was there were very few black role models in Britain .
" Amongst black men , unemployment is about 20 % - if a quarter of adult males do n't work for 10 - 20 years , it does n't give communities much aspiration , it demoralises and dissuades young people .
" They look to alternatives and get involved in gangs . "
' Discrimination '
Mr Crook said black and ethnic minority communities suffered from a " long - term persistent recession " and the government needed to make a " more targeted effort " to suggest they could " achieve in life " .
We need action from government to ensure that these groups are not left behind
Dr Krishna Sarda
Ethnic Minority Foundation " Long - term unemployment is quite devastating , the government needs to improve outcomes and show pathways into apprenticeships .
" There is still discrimination amongst employers , particularly in construction and engineering , " he added .
Dr Krishna Sarda , chief executive of the Ethnic Minority Foundation , said efforts needed to be made to enhance the opportunities , education prospects and economic integration .
" We strongly believe economic and social integration go together .
We need action from government to ensure that these groups are not left behind , " he said .
The IPPR found that young women with no qualifications were the worst hit across all age groups with unemployment at 46 % , up by 18 % from March 2008 .
It said youth unemployment followed similar regional patterns to adult unemployment - and areas worst hit were those dependent on manufacturing and construction industries .

In all of this , Kennedy ’s insights were supported by a variety of recent research suggesting that people are more likely to obey the law when they view law enforcement as fair and legitimate .
Tom Tyler , a psychology professor at New York University , has found that compliance with court orders is highest for offenders who perceive that they have experienced a fair process .
And in a recent book , “ American Homicide , ” the Ohio State University historian Randolph Roth argues that throughout American history , the homicide rate has decreased when people trust that the government is stable and unbiased and believe in the legitimacy of the officials who run it .
Similarly , the legal scholar Paul Butler argues in his new book , “ Let ’s Get Free : A Hip - Hop Theory of Justice , ” that widespread incarceration in the 1980s and ’90s undermined the legitimacy of law enforcement in the eyes of the affected communities by converting a prison term into something heroic rather than stigmatic .
After Operation Ceasefire , Kennedy turned his attention from gangs to open - air drug markets .
He set out to change how the criminal - justice system was viewed from the perspective of the offenders and their communities — and how the offenders and their communities were viewed by the police .
As Kennedy told me , “ I saw law enforcement believing plausible but untrue things about the communities they police ” — namely , that the communities were corrupt and did n’t care about the violence that was destroying them — “ and the communities believing untrue things about the police ” — namely , that the cops were part of a racist conspiracy to lock up black offenders while overlooking white ones .
To correct what he calls a “ corrosive and tragic mistake , ” Kennedy came up with the idea of a kind of truth - and - reconciliation commission in which offenders would talk to the police accompanied by the people they trusted the most : their mothers .
In 2003 , working with James Fealy , the police chief in High Point , N.C. , Kennedy arranged some preliminary meetings .
Although Fealy had been shocked to learn that the community thought he and his officers were almost as bad as the drug dealers , Fealy , in turn , surprised community members by declaring that no one in law enforcement thought the drug war could be won .
These meetings prepared the groundwork for the strategy that followed .
After identifying 16 active drug dealers , Fealy arrested four and then prepared warrants for the other 12 that could be signed whenever the police chose .
He then called in the other dealers , nine of whom arrived accompanied by their mothers and other “ influentials ” like grandmothers , and delivered the following message to them as a group : “ You could be in jail tonight .
We do n’t want to do that , we want to help you succeed , but you are out of the drug business . ”
The mothers and grandmothers , seemingly impressed by the decision not to arrest , cheered on the police .
In subsequent meetings , the “ influentials ” shouted down naysayers , including a conspiracymonger who accused the C.I.A. of having created the crack epidemic to oppress black people .
The drug market in the area dried up .
IN ADDITION TO influencing Judge Alm ’s probation reform , Kennedy ’s efforts to rethink deterrence have also inspired one of the most powerful recent models for national parole reform , which comes from Tracey Meares , a law professor at Yale .
( Unlike probation , which involves a sentence instead of prison , parole involves supervision after part of the prison sentence has been served . )
In 2002 , Meares , who was then a law professor at the University of Chicago , was asked by the U.S. attorney in Chicago , Patrick Fitzgerald , to analyze how best to address crime in the city .
She concluded that they should begin on the West Side , in West Garfield Park and the surrounding area , where rates of murder and gun violence were more than four times the city average .
Fitzgerald suggested that they might implement a version of Project Exile , a controversial program in Virginia that sought to deter gun violence by threatening federal prosecutions — and a five - year mandatory minimum sentence — for repeat offenders convicted of illegal gun possession .
But Project Exile had experienced only mixed success : federal prosecutors could prosecute only a small proportion of the gun cases submitted by the Richmond police .
The threat of a severe sentence was , in effect , something of a bluff .
Meares told Fitzgerald that threats of zero tolerance would n’t work because they simply were n’t credible .
Instead , Meares argued that law - enforcement officials should concentrate on specific groups of wrongdoers in ways they could accept as both reasonable and fair .
Using Operation Ceasefire in Boston as a model , Meares identified everyone who had committed violent or gun-related crimes and had been released from prison and recently assigned to parole .
She gathered them in random groups of no more than 20 for call - in sessions in what Meares calls “ places of civic importance ” — park buildings , local schools and libraries — where they sat at the same table as the police in order to create an egalitarian , nonconfrontational atmosphere .
They then heard a version of Kennedy ’s three - part presentation .
The results of the program were drastic : there was a 37 percent drop in the average monthly homicide rate — the largest drop of any neighborhood in the city .
Violent crime in Chicago today is at a 30 year low .
“ All these strategies are a way of signaling to groups of people that government agents view them with dignity , neutrality and trust , which is the best way of convincing them that the government has the right to hold them accountable for their behavior , ” Meares told me .
From Kennedy and Kleiman to Alm and Meares , the judges and scholars developing new deterrence strategies are changing the way we think about parole , probation , gang violence and drug markets .
But the strategies also present a rare opportunity to persuade the nation ’s policymakers that the most urgent case for prison reform is not only economic but also moral and practical .
Yes , it ’s an outrage that the United States locks up citizens for so long with such uncertain effect ; but it ’s also self - defeating , because long sentences give rise to a crisis of legitimacy that can lead to more crime , not less .
A crisis of legitimacy may sound like a huge , perhaps intractable problem , but the tantalizing promise of the new deterrence thinking is that the crisis can actually be solved , practical step by practical step .
The relative simplicity of the solutions , it turns out , is at the core of their radical potential .
It is said that you can judge the mettle of a man by the quality of his enemies .
So I guess it should be flattering when a group of individuals who appear dedicated to making misery for countless Internet users express glee at what they perceive as my misfortune .
Since my final posting on The Washington Post ‘s Security Fix blog last year , I ’ve been made aware of several discussions among different shadowy online groups who were apparently celebrating the end of that blog .
Some of those conversations I am not at liberty to point to here , but at least one of them is public :
A thread on crutop.nu , a 8,000 member Russian language forum dedicated to Webmasters who specialize in high - risk Web sites , including rogue anti-virus software sales , pharmacy sites , and all manner of extreme porn ( including beastiality and rape ) .
The last time I got this much attention from crutop.nu was last summer , when I published the results of a lengthy investigation that traced a huge number of rogue anti-virus Web site payment processing pages back to Crutop and to Chronopay , a Russian payment processing company that also specializes in high - risk sites .
Indeed , that post concluded that the same individual was responsible for running both entities , ( Chronopay founder Pavel Vrublevsky , a.k.a. “ Redeye ” on Crutop ) .
In this discussion on Crutop , members can be seen celebrating the demise of the Security Fix blog and my employment at The Washington Post , essentially saying that Santa Claus had answered their letters .
Members then go on to discuss how I should be shot ( among other indignities ) , as well as various search engine gaming schemes that might bury the rankings of my new blog at krebsonsecurity .com .
The entire thread ( or least up until today ) can be read by expanding the images below , in order , and viewing a rough translation .

I keep the floors extremely clean , so clean that you can eat off of them , which is actually what I do .
I have a thing about plates and utensils .
I eat 2 well cooked fried eggs off of a small tile in the middle of the living room with chopsticks every evening at 7:15 PM .
You can not touch my chopsticks .3 ) My mother stops by twice a week and yells at me for an hour or so and sobs about her only son being gay .
I 'm actually not gay I just do n't date a lot .
She does n't get this .
She is harmless though but may pinch your cheeks when she see 's you .
7 ) I sometimes come home reeking of fish .
Please do n't ask me about this .
5 ) I hum a lot , sometimes for hours .
It 's not usually loud but if I am in the living room brushing General Tso and I 'm humming , it may get to you and you would have to go into your room .
6 ) I have a sequencing disorder which means I get numbers mixed up and sometimes words .
I will on occasion type a sentence into my computer and run a special grammer and spelling check on it before actually speaking to you .
This takes time and can try one 's patience .
8 ) I like to talk sometimes .
At other times I will ask you to not speak to me for days at a time .
Please stop talking to me when I ask you this .

It was the decade of the mega - heist , when stolen credit card magstripe tracks became the pork bellies of a new underground marketplace , Eastern European hackers turned malware writing into an art , and a nasty new crop of purpose - driven computer worms struck dread in the heart of America .
Now that the zero days are behind us , it 's time to reflect on the most ingenious , destructive or groundbreaking cybercrimes of the first 10 years of the new millennium .
2000 MafiaBoyOnce upon a time , " distributed denial of service attacks " were just a way for quarreling hackers to knock each other out of IRC .
Then one day in February 2000 , a 15 - year - old Canadian named Michael " MafiaBoy " Calce experimentally programmed his botnet to hose down the highest traffic websites he could find .
CNN , Yahoo , Amazon , eBay , Dell and eTrade all buckled under the deluge , leading to national headlines and an emergency meeting of security experts at the White House .
Compared to modern DDoS attacks , MafiaBoy 's was trivial .
But his was the cyberstrike that put the internet 's security issues on a national stage , and inaugurated an era where any pissed off script kiddy could take down part of the web at will .
2002 California Payroll Database BreachOn April 5 , 2002 , an unidentified hacker penetrated a California server housing the state government 's payroll database , gaining access to names , Social Security numbers and salary information for 265,000 state workers from the governor on down .
The breach itself was small potatoes , but when it emerged that the California Controller 's Office had waited two weeks to warn the victims , angry lawmakers reacted by passing the nation 's first breach disclosure law , SB1386 .
The law requires hacked organizations to promptly warn potential identity theft victims .
Its passage pulled the rock off the string of major corporate breaches that companies would have preferred to hush up .
Today , 45 states have enacted similar laws .
2003 SlammerIn 2003 , fear came in 376 bytes .
The lightning - fast Slammer worm targeted a hole in Microsoft 's SQL server , and despite striking six months after a fix was released , the malware cracked an estimated 75,000 unpatched servers in the space of hours .
Bank of America and Washington Mutual ATM networks ground to a halt .
Continental Airlines delayed and canceled flights when its ticketing system got gummed up .
Seattle lost its emergency 911 network , and a nuclear power plant in Ohio lost a safety monitoring system .
Slammer was n't the biggest worm ever , but in its aggressive , relentless spread , it exposed the secret interconnections that corporations were foolishly allowing between important private networks and the public internet .
2004 Foonet+++inset-left
Years before there was a Russian Business Network , a small ISP hosted in a suburban basement in Ohio gained the dubious reputation as the first black - hat hosting company .
It was a safe spot for hackers and packet monkeys to attack an unsuspecting internet .
Foonet 's hosted clients included Carder Planet – the dedicated " carder forum " for credit card hackers – and its IRC servers were where legendary German hacker Axel " Ago " Gembe controlled his Agobot network of compromised Windows boxes .
After two FBI raids , in 2004 , Foonet 's founder and some of the staff were indicted for a DDoS - for - hire scheme that collaterally slammed Amazon.com and the Department of Homeland Security .
Foonet 's owner , Saad Echouafni , skipped out on $ 750,000 to flee the country , and remains on the FBI 's wanted list today .
2006 The Los Angeles Traffic Signal AttackWhen Los Angeles traffic engineers went on strike in August 2006 , the city decided not to take any chances :
They temporarily blocked most access to the computer that controls 3,200 traffic signals throughout the City of Angels .
Two of the striking engineers hacked in anyway .
From a laptop , Kartik Patel and Gabriel Murillo picked four key intersections and changed the timing on the traffic signals so the most congested approach would hit long red lights .
The timing tweaks wreaked havoc in a city already flirting with gridlock , according to the Los Angeles Times , snarling traffic at the Los Angeles International Airport , backing up the Glendale Freeway and paralyzing Little Tokyo and the streets of the downtown Civic Center .
It evidently took several days for managers to figure out what was going on .
In December 2009 , the engineers were sentenced to probation .
2006 Max Vision +++inset-left
In 2006 , a former computer security researcher turned professional black hat weighed and measured the computer underground , and found it wanting .
So in a two - night hackfest from his San Francisco safe house , Max Vision ( aka Iceman ) trained his guns on the online carder forums where hackers and fraudsters buy and sell stolen data , fake IDs and specialized underground services .
When he was done hacking in and wiping out their databases , he absorbed their content and membership into his own site , CardersMarket , turning it into the largest English - speaking criminal marketplace on the web – 6,000 members strong .
The hostile takeover got the attention of the feds who'd thoroughly infiltrated some of the sites he hacked , and a year later FBI and Secret Service tracked Iceman to his hideout .
He 's now awaiting sentencing for stealing 2 million credit cards that rang up $ 86 million in fraudulent charges .
2008 RBS Worldpay Heist
The first time we learned that the payment processor RBS Worldpay had been hacked , it sounded like no big deal :
The company announced in December 2008 that it had seen fraud on only 100 of the 1.5 million payroll and gift card accounts compromised in the breach .
But it turns out the hackers were able to raise the withdrawal limits on 44 of those cards to as high as $ 500,000 .
Then they dispatched a global army of cashers to slam the accounts with repeated rapid - fire withdrawals .
More than 130 ATMs in 49 cities from Moscow to Atlanta were hit simultaneously just after midnight Eastern Time on November 8 , 2008 , resulting in a one - day haul of $ 9.5 million in cold , hard cash .
In November , the United States indicted four of the alleged ringleaders , who are in Estonia , Russia and Moldova .
Good luck with that .

Data:: Section - 2009-12-09
First , An Alternative
Data :: Section was actually written when I realized I could n't use Inline : : Files .
I 'd wanted to use that ages ago , but it had a number of little problems .
The biggest problem , unfortunately , was that it just tried to be way , way too powerful .
I like overpowered modules as much as the next guy , but here 's about where I draw the line : Inline : : Files is a form of source filter , and includes this warning :
It is possible that this module may overwrite the source code in files that use it .
To protect yourself against this possibility , you are strongly advised to use the - backup option described in " Safety first " .
The DATA Section
Data:: Section ( and Inline : : Files ) are meant to make the __DATA__ section both more powerful and more reliable .
For those of you who have n't encountered it , Perl lets you access a virtual filehandle that reads non-code content at the end of your program file .
In other words , if you write this program :
1 :
2 :
3 :
4 :
5 :
6 :
7 :
8 :
9 :
10 :
11 :
12 :
13 :
14 :
my $ total = 0 ;
while ( < DATA > ) {
chomp ;
printf " Got number : %u
" , $ _ ;
$ total += $ _ ;
}
printf " Total : %u
" , $ total ;
__DATA__
2
4
6
8
... then your program would output :
Got number : 2 Got number : 4 Got number : 6 Got number : 8 Total : 20
Why Data:: Section Beats DATA
No Need to seek
There are a few problems with DATA , though .
The most annoying is that you can't easily seek on it .
Its read position is actually relative to the whole source file , so you 'd need to try to tell it first , then save that , and things get messy .
Data :: Section caches your data for you , so you can reread it any time you want .
Multiple " Files " Per Module
The DATA filehandle is one big entity , but Data : : Section lets you provide multiple virtual files in your data :
1 :
2 :
3 :
4 :
5 :
6 :
7 :
8 :
9 :
10 :
11 :
12 :

package Your :: Package ;
use Data:: Section - setup ;
my $ sections = Your : : Package -> merged_section_data ;
for my $ filename ( keys % $ sections ) {
printf " == %s ==
%s
" , $ filename , Your : : Package -> section_data ( $ filename ) ;
}
__DATA__
___ [ so - far.txt ] ___
Sub :: Exporter
Number :: Nary
Email : : Pipemailer : : DieHandler
Pod :: Coverage :: TrustPod
Games : : Bowling :: Scorecard
__ [ coming - up. txt ]__
Mixin :: Linewise
App:: Cronjob
String :: Formatter
Data:: Section
Email :: MIME :: Kit
You 'll get two " filenames " and each one will have five lines in it .
( By the way , that use Data : : Section line ?
Yeah , that 's all you have to do .
Obviously , Data :: Section uses Sub :: Exporter , so you can rename its methods , and there are a few parameters you can use to customize them . )
Inherited Files
If you 're wondering what 's " merged " in the merged_section_data method , it 's inherited files .
In other words , if you wrote a subclass of the Your : : Package code above , you could add new files in its DATA section , but the old files would still be accessible -- unless you added a so - far. txt definition to your subclass .
It behaves very much like an overridden method , in that way .
Practical Uses
When is this useful ?
It 's great to use instead of here - docs for a lot of cases .
It 's also a nice way to avoid having to install and manage text files .
A package can store its own bundle of configuration or template files , and it will have methods to access them .
Then if you want , you can specialize your pack of template files by subclassing the original one .
Even without all its new features , the simple ability to never re-seek DATA is a big one .
( Please note that Data : : Section caches the contents , it does n't magically take care of re-seeking .
That ends up being a real problem . )
DATA is a global variable , and if code ever tries to read from it more than once , the second time will fail , and that is a really annoying bug to track down -- trust me , I 've had to do so many times .
So , forget about plain old DATA sections and start using Data : : Section .
Your future self will thank you .

Mesa police will shell out about $ 500,000 to replace its aged fleet of 21 motorcycles , and while the city continues to struggle financially , Sgt. Ed Wessing said the bikes wo n't cost taxpayers a dime .
The half - million - dollar price tag will be paid entirely from Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations funds , or RICO funds , collected through the forfeiture of assets tied to various crimes .
" We have to make sure we have vehicles for these officers to do their jobs , " said Wessing , a police spokesman and former motor - patrol officer .
" It 's important to have vehicles that are going to be safe and dependable . "
Historically , the department has used a Kawasaki 1000 P , which has largely remained unchanged since it was introduced in the 1970s .
" Incidents where there were very serious conditions and collisions could be related to the lack of ABS and poor lighting , " Wessing said .
" Those were the major safety downfalls of those motorcycles . "
Technology and safety features , such as anti-lock braking systems ( ABS ) , on the new Kawasaki Concours ' , which will replace the 1000 P , mean officers will be able stop their bikes within half the distance .
The department hoped to upgrade its aging motorcycle fleet last year , but severe budget issues forced city officials to freeze all new vehicle purchases citywide , Wessing said .
As months ticked by , Motor Unit Sgt. Cory Calkins approached Sgt. Bryan Soller , president of the local and state chapters of the Fraternal Order of Police .
The department began seeking alternative funding sources for the bikes , which Soller said are a must for officer safety .
" There 's a lot of new technology for these bikes that makes it that much safer for these officers , " he said .
Motor - patrol officers are responsible for traffic patrol and seek speeders , conduct DUI enforcement , accident investigations and other duties .
" There 's an advantage over being inside a police car , " Soller said .
Bikes can easily travel between snarled traffic and can catch up with suspect vehicles much faster .
The department should receive the new bikes early next year .
Included in the $ 500,000 price tag are new helmets with state - of - the - art communications systems , police lighting and sirens , and custom collision bars , which should protect the bike from significant damage should it be dropped on its side .
" It 's expensive , but one officer going down in an accident that can be avoided would cost a lot more , " Soller said .
Some of the old bikes will be used for training motor - patrol officers , Wessing said .
Others will be placed into the city 's fleet bound for auction .
When I woke this morning at 5 AM UK time , I discovered an in - box full of emails from people asking if I knew what was going on with Amazon .
My books — and all books from Macmillan and its many divisions , including Tor , my publisher — had disappeared from the Amazon webstore in both physical and electronic editions .
The New York Times quotes an industry insider as saying that Amazon pulled these books in retaliation for a demand from Macmillan to raise the price of Kindle books from $ 10 to $ 15 .
Presumably , Amazon perceives the $ 10 price - tag as a way of encouraging people to buy its Kindle platform , which itself is a kind of roach - motel for books : the license terms and DRM on the books in the Kindle store prohibit you from reading your Kindle books on competing devices .
So books check in , but they do n't check out .
( I believe that Amazon 's terms , patents and trade - secrets also prohibit its rivals from making software that converts or renders Kindle books for that purpose .
I have asked Amazon whether this was true on more than ten occasions over the past several years , in my capacity as a writer , publisher , and columnist for the Guardian and Publishers Weekly , but they refuse to answer . )
If the NYT 's report is true , then this is a case of two corporate giants illustrating neatly exactly why market concentration is bad for the arts :
* If true , Macmillan demanding a $ 15 pricetag for its ebooks is just plain farcical .
Although there are sunk costs in book production , including the considerable cost of talented editors , copy - editors , typesetters , PR people , marketers , and designers , the incremental cost of selling an ebook is zero .
And audiences have noticed this .
$ 15 is comparable to the discounted price for a new hardcover in a chain bookstore , and it costs more than zero to sell that book .
Demanding parity pricing suggests that paper , logistics , warehousing , printing , returns and inventory control cost nothing .
This is untrue on its face , and readers are aware of this fact .
Update : not to say that all ebooks should cost the same .
But they should be cheaper than print editions .
* If true , Amazon draping itself in the consumer - rights flag in demanding a fair price is even more farcical .
Though Amazon 's physical - goods sales business is the best in the world when it comes to giving buyers a fair shake , this is materially untrue when it comes to electronic book sales , a sector that it dominates .
As mentioned above , Amazon 's DRM and license terms on its Kindle ( as well as on its Audible audiobooks division , which controls the major share of the world 's audiobook sales ) are markedly unfair to readers .
Amazon 's ebooks are locked ( by contract and by DRM ) to the Kindle ( this is even true of the " DRM - free " Kindle books , which still have license terms that prohibit moving the books ) .
This is not due to rightsholder - demands , either : as I discovered when I approached Amazon about selling my books without DRM and without a bad license agreement for Kindle and Audible , they will not allow copyright owners to modify their terms , nor to include text in the body of the work releasing readers from those terms .
Concentration in media is nothing new — as far back as the eighties , activists have been sounding the alarm about mergers and acquisitions in publishing and bookselling ( and , of course , in film we have the antitrust decisions of the 1940s ) .
In the eighties , we worried that mergers would create corporate giants that would dictate unfair terms in distribution , sales , contracts with writers , pricing , and so on .
But today , we have a deeper worry .
For no matter that a giant distributor or a massively agglomerated publisher could distort the market to the detriment of readers and writers — we could bounce back , through competition and new technology and innovative marketing and sales ( and we did , by and large ) .
But today , we have a much more permanent , and graver risk : contracts and DRM have the power to lock readers and writers into legally unbreakable shackles .
There 's no such thing as a proprietary book .
There 's no such thing as a license agreement necessary to read a book .
Books are governed by a social contract that is older than publishing , older even than printing .
The recent innovation of copyright in books recognizes the ancient compact between readers and writers , and protects your rights to own your books , to loan them , to give them away , to resell them , to read them in any nation , in any circumstance .
A publisher or bookseller can't force you to buy Ikea sofas to sit upon while you read your books .
But Amazon can force you to buy Kindles ( and Amazon - approved devices ) to read your Kindle books on and listen to your Audible audiobooks on .
Forever .
And if one of the five titans that control almost all of publishing gets into a scrap with one of the four or five titans that control almost all ebook publishing , or the one company that rules the audiobook market , the collateral damage is that you will have to choose to eschew a gigantic slice of all the literature ever made in order to hang on to your library , or abandon your library in order to get access to that publisher 's work .
Or fill your shoulderbag with a half - dozen tablets and readers , one for each permutation of which corporate elephant is trying to crush another .
There 's an easy fix for this .
Amazon ( and its competitors ) could allow copyright owners to choose whether they want DRM - by - contract on their books .
In a world where readers are allowed to take their books to the platform that offers them the best terms , everybody wins : Macmillan can license to a competitor of Amazon 's at a higher price and pull their books from Amazon , and if readers boycott those ebooks , Macmillan will see the light and come down in price — all without either party having to dictate terms to the other .
In a world where there is a competitive market for books and reading devices , Amazon can draw readers who start off as Apple iPad customers into the Kindle store , without having to convince them to switch devices or abandon their collections .
If Macmillan wants to flex its muscle on an issue of substance and moment , an issue that will make it the hero of readers and writers and booksellers everywhere , it can demand that Amazon , Apple , B&N , and all the other ebook readers allow for interoperability and remove contracts that undo centuries ' worth of book - ownership norms .
And if Amazon wants to throw its toys out of the pram over a consumer rights issue , let it announce that it will offer a fair deal for any book that publishers and writers will allow a fair deal — no DRM , no abusive EULA , just " This book is governed by 17USC , the United States Copyright Law .

Update : Amazon " capitulates . "
The story you 're about to read is n't an urban legend per se — it 's all true , in fact — but there 's a longstanding popular myth associated with it .
On hot , summer days in one of the oldest neighborhoods in Boston , they say , a faint , sickeningly - sweet odor wafts up from cracks in the pavement — the stench of 85 - year - old molasses .
Story of the Great Molasses Disaster
The date was January 15 , 1919 , a Wednesday .
It was about half - past noon .
In Boston 's industrial North End , folks were going about their business as usual .
Only one small detail seemed out of the ordinary , and that was the temperature — unseasonably warm , in the mid-40s , up from a frigid two degrees above zero just three days before .
The sudden thaw had lifted everyone 's spirits .
To anyone who was out on the street that day , it scarcely seemed a harbinger of disaster .
But trouble was brewing fifty feet above street level in the form of a cast - iron tank containing two - and - a - half million gallons of crude molasses .
The molasses , owned by the United States Industrial Alcohol Company , was slated to be made into rum , but this particular batch would never make it to the distillery .
At about 12:40 p.m. the giant tank ruptured , emptying its entire contents into Commercial Street in the space of a few seconds .
The result was nothing less a flash flood consisting of millions of gallons of sweet , sticky , deadly goo .
The Boston Evening Globe published a description based on eyewitness accounts later that day :
Fragments of the great tank were thrown into the air , buildings in the neighborhood began to crumple up as though the underpinnings had been pulled away from under them , and scores of people in the various buildings were buried in the ruins , some dead and others badly injured .
The explosion came without the slightest warning .
The workmen were at their noontime meal , some eating in the building or just outside , and many of the men in the Department of Public Works Buildings and stables , which are close by , and where many were injured badly , were away at lunch .
Once the low , rumbling sound was heard no one had a chance to escape .
The buildings seemed to cringe up as though they were made of pasteboard .
The bulk of the devastation was caused by what was described as a " wall of molasses " at least eight feet high — 15 , according to some bystanders — which rushed through the streets at a speed of 35 miles per hour .
It demolished entire buildings , literally ripping them off their foundations .
It upended vehicles and buried horses .
People tried to outrun the torrent , but were overtaken and either hurled against solid objects or drowned where they fell .
More than 150 people were injured .
21 were killed .
Was the Disaster a Result of Negligence or Sabotage ?
The clean - up took weeks .
Once that was done , the filing of lawsuits began .
More than a hundred plaintiffs lined up to seek damages from the United States Industrial Alcohol Company .
Hearings went on for six years , during which 3,000 people testified , including several " expert witnesses " for the defense who were well paid to argue that the explosion had been the result of sabotage , not negligence on the part of the company .
In the end , however , the court ruled for the plaintiffs , finding that the tank had been overfilled and inadequately reinforced .
No evidence of sabotage was ever found .
All told , the company was forced to pay out nearly a million dollars in damages — a bittersweet victory for survivors of one of the strangest disasters in American history .
BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- Google Inc. Chief Executive Eric
Schmidt got some privacy advocates agitated this week with an offhanded remark that indicated a naïve attitude toward privacy .
He said : " If you have something that you do n't want anyone to know , maybe you should n't be doing it in the first place , but if you really need that kind of privacy , the reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time , and it 's important , for example that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act .
It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities . "
Read more about Schmidt 's comments .
By turning the argument against the user with " just do n't do anything wrong and you 'll be OK , " Schmidt is essentially saying that we are now going to start spying on you .
What else can it mean ?
This sort of proclamation regarding " the authorities " sounds like something the Stasi or KGB would tell the public .
It 's a threat .
For a chief executive to make what amounts to a threat to its users is absolutely astonishing .
The general milquetoast reaction to this threat is even more astounding , but understandable .
Our privacy rights have been eroding for years and just accelerated with the Bush administration .
President Barack Obama has been on board since day one .
What sort of society wants to tap the phone calls of all its citizens ?
What sort of society wants to rifle through your personal belongings after busting into your house ?
These notions are promoted on TV with shows like " 24 " and other cop shows , where warrantless searches are common .
( Even the actual mechanisms are revealed : " Did you hear a scream for help in there ? " " YES !
Let 's bust in . " )
Of course , the bugaboo of terrorism is key to all this .
Yes , I 'm aware after eight years without a new terrorist attack that one eventually will take place , and that we 'll be told it could have been prevented with more surveillance .
“ When someone says if you are not doing anything wrong you have nothing to fear , that person is being misleading and disingenuous . ”
In the technology world , where libertarianism and human rights have been contentious issues , one too many Scott McNealys ( the chairman of Sun Microsystems Inc. JAVA ) have come along making abhorrent and cavalier comments , such as " privacy is dead , get over it . "
It 's no coincidence that this cancerous surrender was transferred to Schmidt , the former chief scientist at Sun under McNealy .
Schmidt , it should be noted , had a few personal details of his life revealed a few years ago by CNet in an exercise to show the power of Google 's GOOG , +0.01 % search engine .
Schmidt was incensed that , for instance , his home address was unearthed , and the company then banned CNet from its press events .
Read the CNet article at issue .
Using Schmidt 's logic , one has to ask :
Why did he care if he was n't doing anything wrong ?
Lack of concern and failure to protect privacy is a lack of concern for the nation and its democratic institutions .
While the system may be in full failure mode -- with full - time surveillance , prying and out - and - out spying on the citizenry combined with various redundant police forces -- we 've created a culture of fear and corruption .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt .
Google
It 's the corruption that 's the problem .
When someone says if you are not doing anything wrong you have nothing to fear , that person is being misleading and disingenuous .
Privacy concerns are not about you ; they are not about me .
They are about everyone else .
We have to protect the minor philanderers and the mildly kinky politicians and judges and those who really have something to hide from blackmail that affects you .
A member of Congress who is having an affair is compromised , and a lobbyist may use that information to sway his or her vote -- a vote detrimental to our interests .
This is the problem , not the fact that you have a secret bookie unbeknownst to your wife that Google rooted out with data mining .
Big deal .
So for starters there is blackmail and undue influence of public officials .
Then there is the ability to data - mine personal stock transactions .
Imagine how easy it would be to figure out M&A activity with lax privacy standards .
Give me the Gmail database for a week ; I 'll be a billionaire overnight .
This hurts the integrity of the stock market and the foundations of the market - based system .
Capitalism itself is threatened .
Yet , according to McNealy , we have to " get over it " -- get over it and just let the whole system become corrupt .
What about news coverage of Google itself ?
" Sir , you 've been a critic of Google .
Does your wife know that you 've been buying jewelry for this woman named Raven Strauss ? "
This sort of thing is why we should be concerned about privacy , and not about spying on you in particular .
" Where did this whistle - blower get information ?
Let 's tap her phone and find out ! "
Again , this is not about you .
I 'm remiss to point the finger at Schmidt and McNealy , because there are many irresponsible executives in the tech sector who spew the same misleading garbage .
( I wonder what they 're trying to hide .
Maybe we should look into it : Grab their browser cookies , put spyware on their machine , monitor their searches .
Or go to work for Google ; it seems to be doing that already . )
Maybe Schmidt will come to his senses .
Google traditionally has been protective of the information it has accumulated .
What changed ?
Was Schmidt compromised and is this the result ?
What do they have on Schmidt ?
Also , who are " they ? "
What 's in the dossier ?
Yes , this is how it works .
Welcome to the Privacy is Dead era , comrade .

JOHANNESBURG 
The icon is a very old man now .
His hair is white , his body frail .
Visitors say Nelson Mandela leans heavily on a cane when he walks into his study .
He slips off his shoes , lowers himself into a stiff - backed chair and lifts each leg onto a cushioned stool .
His wife , Graça , adjusts his feet “ so they ’re symmetrical , and gives him a peck , ” says George Bizos , his old friend and lawyer .
To Mr. Mandela ’s left is a small table piled with newspapers in English and Afrikaans , the language of the whites who imprisoned him for 27 years .
Family and old comrades sit to his right , where his hearing is better .
His memory has weakened , but he still loves to reminisce , bringing out oft - told stories “ like polished stones , ” as one visitor put it .
“ There ’s a quietness about him , ” said Barbara Masekela , his chief of staff after his release from prison in 1990 .
“ I find myself trying to amuse him , and I feel joyous when he breaks out in laughter . ”
Mr. Mandela , perhaps the world ’s most beloved statesman and a natural showman , has repeatedly announced his retirement from public life only to appear at a pop concert in his honor or a political rally .
But recently , as he canceled engagements , rumors that he was gravely ill swirled so persistently in South Africa that his foundation released a statement saying he was “ as well as anyone can expect of someone who is 91 years old . ”
I do n’t know .
Maybe it is just another case of the Republicans accusing the Democrats of something they themselves are guilty of .
FiveThirtyEight has an interesting article about identity politics .
For example , The GOP has long accused Democrats of supporting affirmative action mainly to attract minority votes , even if it did n’t actually help that minority .
Dubya even called it , the “ soft bigotry of low expectations ” .
And by being the party of the “ big tent ” , Democrats are effectively held hostage by trying to buy the votes of all the many groups under their tent .
But now we have a curious case where the GOP is playing identity politics in the worst way possible .
Republicans claim to be against government health care , and have long been opposed to Medicare .
In fact , Medicare goes against just about every principle that conservatives claim to believe in .
And yet , the Republicans have suddenly become the champions of Medicare , attacking the Democrats for trying to cut Medicare funding .
Why are they doing this ?
Because Medicare is extremely popular with those “ angry , mostly - white seniors ” that the Republicans are increasingly dependent on .
So they scream about “ death panels ” , when it is clear that much of the $ 50 billion that is spent by Medicare each year on patients at the end of their lives is wasted : spent on procedures with no health benefit or increase in quality of life ; ordered by doctors and hospitals who are more worried about being sued ; and paid for by Medicare , so there is no financial disincentive for relatives to demand that “ everything medically possible ” be done .
When The Gays first learned that Ted Olson , uber - conservative and defender of George W. Bush ’s presidency , would be taking the lead in Perry v. Schwarzenegger , the case to decide gay marriage at a federal level , many folks , including Gay Inc. leaders , were suspicious of his motives .
Was this guy going to purposefully throw the trial by putting forth a bunk argument in favor of marriage equality , and effectively ruin the gay marriage fight for everyone else ?
But as Perry has proceeded ( we ’re now in Week 3 ) , the opposite appears to be true :
Not only is Olson ( and co-counsel Boies ) throwing down arguments that makes gay marriage seem like the only reasonable thing to allow , it ’s the defendants at Protect Marriage that appear to be purposefully throwing their own case .
The National Organization for Marriage should be pissed !
When the defense called professor Kenneth Miller as its first witness , the court played witness not only to a man whose credentials as an expert on anything are seriously in doubt , but that his own conclusions about gays and marriage were n’t based on his own independent research .
And then , in a mind - blowing admission on the stand ( during what ended up as a nine - hour cross-examination ) he admitted that yes , the Defense of Marriage Act — which , like Prop 8 , prohibits government recognition of same - sex marriage — is discriminatory .
If that were n’t enough , Protect Marriage ’s second witness on the stand managed to further damage their case .
David Blankenhorn ( pictured ) , founder of the Institute for American Values ( how official sounding ! ) and supposedly one of the defense ’s “ best ” expert witnesses , got on the stand and helped sink the defense ’s case .
Under cross-examination , he acknowledged that , not three years a go in a book he authored , he wrote that this country would be “ more American on the day we permit same - sex marriage than we were on the day before . ”
He also dropped a bomb on one of Protect Marriage ’s core arguments :
That only heterosexual marriage is healthy enough to raise children .
On the stand , Blankenhorn admitted he did n’t know of any scientific studies that said children raised by gay parents were worse off than the children of hetero parents .
Moreover , Blankenhorn also dismissed the idea that two adoptive parents ( even of the heterosexual variety ) were just as good as biological parents .
“ No sir , that ’s not correct , ” he told Boies on cross .
Which means Protect Marriage ’s second witness , in arguing against gay marriage ( but proving its normalcy at the same time ) , is heretofore recommending we ban adoption too , because that ’s just not as healthy for kids as two heterosexual biological parents .
Think we ’re making a leap ?
Consider that Blankenhorn ’s argument against gay marriage rests on the same facts : it ’s not as good as heterosexual marriage .
No wonder Judge Vaughn Walker almost nixed Blankenhorn ’s status as an “ expert ” witness .
Worth noting : Blankenhorn ’s name was most recently attached to this Times op - ed , co-authored with Maggie Gallagher debate challenger Jonathan Rauch , that argues civil unions should be legalized , and the M - word not used — only because it ’s too controversial and is n’t a good enough compromise with religious conservatives .
Not because there ’s a reasonable argument against giving gays full marriage rights .
No surprise the American Foundation for Equal Rights , which is footing Olson - Boies ’ bill , blasted an email out headlined , “ PROP .
8 CASE HEADS TO END WITH DEFENDANTS ’ OWN WITNESSES MAKING PLAINTIFFS ’ CASE . ”
Uwe und Hannelore Romeike verstehen sich als evangelikale Christen und vertreten die Ansicht , dass das deutsche Bildungssystem Werte vermittelt , die gegen christliche Grundsätze verstoßen .
Weil sie ihre Kinder hierzulande nicht zu Hause unterrichten durften , suchten sie Asyl in den USA .
Nach Angaben der amerikanischen Home School Legal Defense Association ( HSLDA ) gewährte am Dienstag der US - Einwanderungsrichter Lawrence Burman nach einer Anhörung in Memphis ( Tennessee ) den Antrag der Familie auf Asyl .
Damit können die Romeikes in den USA bleiben und ihre Kinder weiterhin selbst zu Hause unterrichten .
Die Familie lebt seit 2008 in Morristown ( Tennessee ) .
Die HSLDA zitiert auf ihrer Homepage die Entscheidung , die Richter Burman nach einer Anhörung gefällt habe : „ Menschen , die ihre Kinder zu Hause unterrichten wollen , sind eine besondere soziale Gruppe , die die deutsche Regierung zu unterdrücken versucht .
Diese Familie hat eine gut begründete Furcht vor Verfolgung . (...)
Deswegen steht ihr Asyl zu , und das Gericht wird ihr Asyl gewähren . “
Weiter sagte der Richter : „ Die deutsche Regierung bezeichnet Homeschooler als Mitglieder einer Parallelgesellschaft und versucht , sie auszumerzen .
Das ist verrückt und dumm und widerspricht all dem , was wir Amerikaner glauben . “
Schulpflicht geht in Deutschland vor
Flucht ins Ausland
Was in den USA und vielen anderen europäischen Ländern erlaubt ist , ist in Deutschland bis auf wenige Ausnahmen seit 1939 verboten .
Damals wurde deutschlandweit die allgemeine Schulpflicht eingeführt .
Die Schulbehörden hierzulande befürchten unter anderem , dass die Eltern nicht ausreichend qualifiziert sind , der Unterricht nicht lehrplangemäß abläuft oder die Kinder gar isoliert werden .
In einem Interview mit der „ Washington Post “ sagte Uwe Romeike , dass in den vergangenen zehn bis 20 Jahren ein zunehmender Verfall der christlichen Werte an deutschen Schulen zu beobachten gewesen sei .
Zudem seien seine Kinder an deutschen Schulen mit Gewalt und Mobbing konfrontiert gewesen .
Im Jahr 2006 nahm das aus Baden - Württemberg stammende Ehepaar drei seiner ältesten Kinder von der Schule .
Nachdem die mehrfachen Aufforderungen der Behörden , die Kinder in die Schule zu schicken , unbeachtet blieben , stand im Oktober 2006 die Polizei vor Romeikes Tür , um die Kinder in die Schule zu bringen .
Nachdem das Bundesverfassungsgericht in einem Urteil bestätigte , dass sich die Familie der allgemeinen Schulpflicht zu beugen habe , entschlossen sich die Eheleute , in die USA zu fliehen .
Volker Ladenthin , Erziehungswissenschaftler an der Universität Bonn , schätzt , dass es in Deutschland bis zu 1000 Familien gibt , die ihre Kinder zu Hause unterrichten .
Auch die Familie Neubronner aus Bremen wollte sich 2008 das Recht erstreiten , ihre Kinder zu Hause zu unterrichten , und verlor .
Die Familie setzte sich nach Gran Canaria ab , um der Schulpflicht zu entgehen .
Iranian state television has made a documentary about the death of Neda Agha Soltan , a young Iranian woman who was shot dead during the June postelection protests in Tehran , suggesting she was an agent of the United States and Britain who staged her own death .
...
The state - television documentary suggests the video of Neda 's dying moments merely depicted her pouring blood on her own face from a special bottle she was carrying .
Later , the documentary alleges that 27 - year - old Neda was shot dead in the car that was taking her to a hospital .
...
" While Neda is [ pretending ] she is injured and is lying on the back seat of the car on their lap , they bring out a handgun from their pockets , " the documentary 's narrator says .
" A handgun that they obtained from their Western and Iranian friends to water the tree of reforms and kill people and create divisions within society .
Neda , for a moment , realizes their wicked plan and struggles to escape , but they quickly shoot her from behind . "
The narrator adds that this is how " deceived and deceitful " Neda was killed .
The Times editorialized last week that the killings of Iranian opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi 's nephew and several other opposition signal how increasingly desperate the Tehran regime is in stopping opposition forces .
How quickly the government provides another example of its desperation :
This kind of farcical propaganda -- and this is an especially gruesome example -- reminds me of some of communist Eastern Europe 's greatest hits , namely , calling the Berlin Wall the " Anti-Fascist Protection Wall . "
( Remember that the East German government , too , resorted to such a measure at a moment of desperation , when Easterners were fleeing West in great numbers . )
Historical comparisons aside , Tehran will also put five protesters arrested during last week 's demonstrations on trial for warring against God , a charge that carries an automatic death sentence upon conviction .
In addition , several members of the Bahai faith , which is outlawed in Iran , were arrestedbecause " they played a role in organizing the Ashura protests and namely for having sent abroad pictures of the unrest , " according to Tehran 's prosecutor general .
The question , of course , is whether the regime 's actions will have a chilling effect on opposition forces .
The killing of Mousavi 's nephew certainly did n't scare away protesters , and as The Times ' editorial notes , the pro-reform movement " appears to have grown into a politically and geographically diverse grass - roots uprising .
Its challenge of the election results has expanded into a challenge to the very legitimacy of the Islamic government . "
Best of luck ( but not , really ) fighting against that .

What happens when people start watching less television ?
Do they eat less ?
Exercise more ?
Sleep better ?
That is what researchers at the University of Vermont set out to learn in a fascinating six week study to monitor television viewing , physical activity and eating habits .
As it turns out , watching less TV does n’t necessarily lead to more exercise or better eating habits , but it does result in subtle but meaningful changes in overall activity levels , according to a new study in The Archives of Internal Medicine .
Using monitoring equipment attached to TVs , the researchers tracked the viewing habits of 36 men and women who were overweight or obese .
Among the study subjects , the average amount of time spent watching television was five hours a day , similar to national trends .
For the next three weeks , 20 randomly selected study participants had their viewing cut in half .
Based on their previous viewing habits , each person was given a weekly limit of TV time .
Once the limit was reached , a monitor automatically shut the TV off and would not allow it to be turned on again until the next week .
A control group of 16 people continued to watch the same amount as always .
During both the first and second phase of the six week study , the participants also wore armbands for a week that measured their movements .
To the researchers ’ surprise , cutting back television time did n’t have an effect on calorie consumption , nor did it change sleep habits .
The group that watched less television did , however , move more , burning an average of 120 calories more a day than the control group .
Although some participants did report getting more exercise by walking their dogs more often or signing up for a yoga class , most of the people did n’t use their television - free time for scheduled physical exercise .
One person used the extra time to organize photo albums , others reported reading more or playing board games with their children .
Many said they spent the time doing more household chores or paying bills .
But even those minor changes in activity level counted a lot .
While the group that reduced television viewing burned off an additional 120 calories a day compared with the previous three weeks , the control group became even more sedentary , moving about 100 calories less than before .
The additional activity that resulted from less television time is the equivalent of walking about eight miles a week .
“ A lot of people might say , ‘ Of course people would move more with less television , ' ” said Jennifer J. Otten , now a postdoctorate research fellow at Stanford University School of Medicine .
“ What we were looking for was to see if there was a meaningful difference . ”
Dr. Otten said the finding that eating habits were n’t changed by less television time was surprising .
Earlier studies with children have found that reducing television time significantly reduced the number of calories a child consumed .
The fact that a similar effect was n’t found in adults may suggest that children are more easily influenced by food advertising on TV than adults .
Dr. Otten says the main lesson for adults is that reducing your television viewing time will result in a meaningful increase in activity even if you ’re not using the time for strenuous exercise .
“ Compared to watching television , you burn more calories reading , writing , doing desk work — pretty much any activity other than sleeping , ” Dr. Otten said .
“ The main finding is that if you turn off the TV , you may burn more calories without really thinking too much about it . ”
I was watching Meet the Press over the weekend ( because I ’m a party animal like that ) and heard Pastor Rick Warren says things that would make anyone ’s head spin .
Take this exchange :
MR. GREGORY : Just sticking with that topic for just a moment .
If the issue of legalizing gay marriage comes up again … MR .
WARREN : Mm-hmm .
MR. GREGORY : … on the ballot in California … MR .
WARREN : Mm-hmm .
MR . GREGORY : … would you work to fight that ?
MR .
WARREN : You know , my position on gay marriage is very clear and it has n’t changed .
What I do believe in is that it is my job to love everybody , no doubt about it .
MR .
GREGORY : So you would fight it ?
MR .
WARREN : Well , again , I ’m not a politician .
I did n’t fight it in the last issue …
He “ loves ” everybody … unless you happen to be a gay person who wants to get married like straight people do .
In that case , screw you .
Warren was n’t an official ringleader in support of California ’s Prop 8 last year , but he ’s arguably the most influential Christian in the world and anything he advocates to his congregation will have an impact well beyond the walls of his church .
He knows that and it ’s pathetic that he pretends otherwise .
MR. GREGORY : So you would fight it ?
MR .
WARREN : Well , again , I ’m not a politician .
I did n’t fight it in the last issue .
What was misunderstood is people , people on both sides tried to make me the campaign leader .
I only mentioned it one time , and I mentioned it to my own congregation when I was asked , “ What is our position on this ? ” and I made a video for our congregation .
Well , that was dumb , because it immediately went everywhere and then all the sudden it looked like I was the big campaigner .
And — but I was n’t .
Of course I have a position on it .
As a pastor , I happen to believe what the Bible says …
What does the Bible say about this ?
Ah , yes , 1 Corinthians 13 :
Love is patient , love is kind .
It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud .
It is not rude , it is not self - seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs .
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth .
It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres .
Unless you ’re a homo .
I cannot for the life of me understand how certain Christians can claim to love all people while at the same time actively fighting to stop others from experiencing the joy of marriage .
How do you not see the contradiction ?
Warren , whether he likes it or not , helps lead the charge .
Do n’t believe me ?
Just think of the ripple effect in the Christian community if Warren told his congregation that they should not vote against gay marriage , that homosexuals should be allowed to get married , and that Saddleback Church would be glad to sanctify those marriages in the name of Jesus .
You think other Christians would n’t take notice ?
Anyway , Warren is in the headlines this week for another reason , too .
Martin Ssempa is a Ugandan pastor who has made appearances at Saddleback in the past .
He is currently supporting legislation that could make sodomy punishable by death in his country .
Anyone in a position of authority who is aware of a gay or lesbian individual has 24 hours to inform police or face jail time .
Individuals found to engage in efforts to sexually stimulate another for the purpose of homosexual relations , or found touching another for that purpose , will face life in prison .
Those who engage in “ aggravated homosexuality ” — defined as repeated homosexual relations or sexual contact with others who are HIV / AIDS infected — will face the death penalty .
So two gay people in a committed relationship could be killed because of their acts of love .
Even outside the gay marriage issue , this is clearly injustice that any Christian would oppose .
Warren says he severed contact with Ssempa years ago , which is fine , but surely he could condemn the legislation , right ?
Of course not .
Here ’s what Warren said in response to this piece of legislation :
“ The fundamental dignity of every person , our right to be free , and the freedom to make moral choices are gifts endowed by God , our creator .
However , it is not my personal calling as a pastor in America to comment or interfere in the political process of other nations . ”
Rick Warren : Spreading the love .
( This is the same Warren who said in the Meet the Press interview that the number of abortions since Roe v Wade “ is a holocaust . ” )
Whether it ’s other nations or our nation , he has no problem taking political sides when it suits his needs .
It ’s shameful he ’s not taking a stance now when the correct response is so painfully obvious .
His silence speaks volumes about his character .

Matt Frei spoke to BBC World News America 's contributing analyst Ted Koppel about President Obama 's response to the failed bomb attempt on Christmas Day .
According to estimates from Hollywood.com Box Office , James Cameron ’s sci-fi opus grossed $ 68.3 million over New Years weekend , a tiny 10 percent drop from Christmas weekend for a $ 352.1 million domestic total .
Easily the biggest third weekend in the U.S. ever ( 2002 ’s “ Spider - Man ” had held the record with $ 45 million ) .
Only the director of “ Titanic ” could create another worldwide sensation of this magnitude .
“ Avatar “ , in just 17 days , has surpassed $ 1 billion in the global box office .
“ Avatar ” was positioned to hold up well for an event picture due to its pre-Christmas release .
While frequently the most bustling time of the year , December is not the month for opening weekend records , because business is spread throughout the week over the holidays .
Avatar director James Cameron ’s last picture , Titanic , was the extreme example of this , opening to a sensational $ 28.6 million on the same weekend in 1997 and then growing 24 percent over Christmas weekend .
Titanic , of course , was a legendarily unique phenomenon that ran at blockbuster levels for months , ultimately becoming the highest - grossing movie ever at $ 1.842B in the global box office .

Worldwide Top 5 is as follows :
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday the Obama administration has concluded that the best way to pressure Iran to come clean on its nuclear ambitions is to impose sanctions aimed at the country 's ruling elite .
" It is clear that there is a relatively small group of decision makers inside Iran , " she told reporters traveling with her en route to Hawaii .
" They are in both political and commercial relationships , and if we can create a sanctions track that targets those who actually make the decisions , we think that is a smarter way to do sanctions .
But all that is yet to be decided upon . "
Damascus Meeting Iranian FM , Assad talk of ' Zionist regime 's crimes ' Dudi Cohen Mottaki to Syrian president : Support for armed struggle against occupier is moral and human duty .
FM also passes on warm greetings from Iranian president , meets terror group leaders Iranian FM , Assad talk of ' Zionist regime 's crimes '
Clinton 's aircraft stopped at Travis Air Force Base to refuel on the first leg of a trip taking her to Hawaii , Australia , New Zealand and Papua New Guinea .
She did not get specific about those inside Iran who might be targeted with new international sanctions , but her allusion to Iranian leaders with political and commercial ties suggested that she was referring to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps , an elite group that is separate from the Iranian military and is charged with protecting the Islamic revolution that brought the clerics to power in 1979 .
Clinton said the administration 's thinking on approaches to more effective sanctions against Iran has been developed after consultations with a wide range of other countries .
" We 've been very actively involved in soliciting ideas from a broad range of other countries , looking at what will work , what wo n't work , what would have the biggest impact on perhaps changing the strategic calculation inside Iran of the current leadership , " she said .
She said the US remains interested in engaging with Iran , even as it considers ways to pressure Tehran through sanctions .
Asked by a reporter what she made of recent hints from Iran that it might be open to new solutions on the nuclear matter , Clinton said , " We get a constant flow of feelers from the Iranians on approaches that they might consider .
Other countries are reaching out to them all the time , asking if they will look at one or another proposal . "
Clinton said no final decisions on sanctions have been made .
Iran has balked at coming to an agreement on curtailing a nuclear program that the US and other nations fear is aimed at building atomic weapons .
Iran insists the program is strictly for peaceful purposes .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - As U.S. health officials struggle to vaccinate tens of millions of Americans against the pandemic of swine flu , some are looking regretfully at one easy way to instantly double or triple the number of doses available -- by using an immune booster called an adjuvant .

These additives , often as simple as an oil and water mixture , broaden the body ’s response to a vaccine , reducing the amount of active ingredient called antigen needed .
They are widely used in European flu vaccines as well as in Canada .
But not in the United States -- even though the federal government has spent nearly $ 700 million buying them .
The reason -- people might not trust them .
“ If we really do want pregnant women to trust this vaccine or even parents , we have to think about what is acceptable to them , ” Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an interview .
“ We have so much vaccine hesitancy in this country , ” agreed Jeff Levi of the non-profit Trust For America ’s Health .
“ To add ... a new element could well have undermined the efficacy of this campaign , ” Levi told a hearing this week before a Congressional subcommittee .
This frustrates the World Health Organization , which says the global capacity to make influenza vaccines is about 3 billion doses a year -- not enough to cover the population of 6.8 billion people .
WHO has hoped rich countries would donate leftover H1N1 vaccine to others .
The U.S. Health and Human Services Department was ready to try adjuvants had the pandemic been worse .
H1N1 swine flu has infected an estimated 22 million Americans and killed 3,900 , but it so far does not appear to be any deadlier than seasonal influenza .
The worry is that it is affecting younger adults and children instead of the elderly usually targeted by flu , and has the potential to mutate into something more deadly .
“ If things had been worse and this would have been a more severe pandemic , we may well have needed to go that way anyway , ” Levi said .
TRIED AND TRUE
Instead , the United States has stuck with what CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden has repeatedly called the “ tried and true ” approach -- the same formulation used in seasonal flu vaccines .
Five companies have contracts -- Sanofi-Aventis , CSL , Novartis , AstraZeneca unit MedImmune and GlaxoSmithKline .
Polls show that only about half of Americans plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 .
Of those who do not , about half say they worry about safety .
Even so , long lines have formed as people try to get the 50 million or so swine flu doses that have rolled out of factories .
Drug companies have struggled with an unpredictable virus that does not grow well in eggs , as well as changes to U.S. orders that slowed down packaging .
Studies suggest the supply that is out now could have been tripled .
In September , GlaxoSmithKline found a single shot of its H1N1 vaccine protected 98 percent of volunteers , using an adjuvant and just 5.25 micrograms of antigen .
A standard dose without adjuvant takes 15 micrograms of antigen .
Vaccine makers urged Congress this week to help federal agencies find ways to approve the use of adjuvants , and to assure skeptical Americans about their safety .
Dr. Vas Narasimhan , president of Novartis Vaccines USA , noted adjuvants had been licensed for use in Europe for 10 years and tested in 200,000 people .
“ Adjuvanted vaccines produce higher immune response than unadjuvanted vaccines particularly in the elderly and young children , ” Narasimhan told a hearing this week .
He said they may protect better than standard vaccines against viruses that have drifted a little -- the single biggest reason that flu vaccines must be re-formulated every year .
They may also eventually help require less vaccination .
“ Adjuvanted vaccines have been shown to more broadly prime patients ’ immune response ( up to seven years later ) , requiring fewer vaccinations to the newly circulating strain , ” he said .
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is intrigued .
Last month it awarded $ 60 million to researchers and companies to develop new adjuvants .
It 's getting closer and closer to check - writing time for Steve Ballmer , as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has just upheld a decision that would see Microsoft Word and Office banned from sale starting January 11 .
If you 'll recall , Microsoft lost a patent infringement suit against XML specialists i4 i back in May when it was found that Word 's handling of .xml , .docx , and .docm files infringed upon i4 i's patented XML handling algorithms , but the injunction against further Word sales was put on hold pending the results of this appeal .
Now that Microsoft has lost once again , we 'd expect either another appeal and request for the injunction to be stayed , this time to the Supreme Court , or for a settlement between these two that would end this whole mess right now .
We 'll see what happens -- stay tuned .
P.S. - Just to be clear on this , i4i is n't a patent troll -- it 's a 30 person database design company that shipped one of the first XML plugins for Office and was actually responsible for revamping the entire USPTO database around XML to make it compatible with Word back in 2000 .
What 's more , the patents involved here do n't cover XML itself , but rather the specific algorithms used to read and write custom XML -- so OpenOffice users can breathe easy , as i4i has said the suite does n't infringe .
Existing Office users should also be fine , as only future sales of Word are affected by the ruling , not any already - sold products .
Engadget : Helping you flame with accuracy .
Microsoft says it 's moving quickly to prepare versions of Office 2007 and Word 2007 that do n't have the " little - used " XML features for sale by January 11 , and that the Office 2010 beta " does not contain the technology covered by the injunction , " which can be read in a number of ways .
It 's also considering an appeal , so we 'll see what happens next .
More than 80 activists packed a Brisbane university classroom on Monday night , hoping to build on a social media campaign against the Federal Government 's proposed internet filter .
Last week federal Communications Minister Stephen Conroy announced the Government would move ahead with plans to force all ISPs to block " Refused Classification " material .
The material would include sites on overseas servers containing child sex abuse , bestiality , sexual violence or detailed information about how to use drugs or commit crimes .
Activists argue the blacklist will also include material that should be accessible to adults , such as pornography that is legal to possess in Australia , and information about topics such as abortion and euthanasia .
They say the Government should cancel plans for the mandatory filter and focus on giving parents advice on how to supervise their children online .
Following the Minister 's announcement , hundreds of comments were left on the ABC website , most condemning the move .
The " #nocleanfeed " hashtag , which was used on Twitter posts opposing the filter , became one of the most popular topics discussed on the social networking site that afternoon .
Many Facebook users are also supporting the campaign , with the " Stop mandatory filtering of Australian internet " protest page counting more than 10,000 fans .
But Senator Conroy shows no signs of backing down , and says he intends to introduce the legislation to Parliament in the first half of next year .
New approach
The organiser of the Brisbane protest meeting , Nicholas Perkins , says news of the gathering spread through word of mouth and sites like Facebook and Twitter , attracting a broad group of participants .
" We 're getting support from stereotypical geeks to everyday computer users , as well as students who may not be on the internet a lot but need to use it for research , " he said .
Speakers called for a new approach to fighting the filter , describing poorly attended street marches in 2008 as " embarrassing " .
" This is not the time to be making fools of ourselves , " Nic Suzor from lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia ( EFA ) told the meeting .
His organisation is advocating an online protest in January that would see websites and social media sites turning black .
He says a similar " internet blackout " about copyright laws in New Zealand successfully pressured the government there to reverse changes to legislation .
Youth disenchantment
Michael Meloni , 25 , says the movement is getting attention from people who might normally be politically disengaged .
He has started a campaign to deliver a stocking of coal to the Minister for each 1,000 letters he gets opposing the filter .
" I think it 's damaging the way young people look at Labor , " he said .
" It wo n't change much now in terms of seats , but it 's not something people our age will forget . "
ABC elections analyst Antony Green agrees it would be unusual for a single issue like this to have much impact on the outcome of a federal election .
" The big difference in Australia is we have compulsory voting , " he said .
" With voluntary voting , online campaigns can motivate people to vote .
So narrow campaigns built around online activism are n't nearly as effective here because you have to change people 's votes rather than get them to show up . "
While Australian elections do tend to be decided by younger voters , Mr Green says he is not convinced the internet filter is an issue which is having a big impact .
" Swing voters tend to be people voting on economic issues - people who do n't pay too much attention to politics , " he said .
The residents of Gaza have a name for the period of tribal lawlessness that plagued their impoverished territory between Israel ’s withdrawal in 2005 and the Hamas takeover of 2007 .
Marred by rampant tit - for - tat murders , kidnappings , theft , and checkpoints run by armed clans , Gazans call these years ayam al - fowda , or the “ days of chaos . ”
Those days are gone , however , after 2 - 1/ 2 years of strong Hamas rule successfully disarmed the territory ’s rival clans – made up of just one or sometimes several extended families – and restored order again to Gaza ’s streets .
But some of the same families responsible for much of Gaza ’s violence before the Hamas takeover say the Islamist movement has since used crime control as a pretext to influence the clans ’ unique system of tribal law – an ancient oral code experts say often contradicts Hamas ’s own version of Islamic justice – by appointing pro-Hamas clan chiefs and pressuring local leaders to issue Islamic - style rulings .
Hamas officials say clan leaders , referred to locally as mukhtars , are free to practice their own methods of reconciliation , as long as the rule of law is respected and justice is served .
But any overt politicization of the chiefs , historically seen as societal mediators in Gaza , may end up threatening the independence of a system experts say has regulated Gazan society at the grass - roots for centuries .
“ This is a matter of the very deeply entrenched customs of Palestinian society , ” says the director of the Al - Dameer Association for Human Rights in Gaza , Khalil Abu Shammala .
“ Any takeover or molding of this [ tribal ] system will most certainly affect the core of social relations in Gaza , especially when we take into consideration Hamas ’s increasing Islamization of the law . "
Gaza ’s tribal code is a blend of pre-Islamic Bedouin traditions and customs dating back to the era of the Philistines , that are interwoven with , but not anchored in , some Islamic principles .
With guidelines and punishments for everything from clashes between families and personal injury claims to disputes over land and even murder , the code can provide powerful social glue in the absence of a functioning state , analysts say .
Clan adjudication methods , often carried out in the homes of clan leaders over tea , are consensual between parties , and regularly end in the accused paying some sort of monetary compensation to the victim or the victim ’s family .
Because formal courts under the Fatah - led Palestinian Authority were tarnished by accusations of corruption , the mukhtars became virtually the only functioning judiciary in Gaza during the “ days of chaos . ”
“ Like all institutions , the judicial system was affected greatly by the Israeli occupation ” beginning after the Six - Day War of 1967 , says Gaza - based lawyer Samer Mousa .
Many Palestinians in Gaza viewed Israeli courts as biased , he adds .
“ The occupation strengthened the mukhtars , ” Mr. Mousa continues , “ who became rooted very deeply in society as judicial mediators when the Palestinian Authority took over [ in 1993 ] . ”
Clan leaders feel political pressure from Hamas
In the southern Gaza Strip town of Khan Younis , Abu Nabeel , a self - proclaimed apolitical mukhtar responsible for judging disputes between thousands of his extended family members , sips sage tea and thumbs his prayer beads in a breezy , outdoor salon shaded with vine leaves .
He says he has been pressured to issue rulings in favor of Hamas , as well as privately chided for judgments the Islamist movement says are incompatible with Islam .
Local Hamas policemen have asked him to counsel the women on their obligations as Muslims to wear the veil and “ behave properly . ”
Hamas recently banned women from riding motorbikes or scooters to “ protect community values . ”
“ What Hamas wants is to either replace us , or to have us work to strengthen them and their version of Islamic justice , ” Mr. Nabeel says .
“ When Hamas promotes or establishes its own mukhtars and ignores the rest , it has nothing to do with their respect for the tribal code ; it ’s political . ”
Ancient clan laws ' clash with Islamic principles '
Sometimes Gazans turn to the mukhtar because Hamas officials ca n’t or wo n’t take the case for political reasons .
For example , Fahim ( not his real name ) says his family was involved in a dispute with another family in northern Gaza , after some of the young men got into a fight after school .
Fahim ’s brother and his cousin , both 17 , were beaten by members of the other family .
Fahim ’s family went to the Hamas police to file a complaint .
But the other family called on their relatives in the Qassam Brigades , a military wing of Hamas .
The police subsequently said they would cease investigating the crime .
So , Fahim ’s family called on their clan ’s mukhtar to meet the other family ’s mukhtar , and the two imposed a week - long truce on both families to temper bad feelings .
They then began negotiations to solve the problem .
Araf Shaher , a mukhtar also based in the south and known for settling disputes between smugglers in the network of tunnels under the Egyptian - Gazan border , says he will avoid Hamas pressure as long as he can .
“ I have nothing to do with the Hamas police and their version of the law , ” Mr. Shaher says from his office in Rafah , also in the south .
“ My rulings are based more on my own traditions , and Gaza ’s traditions , than they are on Islam .
There are many times when they clash directly with Islamic principles , especially when I am ruling on a murder .
But I wo n’t change . ”
Islamic law calls for the death penalty when someone is murdered , says a senior Hamas official and member of its political bureau , Khalil al - Hayya .
He says with a mukhtar , the crime can be absolved with either money or a simple apology .
Mr. Hayya says Hamas is interested in a more Islamic approach to grassroots conflict resolution , and Mousa says the movement is increasing the number of mukhtars willing to hand out more Islamist - style judgments .
“ Hamas prefers Islamic law , ” says Hayya .
“ Because in many cases the law used by clans is not just ; it does n’t go far enough .
But Islamic law is precise , and there is no injustice because it is the law of God . ”
While Gaza ’s many clans and their leaders filled an important void when institutions broke down after the Israeli withdrawal in 2005 , they also promoted a violent lawlessness many Gazans are now grateful is gone .
Does Hamas law brings order , or authoritarianism ?
Hamas says the calm they brought to Gaza ’s streets actually gives the mukhtars more legitimacy than they ever had under Fatah .
“ The mukhtars in Gaza , they are now supported by the law , ” says Abu Nasser , an adviser on tribal affairs to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya .
“ Now , when the mukhtar gives his judgment , people must follow it because they know he can call the police and impose the ruling on him in the name of the law . ”
Mr. Shammala agrees that the Hamas crackdown on the violent clan culture was a major success for the movement , but sees its interference in the age - old work of the mukhtars as part of its overall consolidation of power in the territory .
“ Hamas disarmed the clans , and that is one of the positive aspects of their rule in Gaza , ” says Shammala .
“ But to end the crime , they do n’t have to meddle with social laws .
It ’s part of a power play .
Whether it ’s Islamic or based on control , they are using it to bring everything in Gaza under their umbrella . ”
Just like E.T. , the aliens in District 9 wanted to phone home ... but maybe they were n't quite as cute .
Weta 's David Meng tells us he aimed to make the creatures disgusting , and they were n't originally going to be CG .
Advertisement
As we can see from that early concept art , some of the alien designs were way stranger than the final version .
Why were those rejected ?
Were you told to tone down the nastiness ?
Advertisement
Those designs were n't necesarily rejected outright , we just evolved away from them .
A huge amount of work was done designing these things .
There were so many iterations , by the time the final design was nailed down , these early images were out of sight and out of mind .
The technical approach to realizing the creatures was always in flux , so that affected the look .
I 'd like to note that the reason the aliens in the early concept art have such human eyes was because they were , at first , intended to be actors in make - up .
Due to budgetary constraints , we did n't think the aliens could be done as pure CG , which is what they ended up being .
They were originally conceived as practical make - up with digital replacement over certain parts .

Neill actually encouraged us to make the aliens gross and unpleasant .
He was very keen that the aliens should look revolting when they were eating , and left it up to us as to what that meant exactly .
So I did my take of what an open alien mouth would look like , and some viewers have been disturbed by it !
They took note of the genitalia - like aspect .
It 's my job to disturb people sometimes , and to be honest , I was only a little worried that genitaliia - esque aliens were old hat .
But I think they continue getting such visceral responses because they remind the viewer of his or her own vulnerability , not because of the shock value .
In the end , that aspect did n't make it into the final alien , possibly due to censorship issues , but as I said , these illustrations were old news by then .
Oh well , it 's all good .
Advertisement
It seems like a lot of the meaning of the story changes depending on how aggressive or how loveable the aliens appear .
Was there ever any talk of making them cuter ?
Or more scary and soldier - like ?
Advertisement
Definitely for the little child alien , Neill wanted to make him very cute .
I collaborated on the child alien with Jamie Beswarick , and Neill encouraged us to play up the big eyes and rounded head , etc .
For the the general alien populace , Neill wanted them to be intimidating due to physical strength and size , and off - putting .
I think the endearing quality of the generic aliens was due to their ineptness and victim status , one felt sorry for their plight .
There was another design phase of the Prawns I personally liked , where they looked very much like those early concept images , but with larger bug eyes .
That evolved further into the final aliens .
Neill really pushed the eyes to be bigger and bigger , which I initially was n't sure about , but upon seeing the final movie , I understand the decision .
A lot of people seemed to prefer that .
It seemed so obvious to have big puppy dog eyes , but without them , perhaps no one would care about Christopher Johnson and his kid .
So the aliens were pure CG , not a mixture of CG and practical effects as you 'd considered .
How would that mixture have worked ?
And were any of the alien body parts still done with practical effects ?
Advertisement
The Prawns themselves were entirely CG , from head to foot .
The alien parts on Wikus were prosthetics built and applied by Weta Workshop ( Sarah Rubano and Joe Dunckley took care of the make - up work on location ) , and there were various alien corpses that we fabricated physically , such as in the laboratory dissection scene .
Initially , the aliens were to be an actor in a suit , who would then be augmented with digital replacement in some areas , at an earlier stage we considered mechanical puppetry mixed with prosthetics .
Ultimately the decision was made to have them be pure CG .
The aliens in D9 are amazingly expressive — they do a lot of " acting " with their eyes and mandibles .
It seems like the biggest problem for a really alien creature is getting human audiences to identify with it or feel its emotions .
How did you approach this problem ?
Advertisement
That credit should mainly go to the animators and Neill Blomkamp .
They solved how this thing we designed should move and emote .
But from a design standpoint , it would go back to the eyes .
Throughout most of the design process , the aliens had mammalian eyes with pupils and sclera , etc. , so we always knew they would be able to emote warm - blooded emotions .
Neill did n't go with our versions of the eyes as solid black or cephalapod pupils , so they retained a relatable humanity to them .
Obviously , a lot of the press about D9 focused on its low budget .
How do you create aliens who look more convincing and interesting than most big - budget movie monsters , on such a low budget ?
Advertisement
Of course , that credit goes to Neill 's filmmaking sensibilities .
I was part of an initially larger team of designers who were later scaled down to Greg Broadmore , Leri Greer and myself .
I worked as lead creature designer , concentrating on the organic creatures .
Greg designed all the robots , bio-suits , weaponry , vehicles , the mothership , etc. , and was the lead concept designer .
In his role as art director , he also contributed studies of the alien 's body coloration , as well as some subtle last minute tweaking on the final version aliens .
Leri did the graphic design , logos and costumes .
With Neill directing me , I just offered up as many possibilities as I could , bearing in mind that it had to be relatable to human audiences and based around a roughly humanoid shape .
Initially , we tried not to heed any budgetary or technical constraints , so as not to become creatively impaired , but those things factored in later on .
Eventually , time just ran out .
Advertisement
The aliens in the film are standing in for South Africans during Apartheid , but they do n't act or appear like any human ethnic group — did you have any discussions about avoiding the " Jar Jar Binks " effect , and making them look less like members of a human ethnicity and more like real aliens ?
I do n't remember that we did .
They spoke in an utterly inhuman language and were so insectile , they did n't really run the risk of mirroring any human ethnic group .
Personally , I never thought our space lobsters would strike anyone as ethnic caricatures !
Advertisement
In the film , we got very little information about the aliens ' social structure and how they came to be in such bad shape .
Were you told anything more about this , during the design phase ?
Is it true that most of the aliens on Earth were worker drones ?
Did you have any ideas about what other aliens , like their Queen , might have looked like ?
I think the idea was that the vast majority of the aliens were workers , and that Christopher Johnson was much brighter than most .
Which sort of explained why the overall population were so lost and ineffectual .
There was definitely talk of the social structure of the aliens during the design phase .
It factored into how we designed them .
There was a lot of stuff designed and talked about that never made it into the film .
It 's possible that Neill may want to save some of these ideas for other future projects , so I do n't know if I should talk about it .
“ Simeon ’s Story : An Eyewitness Account of the Kidnapping of Emmett Till ”
By Simeon Wright with Herb Boyd
Lawrence Hill Books , 2010 , 137 pp ( Hardcover , $ 19.95 )
You are 12 years old .
It ’s the summer .
You are happy because your cousin is visiting .
But one “ dark , dark night , four hours before sun up , ” you wake up and your father is standing in your bedroom with two men .
Your mother is screaming and crying .
The men have come for your cousin .
He walks out of the bedroom with these strangers .
You hear the car drive off but you never hear it come back again .
Your mother , terrified , leaves home .
You find out your cousin is dead .
Your dad and you are in danger because you are witnesses to a crime .
This is Simeon Wright ’s story .
His cousin was Emmett Till – a Black teenager from Chicago who was kidnapped and lynched in 1955 while visiting family in the segregated South .
Wright has just written a book , appropriately called “ Simeon ’s Story : An Eyewitness Account of the Kidnapping of Emmett Till . ”
Despite eyewitnesses , Till ’s killers were never convicted .
As Wright retells it , “ There was no justice for a black man in Mississippi if the case had anything to do with a white person .
The murder of Till and the subsequent decision of his mother , Mamie , to have an open casket funeral , was the spark that lit the fire of the Civil Rights Movement .
The sight of Till ’s disfigured face published in Black newspapers across the country galvanized the community .
Just months after his lynching , Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white person on a Montgomery , Ala. , bus .
Parks said she had Emmett Till on her mind .
In “ Simeon ’s Story ” Wright brings us back to August 1955 in a town called Money , Miss .
He recounts the hard work of life on a farm , including the back - breaking job of picking cotton .
He recalls the racist terror : “ The Ku Klux Klan and night riders were part of our daily lives .
We had separate schools , water fountains , churches and restaurants .
The cemeteries were even segregated . ”
He dedicates the book to his father , Moses Wright , who courageously testified in court against the two white men charged with Till ’s murder , J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant .
“ It was the first time in the history of the state , ” Wright reports , “ that a black man accused a white man of anything … I felt extremely proud . ”
One of the inaccuracies plaguing the Till story that disturbs him most is how his father ’s court testimony was reported : “ According to the story , Dad pointed out J.W. Milam while on the witness stand , he said , ‘ Thar he ’ in broken English .
Dad ’s English was not broken ; in fact , he was very careful about his pronunciation and his use of language .
As a preacher , he was used to speaking in public , so for anyone to suggest that he spoke so poorly is crazy . ”
Wright relates a revealing episode in the Till tragedy .
He was with Till , whose nickname was Bobo , and four other boys at the Bryant grocery store .
Wright ’s brother was concerned about Till not knowing “ Mississippi rules ” and sent Simeon into the store with him so he would n’t be alone .
Earlier ,
Till had bought firecrackers at another store and set them off in town .
After the youths left the Bryant store together , Till made a dangerous mistake , Wright says .
As Mrs. Bryant left the store to go to her car , Till whistled at her .
“ I think he wanted to get a laugh out of us or something .
He was always joking around , and it was hard to tell when he was serious .
It was a loud wolf whistle , a big - city ‘ whee wheeee ! ’ and it caught us all by surprise .
We all looked at each other , realizing that Bobo had violated a longstanding unwritten law , a social taboo … ”
The teenagers panicked .
“ Like a group of boys who had thrown a rock through somebody ’s window , we ran to the car .
Bobo , with a slight limp from the polio he ’d contracted as a child , ran along with us , but not as panic - stricken as we were .
After seeing our fright , it did slowly dawn on him that he had done something wrong . ”
Wright says
Till begged the boys not to tell on him .
He was afraid of being sent back to Chicago , thereby ending the fun they were having up to that point .
“ We did n’t want that to happen so we promised to keep quiet for Bobo ’s sake .
It never occurred to me that Bobo would be killed for whistling at a white woman . ”
Wright ’s life has been plagued by “ what if . ”
“ If I had told Dad , he would have done one of two things : either he would have taken Bobo back to the store and made him apologize to Mrs. Bryant or he would have sent Bobo home as soon as possible .
Either way , perhaps Bobo would be alive today . ”
In a Jan. 18 telephone interview , Wright said he remembers feeling all alone after the trial : “ We got the feeling no one was there to help us . ”
The brutal kidnapping and murder of Till , and the ensuing terror had a lifelong impact on Wright .
He thinks of his cousin every day : “ Certain sounds that I hear .
Every car I heard approaching from the west , or the smell of honeysuckle triggers memories . ”
Perhaps the most emotional scar came from his mother ’s flight out of Mississippi .
“ You never get over that , ” Wright said .
“ But she was so terrified .
It was a crucial point of my life .
I can still hear the crying and talking . ”
Wright participated in Sojourn to the Past , a living black history class of high school juniors and seniors .
Wright said he was inspired to write this book by the students who were interested in the Till case .
He said he wants the book to inspire young and old alike to stand up to all types of “ bullies . ”
“ If you see a bully , deal with it , ” he said .
“ You have to help the little guy .
There are more Emmett Tills in the world .
You have to fight for the little man . ”
Wright also credits his wife and filmmaker Keith Beauchamp for recording his eyewitness account of this horrific event in his family ’s lives and our nation ’s history .
Beauchamp investigated Till ’s murder , 50 years later , and found many inaccuracies in the story .
He also found that a number of eyewitnesses to the events were not interviewed .
Beauchamp ’s research led him to make a documentary , “ The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till . ”
The documentary and the work of Till ’s mother and the Emmett Till Justice Campaign won wide support to reopen the case .
In 2004 , the U.S. Justice Department announced it would begin to reinvestigate .
Despite the exhumation of Till ’s body , confessions and witnesses , there were no new indictments .
The case remains “ unsolved ” today .
In 2008 , Wright helped lobby for the passage of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act , which was signed into law Oct. 7 , 2008 .
Sen .
Tom Coburn , a Republican from Oklahoma , was blocking its passage with a procedural maneuver .
But Wright got a call on Sept. 24 from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid informing him the Till Bill had finally passed .
In a statement Reid said , “ The bill has always had broad bipartisan support ; it is nothing short of shameful that it languished for more than a year because of one Republican Senator .
But today we can be proud that the U.S. Senate has at long last acted to resolve unthinkable , unsolved Civil Rights - era murders like Emmett Till’s . ”
The bill allocates $ 10 million a year toward the Justice Department ’s cold case investigations .
There are numerous unsolved civil rights crimes .
Wright also credits unions and especially African American union leaders , like Rayfield Mooty of the United Steelworkers , for their work on the Till case and other important equality issues .
Mooty , a relative of Mamie Till , helped mobilize Chicago unionists to support the family and their call for justice .
Mooty also helped Wright get his first job at Reynolds Aluminum Company .
Eventually , Wright became a pipefitter and a member of the Pipefitters union , Local 597 .
“ Take the unions out of it and we ’re done for , ” he said .
While Wright has seen some improvements on racism over the years , including the election of Barack Obama , he said for African Americans , “ it ’s much bleaker now than then .
Because of the job situation .
Our standard of living has fallen . ”
He recalled that in 1974 when nearby Electric Motors started there were “ 13,000 workers , now there are a few cars over there . ”
He said unless something is done to create jobs , there will be “ dancing in the streets again . ”
“ That ’s what I call marching , ” he added .
Wright is an extraordinary man with a harrowing story to tell .
Through it all , he finds forgiveness and resiliency .
His story should be read by all .

Flame - retardant chemicals that are present in many household consumer products may reduce fertility in women , University of California - Berkeley researchers reported Tuesday .
The study links each 10 - fold increase in the blood concentration of four PBDE ( polybrominated diphenyl ethers ) chemicals to a 30 % decrease in the odds of becoming pregnant each month .
These chemicals are used in foam furniture , electronics , fabrics , carpets , plastics and other items .
They became common decades ago in the United States when fire safety standards were adopted .
They are being phased out nationwide but some are still found in products made before 2004 .
The research joins other animal and human studies that show health effects from PBDE exposure and that 97 % of U.S. residents have detectable levels of the chemicals in their blood .
" This latest paper is the first to address the impact on human fertility , and the results are surprisingly strong , " says lead author Kim Harley , associate director of the Center for Children 's Environmental Health Research at the University of California - Berkeley 's School of Public Health .
Harley says the chemicals leach into our environment .
She says Californians have particularly high levels of PBDEs , most likely because of the state 's relatively strict flammability laws .
Even though the chemicals are being phased out , Harley remains concerned .
" We know even less about the newer flame retardant chemicals that are coming out , " she says in a university press release .
" We just do n't have the human studies yet to show that they are safe . "
In the study , published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives , Harley and other researchers measured PBDE levels in blood samples from 223 pregnant women , many of them young Mexican immigrants in an agricultural community .
Their analysis takes into consideration exposure to pesticides and other factors that could affect fertility .
The study says it 's not entirely clear how PBDEs impact fertility .
Animal studies have found that the chemicals can impair neurodevelopment , reduce thyroid hormones and alter levels of sex hormones .
The Prime Minister 's latest move , to pick up the phone and ask the Governor General to shut down parliament until early March , proves once again his extreme cynicism and mastery in political calculation .
As commentators , from Jeffery Simpson , to John Ibbitson , to Andrew Coyne have pointed out , there is no excuse for this affront to democracy .
But as Ibbitson noted , Harper is probably right in guessing that in the week between Christmas and New Year , on New Year 's Eve , not enough people will be outraged .
As Kady O'Malley pointed out , you cannot even dream up the talking points for this one .
Parliament gets in the way of Olympic games ?
Athletes will find Question Period an artificial performance enhancer ?
There is no precedent for this .
Amazingly other nations have managed to have government continue during the Olympics .
PMO flak Dimitri Soudas , last seen in Copenhagen haranguing and wrongly accusing Stephen Guilbault of a prank that embarrassed Canada , announced that prorogation was necessary as the government 's economic approach required " recalibration . "
" Recalibration " -- there 's a word to conjure .
Obviously having Parliament in session would exude vibrations interfering with the total stillness required for recalibration .
As Coyne said , this is " bilge . "
What now ?
We need to expect the unexpected .
We need to kick and scream at this insult to democracy -- because that is what it is .
We need to support each other , efforts by other parties , non-political leadership .
Wherever a clear and compelling call for democracy emerges , that voice must be supported .
When I wrote my last book ( " Losing Confidence - Power , politics and the crisis in Canadian democracy " )
I thought we had seen the most outrageous abuse of our system of government .
But this is worse .
Harper 's move this week is premised on the assumption that enough Canadians simply do not care about democracy or the role of Parliament .
It presumes that Parliament can be shuttered for trivial political reasons ; that legislation , committees , government accountability , a climate plan , progress on pensions , the investigation of the alleged cover - up in the treatment of Afghan civilians and other detainees --- that none of that matters enough to have consequences for Mr. Harper .
In the interests of democracy , let 's hope this time his cynicism has miscalculated .
More smoke and mirrors for the peasantry , courtesy of Wall Street , this time coming from Citigroup .
Remember all that hoopla how banks are making payments in stock almost entirely , and how no Citigroup employee would get more than $ 100,000 in cash ?
Well , turns out the stock portion of compensation is just as liquid : it has been revealed that Citigroup employees can sell stock received as part of their bonuses as early as April .
Hopefully by then the CNBC watching sheep will have forgotten all about Wall Street 's record bonuses year and everyone can get on with their lives .
Dow Jones reports :
One source with knowledge of the situation said bankers would be able to sell the shares on the open market providing shareholders approve the scheme at Citigroup 's annual meeting in April .
A source close to Citigroup confirmed that while the cash component of individual bonuses had been capped at $ 100,000 , a large proportion of the remainder of individual awards will be made up of common stock units , which bankers expect to be able to sell following the AGM .
Citigroup declined to comment .
The revelation follows news , first reported by Financial News yesterday , that bankers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC ) will be granted a substantial proportion of the stock component of their bonuses in shares that are due to vest in the short - term - in many cases as early as August .
At this point does anyone not feel like they are taking crazy pills ?
On one hand we have a Treasury Secretary blatantly refusing to answer any and all questions that disclose that he only worked on behalf of Goldman , and is also saying that he never had a formal recusal , just some flighty verbal agreement with his staff , and on the other we have a banking system that is now generously handing out blue bills left and right to any willing idiot who believes that anything at all has changed on Wall Street , besides the fact that 2009 was the most profitable bonus year for Wall Street 's employees , and with this disclosure it appears that all the posturing about bonuses being paid out in stock was total bullshit .
Surely this deserves some more histrionics from the president who will read angrily from the teleprompter how Citigroup employees need to hold their bonuses in stock for at least one more day ... or else .
Have you ever seen the boats shipping by cars and special vans ?
Of course you have .
But have you ever seen the boat shipping inside an ordinary car ?
Lithuanian designer Matas Jonaitis has visually showed how it ’s possible .
Matas has presented a transformable boat , named Verseka that can be folded into half of its size and transported in an average four - wheeled vehicle .
It can be used in rivers or lakes for traveling and fishing .
So , in case you have a sudden idea to do some fishing , you just put your boat in the trunk , go to the lake and enjoy .

Getting things done in Linux
LWN .net needs you !
Without subscribers , LWN would simply not exist .
Please consider signing up for a subscription and helping to keep LWN publishing
If your New Year 's Resolution includes something along the lines of " be better organized , " choosing a task manager might be in order .
Linux does n't lack for task managers , but good ones are few and far between .
To help LWN readers boost productivity , we 've picked a few to look at .
Tasque
Tasque has the advantage of being very simple .
It also has the disadvantage of being very simple .
It 's a good task system for users who want a fairly quick and easy way to manage tasks without the overhead of a system like Getting Things Done ( GTD ) .
Tasque is a very simple task list that syncs with several backends , or just with a local file .
One of the main " selling points " of Tasque , aside from simplicity , is being able to use it with multiple data stores .
Tasque works with Remember the Milk , the Evolution Data store , local files , and others .
Task entry and maintenance with Tasque is easy , and it integrates very well with the GNOME desktop .
But , Tasque seemed to be a bit laggy when using it in conjunction with the Remember the Milk , though it was very responsive when working with a local data file .
Whether the lag was due to RTM or Tasque is unclear .
However , over more than a week 's time , Tasque was very nearly unusable each time we tried syncing with RTM .
Tasque is shipped by default in openSUSE for GNOME users , and is available for Fedora and in the Ubuntu Universe repository .
Source is available via the Tasque pages on the GNOME Web site .
It might be a bit too simple for some users , though , which brings us to Tracks .
Tracks : Doing Things Properly
Tracks has the advantage of not only being open source , but also Web - based and available anywhere .
Tracks is another tool meant to implement David Allen 's Getting Things Done methodology , though it's also suitable for users who do n't subscribe to that particular methodology .
Tracks is Rails - based , and not packaged for most major distros .
It is available as a BitNami Stack for users who do n't have a Web server handy or do n't feel like setting up a Rails environment from scratch on their desktop .
The BitNami Tracks package features a GUI and command line installer , and requires very little effort .
While Tracks is more heavyweight than Tasque , it 's also much more full - featured and capable .
Tracks allows users to not only track individual to - dos , but also projects .
Since it takes a cue from GTD , it also provides users with a way to track contexts ( such as things you do while at the computer , phone calls , errands ) and projects via iCal , plain text files , and RSS feeds .
Tracks is sort of multi-user .
That is , an instance of Tracks can support multiple users , but each user has her or his own set of actions .
It 's not suitable for group projects , as there 's no way for one user to share projects with another or assign another user actions .
Tracks is ideal for productivity junkies who want to measure progress , or for consultants or employees who want or need to show how they spend their time to clients / employers .
Track produces enormous amounts of statistics on completed actions , the number of completed actions in the last 12 months , the days of the week that actions are created and completed , and much more .
Need to get to data via a mobile phone ?
Tracks also provides a mobile interface via sitename.com / mobile / , without any additional configuration required .
Finally , Tracks has an API , so users who have a bit of shell scripting , Ruby , or AppleScript under their belt can get data in and out of tracks using more than the Web interface .
When running under the Bitnami stack on the test machine , Tracks was as snappy as a desktop application — sometimes more - so .
The only glitch discovered was that Tracks would throw an Apache error when trying to see recurring tasks .
Overall , Tracks seems a very solid application and is quite responsive .
KOrganizer
For KDE users , KOrganizer is the best of the lot .
We did n't find any really compelling stand - alone task managers for KDE , but KOrganizer includes a really handy task manager alongside a journaling application and calendar .
KOrganizer is a bit more heavyweight than the others , but very full featured .
To - Do entries can have starting dates and times , notes , attachments , send reminders , and attendees .
Users who need or want all of that information should definitely explore KOrganizer .
Or it can be much simpler .
The stand - alone To- Do list lets users enter task entries as one - liners with no additional information .
It 's up to the user to choose the level of complexity .
Tasks are displayed in the To- Do list view and the calendar view , if the tasks are assigned a completion date .
KOrganizer is very complete for users who are looking for a desktop app without a lot of import / export options .
Users who are looking to sync with mobile devices or Web - based services might find KOrganizer a bit limited , but if those are n't on the list of criteria then it's a very handy solution .
Any Linux distro that packages KDE should have KOrganizer in the package repositories , if it 's not already installed by default .
Getting Things GNOME
One of the newer task management applications available for Linux is Getting Things GNOME ( GTG ) .
As the name suggests , it 's a GNOME - based implementation of Getting Things Done .
Despite the low version number , 0.2 was only released in December , GTG is stable and relatively full - featured .
Since GTG is new , users will need to either compile from source or look at something like Ubuntu's PPAs or the openSUSE Build Service , where recent releases are available .
Entering tasks is easy , all that 's required is a one - liner .
Users can opt to tag tasks and add notes , due dates , and so on  but all that 's required is a one line entry in the main window .
Double click on a task , or click on " New Task " in the GTG main window , and GTG provides a separate window where users can enter additional details about a task .
For management of larger projects , tasks can also have sub -tasks .
So if there 's a lot of Yak Shaving involved with getting something done , it 's possible to track every step of the grooming .
This will come in handy for users in a corporate environment .
GTG also supports plugins , and works with several other GNOME productivity tools , including Tomboy and the Hamster Applet for time tracking .
At first , it looked like GTG lacked support for a notification icon , which seemed odd  but support for that is also provided through a plugin .
Overall , GTG is a fairly complete solution and should be sufficient for anyone who 's looking to implement GTD on a GNOME desktop .
Summary
For lightweight task management , GTG heads the pack .
It 's light , fast , and provides just enough functionality that users can implement GTD or their own brand of task management .
Users looking for a more complete solution will probably find Tracks the most attractive .
It 's very flexible and provides a very usable interface , despite being a Web - based application .
No matter what the preference , though , it should be able to find a Linux - based task manager to fit the bill .
This is one area that FLOSS tools have very well covered .
NEW YORK , Jan 20 ( Reuters ) - The New York Times will begin charging for articles on its website next year , marking a major effort by the newspaper to find new revenue and combat the declines in print circulation and advertising that have badly hurt the publishing industry .
New York Times Co NYT.N , which owns the newspaper , said the plan would be built around a " metered model , " charging readers for access after they have viewed a certain number of articles in a month .
New York
Times home delivery print subscribers would continue to have free access to NYTimes.com .
“ This process of rethinking our business model has also been driven by our desire to achieve additional revenue diversity that will make us less susceptible to the inevitable economic cycles , ” Chief Executive Janet Robinson said in a statement .
The announcement confirms reports in recent days that such a move was under consideration at the New York Times .

Teenage musician dies after being mauled by coyotes as she hiked alone in Canadian park
A promising young musician died after she was savaged by two coyotes while out walking .
Taylor Mitchell , 19 , was hiking by herself in a national park in Canada when the animals attacked .
Paramedics found her bleeding heavily with bite wounds over her entire body after other walkers alerted them when they heard the singer - songwriter 's screams for help .
Tragic : Taylor Mitchell was found bleeding heavily after walkers heard screams
She was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition but doctors were unable to save her .
Miss Mitchell , from Toronto , was an up - and - coming folk and country musician who was nominated for a 2009 Canadian Folk Music Award in the Young Performer of the Year category .
She was out on a trail in Cape Breton Highlands National Park in Nova Scotia , in the east of the country , when the attack occurred on Tuesday .
Normally shy :
The coyotes may have mistaken the singer for a deer
Paul Maynard , of Emergency Health Services , said : ' She was losing a considerable amount of blood from the wounds . '
Police were quickly on the scene and managed to shoot one of the coyotes , apparently wounding it .
But both animals were able to escape .
Coyotes , which also are known as prairie wolves , are found throughout North and Central America .
Scene of the attack : Cape Breton Highlands National Park in Nova Scotia
Wildlife biologist Bob Bancroft said attacks are extremely rare because the animals are usually very shy .
The retired biologist from Nova Scotia 's Department of Natural Resources said it was possible the animals mistook Miss Mitchell for a deer or other prey .
' It 's very unusual and is not likely to be repeated , ' he said .
' We should n't assume that coyotes are suddenly going to become the big bad wolf . '
An official from Parks Canada said they had blocked the entrance to the trail where Miss Mitchell was attacked and were still trying to track down the animals and determine what prompted such an unusual attack .
' There 's been some reports of aggressive animals , so it's not unknown , ' said Helene Robichaud , the park 's superintendent
' But we certainly never have had anything so dramatic and tragic . '
Miss Mitchell was in Nova Scotia as part of a tour to promote her new album on the east coast .
Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Brigdit Leger confirmed that emergency police dispatchers were called after reports of screams .
Miss Mitchell died in hospital in Halifax yesterday morning .
In a statement , her manager Lisa Weitz said : ' Words ca n't begin to express the sadness and tragedy of losing such a sweet , compassionate , vibrant , and phenomenally talented young woman .
' She just turned 19 two months ago and was so excited about the future . '
What we have now are people that are afraid of their own shadows , let alone the Goddamn Republicans .
The WH and the asswipes in the Senate have been deathly afraid of offending these certifiable nutcases .
I just saw Richard Wolffe saying that the WH is planning on going balls to the wall this year and is , in effect , done with putting up with the attacks from the right .
A little problem there : TOO .
FUCKING .
LATE .
We just LOST a Senate seat in Massachusetts .
We could n't get shit done with 60 votes in the Senate , what makes you think anything will be done now with 59 ?
The bubble around the WH has made the Democratic Party unbelievably weak .
Like , losing a senate seat in Massachusetts weak .
Wolffe also said that the WH was " surprised " about the party discipline from the GD Republicans .
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME ?
SURPRISED ?
I 've lived in Kansas my entire life and I could 've told you on the night of Obama 's win exactly how the right and the GOP were going to play this .
These morons get paid how much and have direct access to the President and they were fucking surprised ?
Jesus !
Watching five minutes of politics would tell a person living in complete isolation in fucking Siberia who and what the Republicans are and how they roll .
Christ on a crouton .
After Wolffe , the good Dr. came on .
Said people are upset with the kind of change they 're seeing , that it 's not the change they voted for .
That they did n't vote for an insurance industry - written bill .
That they did n't vote for sweetheart deals with Wall Street .
And that there are " a lot of Democrats who are n't sure if they 're Democrats . "
I 'm sorry , this guy is more of a leader than the empty suit in the WH .
Get Kaine 's sorry ass out of there and put Dean back in .
He knows what we 're up against and knows how to win .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
A Nebraska man is expected to plead guilty next week to launching a cyber attack that shut down the Church of Scientology 's Web sites , federal prosecutors said Monday .
Brian Thomas Mettenbrink , 20 , of Grand Island , Nebraska , was accused of participating in an attack orchestrated by a group that called itself " Anonymous . "
The group led protests against the church in various parts of the country before announcing in January 2008 that it would launch a cyber offensive , said Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Los Angeles .
Mettenbrink admitted in court that he downloaded software from an " Anonymous " message board and used it to launch " denial of service " attacks on Scientology Web sites .
In such attacks , hackers flood a target site with so much traffic that it is unable to handle the volume and slows to a crawl or crashes altogether .
As a result , the site is then unavailable to legitimate users .
The group targeted the church after it forced Web sites to yank a leaked video of actor and church member Tom Cruise fervently making the case for Scientology .
The video was intended for attendees at a church award ceremony in 2004 where Cruise was being honored .
" We are the authorities on getting people off drugs , we are the authorities on the mind , we are the authorities on improving conditions ... we can rehabilitate criminals , " Cruise says in the video .
In 2008 , the video was leaked online and widely ridiculed .
The church responded by threatening to sue Web sites unless they removed the clip .
" Anonymous " then launched its attack .
As part of its offensive , the group asked Internet users to not only download the " denial of service " software from its message board , but also to place prank phone calls , post proprietary church documents online , and send black pages to church fax machines to waste ink .
The group posted a YouTube video that said it aimed to " expel Scientology from the Internet . "
" Expect us , " the video ended .
The attacks targeted local and global sites of the church .
Mettenbrink is expected to plead guilty in federal court next week to a misdemeanor charge of accessing a protected computer with authorization .
He agreed to serve a year in prison , Mrozek said .
Mettenbrink's is the second successful prosecution connected to the " Anonymous " attacks .
Last year , Dmitriy Guzner of Verona , New Jersey , was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison for attacks on Scientology sites .
The Church of Scientology , founded by the late science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard , is well known for its high - profile , celebrity members .
In October , film director Paul Haggis left the church for its alleged public support of Proposition 8 , which eliminated the right of same - sex couples to marry in California .
Also in October , a French court convicted the church and six of its leaders of organized fraud .
The court imposed fines totaling more than $ 1 million on the church and the convicted staff .
The plaintiffs focused their complaints on the use of a device that Scientologists say measures spiritual well - being .
Members used the electropsychometer , or E - Meter , to " locate areas of spiritual duress or travail so they can be addressed and handled , " according to Scientology 's Web site .
The plaintiffs said that , after using the device , they were encouraged to pay for vitamins and books .
They said that amounted to fraud .
The church has called the decision a " modern Inquisition " and said it would appeal the verdict .

Google on Tuesday is making a big move with its
Docs service , opening it up to all types of file uploads .
This includes photos , movies , music , and ZIP archives , all of which will be stored on Google 's servers .
Along with opening up Docs to additional file types , Google is also dramatically increasing the size of individual uploads .
Where the company will still limit users to 500KB for Microsoft Word documents , and 10 MB for PowerPoint presentations and PDFs , the new limit for all other files that cannot be converted into a Google Docs format is 250 MB .
This is 10 times the size of what 's allowed as an attachment in the company 's Web mail service Gmail .
Advertisement
In a post on the company 's blog , Google Docs ' product manager Vijay Bangaru said that the new size and file type allowances serve to make Docs a replacement for USB drives , allowing users to access their files between computers .
The company is also applying the same permissions - based sharing system it has for documents that it hosts , allowing users to share files with one another .
That said , the amount of space for non-Google Docs files that are stored within Docs will only be 1GB .
Users can upgrade though , and Google is planning on that .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Just like users can purchase additional space for other Google services like Picasa Web Albums and Gmail , users will soon be able to rent space from Google .
For standard Google Docs users this will be 25 cents per gigabyte , per year , while Google Apps enterprise users have to pay $ 3.50 per gigabyte , per year .
That 's a hefty price difference , but customer support , and a service level agreement that guarantees uptime add costs .
Advertisement
Bangaru says the new file storage features will be rolling out to users within the " next couple of weeks . "
In the meantime , Google has been busy readying a new documents API that will take advantage of the storage , giving third - party programs read and write access .
This turns Google into more of a traditional storage provider than it 's ever been , completely cutting out the need to visit the Docs site itself to add or remove files .
The only caveat here — and it's a big one — is that users will need to Google Apps premier edition customers to access the API , leaving free users of Docs and lesser Apps subscribers out in the cold .
Three companies that are coming out of the gate with support for this new API are Syncplicity , Manymoon , and Memeo Connect .
All three will be tapping into it to do things like file sync , upload , and backup .
Advertisement
So is this the GDrive ?
Signs that Google was readying Docs for file storage came in late July of last year , which is when the company quietly added the " files " menu to the Docs interface .
It 's since been under - utilized as a place for users to store PDFs that could be read within Google 's document viewer .
Attempts to upload other files that could not be converted into Google 's own formats simply did not go through .
Advertisement
But do these changes make Google Docs the long - awaited GDrive ?
In a way yes , but it 's far from the game - changing storage service that many thought would come by now .
The expectation has always been that if Google came out with its own storage service , it would be deeply tied into its properties .
And more importantly , that it would be something readily available to all users .
This time last year the company had alluded to as much , almost by accident .
Bundled deep within the code of the company 's " Google Pack " software ( which includes a handful of Google , and non-Google software installers ) , was mention of a service called " GDrive . "
It was billed simply as a tool for online file backup and storage .
That included " photos , music , and documents . "
The software also promised to let users access these files from a variety of locations — including the operating system and mobile phones .
Advertisement
Sound familiar ?
Google Docs now does all those things , at least with the help of some third - party programs .
However , the one remaining hurdle is getting the sync to non-enterprise users , which for the time being is not happening .
There is light at the end of the tunnel though .
This year , Google brings its cloud - centric Chrome OS to Netbooks , and you can be sure that storage will be an important part of the equation .
It 's much easier to sell the idea of a cloud - based lifestyle when you can give people a place to dump their existing files .
This is especially true given what could be a very limited amount of storage in the first crop of Chrome OS hardware that will be sporting solid state drives — a technology that costs considerably more per gigabyte than platter - based hard drives .
Advertisement
Suddenly 25 cents a gigabyte does n't sound so bad , does it ?
Where Google still has a lot of work to do is unifying its storage offerings into one big drive that 's shared across all of its services .
As it stands , depending on what type of media you 're giving to Google , and from what service you 're uploading it to , there 's a different bucket with a different limit .
This is further complicated by the fact that many of the services have trouble talking to one another .
If they did , it would allow Google to group search indexes into one place where users could sift through content they had stored across all of Google 's properties .
Advertisement
While Google may get there by the launch of Chrome OS , it does n't have to .
Just consider Tuesday 's news proof enough that Google , at the very least , has the ball rolling .

The Great International Highway Makeover
A revision and expansion of the original website known as “ Yamamoto ’s State Higway Makover Boo-teek . ”
HIGWAY MAKOVER
This page last updated
September 19 , 2003 .
Highway route markers have gotten boring over the years .
Many governments have opted for the MUTCD default ( circles ) or plain blank squares .
The justification for those sparse designs is that they provide for increased number visibility and easy recognition .
True enough , but nothing says you ca n’t design a useful sign that ’s graphically attractive .
Linked below are many examples of potential re-designs .
Most of these signs are based on square / rectangular blanks which are reasonably easy to knock off .
The difference with these signs is what you put on them .
Inspiration for sign makeovers can be found in Alabama which uses a modified state outline on their official highway sign ; Colorado , which uses the state flag in color and Pennsylvania which uses a state symbol .
We are still accepting submissions to this collection .
If you have a sign you wish to contribute , read the guidelines at the bottom of the page .

I ’ve had a lot of people ask me how my first D&D game as Dungeon Master went .
Here ’s a pic I snapped with my phone towards the end of the night .
Actually since we went until 2:30 am , I guess I should say the morning .
Chocholate milk , popcorn , huge golden dragon tablecloth , candles , pewter dragon dice box …yeah I ’d say it went pretty fucking good .
I decided that since this was everyone ’s first time playing D&D I really wanted to go all out .
I figured if we were going to this , we were going to do it right .
So I made some strategic purchases to help set the mood .
With some incense , candles and a few props I was able to transform my dinning room into space suitable for epic adventures involving dungeons and the dragons that may or may not lurk there .
As for the adventure itself , I took one of the stories from the DMG that comes with the starter kit as a sort of seed .
I used it ’s encounters and locations since this was my first time as a DM and I thought having that stuff written out would be helpful .
I went in and added in all my own story hooks and NPC ’s though .
I think for our first game everyone did really well .
I had a hard time getting into the roles of the various NPC’s but I think I ’ll get better at that as time goes on .
In general I think everyone was sort of learning who their character is and how they behave .
Obviously learning the mechanics of combat was also a major focus for everyone .
I did my best to roll with everything they wanted to do .
Just like the DMG had warned , despite all my planning they still wanted to know stuff I had n’t thought about .
I do n’t want to go into too much detail because they all read this and I do n’t want to spoil anything for them .
I will say that I really loved the DM role and I ’m super excited to continue the story .
I ’ve got some pretty cool stuff in store for them .

I know this one is going to hurt those who drink too much iDo n’t koolaid , because they never , in their most wildest dreams thought about any other phone beating the iPhone .
But it happened , TIME announced their “ Top 10 Everything of 2009 ″ list , and the Motorola DROID ranks on number 1 , and the iPhone 3GS took number 4 on the gadgets category .
As a matter of fact , the Barnes & Noble nook is the device that took the second place , and Dyson ’s Air Multiplier bladeless , nonbuffeting fan took third place .
Now , as we all know , many upset iPhone followers will not believe this , but who cares now .
Do you ?
TIME , of course , is just one magazine saying this , for now anyway , there might be more coming down the pike .
Next , for your reading pleasure , is what TIME had to say about the DROID and the iPhone :
1. Motorola Droid
Everybody likes Android , Google ’s open - source smartphone operating system .
But a smartphone operating system is n’t all that satisfying without an actual kick - ass smartphone wrapped around it .
Now Android has one :
The Droid is a hefty beast , a metal behemoth without the gloss and finish of the iPhone , but you do n’t miss it .
The Droid ’s touchscreen is phenomenally sharp and vivid , it has an actual physical ( not great , but good enough ) keyboard , and best of all , the Droid is on Verizon ’s best - of - breed 3G network .
It ’s Android ’s first credible challenge to the iPhone .
Price : $ 300 .
4 . iPhone 3GS
Take the iPhone .
Make it faster .
There , you ’re done .
Yes , the 3GS has a better camera — with video .
And it has a compass and voice control .
Those are all improvements over the original .
But the main point of , and the best thing about , the new iPhone is speed .
It has more of it .
Period .
Price : $ 200 to $ 300 .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 8 ( UPI ) --
Scarce doses of H1N1 vaccine were given to U.S. corporations while doctors and hospitals elsewhere encountered shortages , data indicates .
In October and early November , when there were widespread shortages of the anti-H1N1 virus vaccine , health officials in three states were distributing thousands of doses to corporate clinics at Walt Disney World , Toyota , defense contractors , oil companies and cruise lines , USA Today reported Tuesday .

The newspaper said the distribution patterns were revealed when it examined health department records in Florida , Texas and Georgia .
It followed an outcry produced by revelations that Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs were receiving doses of vaccine while others went begging .
USA Today said the data indicated some early supplies of the vaccine went to groups not considered at the highest risk -- such as pregnant women , chronic health conditions sufferers , hospital workers and young people .
Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich. , told the newspaper : " The question we have to ask on these corporate ones is : Did at - risk people receive the doses ?
Or was corporate America buying their way out of an illness ?
You 've almost got to look at them on a case - by - case basis . "
State officials said corporate clout played no roles in their vaccine distribution decisions .
« Il est inconvenant de continuer à proposer la vaccination »
Un entretien avec le Dr Alain Fisch
Elargissons aujourd ’hui , avec le Dr Alain Fisch , le cercle des spécialistes et des points de vue sur la gestion passée , présente et à venir de la pandémie grippale .
Chef de service au centre hospitalier intercommunal de Villeneuve Saint - Georges ( [ email protected ] ) , président de l ’Institut des Etudes Epidémiologiques et Prophylactiques ( IDEEP ) le Dr Fisch est d’autre part le créateur du site sante - voyages.com .
« Gripette » ou « catastrophe programmée » ?
Dans quel groupe d’experts vous situez - vous vis -à - vis de l’actuelle pandémie ?
Il n’est certainement pas à l’ordre du jour de parler de « grippette » avec ce Myxovirus étrange qui a émergé en mars dans l’hémisphère Nord , qui est très contagieux et antigéniquement proche du A( H1N1 ) de la grippe « espagnole ».
D’une manière générale il faut toujours se méfier des Myxovirus , ces virus aux capacités d’adaptation , de mutation et de sélection extrêmes ; des virus qui plus est impossibles à éradiquer sauf à envisager l’élimination de tous les oiseaux , de tous les porcins … jusqu’aux furets .
Estimez - vous de ce fait que le plan français de lutte contre la pandémie était parfaitement justifié ?
Attention , la méfiance des infectiologues pour ce virus ne veut pas dire adhésion aveugle à toutes les mesures gouvernementales .
Précisons .
Acheter , pour un milliard d’euros , 94 millions de doses de vaccins , n’était pas selon moi une faute mais une erreur excusable .
L’ensemble du monde scientifique estimait , à l’époque des commandes , qu’il faudrait deux doses par personne vaccinée pour obtenir une immunité solide .
Acheter en masse de l’oseltamivir ( Tamiflu® ) était plus discutable compte tenu de l’absence de preuves formelles de l’aptitude –toujours débattue - de ce médicament antiviral à améliorer le pronostic des formes graves .
Quant à sa capacité à prévenir , par une prescription précoce présomptive ( s’adressant à tous syndromes « grippaux » ) , elle n’est toujours pas évaluée en termes d’efficacité opérationnelle ( la plupart des syndromes « grippaux » n’étant pas liés au A ( H1N1 ) v , ni en termes de bénéfices / risques –l ’oseltamivir n’étant pas aussi anodin que l’on veut bien le croire , individuellement et peut - être en termes de santé publique .
Mais le gouvernement avait été traumatisé par la calamiteuse gestion de la canicule : après ne pas en avoir fait assez , il fallait désormais en faire trop .
Acheter des masques chirurgicaux et FFP2 à hauteur ( semble - t - il ) d’un milliard d’unités , paraissait logique mais apparut bien vite antagoniste avec l’option « tout vaccin » ; de fait la population française fut désemparée et ne porta jamais le moindre masque : quelqu ’un a -t - il jamais vu un usager de la RATP , un passant dans la rue , un médecin généraliste , en porter un ?
Tout cela pour un milliard et demi d’euros auxquels il faudra ajouter les coûts logistiques , les réquisitions , les coûts indirects , les arrêts de travail « présomptifs »… Peut - être atteindrons - nous ou dépasserons - nous les deux milliards d’euros .
Vous estimez que l’on aurait pu agir de manière plus efficace et à moindre coût ?
Je pense surtout que l’heure est venue de regarder les choses différemment .
La vaccination est un échec épidémiologique : trois ou au mieux quatre millions de personnes vaccinées sur 65 millions d’habitants n’auront eu aucun impact sur l’évolution nationale de la pandémie .
Cette pandémie est en déclin depuis un mois aux Etats - Unis , depuis 15 jours dans la plupart des pays de l’ouest européen et commence sa défervescence en France .
L’immunité vaccinale étant établie trois semaines après l’injection vaccinale , il est inconvenant de continuer à proposer la vaccination , à force de réquisitions , pendant cette période de fêtes ; ceci dit , les centres de vaccinations sont déjà désertés –sauf par les médecins , internes , infirmières , élèves infirmières et agents administratifs réquisitionnés …..
Vous estimez donc que le gros de la vague est définitivement passé ?
Non , car il faut tenir compte des capacités de ce virus à « rebondir » à tout moment .
De nombreux éléments laissent d’autre part penser qu’il reviendra certainement l’hiver prochain après son deuxième passage au sud dès l’hiver austral .
Quelle sera alors son agressivité ?
A cette interrogation , il n’y a qu’une seule réponse : prévoir l’hypothèse la pire , sans affolement .
Dans l’hypothèse où c’est un virus de haute létalité qui reviendra ( ou qui menacera de revenir ) il faudra craindre les sarcasmes des Français : «
On nous a déjà fait le coup l’année dernière !… »
En toute hypothèse le virus qui reviendra sera différent , comme tous les autres Myxovirus ; les vaccins actuels seront alors inefficaces et il faudra en produire de nouveaux ; les stocks ( 91 millions de doses … ) passeront à la poubelle .
Il est donc bien probable que le virus A ( N1N1 ) v devienne à son tour un virus saisonnier .
A ce propos , il est intéressant de noter que les virus saisonniers prévus cette année ( A / Brisbane/59/2007 ( H1N1 ) , A / Brisbane/10/2007 ( H3N2 ) , B / Brisbane /60/2008 ) n’ont pas montré leur nez .
Le A( H1N1 ) v a imposé sa domination , sans doute par sa contagiosité supérieure .
De ce fait , à ce jour , le virus variant a sauvé énormément de vies .
Que voulez - vous dire ?
Une grippe saisonnière normale , bon an mal an , tue 5000 personnes en France , dont 1 à 2 % ne présentant pas de facteurs de risque .
A ce jour le virus variant en a tué a 168 reprises ( bilan au 21 décembre ) et on admet que dans 20 % des cas les victimes n’avaient aucun facteur de risque .
Conclusion logique : dans l’état actuel du virus variant , il n’est pas pertinent de vacciner : une vaccination massive aurait peut - être levé la pression dominante que ce nouveau virus exerce sur les virus saisonniers ; nous aurions alors peut - être eu une double épidémie avec les deux mortalités cumulées .
Le comportement instinctif des Français , ( souvent non dénué de finesse ) a su leur faire prendre collectivement une distance certaine par rapport à la vaccination proposée contre le A( H1N1 ) v .
Le gouvernement aurait certes pu faire de même .
Mais il aurait fallu pour cela que la gestion de la crise soit , ces derniers mois , assurée par des techniciens pleinement libres de leurs actes et non pas soumis à la férule des politiques .

Un échec cuisant sur lequel il va falloir se pencher
Souvenons - nous : août - septembre 2009 , nous franchissions une première étape , un premier gué de la pandémie .
Les digues australes avaient tenu .
Le virus s’était montré certes contagieux mais d’une virulence à deux vitesses : peu agressif chez la plupart des personnes qu’il infectait , il pouvait aussi devenir redoutable chez une petite minorité ( parfois sans facteurs de risque apparents et donc sans que l’on comprenne précisément pourquoi ) .
Août - septembre 2009 était un peu la « drôle de guerre » de cette pandémie dans l’hémisphère Nord .
Nous étions campés dans nos tranchées , les stocks de minutions s’accumulaient ( dans certains pays ) et bientôt les premières controverses éclataient .
L’Etat en faisait trop .
L’indécence était dénoncée .
Les experts agissaient au nom d’intérêts inavoués .
Rien ne venait .
Rien ne viendrait peut - être .
Puis l’automne de l’année 2009 a dévoilé ( en dépit de la douceur quasi- inégalée des températures ) le visage encore certes inconnu de cette grippe , mais fidèle aux photographies transmises par l’hémisphère Sud pendant notre été .
Dresser en ce premier jour de l’hiver le bilan de cette pandémie ?
N’est - il pas un peu tôt pour penser que la saison est terminée « jusqu’à l’arrivée de l’hiver austral suivant » ?
Peut - on affirmer que la souche qui reviendra sera beaucoup plus virulente et qu’elle nécessitera de jeter les stocks de vaccins actuels ?
Il ne me semble pas aujourd ’hui possible de l’affirmer .
Je ne crois pas pour ma part qu’il soit inopportun de continuer les vaccinations .
Je suis d’accord cependant de reconnaître que la campagne des vaccinations a été un échec cuisant sur lequel il va falloir se pencher .
Pour une fois que nous avions prévu qu’une pandémie de grippe allait arriver …
Pour une fois que nous avions dimensionné les usines de production du vaccin de manière à ce qu’il soit disponible pour tous … .
Pour une fois que nous disposions d’un vaccin efficace et sûr seulement quelques mois après l’émergence d’un virus …
Force est bien de constater que la population française s’est montrée réticente à suivre les recommandations préconisées .
Ce qui se vérifie aussi dans la plupart des pays occidentaux .
Il est trop tôt pour dresser le bilan de tout cela .
Mais ce bilan sera bien évidemment fait un jour .
Avec aujourd ’hui ce constat : il n’est pas possible de vacciner en masse une population qui ne le souhaite pas .
Pourquoi ?
Il conviendra d’investir davantage dans les recherches multidisciplinaires qui nous permettront de comprendre un jour prochain pourquoi nos contemporains n’ont pas souhaités se protéger quand on leur a proposé .
Nous nous posons les mêmes questions concernant les masques .
Mais serait - il dangereux de se faire vacciner aujourd ’hui ?
Pourquoi donc ?
Se faire vacciner , par un vaccin dont on a une expérience planétaire plutôt réussie , ne me semble pas faire courir un risque particulier , et peut encore protéger contre le retour certes hypothétique du virus durant l’hiver .
Je ne crois donc pas que ce soit un mauvais calcul , même si je reconnais qu’il est un peu tardif .
Quant à l’utilisation du Tamiflu , le Dr Fisch a raison de souligner qu’il manque encore des preuves de son efficacité , notamment dans la prévention des complications de la grippe .
Il n’y a pas non plus d’évaluation bien conduite de son utilisation de masse .
Cependant , c’est un médicament qui a montré son efficacité et sa relative innocuité en traitement et en prophylaxie individuels , à partir de plusieurs essais cliniques convaincants .
Efficacité , mais pas miracle thérapeutique !
Inocuité , mais pas absence d’effets indésirables …
Nous sommes bel et bien aujourd ’hui sur le deuxième gué .
Combien sont à venir ?
Quelle sera l’ampleur des prochaines crues ?
La suite , comme toujours est à écrire .
Ensemble .

If you 're a regular reader , you know that the libel laws in the UK are truly awful .
Instead of the burden of proof being on the accuser , as it should be , in the UK the burden is on the accused .
So if I decide to sue you for something you wrote about me , it 's up to you to prove there was no malicious intent on your part .
And it can cost you literally millions of dollars to defend yourself .
That , to be blunt , sucks .
And it 's bad for freedom of expression , because it means that criticism of a claim can be substantially suppressed ; who would want to speak out against , say , quacks , if they can sue you and cost you time and money ?
And we know this is the case because skeptic Simon Singh is being sued under these draconian laws by the British Chiropractic Association for saying they happily promote " bogus " therapies .
I 've written about this many times .
That 's why I 'm asking you to go to The Libel Reform Campaign website and sign their petition .
They want 100,000 signatures by tomorrow so they can show it to Jack Straw , a Member of Parliament , and get some action started on this .
These laws affect everyone on the planet ( if you write something on the Internet , it 's entirely possible to be sued in the UK for it ; this is called libel tourism and is a serious issue ) , so it does n't matter if you 're a UK citizen or not .
Please sign the petition .
I did .
And do it soon , so that we can make an impact on free speech everywhere .
Sir Alex Ferguson has been handed a four - match ban , two of which will be suspended , and fined £ 20,000 for his comments made about the referee Alan Wiley last month .
The Manchester United manager has also been warned about his future conduct after he met with an FA regulatory commission to explain his claims that Wiley was not physically fit enough to referee , which were made following United 's 2 - 2 draw with Sunderland .
Ferguson will now be forced to watch United 's next two matches from the stands , at home to Everton and away to Portsmouth , while the suspended sanction will be automatically activated should Ferguson be found guilty of a similar charge before the end of the 2010 - 11 season on top of any sanction imposed for that offence .
The commission 's chairman , Peter Griffiths QC , said after the hearing : " Each member of the commission recognised Sir Alex Ferguson 's achievements and stature within the game .
Having said that , it was made clear to Sir Alex that with such stature comes increased responsibilities .
" The commission considered his admitted remarks , in the context in which they were made , were not just improper but were grossly improper and wholly inappropriate .
He should never have said what he did say . "
A long , long time ago , someone mentioned to me that it was possible to zip up an entire installation , and transplant it into another hard drive .
I only halfway believed it at the time , since it seemed rather far - fetched and I was but a newb ( I still am ) .
But it sat in the back of my mind like an emergency exit , in the odd chance that I might need to use it … even if it sounded preposterous .
But you know what ?
You can do it .
It works fine .
In fact in some situations , it ’s easier than actually installing a full system .
I wanted to move the entire installation from my Thinkpad to a different hard drive .
I was using the 120 Gb Western Digital Scorpio that fell out of the sky into my hands , but I have a faster - yet - smaller hard drive — a 7200rpm 60 Gb Hitachi — that I would prefer to use .
I do n’t need 120 Gb of storage , and the space would be better spent in an rtorrent slave or in an external case .
But the Scorpio had a Crux installation on it — a six - month old console - only installation , and not one I was keen on rebuilding just to swap drives .
I like the idea that it ’s at least a half a year old , and that it has n’t needed any maintenance other than regular updates .
Cloning was not an option , since the cloning tools I am familiar with do n’t seem able to “ scale down ” an image to fit the drive — Clonezilla , which is a gift from heaven in the category of backup tools , gives me errors if the partitions do n’t match quite right .
And technically I do n’t have space to mirror the drive to , since the only other drive I have is my storage volume , which is where the real - life important stuff lives .
So I began to wonder if I could really unload all the files , then copy them back , and still have a working system .
I read it on the Internet , so it must be true . …
And this time it is .
Here ’s how :
First , offload all the files , by directory .
I usually have a three - way partition split , with a separate / boot , root and / home .
( Why ?
Do n’t interrupt . )
Jump into a live environment ( any live CD will do ) and make three new folders on a destination drive — in my case , it was the storage volume — and label them hda1 , hda3 and hda4 … although really , the names do n’t matter .
Mount them so you can write to them , maybe putting them in / media / …/ hda1 , hda3 and hda4 .
Just to keep things clear in your mind , you might want to make a / media / destination and / media / source folder , to avoid accidentally putting the wrong stuff in the wrong place .
Next , rsync is your friend .
You ’re three quick steps away from mirroring all the files .
rsync - a -- progress /media/source/boot/ /media/destination/hda1/
rsync - a -- progress /media/source/home/ /media/destination/hda4 /
Now the last one is a little funny .
rsync - a -- progress /media/source/ /media/destination/hda3/ --exclude=proc -- exclude=sys
I left out files in / proc and / sys since most of those are generated by the running system , on the fly .
And those trailing slashes are important .
rsync is a really fantastic tool — one of my favorites — but it ’s very precise about what you ask for .
If you leave off a slash , it will insert an entire directory inside another , rather than making the two folders identical .
Which is what it ’s supposed to do , but not what we want .
One other thing :
If you ’re like me and you build your own kernels , remember that the kernel source code might only be 60 Mb or so , but once it ’s decompressed , configured , compiled and finished , that darn tree can take up an easy 500 Mb .
Before you go transferring your entire installation to an external drive across USB1.1 😯 , you might want to take out some of the unwanted stuff .
I am speaking from experience here . 🙄
Wait patiently while the text scrolls by .
…
And once that ’s finished , then you can swap the drive and reverse the process .
I used the same partition arrangement with a slightly smaller / home directory , then rsync ’d everything back across .
It took a while , but after it was done and all the files were in place , I did a filesystem check and reinstalled grub ( I use the command - line interface to install grub .
I ’m cool that way ) and rebooted .
And what to my wondering eyes should appear … but the same system I was using a few hours earlier , with all the stuff still in place , all the files and all the network connections and framebuffer support and so forth and so on , just like I left it on the other drive .
No boot problems , no file inconsistencies , no error messages , nothing .
It did n’t even know it was on a different drive .
So it ’s true , you can actually copy an entire Linux installation between drives , and it ’ll work .
If you feel daring and want to try it for yourself you can give it a whirl , but make sure you save all the important stuff before you begin .
Remember , you read it on the Internet , so it might be true . … 🙄
Hi guys ,
You might have noticed that I do n't post all that much here .
I 'll still be posting in the future but in the meanwhile , please feel free to browse ...

The two firms could make an announcement in the morning Kraft Foods is expected to raise its bid for Cadbury to a level that is accepted by the UK firm , BBC business editor Robert Peston has learned .
He says the US giant may raise its offer to between 840 and 850 pence per share , with 850 p valuing the chocolate - maker at £ 11.7 bn .
Kraft launched its hostile takeover bid for Cadbury in December , having its previous offer of 761p rejected .
The two firms may jointly announce the successful bid later .
Shares in Cadbury ended Monday trading up 14 pence or 1.8 % to 807.50 p .
No-one from either Cadbury or Kraft has been available for comment .
Losing independence
Our business editor said it now seems " highly likely " that Kraft and Cadbury will agree a deal that will probably be announced at 0700 GMT .
CADBURY John Cadbury , a Quaker , opened a shop in Birmingham in 1824 , selling tea , coffee and hot chocolate - as an alternative to alcohol Dairy Milk brand introduced in 1905 , with Milk Tray coming 10 years later Merged with Schweppes drinks business in 1969 .
Its drinks arm was spun off in 2008 Employs about 45,000 people in 60 countries

An agreement between the two companies would end the intense animosity between the firms that first manifested itself when Kraft announced its desire to own Cadbury last autumn .
It would also end any doubt at all that Cadbury will lose its independence .
There would still be a theoretical possibility that the US confectioner Hershey would come in with a higher offer .
But if Cadbury 's board recommends Kraft 's bid , it means that the company will be taken over .
Jobs fears Negotiations between Cadbury 's bankers and Kraft 's bankers are taking place overnight .
KRAFT FOODS
Founded in Illinois as a cheese wholesaler in 1903 Bought in 1988 by Philip Morris , which also purchased Nabisco for $ 19.2bn in 2000 before integrating it into Kraft Foods
More than 40 of its brands are more than 100 years old Has 98,000 employees and 168 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide Unions and analysts have both warned that there will likely be job losses among Cadbury 's 45,000 workforce following a takeover .
Kraft has a Tuesday deadline to make its second and final formal bid for Cadbury , or else have to walk away from the deal for a year .
The US giant had previously faced pressure from its leading shareholder - US billionaire investor Warren Buffett - not to overpay for Cadbury .
However , Kraft raised extra funds earlier this month when it sold its North American pizza business to Swiss group Nestle for $ 3.7bn ( £ 2.3bn ) .

Although exact comparisons to the civilian world are difficult because of different methods of defining and reporting abuse , Pentagon officials and some experts say that the incidence of abuse in the military appears to be no higher than in society generally , and might be lower .
It appears to be even lower in combat operations than at bases in the United States , because of stricter discipline and scrutiny during deployments , as well as restrictions on alcohol , which is often a factor in assaults , for example , on college campuses .
Complaints Increase
The number of complaints , though , is rising .
Across the military , there were 2,908 reported cases of sexual abuse involving service members as victims or assailants , in the fiscal year that ended in September 2008 , the last year for which the Pentagon made numbers available .
That was an 8 percent increase from the previous year , when there were 2,688 .
In the turbulent regions from Egypt to Afghanistan where most American combat troops are now deployed , the increase in reported cases was even sharper : 251 cases , compared with 174 the year before , a 44 percent increase .
The number in Iraq rose to 143 , from 112 the year before .
Everyone agrees that those represent only a fraction of the instances of assault , let alone harassment .
“ A woman in the military is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in Iraq , ” Representative Jane Harman , a Democrat from California , said at a Congressional hearing this year , repeating an assertion she has made a refrain in a campaign of hers to force the military to do more to address abuses .
At least 10 percent of the victims in the last year were men , a reality that the Pentagon ’s task force said the armed services had done practically nothing to address in terms of counseling , treatment and prosecution .
Men are considered even less likely to report attacks , officials said , because of the stigma , and fears that their own sexual orientation would be questioned .
In the majority of the reported cases , the attacker was male .
Senior Pentagon officials argued that the increase in reports did not necessarily signify a higher number of attacks .
Rather , they said , there is now a greater awareness as well as an improved command climate , encouraging more victims to come forward .
“ We believe the increase in the number of reported cases means the department is capturing a greater proportion of the cases that occurred during the year , which is good news , ” said the Pentagon ’s senior official overseeing abuse policies , Kaye Whitley .
Former President George W. Bush said Thursday that America must resist the “ temptation ” to allow the government to take over the private sector , taking a subtle shot at his Democratic successor by warning that too much state intervention and protectionism will squelch the economic recovery .
As the Obama administration has made far - reaching moves into the auto , real estate , health care and financial sectors to fight the economic recession , Mr. Bush , without mentioning the president by name , said , “ The role of government is not to create wealth but to create the conditions that allow entrepreneurs and innovators to thrive .
“ As the world recovers , we will face a temptation to replace the risk - and - reward model of the private sector with the blunt instruments of government spending and control .
History shows that the greater threat to prosperity is not too little government involvement , but too much , ” said Mr. Bush , who has remained out of the limelight since leaving office and rarely criticizes his successor .
Mr. Bush has addressed private groups since leaving the White House in January , but Thursday ’s speech , delivered at Southern Methodist University in Dallas , was his first major public policy address since leaving office .
Obama administration officials have defended many of their economic moves as emergency measures to deal with the economy they inherited from Mr. Bush .
They note that some of the most intrusive policies — including the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout — were instituted under Mr. Bush ’s watch .
At SMU , the future home to the George W. Bush Presidential Center , the former president sought to explain his decision to have the government intervene at the peak of the financial crisis last fall , a decision he called “ one of the most difficult of my presidency . ”
“ I went against my free - market instincts and approved a temporary government intervention to unfreeze credit and prevent a global financial catastrophe , ” he said .
Although many economists credit that early action with halting the economic free fall , Mr. Bush said the only long - term path to prosperity is to free up the private sector and to push for open foreign markets to U.S. goods .
“ Trade has been one of the world ’s most powerful engines of economic growth and one of the most effective ways to lift people out of poverty .
Yet a 60 - year movement toward trade liberalization is under threat from creeping protectionism and isolationism , ” Mr. Bush said .
In one of his first major decisions on trade policy , Mr. Obama in September imposed a tariff on tires from China , making good on a campaign promise to the United Steelworkers union to “ crack down ” on imports that hurt American workers .
In his speech — which set out his goals for a new policy institute focused on economic growth , education , human freedom and global health — Mr. Bush said he entered politics because “ because I saw society drifting away from the values at the heart of the American dream . ”
“ I pledged to govern based on principles that empower people to improve their lives and strengthen our nation .
I believe that free markets open the path to opportunity , that a successful society requires personal responsibility , that freedom is universal and transformative , and that every human life has dignity and value . ”
The core of his new presidential complex — scheduled to open in 2013 — will be the George W. Bush Institute .
The nonpartisan think tank will house scholars from around the world and advance Mr. Bush ’s most dearly held effort as president : promoting human freedom .
“ As I said in my second inaugural address , extending the reach of freedom ‘ is the urgent requirement of our nation ’s security , and the calling of our time , ’ ” he told about 1,500 students , faculty , friends , community leaders and supporters .
He plans to continue to support dissidents and reformers around the world , including those from many of the hostile nations with which Mr. Obama has pledged to engage in dialogue .
“ From labor camps in North Korea , to political prisons in Cuba and Burma , university halls in Iran , coffeehouses in Venezuela , and other places , dissidents and reformers are seeking strength and support .
When America stands for liberty , they take heart .
When we do not , the dictators tighten their grip , ” Mr. Bush said .
Several fellows have been recruited for the institute , including the first fellow in “ human freedom ” — Oscar Morales Guevara .
Mr. Guevara used Facebook to launch a movement called “ One million voices against the FARC , ” the brutal leftist separatist movement in Colombia .
A month later , more than 12 million people in 40 countries rallied against the network .
Former first lady Laura Bush will play a role as well , overseeing women ’s initiatives and education — her signature issue during her tenure in the White House .
With Sandy Kress , former chairman of the Dallas County Democratic Party , as the issue ’s steward , the institute will seek to evaluate how best “ to recruit , prepare , evaluate and reward ” principals and administrators .
The presidential complex — at more than 200,000 square feet , second in size only to former President Ronald Reagan ’s library in Simi Valley , Calif . — will include an archives and museum .
The archives will hold “ 4 million photos ; thousands of boxes of documents ; and hundreds of millions of e-mails — not one of which was sent by me , ” he said to laughter .
But the policy institute will be forward - looking .
“ It ’s an interesting way to make a presidential library , which is usually about what happened in the past , a vehicle to continue to talk about how to change the future , ” said Mark Langdale , president of the George W. Bush Presidential Center .
Also at the museum will be a replica of his Oval Office , a “ Texas rose garden , ” Mr. Bush said , and “ the bullhorn I used in my first visit to ground zero ” at the World Trade Center three days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Mr. Bush , who is writing his memoirs , seemed to enjoy the spotlight and , as a self - confessed C student , his return to college .
“ It ’s pretty exciting for a 63 - year - old to be back on the college scene .
I enjoy popping in on a class from time to time .
Come to think of it , that was my strategy as a student , ” he said to laughter .
His post - presidency also has provided some interesting opportunities , he said , including “ a job offer to be a greeter at Elliott ’s Hardware . ”

A new study from the University of Leicester has found that most men in Europe descend from the first farmers who migrated from the Near East 10,000 years ago .
The findings are published January 19 in the open- access journal PLoS Biology .
The invention of farming is perhaps the most important cultural change in the history of modern humans .
Increased food production led to the development of societies that stayed put , rather than wandering in search of food .
The resulting population growth culminated in the seven billion people who now live on the planet .
In Europe , farming spread from the ' Fertile Crescent ' , a region extending from the eastern Mediterranean coast to the Persian Gulf and including the Tigris and Euphrates valleys .
There has been much debate about whether the westerly spread of agriculture from the Near East was driven by farmers actually migrating , or by the transfer of ideas and technologies to indigenous hunter - gatherers .
Now , researchers have studied the genetic diversity of modern populations to throw light on the processes involved in these ancient events .
The new study , funded by the Wellcome Trust , examines the diversity of the Y chromosome , which is passed from father to son .
Mark Jobling , who led the research , said : " We focused on the commonest Y - chromosome lineage in Europe , carried by about 110 million men -- it follows a gradient from south - east to north - west , reaching almost 100 % frequency in Ireland .
We looked at how the lineage is distributed , how diverse it is in different parts of Europe , and how old it is . "
The results suggested that the lineage spread together with farming from the Near East .
Dr Patricia Balaresque , first author of the study , added : " In total , this means that more than 80 % of European Y chromosomes descend from incoming farmers .
In contrast , most maternal genetic lineages seem to descend from hunter - gatherers .
To us , this suggests a reproductive advantage for farming males over indigenous hunter - gatherer males during the switch from hunting and gathering , to farming -- maybe , back then , it was just sexier to be a farmer . "

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Monday that the state could save $ 1 billion by building and operating prisons in Mexico to house undocumented felons who are currently imprisoned in California .
The governor floated the idea during an appearance at the Sacramento Press Club in response to a question about controlling state spending .
His speech came on the same day that changes in prisoner parole and credits for time served took effect .
" We pay them to build the prisons down in Mexico and then we have those undocumented immigrants be down there in a prison .
...
And all this , it would be half the cost to build the prisons and half the cost to run the prisons , " Schwarzenegger said , predicting it would save the state $ 1 billion that could be spent on higher education .
About 19,000 of the state 's 171,000 prisoners are illegal immigrants , according to the most recent statistics available online .
The state spends more than $ 8 billion a year on the prison system .
Aaron McLear , spokesman for the governor , said later that Schwarzenegger 's comments did not represent a concrete proposal , but " a concept somebody mentioned to him " and he could not say where the governor came up with the $ 1 billion figure .
The governor 's statements seemed to catch his prisons chief off guard .
Matthew Cate , secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , said it was not a proposal the department was pursuing and he assumed it was an extension of Schwarzenegger 's call to privatize some of the state 's prison operations .
Privatizing prisons
In his State of the State speech earlier this month , Schwarzenegger called for allowing private companies to compete with state - run prisons , which , he said , could save billions of dollars .
After the governor spoke Monday , Cate said the department has not reviewed or analyzed the Mexico proposal and said the department has no projections of how much money the state could save .
He also acknowledged it could raise a host of jurisdictional and other issues .
" It would probably be complicated , but without looking into it yet , I 'm not sure , " said Cate , who was present at the Press Club event .
California is currently under a federal court order to reduce its prison population by 40,000 inmates over the next two years .
A federal judge installed a receiver in 2006 to oversee inmate health care in state prisons , finding that substandard care led to the death of about one prisoner per week .
Donald Specter , director of the Prison Law Office , which sued the state on behalf of prisoners , said the governor 's idea was " not very practical . "
" It would be like the state of California having a separate island of its own government in Mexico .
It just seems like that would be impossible , " Specter said .
The governor 's idea also drew criticism from the prison guards union .
" There are a number of reasons why it not only wo n't work , but should n't work , " said Lance Corcoran , spokesman for the California Correctional Peace Officers Association .
" There is no obligation from a sovereign nation to incarcerate and rehabilitate individuals who have not committed crimes within their borders . "
Nearly any change in how California manages its prisons spurs controversy .
On Monday , some lawmakers were criticizing laws on parole and sentencing reductions that took effect this week .
The changes , which were part of last year 's budget negotiations , will reduce the state 's prison population by about 6,500 inmates this year , according to the corrections department .
Changes criticized
That will mean people who are regarded as low - risk parolees will not be monitored by a parole agent and prisoners can earn additional credits for time served in prison , which would reduce their sentences .
Those changes were criticized by both Republicans and Democrats , including Assemblyman Ted Lieu , D- Torrance ( Los Angeles County ) , who is a candidate for state attorney general .
Lieu co-authored legislation introduced Monday to require local authorities to be involved in those parole decisions and for the state to notify local officials when people are given early release into their jurisdictions .
He said the changes threaten public safety .
" I guarantee you crime will increase and there will be more victims of crime , " he said .
Cate disputed that assessment , predicting the number of people who commit crimes again and return to prison would fall , as they would earn credits for completing programs that prisons officials say reduce recidivism .
Who is counting the bodies in Iraq ?
By Natalia Antelava
BBC News , Baghdad
" We do n't do body counts . "
These were the words of Gen Tommy Franks , the man in charge of the US - led invasion of Iraq .
But more than six - and - a- half years after the invasion , the body count has become a measure of success and failure in Iraq .
In November , officials announced that violent deaths were at their lowest since 2003 .
That was an important example of progress in Iraq , according to the Iraqi government .
Most of the big explosions since August occurred near official buildings
Eight days after the announcement , five massive explosions went off almost simultaneously in different parts of Baghdad , killing and wounding hundreds .
These well - co- ordinated , sophisticated attacks targeted symbols of the state - not only government buildings but also universities and state - run institutions .
The explosions were similar in scale to devastating bomb attacks in August and in October .
The country 's commander - in - chief and Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , is now under increased pressure to provide better security for the capital .
After all , that 's what he is credited with doing best .
Serious questions
Mr Maliki 's political reputation was built largely on his apparent success in bringing violence levels down following the US troop surge in 2007 .
HISTORY OF BIG ATTACKS Mar 2004 : 171 killed in bombings in Baghdad and Karbala Nov 2006 : 202 killed in multiple blasts in Baghdad Mar 2007 : 152 killed in lorry bombing in Talafar Apr 2007 : 191 killed in car bombings in Baghdad Aug 2007 : More than 500 killed in attacks on villages near Sinjar Aug 2009 : 95 killed in lorry bombs in Baghdad Oct 2009 : 155 killed in twin lorry bomb attacks in Baghdad Dec 2009 : 127 killed in a series of car bombs in Baghdad
Source : News agencies , BBC Now , this image of a man who could keep Baghdad safe has been tarnished .
Across the city , as dust settled over the bomb sites and grief took the place of the initial shock and panic , some serious questions began to emerge .
One of them is how many died in the explosions ?
The number , according to the international and independent Iraqi media is more than one hundred , but the official toll is 77 .
There are plenty of examples of similar discrepancies in numbers .
Round -up
Two days before the big bombings , explosives went off in a school in Sadr City , a Shia suburb of Baghdad .
We go to the bomb sites - we know how many people really die
Hindt al - Bedeiri
Iraqi journalist Police sources told us that six children were killed , but Iraqi officials said one student had died .
There was a real difference in coverage of the event as well .
It grabbed international headlines , but Iraqi state TV led on political progress and the achievements of the government .
The school explosion was mentioned in a 40 - second round - up at the very end of the news bulletin .
" The government is manipulating the figures , " says journalist Hindt al - Bedeiri who writes for the pro-opposition al - Mashraq newspaper .
" Politicians are lying to us because they are worried about the election .
They are looking after their own interests .
We go to the bomb sites - we know how many people really die , " she says .
Official numbers
But the government insists that its numbers are correct .
We are not lying ...
There is no justification to distorting this kind of information .
It 's disrespectful .
Every death , every person matters
Saad al - Mutalibi
Government adviser " The media are interested in blowing the situation out of proportion , and certain networks and channels are trying to boost the numbers , " says Saad al - Mutalibi , an adviser to the Iraqi government .
" I believe these official numbers because they come from the Ministry of Health " .
For their part , health authorities receive their figures from hospitals .
Shortly after Tuesday 's bombings , the BBC visited one of Baghdad 's hospitals .
The total number of injured given by administrative staff was significantly lower than the estimates provided by doctors who were receiving patients .
One of the doctors , surgeon Tara Barki , said she believed the government was trying to downplay violence .
" We have explosions every day , but most of them are small and scattered and so they either receive no media attention or are camouflaged by the government , " Dr Barki said .
' Deaths matter '
But the government denies manipulating figures .
" We are not lying , and I can guarantee you that the office of Prime Minister Maliki would never lie about the figures , " said Mr Moutalibi , the government adviser .
COUNTING THE DEAD
In October 2009 , the Iraqi government reported that 85,000 Iraqis ( civilians , military and police ) died in violence between 2004 and 2008 Iraq Body Count : Campaign group counts from media reports and official figures .
It says that 94,705 - 103,336 civilians have died since invasion Lancet study in October 2006 estimated 655,000 people died in Iraq as a result of the invasion " There is no justification to distorting this kind of information .
It 's disrespectful .
Every death , every person matters . "
The government says these explosions should not undermine the progress it has made .
In December , and after months of political wrangling , Iraqi politicians finally agreed to have an election on 7 March .
The deal was hailed as a big political achievement , crucial to the future of Iraq .
But violence , it seems , could still be dictating the rules of the game .
The outcome of the election , the timing of the US withdrawal and Iraq 's ability to attract much - needed investment , could all depend on how safe this country is - or is perceived to be .
Statistics are irrelevant for mothers who are still losing their children in Iraq .
But whatever Gen Tommy Franks said nearly seven years ago , today Iraq 's politicians are indeed doing a body count .

A man who took a bus on a 30 - mile joyride through West Yorkshire leaving a £ 250,000 trail of destruction has been jailed .
Shane Oldroyd , 27 , of Ossett , stole the single - decker Arriva bus from Wakefield bus station in August because he needed to get home and had no money .
Judge Kerry Macgill told Leeds Crown Court Oldroyd was guilty of " wicked , dangerous and reckless " driving .
He was jailed indefinitely to serve at least three - and - a - half years .
Oldroyd ploughed into more than 50 cars , injured two people , destroyed several walls , road signs and traffic lights and badly damaged buildings during the rampage , Leeds Crown Court was told .
So what ?
I took a bus for a nice little ride
Shane Oldroyd 's words as he was arrested
He admitted aggravated vehicle taking and damaging a Mercedes car , and being reckless as to whether life was endangered .
He also pleaded guilty to driving without insurance , driving over the alcohol limit and failing to stop after an accident .
Judge Macgill said he had handed down an indeterminate sentence because Oldroyd posed " a very real risk of serious harm to the public if you were at liberty in the near future " .
Prosecutor Simon Haring showed the court CCTV footage , shot from a West Yorkshire police helicopter , which tracked the bus for almost an hour through Wakefield city centre and surrounding towns on 16 August .
The bus was finally brought to a halt on the M1 near Wakefield after police used a stinger device to deflate its tyres .
The court also heard that when Oldroyd was taken off the bus by police , he said : " So what ?
I took a bus for a nice little ride . "
Also on the bus with him was a friend , 20 - year - old Sarah Smith , of Portobello , Wakefield .
She also admitted aggravated vehicle taking and will be sentenced at a later date .
A truck tire supporting a 36,300 - kilogram load repeatedly traverses an 18 - meter stretch of road , day in and day out , rolling up 483,000 kilometers on the odometer at the U.S. Department of Transportation 's ( DoT ) testing facility in Virginia .
The goal is to thoroughly challenge any new paving techniques and see how the road surface holds up .
Now imagine putting a solar panel under there .
That 's exactly what Scott Brusaw of Sagle , Idaho–based Solar Roadways hopes to do next February .
The electrical engineer is currently at work building a prototype of his so - called " Solar Road Panel " with the help of a $ 100,000 small business contract from the DoT .
" We 're building solar panels that you can drive on , " Brusaw says .
" The fact that it 's generating power means it pays for itself over time , as opposed to asphalt . "
There are about 260,000 kilometers of roadway in the U.S. National Highway System alone , and thousands more in state highways , suburban thoroughfares and rural roads .
Could all that asphalt be replaced with a solar technology that would also double as the nation 's power grid ?
The key to making this work will be the glass :
The solar road panel prototype is 1,024 modules — each containing a solar cell , a light - emitting diode and , someday , an ultracapacitor for storage — sandwiched between a layer of some yet - to - be developed glass and a layer of conducting material .
" Nobody 's tried to drive on glass long - term , " Brusaw says .
In addition to needing strength , this glass will be textured to allow tires to grip and water to run off .
It will also be embedded with heating elements — like a car 's rear windshield — to melt snow or ice .
And it will need to be self - cleaning , coping with the grit and grime of an endless procession of tires as well as dust , dirt and other highway detritus .
Needless to say , such glass does not exist yet but Brusaw hopes to partner with researchers at The Pennsylvania State University 's Materials Research Institute to develop it .
" Glass theoretically can have a very high strength , provided there are no flaws , " says materials scientist John Hellmann of Penn State , a glass expert .
But " can you keep the proper optical properties to transmit light to the PV [ photovoltaics , or solar cell ] and still not weather or change with that traffic going over it ? …
We make some pretty doggone good glass for structural applications but we 're not driving trucks on them . "
The engineering challenges are immense , adds materials scientist Richard Brow of the Missouri University of Science and Technology , another glass expert .
But glass can be strengthened by compressing its surface using special heating techniques or , at a molecular level , swapping ions in the glass itself .
Such enhanced glass is 10 times stronger than the conventional variety and is used , for example , in smart phones to withstand the pressures of texting .
" Can you go from a teenager 's thumb to a truck ?
That 's a pretty big leap , but 10 years ago we did n't think you could make a 15 - micron piece of glass for what 's relatively rough handling in a PDA , " Brow says .
Glass has been used to build footbridges , such as the Chihuly Bridge of Glass in Tacoma , Wash .
And new glass ceramic composites with increased toughness have been developed for the photovoltaics industry , Brow adds — but that might boost the price of the resulting panel .
In the meantime , Brusaw is spending $ 40,000 of the DoT 's money to build a prototype from chemically hardened glass panels that can be purchased today .
He will experiment with various types of solar cells , from thin - film to traditional monocrystalline silicon photovoltaics , and he will try to strike the right balance between transparency — so the panel works to deliver at least several thousand kilowatt - hours of electricity each day — and road - gripping texture , which will block some of the light .
" If you have perfectly clear glass , you get perfect PV efficiency .
But [ with ] perfectly smooth glass , everybody slips off the road , " he notes .
" Glass manufacturers can cut grooves into the glass in a hatch - type pattern .
We 'll try various methods and see what holds up . "
Cost will be a factor : " The cost to develop a glass that will hold up in the fast lane of a highway ?
Fifteen [ million ] to 25 million dollars over three to five years , " Brusaw says .
" The cost in mass production ?
About $ 1 per square foot . "
The goal is to produce a 12 - foot by 12 - foot panel for $ 10,000 that is capable of producing 7,600 watt - hours of electricity daily ; it would take roughly six panels to match the electricity demand of one average U.S. home , which use 936 kilowatt - hours per month , according to the Energy Information Administration . *
In addition to requiring a yet - to - be- invented form of glass , solar roadways would need some form of energy - storage capability — whether batteries or some not - yet - devised ultracapacitor .
The goal is to create a cross-country highway system that can also serve as an national electricity generator and power grid .
And paired with wind turbines to generate electricity at night , Brusaw estimates replacing the nation 's highways with his solar roadways could eliminate the need for fossil fuel–fired power plants .
" Based on my calculations , at 15 percent efficiency [ from the photovoltaics ] we produce more than three times the electricity we have ever produced , " he says .
Even with cars constantly casting shade over the road surface , along with other challenges , " we think we can make enough to meet the nation 's energy needs , " he adds .
Other companies , such as the England 's Invisible Heating Systems , have developed roads that use embedded water pipes to harvest some of the sun 's ample energy that also bathes U.S. roads .
The solar roadway will also offer embedded LEDs to illuminate the road and display information , whether the actual traffic directions , such as lane markers , or messages such as " SLOW DOWN . "
And , should electric cars become popular , powered pavement could also offer recharging stations wherever such panels are installed .
The first test of Brusaw 's crystalline vision will be when the prototype is delivered to the DoT on February 12 , 2010 .
And the DoT 's challenges will be followed by some durability testing by the inventor with a pickax , sledgehammer and , depending on the prototype 's fortitude , guns .
Then it's on to parking lots and perhaps fast food restaurants .
" Parking lots are much better than going right out onto the highway , " Brusaw says .
" You have slow - moving , lightweight vehicles .
We can learn all the lessons there before moving into the fast lane . "
* This sentence was changed to reflect actual power output of the panels , which is in watt - hours not kilowatt - hours as originally written .
Dangerous Roads
Take a look at two world ’s most dangerous roads .
Bolivia ’s Road of Death and Guoliang tunnel Road in Taihang Mountains ( China ) .
Bolivia ’s Road of Death
The North Yungas Road is a 38 to 43 mile road ( depending on source ) leading from La Paz to Coroico , in the Yungas region of Bolivia and is undoubtedly the most dangerous road in the world for motorists .
It is legendary for its extreme danger and in 1995 the Inter - American Development Bank christened it as the “ world ’s most dangerous road ” .
One estimate is that a fatal accident happens there every couple of weeks and 200-300 travellers are killed yearly along the road
The road moreover includes Christian crosses marking many of the spots where such vehicles have fallen .
Upon leaving La Paz , the road first ascends up to around 5 km , before descending to 1079 ft ( 330 m ) , transitioning quickly from cool altiplano terrain to rain forest as it winds through very steep hillsides and atop cliffs .
The road was built in the 1930s during the Chaco War by Paraguayan prisoners .
Because of the extreme dropoffs , single - lane width , and lack of guardrails , the road is extremely dangerous .
Further still , rain and fog can make visibility precarious , the road surface muddy , and loosen rocks from the hillsides above .
Guoliang Tunnel Road in Taihang Mountains , China
The Guoliang Tunnel in Taihang mountains in China is 1,200 - metre - long tunnel which is about 5 meters high and 4 meters wide .
The wall of the tunnel is uneven and there are more than 30 windows of different sizes and shapes .
Jay Leno , Conan O'Brien
NBC plans to move Jay Leno back to 11:35 /10:35c and current Tonight host Conan O'Brien to 12:05/11:05 c , The New York Times reports .
NBC higher - ups held discussions with both Leno and O'Brien Thursday about the future of NBC 's late - night schedule , according to the newspaper .
While Leno would see his time slimmed down to a half - hour , O'Brien would still host an hourlong program , which would push Late Night host Jimmy Fallon to 1:05 / 12:05 c start time .
This also leaves up in the air the future of Last Call with Carson Daly , which starts at 1:35 / 12:35 c following Fallon .
NBC says it 's working to improve the performance of Jay Leno 's show
Leno , O'Brien and Fallon will move to their respective new timeslots after the 2010 Winter Olympics wrap up on Feb. 28 .
The games begin Feb. 12 and will put all three comics off the air for at least two weeks , giving the network ample time to make such changes to the current lineup , the Times reports .
Reports from FTVLive and TMZ surfaced Thursday that NBC was mulling a late - night shakeup in light of both Leno and O'Brien 's low ratings as well as concerns from network affiliates .
NBC declined to comment on the Times report .
NBC issued statements , saying it hoped to " find new ways to improve the performance " of Leno 's show and that it remained " committed to keeping Conan O'Brien on NBC . "
Jay Leno says he'd return to 11:35 if asked
Leno indirectly addressed the various reports during his monologue , playing off band leader Kevin Eubanks .
" As you may have heard , there is a rumor floating around that we were canceled .
I heard it coming in this morning on the radio .
So far no one has said anything to me .
But Kev , if we did get canceled , it will give us time to do some traveling .
I understand that Fox is beautiful this time of year , " Leno joked .
" I do n't think there is any truth to the rumors .
See , it 's always been my experience that NBC only cancels you when when you 're in first place .
So we are fine . "
NBC plans to order more Law & Order , beef up pilot development
O'Brien did not allude to the swirling scuttlebutt in his monologue .
No one addressed what will happen at 10 p.m. Monday through Friday , although NBC Entertainment chief Angela Bromstad recently talked about developing as many as 10 dramas and eight comedies .
Linux : Install a million games in one click !
Updated : December 16 , 2009
Well , not really a million , but how about tens or hundreds ?
Good enough for you ?
Today , we will talk about two extremely useful applications that allow to you search for hundreds of games that run on Linux , sorted by category , popularity , license , or price , read game synopses , check out the screenshots , and then , should you decide that you like some of them , install them with a single mouse click .
Do you know what this means ?
This means that all and any other method of getting Linux games is virtually obsolete .
You now have a Steam Valve style programs for Linux , capable of bringing hundreds of great titles to your desktop .
Follow me .
djl
homepage
djl is an open - source game manager for Linux , written in Python and inspired by Steam Valve for Windows .
Get djl
The first thing you will have to do is download the installer script from the website .
It 's contained in a tar.gz archive , so you will have to extract it first .
The djl.sh contained inside the archive needs to be executable in order to run , so you may have to make it that way .
For less experienced users , this is the sequence of commands you will have to run to start djl :
tar zxvf < archive - name >
cd < extracted - archive - dir >
chmod +x djl.sh
./djl.sh
When you run the script the first time , if you do not have the Python framework installed , you 'll get an error .
Luckily , the script points you out to the missing python - qt4 libraries .
Fire up your package manager and install it .
Alternatively , use the command line to install the package .
Run djl
Once you have everything in place , run the application .
You will be asked to configure the tool .
This includes configuring the installation directory for your games , the Web browser of your choice , the default tab in the main menu , the font size , updates , dependencies , and more .
Very convenient .
Using djl
Now comes the really cool part .
After you download the News items , you 're ready to roll .

With djl , getting the games downloaded and tested is going to be a breeze .
Plugins
djl is an extensive tool , with plugins available .
For example , you can add Urban Terror server monitor or follow Unreal Tournament statistics .
And you can chat , too !
Fantastic !
GameStore
homepage
GameStore is a game management utility , specifically for openSUSE , following the similar concept of Steam Valve for Windows .
GameStore works against the Games openSUSE repository , downloading game information and screenshots , allowing you to browse the different categories , read about the games , get first impressions , and install them with one mouse click .
Similarly , installing GameStore is a one mouse click trick .
Just go to stick 's corner and grab it .
The one - click link will launch the software manager and install GameStore for you , including adding the extra repositories with more than 150 game titles available .
After this , launch GameStore .
GameStore is still a young application , lagging behind djl in interface and options , nevertheless , it 's very easy to use .
It was also bug - free .
Like djl , it lets you browse different categories and install games .
You get descriptions and screenshots for most of the games , allowing you to decide whether you 're interested in the offered title .
AlienArena , Nexuiz , Dark Oberon , Warzone 2100 , Trigger , you name it .
The most popular , free , open - source games are available for you , at the tip of your fingers .
Very easy and convenient .
Conclusion
Once again , I 'll ask , do you realize what djl and GameStore mean - many more Linux game reviews on Dedoimedo , coming soon !
At the moment , djl is a more mature , more featured application , with a wider selection of titles and additional features , like better game installation / removal control , chat and plugins .
GameStore also has a lot of potential and should grow into a beautiful program as it gets more recognition and support and new options and more games are introduced .
Most importantly , whatever your Linux distribution , you now have the ability to cram your hard disks with lots of great titles and enjoy Linux gaming on a whole new level .
No worries about installation , tweaks , command - line hacks , or anything like that .
Just lean back and enjoy .
I 'm tremendously pleased by these tools .

One of the things we often struggle with as a company is deciding how much to talk about our future plans and our current work towards those plans .
Our natural inclination is to be open about what we 're doing , but there are several problems with talking about future plans :
Our plans can and will change , upsetting customers who were making their own plans based on our original plan .
Our plans might interfere with current sales , as customers stop buying OmniGraffle 8 in anticipation of the future release of OmniGraffle 9 .
We might get accused of promoting vaporware , as when we started talking about OmniFocus .
But there are also problems with not talking about our future plans , as it leaves people wondering what direction we 're going and whether they 'd like to be going that direction too .
So , given the exciting event of this week , I think it 's appropriate for us to share some of our plans with you now …
Remember how Macintosh was intended to be the computer “ for the rest of us ” ?
That 's what we feel Apple 's iPad is : the best computing device for most of the things people use computers for .
( Or , as Apple puts it , “ the best way to experience the web , email , and photos . ” )
It 's the computer people can sit down and start using immediately , without training , whether they 're 2 or 92 .
We 're really excited about Apple 's iPad , and we want to make all of our products available for it as soon as we can .
Yes , we already had a big year planned for 2010 , with several long - anticipated major product releases — but we think iPad is really important : important enough to spend some time juggling our plans to figure out how we can introduce five new iPad apps .
Yes .
Five .
We want to bring all five of our productivity apps to iPad : OmniGraffle , OmniOutliner , OmniPlan , OmniFocus , and OmniGraphSketcher .
This is a big undertaking , and we can't do it all at once .
We started working on iPad adaptations of OmniGraffle and OmniFocus as soon as the SDK was made available Wednesday afternoon , and we 're hoping to get started with OmniGraphSketcher for iPad within the next few weeks .
OmniPlan for iPad will be a little further behind , simply because the OmniPlan development team is on the home stretch of their two - year OmniPlan 2 development cycle , and we'd like to get that out the door before bringing OmniPlan to another platform .
Similarly , the OmniOutliner team is also heavily into a major development cycle — one which affects not only the next major release of OmniOutliner , version 4 , but also the upcoming major releases of both OmniFocus and OmniPlan — so that team is booked up for at least the next several months .
But while it wo n't be on iPad on day one , OmniOutliner is where all of our projects start and we think it will be a great fit for iPad , so we plan to adapt it as soon as possible .
What does this mean for our non-iPad apps ?
Well , for the apps we 're bringing to iPad immediately there will be a bit of a delay in their next major Mac release cycle : for example , while we 've already done a fair bit of work on OmniGraffle 6 for Mac , we 're going to put that work on hold while we work on the iPad adaptation .
Not that we do n't think OmniGraffle 6 is important or exciting , but we think OmniGraffle for iPad is even more important .
For the other apps , OmniPlan 2 and OmniOutliner 4 , we 're hoping for little or no delay in our upcoming releases , but there 's likely to be a bit of a pause immediately afterwards as the teams shift gears and start working on bringing those apps to iPad as well .
So , that 's our current plan .
As I said in my introduction , our plans do change over time — obviously , they 've changed quite a bit just this week !— so please do n't rely on things happening according to today 's particular snapshot of those plans .
But I hope that this snapshot at least gives you a sense of what we 're doing and why ( and perhaps even an idea of when ) , so you can decide whether we 're going in a direction you 're interested in .
Either way , I hope you 'll let us know !
Thanks for your time !

Our blurbs :
James Fallows :
The End of Influence is timely , convincing , practical - minded , and very well written >
If you want a way to understand our economic predicament and the real choices ahead , this is an excellent place to start .
Romano Prodi : I started reading this book and could not stop until I arrived at the last sentence .
Really splendid : rigorous , scientifically perfect , and politically accurate .
Robert Reich :
In this splendid little book , Stephen Cohen and Brad DeLong real one big truth :
There 's no returning to the neoliberal order of deregulation , privatization , free markets , and free trade that captured the minds and hearts of American policymakers over the last three decades .
America is broke , and must now face a much messier world in which governments -- especially those controlling lots of savings -- are intent on playing a different game .
We have recently posted a couple of posts concerning what to do or not to do should you experience an engine failure right after take - off .
However , Blake , the blogger behind the Fly With Blake blog , has just posted a video showing a textbook example of what can and will likely go wrong if you attempt to return to the airport at to low of an altitude after an engine failure immediately after take - off .
Unfortunately , the pilot and his acrobatic partner were both killed in the crash and we should warn you , the video is graphic .
The Troops Protect Our Freedom , and Other Lies I Learned in School
Barrack Obama ’s Nobel acceptance speech included this self - congratulatory little gem :
“ But the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions — not just treaties and declarations — that brought stability to a post - World War II world .
Whatever mistakes we have made , the plain fact is this :
The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms .
The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea , and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans . ”
Before Mr. Obama dislocates a shoulder patting himself on the back , maybe we should look at the record .
When it comes to guaranteeing stability and promoting democracy , the United States ’ record is pretty clear .
“ Global security ” and “ stability ” mean the security and stability of a particular global order guaranteed by the United States — a global order that reflects the interests of the coalition of class forces that control the American government .
The United States ’ record with regard to “ enabling democracy ” is also clear .
When it has best served the interests of the corporate world order to replace a dictatorship with a formal democracy , the United States has done so .
But when it has best suited the interests of corporate power to overthrow a democracy by force , the United States government has not hesitated to do so .
A lot of American blood has , indeed , been shed in battlefields around the world .
Even more blood has been shed by the people who lived in those countries , fighting American soldiers .
And the wars in which all that blood has been shed have had little to do with the prosperity , freedom , or other interests of the people where the wars were fought .
The list of killing fields , stained with “ the blood of our citizens ” — and of many other people — is indeed a long one .
It includes the millions killed by military regimes and death squads in Central America , from the overthrow of Arbenz in 1954 to U.S. support for the Contras ’ terrorism in the 1980s .
It includes the victims of the military dictatorships of the Southern Cone of Latin America , installed with the support of Operation Condor in the ’60s and ’70s .
It includes the hundreds of thousands massacred by Suharto ( with the CIA ’s Jakarta station drawing up the hit lists ) and millions more by Mobutu .
“ Freedom , ” in operational terms , has translated into whatever degree of freedom was compatible with secure profits for United Fruit Company and ITT — which was n’t much .
More often than not , the United States has intervened to protect the corporations who own the world from the people who live in it .
As Noam Chomsky put it , the Cold War in practical terms can be summed up as a war by the U.S. against the Third World , and by the USSR against its satellites , with the “ threat ” of the opposing superpower in both cases serving mainly as a pretext .
It ’s a lot like Emmanuel Goldstein described the three rival superpowers of “ 1984 ” : three sheaves of corn propping each other up , and enabling one another to defend their respective internal systems of power .
One of the most central items in the American creed is the belief that the troops “ protect our freedom . ”
By definition , any war the United States fights is to “ defend our freedoms . ”
Just watch the cable news shows , or read your local newspaper ’s editorials on Veteran ’s Day and Memorial Day , if you do n’t believe it .
If any one belief is central to the ideology of One Hundred Percent Americanism , this is it .
But it does n’t bear much looking into .
I once saw JCS Chairman Richard Myers on C - SPAN , addressing the Army War College , criticizing China ( with a straight face ) for having military forces beyond its “ legitimate defensive needs . ”
This from the highest - ranking military officer in a global superpower whose military budget exceeded those of the rest of the world combined .
When most people of common sense think of “ defending our country , ” the first thing that comes to mind is probably defending against an actual military attack on the territory of the United States .
But if you look at all the foreign “ threats ” the U.S. government “ defends ” itself against , strangely enough they mainly involve what some country on the other side of the world is doing within a few hundred miles of its own borders .
Most of them do n’t even have the logistical capability to project force more than a few hundred miles outside their own borders .
So if you think about it , it ’s only fair that the U.S. military “ defend our country ” and “ protect our freedoms ” on the other side of the world .
If Uncle Sam were n’t generous enough to meet them more than halfway , we ’d never get to have any wars .
Myers ’ comments about China , and the nature of the other “ threats ” the U.S. national security state points to , provide an interesting glimpse into what “ American exceptionalism ” is really all about .
The United States is the only country in the world that is permitted to define as “ excessive military capabilities ” the ability to successfully resist an American attack .
The United States is the only country with the right to define as “ aggression ” what another country does in its own immediate vicinity on the other side of the world — while the United States itself intervenes militarily all over the globe to force others to obey its will .
The United States is the only country which is allowed to define a “ threat ” as another country ’s ability to disobey the orders of the global hegemon within a few hundred miles of its own borders .
By definition , a “ threat ” is any country that does n’t do what it ’s told .
So when Liz Cheney criticizes Obama for not believing in American exceptionalism , she ’s all wet .
He believes in it , all right .
As Chomsky pointed out , American liberals , as much as American conservatives , share the implicit assumption that “ we own the world . ”
They may believe that Vietnam or Iraq was a “ mistake , ” but never for one second do they question the premise that the United States has the right to intervene in such cases .
Let ’s get something clear .
The United States ’ military does not “ defend our freedom . ”
There has n’t been a war in my lifetime that involved a genuine foreign military threat to our freedom , and the United States government has been actively involved in suppressing freedom around the world for decades .
The United States government is a threat to our freedom , and the freedom of people everywhere .
Move over Bambi ... at barely ten inches tall this HAS to be the cutest baby around
She was abandoned by her mother during the cold snap but she has since won the hearts of everyone who has met her .
This tiny antelope , who is barely ten inches tall , is being bottle fed milk five times a day and will
be given a helping hand until she is old enough to tuck into a diet of buds , shoots and fruits herself .
Experts at Chester Zoo believe the icy weather may have put a chill on her mother 's maternal instincts , leaving the keepers to step in .
So small : This Kirk 's dik - dik antelope is being hard - reared by staff at Chester Zoo after being abandoned
The baby antelope is a Kirk 's dik - dik , the first of her kind to be born in the zoo .
Senior keeper Helen Massey has been playing mother to the new arrival .
" Kirk 's dik - dik is one of the smaller of the antelope species but what they lack in stature , they make up for in appeal , " she said .
" Our addition is growing stronger by the day and we hope she will be holding her own in the next few weeks . "
Mind the mouse : Chester Zoo's Tim Rowlands at the computer with his tiny companion looking on

Tim 's hands dwarf his tiny charge as he gives her milk
Native to Kenya , Tanzania and Namibia , the dik - dik gets its name from the noise it makes when running for cover .
They can live for up to 10 years .
As I alluded to earlier , this edition of Friday Prospects is pretty unique .
Casey was kind enough to offer me the opportunity to interview Nick Jensen -- Detroit's 5th round pick from 2009 .
Jensen plays for the Green Bay Gamblers in the USHL , heading to St. Cloud State next season .
He 's having a great season , having won gold internationally , top ten in the league in +/- , and just being named to the USHL All - Star game .
We talked a bit about his progress this season , his experience being drafted by Detroit , his future in college , and his gold medal - winning performance with Team USA at the World Junior A Challenge .
Enjoy .
WIM : Green Bay is first in the division and you were just named to the USHL All - Star Game .
What does that mean to you to accomplish something like that ?
JENSEN : I definitely take pride in that , it 's an opportunity that I 'm glad to be a part of .
Our team did n't really get recognized last year -- not saying that I should have been on it last year ( ED NOTE : Jensen led the USHL in +/- last year , just sayin ' ) , but there was a lot of guys that probably should have been on it and we really did n't get any recognition .
We had a new coach , new staff , and a couple players that were not well known .
This year I think we 've got the most guys , two people on the coaching staff going , so it means a lot to be able to go this year .
WIM : How would you describe your style of play to Wings fans who have n't been able to see you play -- your strengths and weaknesses ?
JENSEN : I think my skating is my best asset .
I usually make pretty smart plays with the puck .
I like being more of an offensive defenseman , you know , I do n't just sit back and play tight .
I try to play good defense too , along with offense .
That 's pretty much how I 'd explain it .
WIM : What aspect of your game have you been trying to improve on this season , and how do you feel you 've done with that ?
JENSEN : At the beginning of this season I was trying to improve on moving the puck up as soon as possible , because it 's really important at these high level leagues .
As soon as I get the puck , I 'm pretty much like a quarterback .
You 've got to pick your head up and move it to the open guy as soon as possible .
Everyone in this league and everything happens so fast .
The faster you make things happen , the better the play 's going to be .
WIM : What do you feel you still need to work on to get to the next level ?
JENSEN : I would n't say I 'm the best at moving the puck , so I just need to work on my passing , keeping my head up , and moving it to the forwards as fast as possible .
Shooting 's huge because the goalies are so good , especially at higher levels and even this level .
I have to work on getting shots through from the blueline , and getting it through the forward who 's trying to screen him .
WIM : What did it mean to you to be drafted by the Red Wings and has that changed any aspects of your game or how you approach coming to the rink every day ?
JENSEN : Getting drafted , to me , just felt like the start .
It meant that this was just the beginning and I had to start working really hard now .
Especially from Detroit , being where they are and their reputation of being a great hockey team .
My mom 's side of the family is all from Michigan , too , so it was nice to get drafted because they were all pretty excited .
The Wings have always been the favorite team of all of them .
WIM : Do you get to visit the area a lot then ?
JENSEN : Obviously not now , but I used to go there every year , at least when I was n't busy with hockey .
My parents still go out there and I still have relatives out there .
WIM : Did you get any indication leading up to the draft that Detroit might take you ?
JENSEN : I had never talked to them until the day of the first round , the day before I got drafted .
They called me and asked me a few questions -- nothing too in depth , just basic questions like what my strengths and weaknesses are .
That was pretty much my indication that they were interested , but I was n't sure if they were going to take me or not .
More with Jensen after the jump , including his run in with two big name former Red Wings and his thoughts on USHL hockey .
WIM : You 've said before that one of your favorite players was Nicklas Lidstrom , did you get a chance to meet him ?
JENSEN : Not yet I have n't , but when I was at their camp I did get a chance to meet Steve Yzerman .
He was one of my favorite players too so that was pretty cool .
WIM : And how was your experience at the development camp last summer , meeting the rest of the organization ?
JENSEN : It was really cool .
There was like 40 guys that they brought in , all top notch players .
It was a really neat camp , you got to be in the locker room , you got to tour all of the facilities , yeah , it was pretty cool .
WIM : Was that camp more for learning how to be a professional , or for the Wings to just assess where your development is at ?
JENSEN : It 's a mixture of both I think .
We wake up pretty early and go out onto the ice for about two and a half hours each day .
The first half we 're working on a bunch of skills like power skating , stickhandling , and shooting .
Then they resurface and we 'll come out and work with Curt Fraser , the coach of their AHL team .
He teaches us breakouts , forechecks , and all of the little things you need to know .
There were a lot of guys at the camp that went on to the tryout camp for the Red Wings , so they had to know all that stuff going in .
They taught us all that , then we'd go off ice for a lot of off - ice training with plyometrics , weight - lifting , and dieting , just what we should be eating .
WIM : Do the Wings stay in contact with you over the course of the season ?
JENSEN : Yeah , they have one of their former players , Jiri Fischer , he works with all the draftees .
He actually came around this year and talked to me , he came and watched me play .
What he does is come watch you play and evaluate your game and see what you need to work on .
He 'll actually come to wherever you play at and have an on-ice session with you , to work on whatever you need to work on .
WIM : Why did you decide to go to the USHL over major junior hockey ?
JENSEN : College is a lot of the reason , I wanted to be able to get an education still .
Obviously I did n't know I was going to get drafted or anything .
Still , if I had known that , I still would have come to this league .
It 's top notch , and unlike some of the major junior leagues you 're eligible for college .
That 's what my plan is and what I want to do .
WIM : Right .
And you 're still going to St. Cloud State next year ?
JENSEN : Yeah , that 's correct .
WIM : Why did you decide to join that program ?
JENSEN : It kind of came down to process of elimination .
It came down to wanting to play in the WCHA ( Western Collegiate Hockey Association ) so I talked to different schools .
I talked to Mankato State ( Minnesota State University ) , Alaska , and then St. Cloud .
After I committed I talked to Minnesota - Duluth and the University of Minnesota .
I took a visit to Mankato and St. Cloud , because I decided I wanted to stay in Minnesota for college because that 's where I 'm from .
So I visited two and pretty much just chose St. Cloud .
They 're pretty similar schools , but I like St. Cloud a little better .
I 've got a lot of friends going there , and they got new renovations for their rink .
Then I talked to the coach about their depth and their roster , and it sounded like the team that I would want to be on .
WIM : Lastly , you won gold at the World Junior A Challenge .
Talk about that experience and how that 's going to help you moving forward .
JENSEN : It was a great experience when I went out there .
I did n't have a whole idea of what it was because there 's so many different USA tournaments like the Olympics then the IIHF under - 20 team .
The guys that went out there were mostly USHL and it was a great group of guys , all from different teams .
We got along great .
It was a great experience playing against different teams , like Canada and Sweden because obviously I 've never played against them before .
I learned that their style of play is so much different from our team .
Winning the gold definitely made me proud , knowing that I represented my country like that , being able to win it for my country .
It was fun , it was good experience .
----
And that 'll do it .
Thanks to Casey for allowing me to ask all of my nerdy prospects questions , and thanks to Nick for being a good sport and not being one of those media - trained hockey players who can't give more than a ten word answer ...

A growing war of words is emerging tonight as the US military , ostensibly dispatched to Haiti to help with humanitarian efforts in the wake of a disastrous earthquake , is being accused to blocking aid from entering the nation as well as flights for non-American citizens from leaving .
“ This is about helping Haiti , not about occupying Haiti , ” cautioned one French minister , who slammed US troops that seized Haiti ’s only airport and have since been directing traffic as it suits them .
Doctors Without Borders , one of the world ’s most high profile aid groups and the recipients of several major donations for Haitian relief efforts , complained that the US military actually blocked several flights carrying badly needed medical supplies , including inflatable emergency hospitals , ordering them to divert to the Dominican Republic instead .
US military spokesman for Haiti operations Captain John Kirby shrugged off the complaints , citing “ security concerns . ”
Another official blamed “ a crowded parking lot . ”
Still other commanders promised that the military would change its practices so that humanitarian aid was given a higher priority , sparking inevitable questions about why this was n’t the case in the first place .
Despite efforts to get some clarification from Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the scope of the operation , he would speak only in vague terms .
Troops in the country insisted they “ are n’t here to fight , ” but their actions on the ground suggest that even in a purely humanitarian operation the US is very comfortable with the role of occupier , and the perpetual war mentality is extending to control over the tiny airport , with disastrous consequences .

The mayor of Arlington , Tennessee , believes he knows exactly why President Barack Obama chose last Tuesday night to announce his Afghanistan troop surge :
It was a nefarious plot by the “ Muslim ” president to pre-empt that night ’s broadcast of A Charlie Brown Christmas .
Russell Wiseman , mayor of Memphis suburb Arlington , suggested in a Facebook posting that Obama wanted to obscure the traditional Christmas TV special ’s Christian message .
And in what the Memphis Commercial Appeal described as “ an extensive thread that attacked the president , ” Wiseman also said that Obama supporters “ need to move to a Muslim country … oh wait , that ’s America … pitiful . ”

This is how the Commercial Appeal transcribed Wiseman ’s Facebook posting , which is accessible only to the mayor ’s Facebook friends :
Ok , so , this is total crap , we sit the kids down to watch ‘ The Charlie Brown Christmas Special ’ and our muslim [ sic ] president is there , what a load … try to convince me that was n’t done on purpose .
Ask the man if he believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and he will give you a 10 minute disertation [ sic ] about it ….[ w ] hen the answer should simply be ‘ yes ’ … .
And in a statement that will inevitably be interpreted as a declaration of either a class war or a racial war , Wiseman went on to lament the fact that Americans who do n’t own property are allowed to vote .
“ [ Y ] ou know , our forefathers had it written in the original Constitution that ONLY property owners could vote , if that has stayed in there , things would be different … , ” Wiseman wrote .
Asked by the Commercial Appeal to comment on his screed , the mayor replied that the newspaper was “ making a mountain out of a molehill ” over the story .

No other place has had problems on the scale of Jefferson County , the most populous county in Alabama .
It has been sinking under a $ 3 billion debt burden for several years , and the hundreds of millions of dollars in fees it owed J. P. Morgan on the derivatives compounded the problem .
The county has made drastic cuts in services and has warned for months that it might have to declare bankruptcy .
Image Larry Langford , a former public official , was convicted in the case .
Credit ... Dusty Compton / Tuscaloosa News
The S.E.C. did not point to anything improper about Jefferson County ’s bonds , its derivatives , or with the once - popular concept of linking the two .
Its complaint focused solely on what it called unlawful activity in J. P. Morgan ’s efforts to win the business .
It said the two former bank employees , Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin , had arranged for illegal payments of more than $ 8 million to friends of the county commissioners , who then worked to make sure the commissioners voted to give J. P. Morgan contracts to underwrite the county ’s bonds and provide the derivatives , known as interest - rate swaps .
A lawyer for Mr. LeCroy , Lisa Mathewson , said the S.E.C. had overstepped its jurisdiction and labeled permissible business practices as fraudulent .
A lawyer for Mr. MacFaddin , Richard F. Lawler , said his client denied violating any securities laws and believed he would be vindicated at trial .
The former County Commission president , Larry Langford , was convicted last week of accepting luxury gifts and cash totaling $ 235,000 in connection with the scheme .
He was serving as mayor of Birmingham , Ala. , Jefferson County ’s largest city , but was automatically removed when he was convicted .
The two former bank employees did not settle with the S.E.C .
The suit said that J. P. Morgan passed the cost of the illegal payments to the county by charging above - market prices on the interest - rate swaps .
J. P. Morgan did not admit or deny any of the government ’s accusations .
It said in a statement that it had discontinued its business of trading in derivatives with states and local governments .
It also pointed out that the settlement did not impair any of Jefferson County ’s bonds .
__1931 : __The new invention of the coaxial cable is issued a U.S. patent , which will eventually deliver the gift of ubiquitous telephony and cable television .
How do you minimize signal interference for telecommunication ?
Easy :
Take a wire that acts as an inner conductor and wrap an outer conductor around it , instead of running two wires side by side .
That way , the electromagnetic field carrying the signal will only travel in the space between the inner and outer conductors .
That will allow wider frequency range , too .
Duh .
That invention — known today as the coaxial cable , because the two conductors share the same axis — was n't realized in the United States until 1931 .
Experiments with co-ax cables took place in Bell Laboratories for possible telephone usage .
Each cable route , consisting of several individual cables , could carry 1,800 calls .
U.S. Patent No. 1,835,031 for a " concentric conducting system " was awarded to Lloyd Espenschied of Kew Gardens , New York , and Herman A. Affel of Ridgewood , New Jersey , and assigned to the American Telephone & Telegraph Co .
Coaxial cable technology improved over time to increase capacity .
By the 1970s , systems could support up to 132,000 conversations .
Coaxial cables and amplifiers also led to the creation of the first trans -Atlantic telephone cable in 1956 .
The implementation of TAT - 1 , a transatlantic system bridging AT&T with the British Post Office , was " a stupendous pioneering undertaking .
Some 4,500 miles of coaxial cable had to be made to the most exacting specifications ever devised , and new machinery had to be designed for laying the cables in waters up to 2.5 miles deep , " according to the book Shaping American Telecommunications : A History of Technology , Policy and Economics .
The co-ax eventually contributed to the growth of community antenna television , or CATV — a large antenna that would share its signal with many individual homes through coaxial cables .
And that led to programming created exclusively for cable subscribers , creating a multibillion - dollar industry .
And , as long as we 've got all those low - interference cables running into millions of homes , why not use them for broadband internet access ?
Not a bad idea .
As a matter of fact why not run the video through the internet ?
All of it based on the simple idea of running a wire wrapped around another wire .

Getting the correct balance of proteins in our diet may be more important for healthy ageing than reducing calories , new research funded by the Wellcome Trust and Research into Ageing suggests .
The research may help explain why ' dietary restriction ' ( also known as calorie restriction ) -- reducing food intake whilst maintaining sufficient quantities of vitamins , minerals and other important nutrients -- appears to have health benefits .
In many organisms , such as the fruit fly ( drosophila ) , mice , rats and the Rhesus monkey , these benefits include living longer .
Evidence suggests that dietary restriction can have health benefits for humans , too , though it is unclear whether it can increase longevity .
Dietary restriction can have a potentially negative side effect , however : diminished fertility .
For example , the female fruit fly reproduces less frequently on a low calorie diet and its litter size is reduced , though its reproductive span lasts longer .
This is believed to be an evolutionary trait : in times of famine , essential nutrients are diverted away from reproduction and towards survival .
To understand whether the health benefits of dietary restriction stem from a reduction in specific nutrients or in calorie intake in general , researchers at the Institute of Healthy Ageing , UCL ( University College London ) , measured the effects of manipulating the diet of female fruit flies .
The results of the study are published December 3 in the journal Nature .
The fruit flies were fed a diet of yeast , sugar and water , but with differing amounts of key nutrients , such as vitamins , lipids and amino acids .
The researchers found that varying the amount of amino acids in the mixture affected lifespan and fertility ; varying the amount of the other nutrients had little or no effect .
In fact , when the researchers studied the effect further , they found that levels of a particular amino acid known as methionine were crucial to maximising lifespan without decreasing fertility .
Adding methionine to a low calorie diet boosted fertility without reducing lifespan ; likewise , reducing methionine content in a high calorie diet prolonged lifespan .
Previous studies have also shown that reducing the intake of methionine in rodents can help extend lifespan .
" By carefully manipulating the balance of amino acids in the diet , we have been able to maximise both lifespan and fertility , " explains Dr Matthew Piper , one of the study authors .
" This indicates that it is possible to extend lifespan without wholesale dietary restriction and without the unfortunate consequence of lowering reproductive capacity . "
Amino acids are the building blocks of life as they form the basis of proteins .
Methionine is one of the most important amino acids at it is essential to the formation of all proteins .
Whilst proteins are formed naturally in the body , we also consume proteins from many different food types , including meat and dairy products , soy - derived food such as tofu , and pulses .
The relative abundance of methionine differs depending on the food type in question ; it occurs in naturally high levels in foods such as sesame seeds , Brazil nuts , wheat germ , fish and meats .
" In the past , we have tended to think that the amount of protein is what is important to our diet , " says Dr Piper .
" We 've shown here that in flies -- and this is likely to be the case for other organisms -- the balance of amino acids in the diet can affect health later in life .
If this is the case for humans , then the type of protein will be more important .
" It 's not as simple as saying ' eat less nuts ' or ' eat more nuts ' to live longer -- it 's about getting the protein balance right , a factor that might be particularly important for high protein diets , such as the Atkins diet or body builders ' protein supplements . "
Because the effects of dietary restriction on lifespan appears to be evolutionarily conserved -- occurring in organisms from yeast to monkeys -- scientists believe that the mechanisms may also be conserved .
This opens up the possibility of using these organisms as models to study how dietary restriction works .
Although the human genome has around four times the number of genes as the fruit fly genome , there is a close relationship between many of these genes .
Since it is easy to create mutants and carry out experiments on fruit flies , the functions of many fly genes have been established and newly discovered human genes can often be matched against their fly counterparts .
Therefore , even though the fruit fly does not on the surface resemble humans , many findings about its basic biology can be interpreted for human biology .

This walleye was infected with the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus .
Cornell researchers report that fish from Lake Superior have been found to be infected with the virus , which means that it has now spread to all of the Great Lakes .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A deadly fish virus - viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus - first discovered in the Northeast in 2005 , has been found for the first time in Lake Superior .
The virus is now in all of the Great Lakes .
A deadly fish virus that was first discovered in the Northeast in 2005 has been found for the first time in fish from Lake Superior , report Cornell researchers .
That means that the virus has now been documented in all of the Great Lakes .
The viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus ( VHSV ) , which causes fatal anemia and hemorrhaging in many fish species , poses no threat to humans , said Paul Bowser , professor of aquatic animal medicine at Cornell 's College of Veterinary Medicine .
Bowser and colleagues recently tested 874 fish from seven sites in Lake Superior in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) Western Fisheries Research Center in Seattle .
Fish from Paradise and Skanee in Michigan and St. Louis Bay and Superior Bay in Wisconsin tested positive .
Some of the results have been corroborated by other laboratories ; others have tests still under way .
The virus , which has been identified in 28 freshwater fish species in the Great Lakes watershed , has reached epidemic proportions in the Great Lakes and threatens New York 's sport - fishing industry , said Bowser , estimated to contribute some $ 1.4 billion annually to New York 's economy .
" People come from all over the eastern United States to fish the Great Lakes , " said Bowser , noting that the virus has also been found in a few inland waters as well , including lakes , streams and a family - owned earthen pond .
" The economy of many of these areas ebbs and flows with the season and perceived value of outdoor recreational opportunities .
The value of these opportunities is dependent on how successful we are at managing the health of wild fish .
On a worldwide basis , VHSV is considered one of the most serious pathogens of fish , because it kills so many fish , is not treatable and infects a broad range of fish species . "
In 2008 the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a federal order preventing transport of the 28 species within the Great Lakes watershed , including Lake Superior , to limit the spread of this viral pathogen .
As a result , the new findings will not lead to additional regulatory actions , according to authorities .
While no significant fish mortality due to VHSV was observed in 2008 and 2009 , " It is important to note that there are still fish harboring VHSV ; essentially the infection proceeds even though no mortalities are being observed , " said Bowser .
" This is important because it suggests that these infected fish may serve as a reservoir for the virus in the Great Lakes ecosystem .
While we do n't fully understand the lack of recent mortality , the potential presence or absence of stressors on the fish may be playing a role . "

ARCHIVES | SEARCH DDoS on www.fra.se Posted by Mikko @ 10:02 GMT
The Swedish Signals Intelligence agency ( F�rsvarets Radioanstalt FRA ) is currently under a large - scale DDoS attack .
At the moment www.fra.se is inaccessible .
FRA was in the news recently , as Sweden passed a law giving them legal permission to tap Internet traffic passing through Swedish national borders .
For example , the majority of Russian international Internet traffic passes through Sweden .
The monitoring effectively started last month .
We have no information on who 's behind the attacks .
Downtime stats are available here .
Babies born to women who have taken folic acid supplements during their pregnancy are up to 30 % more likely than other children to develop asthma , researchers have found .
Mothers - to - be who take folic acid when they are between 30 and 34 weeks pregnant as a health measure may inadvertently prompt the breathing condition in their offspring , a new study says .
The research , published in the American Journal of Epidemiology , claims that its findings may help explain the huge global rise over the last 50 years in asthma , especially among children , which has puzzled experts and led to speculation over the causes of the increase .
" We believe that this is the first published study in humans to demonstrate that increasing consumption of folic acid , and specifically supplemental folate during late pregnancy , significantly increases the risk of physician - diagnosed asthma in the child at 3.5 years , persistent asthma ( at 3.5 and 5.5 years ) , and possibly asthma at 5.5 years , " write the authors , led by associate professor Michael Davies of the Research Centre for the Early Origins of Health and Disease at the University of Adelaide in Australia .
Davies and his team studied the effect of 557 Australian expectant mothers ' folate consumption on their child 's later development of asthma by examining their diet during pregnancy and how many of their children had asthma at 3.5 years and 5.5 years .
However , while intake of folic acid supplements in later pregnancy was potentially problematic , intake of folate – the natural form of folic acid – through consumption of green leafy vegetables , certain nuts and fruits involved no risk , said Davies .
Nor did folic acid intake in early pregnancy , he added .
His research showed how changing diet patterns , and especially over - use of a supplement , could play a role in explaining childhood asthma , he added .
The Department of Health recommends that women should take folic acid for a month before they conceive and during the first trimester of pregnancy , but not beyond , as a way of reducing the number of babies born with neural tube defects , notably spina bifida .
While a third of mothers take it pre-pregnancy , some continue to take it throughout , either as a single supplement or as part of a range of vitamins .
But Prof Terence Stephenson , president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , said he doubted the research was very important .
" The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health strongly supports the use of folic acid in pregnancy .
It will significantly reduce the number of children born with serious abnormalities of the brain or spine and the associated disabilities .
These conditions have profound implications for the child and parents or carers , " he said .
" The study published this week suggesting a link between folic acid in pregnancy and subsequent increased risk of childhood asthma is not a randomised trial .
It relied on a postal questionnaire with a 76 % response rate .
The increased risk , if there is any , is only just statistically significant .
Asthma is treatable whereas spina bifida is a serious and lifelong condition . "
Leanne Metcalf , of Asthma UK , said : " While asthma is a serious and longterm condition , the benefits of taking folic acid supplements in pregnancy , particularly with regards to prevention of birth defects like spina bifida , still outweigh the risk of developing asthma . "
That view was also supported by Siobhan Freegard , co-founder of Netmums , a social networking site for mothers which claims to have 2.4 million users .
" It 's better to have the folic acid and take my chances of asthma against the really serious risk of spina bifida that low folate intake in your diet can cause .
The best thing is to take folic acid before you conceive , if you can , and for the first three months , and then get folate naturally from then on through eating things such as spinach , " she said .
The government is coming under pressure to introduce the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid as a way of reducing neural tube defects .
The move is backed by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition ( SACN ) , its official advisers , and the Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) .
UPDATES EXCLUSIVE : ‘ Spider - Man 4 ’ Officially Has No Start Date As Of Today Because Of Script Problems ; Sony “ Unlikely ” To Make Scheduled May 5 , 2011 , Release Date
BREAKING NEWS !
3RD UPDATE : Tobey Maguire just released this statement to me : “ I am so proud of what we accomplished with the Spider - Man franchise over the last decade .
Beyond the films themselves I have formed some deep and lasting friendships .
I am excited to see the next chapter unfold in this incredible story . ”
2ND UPDATE : Mike Fleming and Nikki Finke have just confirmed that Sony Pictures decided today to reboot the Spider - Man franchise after franchise director Sam Raimi pulled out of Spider - Man 4 because he felt he could n’t make its summer release date and keep the film ’s creative integrity .
This means that Raimi and the cast including star Tobey Maguire are out .
There will be no Spider - Man 4 .
Instead , Mike Fleming is told , the studio will focus on a Summer 2012 reboot from a script by Jamie Vanderbilt with a new director and a new cast .
All this took place today at meeting on the lot today .
An official Sony Pictures news release about it is expected out now ( see below ) .
Immediately , the news brought celebration and consternation equally to webslinger fanboys who say the reboot plot puts Peter Parker back in high school .
There ’s also much unconfirmed speculation that this new franchise will be in 3D .
And the fans also recall that , in 1991 , James Cameron wrote a treatment for Spider - Man and now they ’re wondering if he might helm the reboot .
( Sony ended up acquiring his treatment in a legal settlement . )
Here ’s what went down :
My sources tell me that Raimi told Sony Pictures : “ I ca n’t make your date .
I ca n’t go forward creatively . ”
And , so , once he said “ That ’s it ” , Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal and Columbia Pictures ’
Matt Tolmach decided they did n’t want to replace him and instead chose to reboot the franchise .
Insiders also tell me that Tobey Maguire heard the news in a phone call with Amy today .
I ’m told Tobey was n’t upset .
“ He ’s made 3 great Spider - Man movies .
He ’s done really well .
But he ’s the kind of guy who , if Sam wanted to go forward , would have been there for Sam and the studio .
Absolutely . ”
Mike Fleming has heard that , from Spidey , Raimi could move to World Of Warcraft , or to The Given Day , that terrific novel by Dennis Lehane , author of Shutter Island and Mystic River .
Both are worthy projects , but World Of Warcraft is a huge franchise .
Fortunately for the studio , Sony was not yet “ pay or play ” on some of the talent negotiations which were still only at the tail end .
Raimi was insisting that John Malkovich play the villain , and the studio was looking to cast Anne Hathaway .
“ I ’m not so sure we ’re going in that direction , ” an insider told me on January 5th .
Sony had been hot for her until bigwigs realized she ’d cost too much and they probably do n’t need “ such a big star ” for the pic , I was told .
( See my previous , Anne Hathaway Wanted For ‘ Spider - Man 4 ’. )
As for those repeated rumors that Spider - Man 4 might shoot in 3D , I ’ve learned it would have added at least 6 months to the production schedule and “ no one on the pic has any idea how to do that , ” a source confided .
You ’ve got to figure 3D now is uppermost on Sony minds given the post - Avatar climate , and Summer 2012 is more than enough time to make the reboot with new technology .
Back in April , Amy Pascal and Michael Lynton told Forbes magazine : “ People are paying a premium to see movies in 3 - D and that ’s a very big deal .
It ’s never been done before that someone says you have to pay more to see Spider - Man than a romantic comedy . ”
The events that led to today ’s shocking decision to scrap Spider - Man 4 can be traced to mid-December when I saw a December 11th email alerting the pic ’s special effects crew that the fourquel would not be starting as planned “ but Sam Raimi has story issues [ that ] need to be resolved before we are ready to shoot ” .
At that point , it was n’t well known that the Spider - Man franchise director helming the 4th installment had huge problems with the script that has run through screenwriters Jamie Vanderbilt , David Lindsay - Abaire , and Gary Ross .
I was told Sam Raimi had been very vocal inside Sony that he “ hated ” it .
I broke this story on January 5th , and reported that Raimi and Sony were anxiously waiting for still another version from screenwriter Alvin Sargent , who wrote Spidey 2 & 3 and is married to Spidey franchise producer Laura Ziskin .
“ It is unlikely that May 11 , 2011 , date will be made , ” a Sony insider told me that day .
“ It depends on how quickly the script can get in . ”
However , agents told clients in the movie to already expect the film to be pushed back .
My sources said Sony still intends to release that summer , even if the new date is July 2011 .
But Spider - Man has always owned that coveted early May date .
Even as far back as September 2008 when I reported my exclusive that Sony Locks Sam Raimi / Tobey Maguire For ‘ Spider - Man 4 ’ .
What a giant opportunity for other studios planning their 2011 schedules to grab this big opening .
And they did .
Paramount and Marvel Entertainment pushed up the release of Thor by two weeks to May 6 , 2011 .
Thor was set to have opened May 20 , 2011 , a slot which Disney grabbed for Pirates of the Caribbean 4 : On Stranger Tides .
Spider - Man 4 was supposed to start filming in February , which Tobey Maguire echoed repeatedly in publicity appearances for Brothers .
Then it pushed to March .
Then late March / early April .
And by January 5th there was no date at all , according to my Sony insiders who emailed me : “ Some decisions have been made over the holiday about Spider - Man 4 .
We will be extending the production hiatus on the film .
The studio is firmly committed to this franchise but , for us , the script must come first .
We intend to notify members of the crew immediately .
As you know , Alvin Sargent is currently working on the screenplay .
When we have more news , we will keep you posted . ”
Pascal and Tolmach , who have shepherded the Spider - Man franchise from Day One , have been wrestling with this script problem for months .
“ I ’m going to do everything I can to make May , ” she has repeatedly told Hollywood types involved with the movie .
“ But I ’m not going to start a movie where the script is n’t right yet .
Not unless I want my career to be over . ”
Here is the Sony press release :
TOKYO  I was on a Japanese treadmill gazing at the usual numbers , speed and calorie count and so on , when I started to get mesmerized by the little images of food and drink on the screen .
At 35 calories , there was a frothy cappuccino , and then at 75 two pieces of tuna sushi , to be followed at 126 by an ice cream cone , at 150 by a beer and at 204 by an elegant glass decanter of sake .
The 300 - calorie mark ushered in chocolate cake , which segued at 325 to cheesecake .
At 450 calories I caught a sweat - drenched glimpse of an egg - topped sandwich suggestive of a Croque Madame .
Whatever followed was lost in translation .
I ’d never seen anything like this in any gym and found myself lost in an obsessive , screen - gazing state .
Were these images , I wondered , warnings about dishes and drinks to be avoided , or were they invitations to enjoy them later , the visual projection of a no - pain - no - gain philosophy ?
Or were they simply calorie - count notices of the kind now found in New York restaurants ?
I still do n’t know .
But my sense is that the state I found myself in , of playful fixation on a screen , imagining the bite of the ice - cold beer and the unctuousness of the sushi , contained something peculiarly Japanese .
This is not to say of course that kids the world over are not mesmerized by screens of various forms often showing Japanese - made video games .
But I ’m not aware of any other nation where fantasy , escapism and the cyber world have fused with such intensity .

What 's new ?
It occurs to me that those who have already looked at this web page might not want to slog through all of it on the chance that something newly installed might interest them .
If you 've looked at the page before , then look at this dated list .
Dates start in 1995 July .

THE ROBOT AND THE BABY is a science fiction story .
Maybe I 'll try to publish it conventionally .
Do you think I should ?
I have decided to make some comment from time to time on world , national and scientific affairs .
I do n't have time to make this into a proper blog .
My goal is get all my papers and many of my notes into a form reachable from this page .
Slides for most of my lectures are here .
If any of the papers here are listed as references , I would be grateful if the URLs were given along with the printed references .

The Sustainability of Human Progress
Many people , including many scientists , mistakenly believe that human progress , in the form it has taken in the last few hundred years , is unsustainable .
The sustainabililty page and its subsidiaries attempt to summarize the scientific basis for technological optimism .
There is also a section discussing related ideological phenomena and the advocacy politics to which ideologies have given rise .
The sustainability pages are essentially done , although I plan to improve them and respond to inadequacies people find .
Having done my best to show that material progress is sustainable , I can turn my attention to the future and present ideas about what progress people will want and what can be achieved .
The emphasis is on opportunities rather than on inevitability .
What is Artificial Intelligence ?

PAPERS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and their Computation by Machine ( Part I ) .
This was the original paper on LISP .
It is copied with minor notational changes from CACM , April 1960 .
If you want the exact typography , look there .
A few typographical changes have been made , but the notation has not been modernized .
There are also some new explanatory footnotes .
Part II , which never appeared , was to have had some Lisp programs for algebraic computation .
LISP --- NOTES ON ITS PAST AND FUTURE ---1980 was published in 1980 .
I put it up since it mostly represents my present opinions .
There are some 1999 footnotes .
Elephant 2000 - 1992
This unpublished draft is a proposal for a new programming language , but it includes the mathematical theory of computation proposal for distinguishing input - output and accomplishment specifications , characterizes input and output statements as speech acts and allows reference to the past in programs .
PUBLISHED PAPERS ON MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF COMPUTATION
Towards a Mathematical Science of Computation , IFIPS 1962 extends the results of the previous paper .
I think it is the first mention and use of abstract syntax .
Correctness of a Compiler for Arithmetic Expressions by John McCarthy and James Painter may have been the first proof of correctness of a compiler .
Abstract syntax and Lisp - style recursive definitions kept the paper short .

Inversion of Functions Defined by Turing Machines was included in Automata Studies edited by Claude Shannon and myself and published by Princeton University Press in 1956 .
It introduced the notion of well - defined problem , but I became convinced that inverting computable functions in general is not a feasible way of doing AI .
Programs with Common Sense was probably the first paper on logical AI , i.e .
AI in which logic is the method of representing information in computer memory and not just the subject matter of the program .
The paper was given in the Teddington Conference on the Mechanization of Thought Processes in December 1958 and printed in the proceedings of that conference .
It may also be the first paper to propose common sense reasoning ability as the key to AI .
Some Philosophical Problems from the Standpoint of Artificial Intelligence by John McCarthy and Pat Hayes was published in 1969 in Machine Intelligence 4 .
It is the basic paper on situation calculus .
My 1964 Stanford AI Memo A Tough Nut for Proof Procedures has aroused increased interest lately .
The present version has some recent comments .
It is to prove that a checkerboard with two diagonally opposite squares removed cannot be covered by dominoes that cover two adjacent squares .
The Mutilated Checkerboard in Set Theory was presented at the QED meeting in Warsaw in 1995 July .
It is a proof in set theory that I think an interactive prover for heavy duty set theory should be able to accept .
It uses for a different purpose the same problem as the previous paper .
Circumscription - A Form of Nonmonotonic Reasoning was published in Artificial Intelligence in 1980 .
Applications of Circumscription to Formalizing Common Sense Knowledge was published in Artificial Intelligence in 1986 .
It gives a better formulation of circumscription and emphasizes making certain functions and predicates variable .
Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines concerns what it means for a machine to have beliefs .
This started the dispute about whether thermostats could be considered to have beliefs .
It was published in 1979 in an obscure collection and reprinted in my 1990 book Formalizing Common Sense .
First Order Theories of Individual Concepts and Propositions was first published in Machine Intelligence 9 in 1979 .
Artificial Intelligence , Logic and Formalizing Common Sense
in Philosophical Logic and Artificial Intelligence edited by Richmond Thomason ( Dordrecht ; Kluwer Academic , c1989 ) .
This contains a reasonably up - to - date ( even as of 1994 ) point of view of logical AI .
It does n't cover what I do n't know or have forgotten .
Notes on Formalizing Context
Appeared in Proceedings of IJCAI - 1993 .
This version has an improvement in the way lifting above - theory is treated .
Formalizing Context ( Expanded Notes ) contains expanded material on context .
It is joint work with Sasa Buvac .
Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy was given at Aaron Sloman 's Symposium on philosophy and AI at IJCAI - 95 .
The present version is somewhat improved .
A LOGICAL AI APPROACH TO CONTEXT responds to a request for a note on our approach to formalizing context in mathematical logic that can be compared with John Perry 's situation semantics based approach to context .
It will appear ( presumably appeared ) in a CSLI ( Center for Studies in Linguistics and Information ) publication .
Making Robots Conscious of their Mental States was given at Machine Intelligence 15 , 1995 August in Oxford .
It 's in the Proceedings of that workshop .
The idea is that many tasks will require the computer programs examine their own computational structures in ways like those involved in human consciousness and indeed self - consciousness .
The present version is much improved .
Some Expert Systems Need Common Sense was published in 1984 .
Some people are re-defining AI in such a way that common sense and therefore human level AI are precluded .
They do this inadvertently ( presumably ) by assuming that some human limits what phenomena are to be taken into account in defining the AI system .
Coloring Maps and the Kowalski Doctrine was a 1982 Stanford report .
More is known about realizing the Kempe heuristic by making a Prolog that can run in an introspective mode , and I 'll put in a note about it when I get a chance .
The Little Thoughts of Thinking Machines is a popular article that appeared in Psychology Today in 1983 .
Epistemological Problems of Artificial Intelligence summarized the epistemological problems I saw at that time .
It was an invited talk at IJCAI - 77 .
Many of the problems mentioned in this paper were treated later in more detail by myself and other people .
Generality in Artificial Intelligence relates to my ACM Turing Award lecture given in 1971 .
However , the ideas did n't jell sufficiently at that time to be written up .
In 1987 ACM asked for a summary to include in a volume of Turing Award lectures .
Instead I wrote this complete paper .
Its actual relation to the 1971 lecture is hard to say , since I did n't remember what I said in 1971 .
On the Model Theory of Knowledge by myself , M. Sato , T. Hayashi and S. Igarashi was written in the late 1970s .
Creative Solutions to Problems was given at the AISB Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Creativity , 1999 April 8 and 9 .
Combining Narratives is by John McCarthy and Tom Costello .
It was presented at KR - 98 in Trento , Italy .
A major feature of this paper is that sentences describing two independent narratives can be combined just by conjoining the sentences .
Sentences can be added later to establish relations between them .
Useful Counterfactuals by Tom Costello and John McCarthy is published in the ETAI ( Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence ) , Vol 3 ( 1999 ) , Section A .
Counterfactual conditional sentences can be useful in artificial intelligence .
In particular , they allow reasoners to learn from experiences that they did not quite have .
The truth of a counterfactual and the conclusions that can be drawn from a counterfactual are theory dependent , and different theories are useful in different circumstances .
A simple class of useful counterfactuals involves a change of one component of a point in a space provided with a cartesian product structure .
We call these cartesian counterfactuals .
Cartesian counterfactuals can be modeled by assignment and contents functions as in program semantics .
We also study the more general tree - structured counterfactuals .
Free Will - Even for Robots will appear in a special issue of the Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence devoted to philosophical questions .
Robots will need to consider their own choices in a manner similar to that in which a human contemplates his own free will .
DETERMINISTIC FREE WILL is a shorter paper than Free Will - Even for Robots .
I think it gets to the essence of free will and incorporates it in a situation calculus formula .
AI needs to deal with objects and predicates that do n't admit if - and - only - if definitions .
It also needs approximate theories and needs to study the relation between entities at different levels of approximation .
Approximate objects and approximate theories is in the Proceedings of KR - 2000 .
ACTIONS AND OTHER EVENTS IN SITUATION CALCULUS
This is a new ( 2001 August ) article on situation calculus .
It differs from previous approaches in three ways .
It distinguishes internal events that happen spontaneously from external events ( actions ) .
It also treats processes , e.g. a buzzer , that do not settle down .
The non-monotonic reasoning is circumscription done situation by situation .
It is in the Proceedings of KR - 2002 .
Notes on AI
An Example for Natural Language Understanding and the AI Problems it Raisestry .
- 1976 .
Apparently these problems have n't been solved and the recently popular statistical methods do n't even try .
Overcoming unexpected obstacles is a note written in 1992 and 1993 describing an important kind of elaboration tolerance .
A plan is shown to work by reasoning involving circumscribing a predicate occurs ( e , s ) asserting that the event e occurs in situation s.
If a sentence is added asserting the occurrence of an event that defeats the plan and the circumscription is done again , the plan can no longer be shown to work .
In our example , a revised plan including an action that overcomes the obstacle can be shown to work .
There is a bug in handling the circumscription that I have not fixed , and this accounts for the long delay in posting this note .
Formalization of two Puzzles Involving Knowledge involves formalization of facts about knowledge including both knowing what and knowing that , how to assume and prove non-knowledge , joint knowledge and the effect of learning a fact on the set of facts then known .
It uses the Kripke possible worlds formalism directly .
What is AI ? is intended to answer questions I get in email from people uninformed about AI .
Suggestions for improving it are welcome , and anyone who has a use for it is welcome to link to it or copy it .
Making Computer Chess a Drosophila for AI is an outgrowth of my review of Monty Newborn 's Kasparov versus Deep Blue : Computer Chess Comes of Age .
The review appeared in Science for 1997 June 6 .
Roofs and Boxes is an example to illustrate that extrapolating past experience to predict the future usually involves recognitions of phenomena in the world and not just the sequence of inputs .
The problem is too hard for now .
Philosophical and scientific presuppositions of logical AI appeared in Logical Foundations for Cognitive Agents : Contributions in Honor of Ray Reiter , edited by H. J. Levesque and F. Pirri , Springer - Verlag , 1999 .
Parameterizing the Set of Models of a Propositional Theory
It is often inadequate that a theory be consistent , i.e. have models .
It should have enough models .
We discuss parameterizing the set of models in the special case of propositional satisfiability .
Appearance and Reality : A challenge to machine learning contains a puzzle whose solution is to determine the reality behind the appearance you see on the page .
The challenge is to make machine learning programs and scientific discovery programs that can find the reality behind appearance in this simple case .
John Searle 's chinese room argument contains a refutation of that argument that computers can't be conscious .
OTHER COMPUTER SCIENCE
The Common Business Communication Language , published in 1982 , proposes a language for inter-business inter-computer commmunication .
Most of the ideas in this paper have been re-invented in connection with electronic commerce , specifically in connection with XML .
Criteria for usefulness of computers in offices is a 1982 article .
Its observations are mainly confirmed , but some of the measures it advocates are still not implemented .
Networks considered harmful - for electronic mail is a 1989 editorial in CACM .
Now that Internet is universally available , its considerations are mostly obsolete .
THE HOME INFORMATION TERMINAL --- A 1970 VIEW
This article was published in Man and Computer .
Proc. int. Conf. , Bordeaux 1970 , pp. 48-57 ( Karger , Basel 1972 ) .
It is interesting to compare its 1970 proposals with the current situation , 30 years later .
I have decorated it with footnotes commenting on the 1970 situation and making comparisons .
Some of the improvements advocated in the paper are still yet to come .
I claim quite a few prophet points for the article .
MATHEMATICAL PAPERS
2006 January : I seem to have forgotten to put links to my mathematical articles on this web page - even the ones I have in computer form .
Maybe I 'll get around to it .
AI PAPERS IN PROGRESS
The date given is when the paper was last revised .
Actually , all papers are in progress , since I sometimes improve published papers when I think of something new .
Most will not be submitted for formal publication , but they may be referenced .
The article will surely be changed before being submitted to a conference or a journal .
Comments are welcomed .
The 1996 The Well - Designed Child discusses the initial knowledge of the world that makes a baby more competent than a " Lockean baby " would be .
Slides from a 2007 Sept 27 lecture in Rome have been added .
I hope the new material is an improvement .
Partial Formalizations and the Lemmings Game 1994 Nov
Situation Calculus with Concurrent Events and Narrative - 1994
This article was intended to be superseded by Combining Narratives by McCarthy and Costello .
However , I have become attached to some of the constructions of the original article that were omitted from the new version .
Concepts of Logical AI has a paragraph each about each of approximately 50 concepts .
Phenomenal Data Mining concerns finding relations between data and phenomena and not just relations within the data .
There is n't much AI in the paper - yet , but the idea for phenomenal data mining has somewhat of a philosophical and AI origin .
Phenomenal Data Mining is a slightly updated version of the above that will appear in SIGKDD Explorations .
A further edited version will appear in CACM .
Elaboration Tolerance discusses making logical representations of facts that can accept various kinds of modifications easily - best by the addition of sentences .
- 1997 Sept 9 , updated 1997 Dec 14
FORMALIZATION OF STRIPS IN SITUATION CALCULUS is a 1985 note aimed at regarding STRIPS as a proof strategy for an interactive theorem prover using a situation calculus formalism .
It does n't quite get there .
NOTES ON SELF - AWARENESS is a preliminary report related to the 2004 April DARPA Workshop on self - awareness .

EDITORIAL PROJECTS
ADVOCACY contains references to pages advocating something or other .
ESSAYS contains essays about various topics written from time to time .
Some of them are supposed to be funny .
Electronic Archives
Here are some references to home pages of individuals and institutions concerned with AI .
I 'd be glad to have more references .
Here is a Emacs Lisp file of mathematical , physical and astronomical facts that I prepared for my own use which I am making available by request .
I have called it facts . txt , so that Netscape and competitors will treat it right .
Xemacs and FSF Emacs would prefer it renamed to facts.el ; then they will treat it right .
The emacs lisps are subsets of Common Lisp , so it can be loaded into Common Lisp and used there .
Here 's a puzzle expressing my attitude towards many human problems .
Look at THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA
This page has the permanent URL : http://purl.oclc.org/NET/jmc/ .
The theory is that if http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc has to be changed ( which is not planned ) then OCLC will redirect the reference to the new URL , assuming I have provided one .
On 1999 February 15 I was interviewed by Dorian Devins for a radio program called the Green Room .
The interview was broadcast live , and if you want to hear it , you can go to the Green Room site and look for Feb 15 , 1999 .
Small notes on various matters
A commentary on important events of the 20th century and expected events of the next was solicited by the San Jose Mercury and published on 1999 June 24 .
The above is a slightly expanded version .
Universality : or why there are separate sciences tells why a universal mechanism at one level of organization makes the details of lower levels irrelevant .
Thus universal computers make computer science independent of basic physics .
Some of my old files that I think have current interest are linked from oldnotes .
html .
I start on 2004 June 4 with one file on keyboards for arbitrary character sets .
