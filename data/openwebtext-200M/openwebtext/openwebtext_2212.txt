After Barack Obama met with Iraqi leaders here on Monday , the Iraqi government outlined a possible schedule for a U.S. troop withdrawal that is similar to the plan the Democratic presidential candidate has pledged to follow if he is elected .
Its announcement bolstered Obama ’s credibility on a key foreign policy issue , early in a weeklong trip to the Middle East and Europe that was designed to reassure voters concerned he lacks the experience to be commander in chief .
It also gave him a boost in his debate with Republican presidential candidate John McCain over how to end the war in Iraq .
McCain has repeatedly insisted that setting a firm withdrawal date ignores conditions on the ground and could prevent the U.S. from winning the war .
The renewed debate over troop withdrawals is one measure of how Obama ’s trip -- his second to Iraq and his first as a presidential candidate -- is reverberating at home and abroad .
Proposals by political candidates are usually given little weight , but the Iraqis appear to be taking seriously Obama ’s plan to remove most U.S. combat troops within 16 months of taking office .

An Iraqi government spokesman said Monday that if security continued to improve , the government hoped the troops could leave by the end of 2010 , about eight months later than Obama ’s target .
The spokesman , Ali Dabbagh , stopped short of endorsing Obama ’s specific proposal or suggesting a firm deadline for the troops ’ departure , but his remarks appeared to bolster Obama ’s stance , proving awkward for McCain and the Bush administration .
On this trip , Obama will also meet the leaders of Jordan , Israel , the Palestinian Authority , Germany , France and Britain .
Since his travels began this weekend , television images and photographs have shown him with U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki in Baghdad .
On Monday , the Illinois senator was photographed in a helicopter touring Baghdad with Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , the U.S. military commander in Iraq .
McCain in recent days has appeared with familiar Republican officials at home ; on Monday , the Arizona senator was seen on television riding in a golf cart with former President George H.W. Bush at Bush ’s oceanfront estate in Maine .
On Sunday , he attended a Yankees game with former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani , his onetime rival for the GOP nomination .
Obama is scheduled to speak to U.S. journalists today in Amman , Jordan , but has so far spent little time talking to the media .
In Baghdad on Monday , he did not stop to take questions from a gauntlet of Iraqi and Western journalists waiting at Maliki ’s compound .
He said without breaking stride that the meeting was “ constructive ” and that he would discuss it later .

In Washington , the Iraqi spokesman ’s statement seemed to startle officials .
The previous day , Dabbagh had tried to discredit an interview published in a German magazine in which Maliki seemed to endorse Obama ’s plan .
The new statement Monday suggested that the Iraqi government and Obama are not far apart in their views of how long a drawdown might take .
“ We cannot give any timetable other than that the Iraqi government believes that the end of 2010 is the appropriate time for the withdrawal of the forces , ” Dabbagh told reporters .
His statement came only days after Bush and Maliki announced on Friday that they would work on a “ general time horizon ” for withdrawing U.S. combat troops , a phrase that implies flexibility .

Officials in both countries have underlined that the U.S. can reduce its presence in Iraq only if security continues to improve .
“ They agreed -- the president and the prime minister and their negotiators -- that any decision should be based on conditions , should not be arbitrary , and it should not tie the hands of our commanders , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Monday .
McCain ’s campaign also said any withdrawal plan should be linked to conditions in Iraq .
He has said it would be “ reckless ” to pull U.S. troops from Iraq in the 16 - month time frame envisioned by his rival .

“ That ’s an artificial date , ” said McCain foreign policy advisor Randy Scheunemann on Monday , “ and it is completely ignorant of conditions on the ground and the effect that it would have both on our ability to withdraw as well as the ability to have sustainable security in Iraq in the aftermath . ”
McCain , speaking at the Bush home in Maine , criticized Obama for opposing the “ surge ” of 28,500 additional U.S. troops into Iraq last year .
“ The fact is , if we had done what Sen .
Obama wanted to do , we would have lost and we would have faced a wider war , and we would have had greater problems in Afghanistan .
. . .
He has been completely wrong on that issue , ” McCain said .
Obama wants to scale back the U.S. presence in Iraq and send two additional brigades to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan , which he visited for the first time over the weekend .

Dabbagh sidestepped questions about whether Iraqi officials discussed their proposed timeline for troop withdrawals with Obama .
Obama ’s delegation , which includes Sens. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb . ) and Jack Reed ( D - R.I. ) , was briefed Sunday by senior U.S. , British and Iraqi commanders in Baghdad and Basra .
The number of attacks nationwide has dropped to levels last seen in 2004 , according to military figures .
In a joint statement , the senators said : “ Iraqis want an aspirational timeline , with a clear date , for the redeployment of American combat forces .
Prime Minister Maliki told us that while the Iraqi people deeply appreciate the sacrifices of American soldiers , they do not want an open - ended presence of U.S. combat forces . ”

Maliki ’s government has become increasingly assertive about its ability to take charge of security after a string of successes against militants in major urban centers .
But many Iraqis worry that the country could slide back into more violence if U.S. - led forces are withdrawn too hastily .
Iraq ’s Sunni vice president , Tariq Hashimi , said he relayed those concerns when he met with the delegation Monday .
“ All Iraqis agree that the U.S. military should withdraw sooner or later but this should not . . . leave a security vacuum in Iraq , ” Hashimi told reporters after the meeting .
“ The readiness of the Iraqi security forces should be ensured prior to such an event . ”

Underlining the persistent threat , police said seven people were killed and eight others wounded Monday when a tractor rigged with explosives detonated as members of a U.S. - backed local guard force drove through a rural district of Diyala province .
Maliki is promising to send Iraqi reinforcements to the province .

A new type of solar panel that allows light to pass through it like a pane of glass has been invented by scientists who said that it is 10 times more powerful than conventional methods of producing energy from sunlight .
The discovery raises the prospect of using ordinary domestic windows to generate electricity with minimum structural alterations , although scientists have not yet worked out how much it would cost to convert a domestic home to a solar - powered generator .
Instead of coating the entire solar panel with solar cells - the expensive semiconductor devices that turn the energy of sunlight into electricity - the new solar panel works on the principle of concentrating the light , and the energy , at the edges of a pane of glass where it can be collected by the solar cells .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in Boston said that the “ solar concentrator ” is made from a film of organic molecules that can be coated on to glass window panes or other surfaces exposed to sunlight .
This allows light to pass straight through the window even though it is being used to generate power .
It also means that the expensive solar cells need only be placed around the edges of the collecting area , so that there is little need to track the movements of the Sun for generating maximum power , as well as reducing overall costs .
“ Light is gathered over a large area [ like a window ] and gathered , or concentrated , at the edges .
The cost of photovoltaic power can be reduced with organic solar concentrators , ” said Professor Marc Baldo , the leader of the research team at MIT .
Existing solar concentrators using in commercial solar generators have to track the movements of the Sun during the day to generate the highest optical intensities .
This often involves expensive mobile mirrors and are difficult to maintain , Professor Baldo said .
“ In addition , solar cells at the focal point of the mirrors must be cooled , and the entire assembly waste space around the perimeter to avoid shadowing neighbouring concentrators , ” he said .
The MIT solar concentrator involves a mixture of two or more dyes that are painted onto a pane of glass or plastic .
These dyes absorb light across a range of different wavelengths , which is then re-emitted at a different wavelength and transported across the pane to the waiting solar cells at the edges .
Jon Mapel , one of the MIT scientists who worked on the project , said that the trick was to improve the efficiency of the process , which ultimately leads to better performance and lower costs .
“ We made it so the light can travel a much longer distance .
We were able to substantially reduce light transport losses , resulting in a tenfold increase in the amount of power converted by the solar cells , ” Dr Mapel said .
Solar power is seen as one of the greenest sources of energy but it has been dogged by the relatively high costs of installing photovoltaic cells on houses and buildings , which can take years to pay off in terms of energy savings .
Their efficiency in low - light conditions is also a problem for countries such as Britain were sunlight is a rare commodity in the coldest months of winter .
Police in Alice Springs say they were appalled to find a driver put a seatbelt around a carton of beer - but left a five - year - old child unrestrained .
Officers stopped the unregistered sedan on the Ross Highway south of Alice Springs on the weekend .
They found the child sitting in the back seat without a seatbelt , but the driver had put a belt around a slab of beer .
" If human kind is going to extend its presence beyond earth , at some point we are very seriously going to have to consider : can we procreate on another world ? "
Dr Kring said .
" If a child is born on another planet , could that individual come back to earth and live in the one G environment .
Could they function ?
To expect that it is not going to be an issue is naïve . "
The U.S. military on Friday postponed a weekend ceremony to hand over responsibility for security in Anbar province to the Iraqi government , citing forecasts of bad weather .
Lt. Col. Chris Hughes , a military spokesman , said the decision was not connected to a suicide bombing Thursday at a community meeting in the Anbar town of Karmah that killed 25 people , including three U.S. Marines and two interpreters .
High winds and dust storms were expected today .
Hughes said the conditions would prevent U.S. and Iraqi officials from flying to the event .
The military provided no new date for the transfer but said it would take place soon .

Anbar , the vast province west of Baghdad that stretches to the borders of Syria , Jordan and Saudi Arabia , was long the center of the Sunni Arab - driven insurgency against U.S. forces and their Iraqi allies .
But the number of attacks has plummeted since late 2006 , when local tribal leaders rebelled against the militant groups among them , including Al Qaeda in Iraq .
The collaboration between U.S. forces and tribesmen became the model for the so - called Sons of Iraq program , which is credited with reducing violence in other Sunni - dominated parts of the country .
The U.S. program pays men about $ 10 a day to help protect their neighborhoods .
Anbar would be the 10th of Iraq ’s 18 provinces to return to Iraqi control and the first one that is predominantly Sunni Arab .
The others are mostly Shiite Muslim or dominated by ethnic Kurds .
Thursday ’s attack led some local officials to question whether the transfer of security responsibility was premature .
Some contended that the provincial police force should first be cleansed of insurgent collaborators .

The bomber , who blew himself up at a meeting of tribal sheiks and government officials , wore a police uniform .
U.S. officers said the attack appeared to be the work of Al Qaeda in Iraq , the Sunni militant group that dominated the province at the time of the tribal uprising .
A member of the cell believed to be responsible for the bombing was captured Friday , the military said .
In another development , police said Friday that a senior judge was killed Thursday in a drive - by shooting in east Baghdad .
Judge Kamil Shewaili , the head of one of Baghdad ’s two appeals courts , was driving home when he was attacked .

Apple beta testing iPhone 2.1 firmware , adding more GPS features
We just got word that Apple has released a beta version of iPhone OS 2.1 to developers .
Along with the 2.1 firmware , a new version of the iPhone SDK has been seeded as well , but the new SDK ca n’t be used for submitting applications to the App Store at the moment .
A few new things we are seeing in this version of the software is the addition of a bunch of Core Location features that track the direction you are heading , and the speed you are traveling .
Looks like we might see a turn - by - turn GPS app after all on the iPhone 3G .
by Sylvia Browne
Sylvia Browne answers some of the popular questions from SpiritNow.com readers .
I wonder sometimes about God .
What is he really like ?
God is simply perfect love and an ever - present force .
God always loves us .
God created us from good and He gave us free will .
Some religions have attempted to create God to have a vengeful , angry or even a vindictive personality .
But these religions have not done this out of cruelty ; they have done it as part of their ancient teaching philosophy .
Uneducated people can be managed by fear .
But thoughtful , educated people will want more information .
God does not have these negative human - like personality characteristics .
God is 100 % love at all times .
Is our astrology sign important ?
Yes it is !
We choose our sun sign , our rising sign and our moon sign and they are all important .
We choose everything just as we would like it to be .
My Spirit Guide Francine says that everything is charted out for us ahead of time , that we select what we would like to experience .
Do n't you know of people who were born a month " early or " late ? "
These people simply chose a different astrology sign for their charts .
How can I find love ?
Some people have fallen in love and have loved the wrong person .
I have done this myself , so I speak from experience .
Do not say that you wo n't love again ; simply stop loving the wrong people .
Do n't give your love to people that do n't love you back or do n't deserve it .
There is an old - fashioned saying that is very true , " Do n't cast your pearls before swine . "
Why do I feel that my relationship with my cat is so special ?
This is because you are experiencing a relationship with unconditional love .
Having unconditional love in your life is very special .
You will know unconditional love because you do n't have to " do " anything ; you simply have to " be . "
A relationship with a pet is one where you have that unconditional love .
It is the same with a relationship with a child .
Other people in your life can give this unconditional love , but know that this type of relationship can be very rare to have and should be treasured .
First I lose my car and now my job .
Why is God picking on me so much ?
Please understand that God does not select people to play Russian roulette with for any reason .
He also does not choose people to be ever - suffering and become constant martyrs .
Very often when something happens in our lives , it is our chart at work , the chart we created when we chose to incarnate .
You selected this specific chart to have life lessons and to learn from them .
Often when we have a tragedy , we can grow spiritually and emotionally from that experience .
Many times we can choose to help others who will face that same type of experience in their lives .
God is always good and never " picks on " people for any reason .
How can I make my life better ?
Even though we have a life chart that describes our major events , visualization and positive thinking are very helpful for your life .
Visualization and positive thinking help guide you how to get to where you are going .
They are both useful tools that you can use on a regular basis .
I think of bears all the time .
Does this mean something ?
You are most likely attracting to yourself your totem .
A totem ( or anima ) is an animal spirit that will be with us throughout our lifetime .
This animal spirit is one that connects in some way with our life theme .
The grizzly bear is the totem for those who have the life theme of the " warrior . "
Your bears are reminding you of your own warrior energy .
Totems protect us and give us positive energy whenever we need it .
My beloved dog died , is he okay ?
Will I meet him again on The Other Side ?
Absolutely you will .
Animals are very spiritual beings and are actually born perfect .
Pets actually come to earth simply to live their lives with us ; they have no need to learn life lessons as we do .
Your pet is already very accustomed to The Other Side , and astral traveled there at least four times a week while they slept .
They have known
The Other Side very well and you will certainly see them on The Other Side once more .
What can I do to help my child 's spiritual life ?
Helping your child develop spiritually is just as important as any other part of their life .
Teach them to pray every night and pray with them at night as they are young .
Surround them with the white light of the Holy Spirit every night .
This is a wonderful practice and they will feel God 's love for them .
I think something bad happened to me in a past life , and that it is affecting me now .
Does this happen sometimes to people ?
Every lifetime you have had will affect the lifetime you have right now .
Both the positive and the negative experiences you have had will affect your life .
You have had strong positive experiences that you remember on a very deep level , and you also have had strong negative experiences that you remember .
Becoming conscious of them and understanding what happened is a very healing way to release them if they are affecting your life in a negative way .
Sylvia Browne is without question , " America 's # 1 Psychic , " an internationally known psychic and medium .
The Pentagon not only told the world yesterday that it would keep on using cluster bombs – it called the controversial weapons life - savers , too .
The Defense Department unveiled its new policy on cluster munitions .
In it , the weapons , which scatter tiny bomblets over huge swaths of territory , are described as
" legitimate weapons with clear military utility . "
Not only do " they provide distinct advantages against a range of targets , " a Defense Department press release notes , but " their use reduces risks to U.S. forces and can save U.S. lives . "
The Pentagon says the munitions will continue to be used , " in a manner consistent with the law of armed conflict . "
But the law is changing .
In May , just about every country on the planet signed a treaty banning cluster bombs .
The U.S. was one of four holdouts .
The problem with the weapons , critics tell the * Los Angeles Times * , is that they " have a high failure rate .
Many bomblets may not explode on contact , and later can be accidentally triggered by civilians . "
The new policy is designed to reduce the danger of unexploded bomblets by mandating that bombs with a " dud rate " higher than 1 % will not be used after 2018 .
Until then , the use of a cluster bomb with a higher failure rate must be approved by regional commanders .
" For the U.S. to take another 10 years to eliminate the worst of the cluster munitions is completely inadequate from a humanitarian point of view , "
said Bonnie Docherty , an arms researcher with Human Rights Watch .
There are about 720 million of the bomblets , the * Times * observes .
" The
Pentagon adopted a policy in 2005 banning acquisition of cluster bombs with a dud rate higher than 1 % , but the inventory contains many munitions purchased before then . "
Air
Force Lt. Col. Almarah K. Belk , a Pentagon spokeswoman , said certain situations may require the use of cluster bombs , citing as an example the presence of militants on the roof of a building occupied by civilians .
A cluster bomb dropped on the roof could kill or injure the militants without destroying the building , she said .
*" It is not pretty ; nothing about war ever is , " Belk said .
*
Our own David Hambling , who has written extensively on these sorts of munitions , is n't buying it .
" This policy seems very reactive and defensive ; rather than taking a lead , it 's more like a rearguard action to hang on to what they have , " he writes in to say .
For an organization which normally rises to new challenges with impressive feats of technological development , the tone is oddly defeatist : where else do you hear munitions people saying " what we have is the best possible - no technological advance can replace than existing cluster munitions . "
Meanwhile , it 's worth looking at cluster bomb alternatives already being developed by industry - I 'm thinking reactive material options and munitions like miniature bombs like CLAWS .
My view : we can do better than this .

ALSO :
In a previous post I showed you how to pull down the latest source for IronRuby and get it built in Visual Studio .
Well , today I am going to look at how you would write and run programs using IronRuby .
I am trying out a new source syntax highlighter , since my old one does n’t support Ruby .
So if you are having problems with the source , then just view it on my site instead of an RSS reader .
Okay , so the first thing you are going to have to do now is kick Visual Studio to the curb .
Visual Studio rocks , but it has no support for Ruby .
So , go ahead and close it .
No seriously , just close it , I ’ll wait …
Okay , done ?
Good .
Now you are probably going to want an editor that has source highlighting for Ruby .
It just makes life a little easier , and who does n’t want that when learning a new language ?
I recommend grabbing Notepad ++ if you do n’t have a particular tool in mind .
It is a great editor and it has built in support for syntax highlighting .
Best of all , its free .
So , first off make sure that you did everything in the last post , including adding the location of ir .exe to your path .
This is important , otherwise you will have some problems .
Next we are going to just create a folder for our application :
Looks good to me .
HelloWorld is always my favorite application .
Inside of this we are going to create a HelloWorld.rb file :
Okay , now lets put some Ruby code in this guy .
All we want to do is write “ Hello World ” out to the console , so here it is :
puts " Hello World "
Pretty simple , huh ?
Now lets look at how we run this .
First , get your console to the folder where you created this file :
Then we just run this simple command :
And that is it !
You now have a working Ruby program .
So , you might be saying , okay so I have one file running .
What if I want to make some classes in several files and run them ?
Well , I ’m glad you asked !
First , lets create a HelloWorld class .
class HelloWorld def say_hello puts " Hello World " end end
There , now we have a class that will write out our “ Hello World ” message .
Being a C# guy , something is just very comforting about seeing the class there !
Now , lets create a second file called “ SayHello.rb ” that contains this :
require " HelloWorld " hello = HelloWorld.new hello.say_hello
What you are seeing here is the equivalent of an import statement , and it is actually looking in the same folder as our “ SayHello.rb ” file and will find “ HelloWorld.rb ” so that we can reference the HelloWorld class .
You can then see that we are creating a new instance of this class by calling the “ new ” method and then we call our “ say_hello ” method .
( In case you are wondering , it is general convention to name ruby methods all lowercase with underscores separating words )
Now that we have all of this setup , we can then run it from the command line :
As you can see , we only need to specify the one file , the other one is found automatically .
So , there you have it , you now have the most basic skills needed to start writing Ruby applications .
IronRuby is aimed at being a feature complete version of Ruby 1.8 , so you should be able to go out there and use just about any Ruby tutorial to start developing in IronRuby .
Over the next few days I am going to be experimenting with IronRuby and will try and post many of my findings up on the blog !
I hope you enjoyed it !
JULY 16 -- Comedian Andy Dick was arrested this morning by California cops on drug and sexual battery charges .
Dick , 42 , was nabbed around 2 AM in a Riverside County parking lot after he allegedly groped the breasts of a 17 - year - old girl and then pulled the teen 's tank top and bra down , exposing her breasts ( the incident occurred outside the Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant ) .
During a search of Dick , police discovered a small amount of marijuana in his pants pocket and a single Xanax pill for which he did not have a prescription .
An ' extremely intoxicated ' Dick was booked into the Southwest Detention Center , where bail was set at $ 5,000 .
In May 2004 , Dick was arrested on a pot possession charge while attending the Coachella music festival , also in Riverside County .

CBS : Iraqi government corruption funds insurgents who kill Americans David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The government of Iraq is facing many challenges to its ability to run the country , both internal and external .
According to a new report by 60 Minutes , " one of the biggest problems is corruption , which is robust even by Middle Eastern standards . "
" Bribery and outright theft are flourishing in virtually every Iraqi ministry , " notes CBS 's Steve Kroft , " and some of those ill - gotten gains are being used to kill American troops . "
State Department official James Mattil told CBS that the corruption is " across - the - board . "
Much of the stolen money finds its way to Iraqi insurgents or militias , while " in other cases , it is the militias and insurgents themselves who control some of the ministries who are involved in the corruption . "
" It 's known and tolerated by the prime minister and other officials within the government , " emphasized Mattil , who observed the corruption first - hand while assigned as an advisor to Iraq 's former Commissioner of Public Integrity , Judge Radhi al - Radhi .
Judge Radhi himself told CBS during an interview in 2006 that more than half a billion dollars had been stolen from the Iraqi defense ministry .
Following that interview , he attempted to widen his investigation to other ministries , but was met with death threats and the murder of thirty - one members of his staff .
In July 2007 a missile was fired at his house .
He and his family finally left Iraq last September and are now living in the suburbs of Washington , DC .
Shortly before Radhi left Iraq , his commission was coming under increasing pressure from Prime Minister Maliki , who issued a memo saying they could not bring charges against anyone in the president 's office or current or former ministers without his permission .
" It basically put a stop to any anti-corruption activities within the Iraqi government , " Mattil told CBS , " and it came directly from the prime minister 's office . "
Mattil shared this memo with his colleagues at the State Department but received no response .
A draft report on the corruption was leaked to the press last summer , but the State Department responded only by making the report classified .
After Radhi sought asylum in the United States , he was called to testify before the House Oversight Committee .
Chairman Henry Waxman then asked Secretary of State Rice to comment on Rhadi 's allegations .
" Mr. Chairman , I will have to get back to you , " Rice replied .
" I do n't know precisely what you are referring to . "
" Six months later , " CBS concludes , " Waxman 's staff was still waiting for an answer . "

Transcript via closed captions :: kroft : general david petraeus , the top u.s. commander in iraq , told congress this past week that there has been substantial progress , but not enough to begin withdrawing american troops .
there are questions about the readiness of the new iraqi army , and the competence of prime minister nouri al maliki's coalition government , which is fraught with ethnic and religious divisions .
electricity is still in short supply , medicines are available mainly through the black market , and there are long lines for fuel in a country that has the third largest oil reserves in the world .
one of the biggest problems is corruption , which is robust even by middle eastern standards .
and according to u.s. and iraqi officials , bribery and outright theft are flourishing in virtually every iraqi ministry , and some of those ill - gotten gains are being used to kill american troops .
our story begins 18 months ago , in the fall of 2006 , when we first reported that more than $ 1 billion from the previous iraqi defense ministry had been wasted , stolen , or misappropriated .
the money was supposed to supply the new iraqi army with desperately needed equipment to fight the growing insurgency .
but according to audits conducted by the iraqi government , and to judge radhi al radhi , iraq 's top anticorruption official , millions were misspent on old and antiquated equipment , and the rest simply disappeared .
how much of the $ 1.3 billion do you think was stolen ? :: radhi ( translated ) : more than half . :: kroft : more than half ? :: radhi : yes . :: kroft : half a billion dollars -- $ 600 million , $ 700 million ? :: radhi : yes . :: kroft : that 's got to be one of the largest thefts in history . :: radhi ( translated ) : as we hear from friends abroad , they have never heard of such corruption and embezzlement to such a degree . :: kroft : judge radhi , who had been imprisoned and tortured under saddam hussein , obtained arrest warrants for the former minister of defense and his top aides , all of whom fled the country .
as iraq 's commissioner of public integrity , radhi had one of the most dangerous jobs in the country .
he launched investigations against 20 current and former ministers , alienating the political establishment to the point that parliament tried to fire him .
he had 30 bodyguards , and received constant death threats .
lots of people would like to see you dead . :: radhi ( translated ) : i do n't care .
that 's their problem . :: kroft : you do n't care ? :: radhi : i do not care . :: kroft : that was in 2006 . :: radhi : hi. :: kroft : how are you , judge radhi .
nice to see you . :: radhi : how do you do ? :: kroft : today he 's living with his extended family in a small apartment with donated furniture in the suburbs of washington , d.c. the most public figure in iraq 's battle against corruption had finally been driven out of his job and his country , and is now a refugee seeking asylum in the united states . :: radhi ( translated ) : he was killed because he fought corruption . :: kroft : judge radhi showed us pictures of some of the 31 members of his staff who were murdered .
this one was killed with his pregnant wife .
the father of his security chief was found hanging on a meat hook . :: kroft : when we first interviewed you , i said , " look , there are all sorts of people that want you dead . " and you answered , " i do n't care . " :: radhi ( translated ) : but this threat is now against my family , too . :: kroft : what made you believe that your family was in danger ? :: radhi ( translated ) : at the end of july , a missile was fired at my home .
it fell about five meters away from my home .
it hit another house next to mine , and of course my family was terrified . :: james mattil : and it got to the point where his adversaries were left with few other options but to possibly remove him , period . :: kroft : james mattil was the chief of staff of the state department 's office of accountability and transparency in iraq , and it was his job to assist judge radhi in cleaning up corruption .
and mattil believes radhi did a good job , given the resources at his disposal and the scope of the problem , which was outlined in a draft report prepared by the state department .
according to the report , these are some of the ministries where corruption seemed to be rampant : the ministry of interior ; the ministry of defense ; ministry of trade ; ministry of health ; ministry of oil ; ministry of education ; ministry of water resources ; finance ; electricity ; labor and social affairs ; displacement and migration ; science and technology .
i mean , what ... what 's left ? :: mattil : i was going to ask you that .
okay ?
it 's pretty much across the board in every ministry . :: kroft : mattil says shortly after the unclassified report was leaked to the press last summer , the state department decided to make it classified .
based on what , for what reason ? :: mattil : the embarrassment factor , i would think . :: kroft : is there a security classification called " embarrassment " ? :: mattil : not to my knowledge .
:: kroft : but the state department 's decision to try and bury the report did n't change the facts in iraq .
in some cases , mattil says , the corruption involves outright theft of government funds , or bribery , with some of the money finding its way into the hands of insurgents or iraqi militias . :: mattil : in other cases , it is the militias and insurgents themselves who control some of the ministries , who are involved in the corruption and funding their activities , through these actions .
you said -- and maybe you misspoke , i do n't know -- that the militias and the insurgency were actually controlling some of the ministries . :: mattil : that 's correct . :: kroft : this is known and condoned by the prime minister , maliki ? :: mattil : it 's known and tolerated by the prime minister and other officials within the government . :: kroft : and they 're aware of the level of corruption ? :: mattil : yes , they would have to be . :: radhi : the point that must be clear is that that the american and the iraqi funds are now going to the militias .
and both iraqis and the americans are being killed with that , and this is the big problem . :: kroft : the situation got so bad , radhi says his investigators could n't even enter certain government buildings .
were your investigators allowed to go into the ministry of health ? :: radhi ( translated ) : they entered the ministry and they conducted their investigations .
but they were threatened to be kidnapped . :: kroft : so they stopped ? :: radhi ( translated ) : yes .
the same with the ministry of oil . :: kroft : these are ministries of the iraqi government . :: radhi ( translated ) : this is the reality . :: kroft : another reality is that there are few deterrents to corruption at the highest levels .
former defense minister hazem shaalan and his deputy ziad cattan were both convicted in absentia for their role in the ministry of defense scandal .
and both are now living comfortably abroad .
we interviewed cattan in paris nearly two years ago , and played him recordings in which he discussed what sounded like a payoff to someone described as a representative of the president and prime minister of the interim government . :: cattan ( translated ) : he wants to know . :: associate ( translated ) : he wants to know how much they are going to place in his account ? :: cattan ( translated ) : yes , of course . :: associate ( translated ) : how much ? :: cattan ( translated ) : $ 45 million . :: kroft : he wants to know how much money is going to be placed in his account , and you say $ 45 million ? :: cattan : yes .
but not dollar .
i do n't say dollar . :: kroft : and what was it ?
$ 45 million what ? :: cattan : i do n't remember . :: kroft : well , you 're going to give him 45 million of something .
:: cattan : yes .
but i do n't remember what the matter was .
:: kroft : warrants for the arrest of cattan and former defense minister shaalan have been sent to police agencies around the world , but there is not much chance of them being picked up and sent back to iraq .
and the same goes for former electricity minister aiham alsammarae , an american businessman who got himself tangled up in the hot wires of iraqi politics , and now faces prison time for mismanaging public funds .
al sammarae somehow managed to escape from custody , and made his way back to his home near chicago .
the only problem we had finding him a few months ago was getting past the snowdrifts .
i'm sitting here looking at a wanted poster from interpol for aiham alsammarae , born 1951 , baghdad .
height : 1.9 meter , 75 inches .
weight : 200 pounds .
this looks very much like you . :: alsammarae : well , it is me , but it is wrong because it is issued by iraqi government based on false information . :: kroft : you 're not expecting the u.s. marshals to come in here and arrest you some day and send you off to iraq to stand trial ? :: alsammarae : well , i will be so surprised if that happens in the states .
did i do anything wrong in united states ?
no. did i pay my taxes , every penny , every year ?
yes. :: kroft : well , you 're an international fugitive . :: alsammarae : the world is full of innocent victims .
i am innocent and i will prove it . :: kroft : but there are indications that alsammarae may have some problems here in the u.s. his name has surfaced in connection with the corruption trial of his old friend , chicago real estate developer tony rezko .
in a closed - door session , federal prosecutors reportedly accused rezko of bribing alsammarae in order to obtain an iraqi electricity contract .
alsammarae denies the charges , and says he 's doing everything possible to clear his name , short of going back to baghdad , where he says he will be killed , perhaps by iraqis who are only getting a few hours of electricity every day despite billions of dollars of investment from the u.s. and iraqi governments . :: radhi : hello ? :: kroft : in the months before he left iraq , judge radhi and his commission on public integrity began getting more and more interference from prime minster maliki . :: radhi ( translated ) : he wrote a memo saying we could not recommend pressing charges against anyone from the president 's office or from previous or current ministers .
who is corrupt in the ministries if it's not the ministers themselves ?
if we do n't recommend they be tried , then corruption will stay as it is . :: kroft : according to james mattil , judge radhi's former advisor at the state department , the memo prohibited investigatons of current or former high level iraqi officials without the permission of the prime minister himself . :: mattil : it basically put a stop to any anticorruption activities within the iraqi government .
and it came directly from the prime minister 's office . :: kroft : so the only way the prime minister could be investigated for corruption would be if he signed off on his own investigation ? :: mattil : correct . :: kroft : so he'd have to be corrupt and stupid ? :: mattil : yes .
you so you saw this memo ? :: mattil : yes . :: kroft : did you share it with your colleagues at the state department ? :: mattil : yes , immediately . :: kroft : what was the reaction of your superiors when you showed it to them ? :: mattil : none , that i am aware of . :: radhi : no one is above the law . :: kroft : but it did get some reaction in the u.s. congress when radhi , seeking asylum in the united states , was called to testify before the house oversight committee .
chairman henry waxman grilled secretary of state condoleezza rice about radhi's allegations . :: waxman : well , this is a big deal .
this is the prime minister of the country . :: rice : i agree with you .
it 's a big deal . :: waxman : it 's his country , his government , that we are propping up with the lives of our soldiers and the billions of dollars of our taxpayers ' money .
prime minister maliki has issued an order saying that he may not be investigated , nor may his minister be investigated , for corruption , which means they are immunized from the investigation .
are you aware of that order ?
and does it trouble you that such an order has been issued ? :: rice : well , mr. chairman , i will have to get back to you .
i do n't know precisely what you are referring to . :: kroft : six months later , waxman 's staff was still waiting for an answer .
but a state department official and a representative of the iraqi government told us corruption is not condoned , and fighting it remains a top priority .
after radhi left iraq , the prime minister went on tv and accused him of corruption .
did you bring a lot of money with you when you came from iraq ? :: radhi ( translated ) : nothing but my last salary . :: kroft : how are you getting by here ? :: radhi ( translated ) : actually , with the help of american friends . :: kroft : until radhi's asylum application is approved , he 's unable to work .
these days he is getting most of his news on iraq from television .
the maliki government said 2008 would be the year of fighting corruption .
you do n't think this is going to be the year of fighting corruption ? :: radhi ( translated ) : i think that this year will be more corrupt .
With many eyes in Israel already turned toward the American presidential election this November , questions over what and who is good for the Middle East are fast becoming hot topics .
Warming things up that much more , two academics who have cast a critical light on the nature of US - Israel ties came here Thursday as part of a larger Middle East tour , during which they called on America to end its " special relationship with Israel and treat it as a normal country . "
Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer , professors at Harvard University and the University of Chicago , respectively , published " The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy " last fall , raising a maelstrom of reactions : criticism from some corners and praise from others .
In pro-Israel circles , the book is viewed – along with former US President Carter 's " Peace Not Apartheid " book – as an attack on a pillar of American foreign policy .
Critics of Profs .
Walt and Mearsheimer say that the book and the arguments they make in it has anti-Semitic overtones and paints the pro-Israel lobby in the US as an all - powerful interest group doing damage to American and international interests .
But the two men , who were brought to Israel as guests of the left - wing group Gush Shalom ( Peace Bloc ) and later invited by colleagues to speak at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , said their words had often been misread and misinterpreted .
" Giving Israel unconditional support is not making America more popular around the world , and it is not making Americans more secure at home , " said Walt .
Israel 's role as a democracy is also not a strong enough reason for such strong political and financial backing , he said .
" There are a lot of other democracies around the world and none of them get this level of support , with no strings attached . "
He said that anyone who questions that relationship is " playing with fire " and risks " being smeared " as anti-Semitic .
" These policies have been misguided .
They 're not good for the US , have not been good for Israel , and are not good for the Middle East overall , " Walt said .
" But we said at least a dozen times in the book :
It 's not a cabal and it's not a conspiracy .
And we meant it . "
In the talk , Mearsheimer charged that Israel and the Israel lobby – which he said also included many Christian Zionists and Evangelicals , and therefore was not synonymous with being a " Jewish lobby " – was trying to push America into military action against Iran .
" There is only one country that is putting pressure on the US to attack Iran , and that is Israel , " Mearsheimer said .
" AIPAC is pushing hard for an attack on Iran , and no other lobby in America is , " he said , referring to the pro-Israeli lobby group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
That the two men were invited to speak at all was the subject of some controversy , with several Israeli professors questioning whether the invitation was appropriate .
The university did not widely advertise the lecture , which was held in a moderate - sized lecture hall unable to contain the number of students and faculty who had arrived .
But most seemed to agree that , especially at the school that is viewed as Israel 's leading university , diverse views should be aired .
" There is more criticism being heard here in Israel of the lobby , " says Moshe Fox , a doctoral student , referring to AIPAC , " and of the US - Israel relationship in general than there is in the US . "
Indeed , in recent weeks , Israeli politicians and pundits have been speaking more critically about the state of relations between the United States and the Jewish state .
Following President Bush 's visit here last month , some commentators worried aloud that the unconditional support he expressed for Israel during its 60th birthday celebrations was blurring the boundaries of Israel 's sovereignty and further diminishing Washington 's ability to claim a role as a " fair broker " in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict
Additional reservations about the US - Israel relationship have been voiced amid a deeply damaging scandal in which Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is alleged to have taken more than $ 150,000 in unaccounted - for cash from a US supporter , raising deeper questions about the influence of American donors on Israeli politicians .
The Israeli government , says Uri Avnery , the head of Gush Shalom , is content with having a very pro-Israel American administration .
Supporters of the peace camp , on the other hand , are hoping that November will bring a change in policy and are pinning their hopes on Democratic candidate Barack Obama .
Peace advocates were dismayed , he said , to hear Senator Obama 's comments to AIPAC last week .
" The first thing Barack Obama did after he secured the nomination was to go to AIPAC to make a speech which is scandalous as far as peace as concerned , " Mr. Avnery said .
" He said that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel and cannot be divided , but without this , there wo n't be peace with Palestinians .
" It shows us that without AIPAC , he feels he can't be elected , and that shows us how crucial AIPAC is . "
There are fears in Israel , Avnery adds , that a President Obama would rock the US - Israel relationship .
" The Israeli establishment is very cautious and they are very suspicious of Obama , " he adds .
" The Israeli government is quite satisfied with America as it is , and as far as they 're concerned , there can't be a better American for Israel than George Bush .
We would like American policy to be more even - handed so it will play a role in making peace . "
Robert Wistrich , a historian at the Hebrew University who runs the school 's center for the study of anti-Semitism , says Walt and Mearsheimer 's arguments pander to old - fashioned stereotypes – ones that wo n't help Israel make moves toward peace .
" Whichever way you turn it around , they 're saying that if only there was n't so much Jewish or Israeli power , everything would be fine in the Middle East , which we know is n't true , " Professor Wistrich says .
Israelis , he adds , still can't figure out where Obama stands .
" I do n't think Jews or Israelis want to go out on a limb and prejudge a man who might be president , " he says .
" The main worry here is more along the lines of appeasement , such as what he 's said about meeting Iranian leaders , and we know where that 's led so far . "

When a high - ranking U.S. senator sounds more like Karl Marx than Adam Smith over the issue of energy prices , it must be an election year .
Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd , the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , appeared on CNBC ’s June 10 “ Squawk Box ” pushing government control of corporate profits .
Dodd said he considered a company to be “ doing very , very well ” with profits above $ 8 or $ 10 per barrel of oil .
He said he advocated a windfall profits tax , where Congress would determine what amount of profit is fair and what is n’t .
CNBC's Joe Kernan called the Connecticut senator on the idea , asking if he was going to apply the same strategy to other types of businesses .
“ Are you going to go across industries , across the board and decide what Congress thinks is a fair amount of profit and drawing lines on what ’s fair and what ’s not for corporations ?
That ’s not the way it ’s done in this country , senator .
It could never be done that way , could it ? ”
“ Yes , it could be , ” Dodd said .
“ In fact it ’s been done that way in the past and particularly when you ’re trying to get some relief for people out here when the economy is in a tailspin .
We ’re about to go into a recession here .
This is really causing a tremendous dislocation , not only here , but around the world . ”
MP : If Senator Dodd is concerned about industries making " windfall profits , " he might want to start by investigating the 57 industries with profit margins HIGHER than the oil industry ( see list above , click to enlarge , profit margin data available here ) .
You probably know how it goes .
You 've just had lunch and you 're back at your desk .
3 pm rolls around and home time is still some way off .
Then the yawns start and all you can think about is curling up under your desk for a sleep .
It 's a fairly normal response , and the subject of an abstract at Sleep 2008 , the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies .
A group of scientists from Loughborough University in the UK presented their work on daytime sleepiness , and whether the best way to combat it was to get up later in the morning , caffeine , or a 20 - minute afternoon nap .
The study involved 20 healthy adult volunteers , who all averaged around 7.4 hours sleep a night .
They then compared how the volunteers performed to multiple sleep latency testing — how long it took them to fall asleep for a nap at various intervals — in one of four states ; their normal amount of sleep , after having an extra 90 minutes in bed in the morning , after taking 150 mg of caffeine at 2 pm , or after taking a 20 - minute nap at 2:30 pm .
Compared to getting an average night 's sleep , all three of the conditions extended the amount of time it took the subjects to fall asleep during the sleep tests , but the 20 - minute afternoon nap proved the most effective at combating sleepiness later in the day ; although a long lie - in in the morning and the caffeine also reduced afternoon sleepiness , they did so less effectively than the 20 - minute nap .
So , there you have it .
Afternoon tiredness is best combated by a quick nap .
Of course , for those of us who are n't lucky enough to work at home , have a very understanding boss , or live in Spain , two cups of coffee might be a better idea ...

Each time you take a measurement with Jiffy , the measurements are recorded in the DOM under a single JSON object .
This firefox extension simply grabs the values when its panel is opened in firebug , a page with metrics is loaded or the Refresh button is hit .
The extension provides the following features :
Graphical view of Javascript measurements .
Two types of rows are displayed .
The first is a summary row for each measurment category .
These are created in Jiffy by calling Jiffy.mark ( markName ) .
Individual events within a mark category are captured with Jiffy. measure ( eventName , markName ) .
These are displayed as subrows .

The first is a summary row for each measurment category .
These are created in Jiffy by calling Jiffy.mark ( markName ) .
Individual events within a mark category are captured with Jiffy. measure ( eventName , markName ) .
These are displayed as subrows .
Clear .
Measurements can be cleared from the DOM and the graph reset .
This is useful for taking measurements that might happen after the onload during user interaction with the page .
Measurements can be cleared from the DOM and the graph reset .
This is useful for taking measurements that might happen after the onload during user interaction with the page .
Refresh .
If more measurements are collected after the onload , Refresh will generate a new graph based on the current measurements .
If more measurements are collected after the onload , Refresh will generate a new graph based on the current measurements .
Print .
Opens a new window with a printable version of the graph .
The Extension has been tested on the following Firefox versions :
Firefox 2.0.0 .*
Firefox 3.0 .*
The Extension works with the following Firefox / Firebug combinations ( it may work on other versions , but these are officially supported ) :
Firebug 1.0.5 for Firefox 2
Firebug 1.2.0b6 for Firefox 3 ( Latest Firebug version )
The extension has four command buttons : Clear , Refresh , Duration and Print .
Clear
Pressing the clear button will clear the stats from the page and render a blank panel .
This is a destructive operation as it calls the clearMeasures method ( see Configuration section below ) .
Refresh
Forces the graph to render the current measures available on the page .
This is useful if some measures are captured on user events .
After triggering these measured events , press the Refresh button to see a new graph including the new measures .
This calls the getMeasures method ( see Configuration section below ) .
Duration
This toggles rendering the measures as a list of elapsed times vs. rendering the measures as elapsed and duration times along a timeline .
When the Duration button is off , marks are rendered in a vertical list fashion .
Each event measurement is plotted relative to the mark .
In duration mode the both elapsed and duration times are represented for each mark .
When the Duration button is on , marks and events are rendered along a timeline .
Each mark displays both elapsed and duration times .
Each mark bar graph renders the elapsed time plus the " dead " time giving a total picture of duration .
Print
Displays the current stats as a list of elapsed time measurements in a separate window formatted for printing .
This is a firebug extension .
You will need Firebug installed .
The steps to getting setup are :
If installed correctly , the test page should look something like this .
By default , the Jiffy extension gets measurements from the web page by calling window .
Jiffy.getMeasures ( ) and clears measurements by calling window.Jiffy.clearMeasures ( ) .
It also tests whether a page has metrics by looking for the presence of the window .
Jiffy object .
These three points of interaction with Jiffy are defined in Firefox configuration properties .
The three properties and the default values are :
Property Default Value Description extensions.jiffy.clearMeasures Jiffy.clearMeasures ( )
A valid Javascript code fragment that when appended to ' window . ' will clear the measurements for the page .
extensions.jiffy.getMeasures Jiffy.getMeasures ( )
A valid Javascript code fragment that when appended to ' window . ' will return the measurements for the page .
The details of the Java array returned is discussed below .
extensions.jiffy.scopeObject
Jiffy
A valid Javascript variable that when appended to ' window . ' will denote ( by it being defined and non-null ) that measurements exist on the page .
Array returned by getMeasures ( )
The getMeasures ( ) call should return an array of Java objects , each containing the following fields
Field Description et Elapsed time for this measurement .
evt
The event measured ( in Jiffy this is recorded with the Jiffy. measure ( ) method ) .
name
The name of the category that holds a set of events .
In Jiffy this is called a ' mark ' .
A mark is created by calling Jiffy.mark ( markName ) .
Each call to Jiffy. measure ( evt , mark ) associates an event with a mark .
Here is an example of the array returned by Jiffy.getMeasures ( ) .
var measures = [ {et :2676 , evt : " load " , name : " PageStart " , rt:1213159816044} , {et:7 , evt :" carouselcreated " , name : " onLoad " , rt:1213159818722} , {et:67 , evt :" finishedonLoad " , name : " onLoad " , rt:1213159818729} ] ;
If you set the three extensions .
jiffy .* configuration parameters ( use about : config to access them ) , return an array as described above , clear the measures and supply the name of the object holding your values or methods , then the Jiffy extension can work with your Javascript measurements .
Jiffy Extension will render it like this :
What the Jiffy extension will graph with the mock data above .
Frequently asked questions will be added here .

Newman , like the rest of us , has to come to terms with the politicking and warfare of the previous century .
He decides to step outside of the mainstream narrative propagated by our educational system and " news media , " and in the process he frames the petroleum industry as responsible for all of this death and sadness .
Newman 's work as a stand - up comic allows him to show off his considerable talents as an impersonator and a humorist .
Enjoy !
Islam enjoys a large and influential ally among the non —Muslims : A new generation of ' Useful Idiots , ' the sort of people Lenin identified living in liberal democracies who furthered the work of communism .
This new generation of Useful Idiots also lives in liberal democracies , but serves the cause of Islamofascism — another virulent form of totalitarian ideology .
Useful Idiots are na�ve , foolish , ignorant of facts , unrealistically idealistic , dreamers , willfully in denial or deceptive .
They hail from the ranks of the chronically unhappy , the anarchists , the aspiring revolutionaries , the neurotics who are at war with life , the disaffected alienated from government , corporations , and just about any and all institutions of society .
The Useful Idiot can be a billionaire , a movie star , an academe of renown , a politician , or from any other segment of the population .
Arguably , the most dangerous variant of the Useful Idiot is the ' Politically Correct . '
He is the master practitioner of euphemism , hedging , doubletalk , and outright deception .
The Useful Idiot derives satisfaction from being anti—establishment .
He finds perverse gratification in aiding the forces that aim to dismantle an existing order , whatever it may be : an order he neither approves of nor he feels he belongs to .
The Useful Idiot is conflicted and dishonest .
He fails to look inside himself and discover the causes of his own problems and unhappiness while he readily enlists himself in causes that validate his distorted perception .
Understandably , it is easier to blame others and the outside world than to examine oneself with an eye to self — discovery and self — improvement .
Furthermore , criticizing and complaining — liberal practices of the Useful Idiot — require little talent and energy .
The Useful Idiot is a great armchair philosopher and ' Monday Morning Quarterback . '
The Useful Idiot is not the same as a person who honestly has a different point of view .
A society without honest and open differences of views is a dead society .
Critical , different and fresh ideas are the life blood of a living society — the very anathema of autocracies where the official position is sacrosanct .
Even a ' normal ' person spends a great deal more energy aiming to fix things out there than working to overcome his own flaws and shortcomings , or contribute positively to the larger society .
People do n't like to take stock of what they are doing or not doing that is responsible for the conditions they disapprove .
But the Useful Idiot takes things much farther .
The Useful Idiot , among other things , is a master practitioner of scapegoating .
He assigns blame to others while absolving himself of responsibility , has a long handy list of candidates for blaming anything and everything , and by living a distorted life , he contributes to the ills of society .
The Useful Idiot may even engage in willful misinformation and deception when it suits him .
Terms such as ' Political Islam , ' or ' Radical Islam , ' for instance , are contributions of the Useful Idiot .
These terms do not even exist in the native parlance of Islam , simply because they are redundant .
Islam , by its very nature and according to its charter — the Quran — is a radical political movement .
It is the Useful Idiot who sanitizes Islam and misguides the populace by saying that the ' real Islam ' constitutes the main body of the religion ; and , that this main body is non—political and moderate .
Regrettably , a large segment of the population goes along with these nonsensical euphemisms depicting Islam because it prefers to believe them .
It is less threatening to believe that only a hijacked small segment of Islam is radical or politically driven and that the main body of Islam is indeed moderate and non—political .
But Islam is political to the core .
In Islam the mosque and state are one and the same — the mosque is the state .
This arrangement goes back to the days of Muhammad himself .
Islam is also radical in the extreme .
Even the ' moderate ' Islam is radical in its beliefs as well as its deeds .
Muslims believe that all non —Muslims , bar none , are hellfire bound and well — deserve being maltreated compared to believers .
No radical barbaric act of depravity is unthinkable for Muslims in dealing with others .
They have destroyed precious statues of Buddha , leveled sacred monuments of other religions , and bulldozed the cemeteries of non —Muslims — a few examples of their utter extreme contempt toward others .
Muslims are radical even in their intrafaith dealings .
Various sects and sub—sects pronounce other sects and sub—sects as heretics worthy of death ; women are treated as chattel , deprived of many rights ; hands are chopped for stealing even a loaf of bread ; sexual violation is punished by stoning , and much much more .
These are standard day — to — day ways of the mainstream ' moderate '
Muslims living under the stone — age laws of Sharia .
The ' moderate ' mainstream of Islam has been outright genocidal from inception .
Their own historians record that Ali , the first imam of the Shiite and the son — in — law of Muhammad , with the help of another man , beheaded 700 Jewish men in the presence of the Prophet himself .
The Prophet of Allah and his disciples took the murdered men's women and children in slavery .
Muslims have been , and continue to be , the most vicious and shameless practitioners of slavery .
The slave trade , even today , is a thriving business in some Islamic lands where wealthy , perverted sheikhs purchase children of the poor from traffickers for their sadistic gratification .
Muslims are taught deception and lying in the Quran itself — something that Muhammad practiced during his life whenever he found it expedient .
Successive Islamic rulers and leaders have done the same .
Khomeini , the founder of the 1979 Iranian Revolution , for instance , rallied the people under the banner of democracy .
All along his support for democracy was not a commitment of an honest man , but a ruse .
As soon as he gathered the reins of power , Khomeini went after the Useful Idiots of his time with vengeance .
These best children of Iran , having been thoroughly deceived and used by the crafty phony populist — religionist , had to flee the country to avoid the fate of tens of thousands who were imprisoned or executed by the double — crossing imam .
Almost three decades after the tragic Islamic Revolution of 1979 , the suffocating rule of Islam casts its death — bearing pal over Iranians .
A proud people with enviable heritage is being systematically purged of its sense of identity and forced to think and behave like the barbaric and intolerant Muslims .
Iranians who had always treated women with equality , for instance , have seen them reduced by the stone — age clergy to sub — human status of Islamic teaching .
Any attempt by the women of Iran to counter the misogynist rule of Muhammad 's mullahs is mercilessly suppressed .
Women are beaten , imprisoned , raped and killed just as men are slaughtered without due process or mercy .
The lesson is clear .
Beware of the Useful Idiots who live in liberal democracies .
Knowingly or unknowingly , they serve as the greatest volunteer and effective soldiers of Islam .
They pave the way for the advancement of Islam and they will assuredly be among the very first victims of Islam as soon as it assumes power .

Applied mathematician Graeme Milton dreams up new materials , develops mathematical formulas to describe them and leaves it to others to construct and demonstrate their novelties and usefulness in a laboratory .
While many of his theoretical musings are published in peer - reviewed journals , his research on a superlens with the ability to hide or “ cloak ” an object is too similar to cloaking devices portrayed in Star Trek and Harry Potter to stay buried in the annals of academia .
The concept of a superlens came originally from Sir John Pendry in 2000 — although Milton and his colleagues Nicolae Nicorovici and Ross McPhedran conducted closely related studies back in 1994 — and the concept has been studied extensively .
Yet no one had realized the cloaking properties until they were discovered through the research by Milton ’s team .
The concept of a superlens cloak is a long way from a workable device , but the integrity of the mathematical concept has sent some experimentalists into the laboratory to try and turn the theory into reality .
So far , the groups working in this area are not ready to publish papers , but they ’ve accomplished enough to keep trying .
“ We ’re along way off from the Star Trek device but some of the experimental results achieved so far are surprising and exciting , ” Milton noted .
Milton pursues his research at the University of Utah where the math department has some of the best scientists in the nation for studying the mathematics of new materials .
While colleagues consider Milton among “ the best in the world ” with the mathematics of materials , he was not always so highly ranked .
In fact , Milton , who was born in Sydney , Australia , came close to failing his sophomore year at Sydney University because he spent so much time reading about advanced subjects such as quantum mechanics and general relativity he failed to attend his regular classes , and eventually dropped out of school to spend a year hitchhiking through New Zealand .
He later returned to the university to buckle down and earn his bachelor ’s and master ’s degrees in physics , followed by a doctorate in physics at Cornell University .
His love of the outdoors led him to accept the job in Utah – he does some of his best thinking while skiing , mountain biking , swimming and road biking .
The superlens theorized by Milton and Nicorovici cloaks a nearby object by making light behave in an unusual way .
Instead of having a positive refractive index that makes light bend in the same way as it does when passing from air into a medium like glass or water , the superlens has a negative refractive index that in essence causes light to reverse and travel backwards .
When an object is placed next to the superlens , the light bouncing off the object is canceled out by the light reflecting off the superlens , rendering the object invisible .
Milton said the phenomenon , theorized by Milton and Nicorovici and confirmed by computer , is somewhat analogous to the noise cancellation headphones passengers wear on airplanes .
“ At this point , experiments would be considered successful if they worked with a single frequency of light and cloaked a few specks of dust , and the object cloaked would need to be much smaller than the superlens , ” said Milton .
In spite of the challenge , a group of scientists is currently working to demonstrate the proof of principle .
“ They ’ve made some progress , but they want to do some more work before they put their results in a paper , ” he added .
Potential early uses for a cloaking device are varied .
While stealth military devices are an obvious option , one approach is in medicine where the concept would allow certain electronic instruments to be used despite the presence of strong electromagnetic fields , such as those produced by hospital brain scanners .
Milton and other researchers have also carried out related work that might prove capable of guiding the elastic shock waves of earthquakes around buildings .
While practical applications are fun to speculate about , mathematicians may appreciate the new math presented by the concept just as much .
“ The findings will lead to a better understanding of partial differential equations , which will lead to a better understanding the propagation of sound , light , fluid and turbulence , ” Milton said .
The new math will also help scientists better understand the new field of metamaterials – a family of new materials with properties not seen in naturally occurring materials .
“ Existing laws do n’t adequately describe materials with exotic microstructures that are associated with some metamaterials . ”
Devising new materials is how Milton and his colleagues came across the superlens in the first place .
A metamaterial ’s properties are dictated by its internal structure rather than by its composition .
His job requires him to discover or design new geometric structures and then develop mathematical formulas to prove their properties .
He was working in his home country of Australia on a composite material composed of arrays of coated cylinders when he realized the cylinders could focus light in an unconventional way .
That discovery eventually led to his mathematical model for the superlens cloak .

The Newmindspace pillow fight went down in a sea of feathers on Saturday evening in Nathan Phillips Square .

It looks as if the West has won .
San Francisco is the fittest big city in the USA , just slightly more fit than Seattle , according to a scientific analysis of 16 cities released today by the American College of Sports Medicine at its annual meeting in Indianapolis .
But not all of the West is in top shape .
Los Angeles is near the bottom of the list .
To rank big metropolitan areas , health and fitness experts analyzed government data from the 15 most populous cities in the country and Indianapolis , where the sports - medicine group is headquartered .
They took into consideration a number of health indicators , including the percentage of people who exercise regularly , maintain a healthy weight , eat the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables , have access to health care , have health insurance and do n't smoke .
They also looked at the environment , including the availability of parks , walking / bike trails and public transportation .
This new analysis , called the American Fitness Index , is different from the rankings of fittest and fattest cities released annually by Men 's Fitness , although some of the targeted health indicators are similar .
For example , the magazine 's editors examine such factors as time spent working out , average commuting time , the number of parks and time spent watching TV .
Government statistics show that about 66 % of adults are overweight or obese , which increases their risk of type 2 diabetes , heart disease and some types of cancer .
New data out Wednesday show that 32 % of children and teens in the USA weigh too much .
" This epidemic of obesity is catching up with us , and one way we can combat it is to provide an environment where kids and families can exercise , " says Walt Thompson , chairman of the panel that created the new index and a professor of exercise physiology at Georgia State University in Atlanta .
His city came in No. 5 , but he'd like to help Atlanta move up the list .
" We 're targeting cities because that 's where most people live , and they typically do n't have the kind of environment that supports exercise , as opposed to somebody who lives out the country , where there is plenty of open space , " he says .
" Our hope is the cities on the bottom of the list will try to replicate some of the things that cities on the top of the list are doing . "
Many cities already have initiatives to encourage more physical activity , but others need to be doing more , says Barbara Ainsworth , professor in the department of exercise and wellness at Arizona State University - Mesa .
" Cities can take this information and use it to improve the quality of life for their residents . "
The sports - medicine group 's physical activity guidelines recommend that adult Americans , ages 18 to 65 , do moderate - intensity aerobic activity ( walking , dancing , biking ) for at least 30 minutes five days each week and strength training at least twice a week for all their major muscle groups , including the chest , back , shoulders , upper legs , lower legs and arms .
This could be strength training with free weights or machines or weight - bearing calisthenics such as pushups .
It should be done on two non-consecutive days .
The aerobic activities should be done in at least 10 - minute bouts , the group recommends .
Short spurts of low - intensity movement — shopping , taking out the trash or walking a few minutes in the office or parking lot — do n't count .
More information on the fit-city rankings is available at americanfitnessindex.org .
A version of this list appears in the October 4 , 2020 issue of The New York Times Book Review .
Rankings on weekly lists reflect sales for the week ending September 19 , 2020 .
Lists are published early online .

" No one knows when that day or hour will come .
Even the angels in heaven and the Son do n't know .
Only the Father knows . "
( Matthew 24:36 )
" For this we say to you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep .
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of an archangel , and with the trumpet of God .
And the dead in Christ will rise first .
Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air .
And thus we shall always be with the Lord . "

Have you ever thought about what will happen to your pets after Jesus comes back to claim the souls of the saved during the Rapture and deliver them to heaven to enjoy ever lasting life ?
The bible clearly teaches that only those that have accepted Jesus as their savior will enter heaven ( John 14:6 , Romans 3:23 ) , and we all know that pets do not have the cognitive ability to do this , so what will happen to your beloved pets ?
Surely without you there , they would be stuck inside your empty house , starving to death with no one to feed them , let them out to potty , or clean their litter box .
This is probably not what you envision for your pets after you are gone .
This is where I come in .
I am here to offer you pet care service for after the rapture .
As an atheist , I will surely still be here on this earth post rapture and would love to look after your pets for a small fee and make sure they are still well taken care of after you and your family have been raptured .
You will be able to look down on them from heaven and see them being well cared for by me and living happy , healthy lives .
Do not let my atheism scare you !
I am a moral and loving pet owner and would never do harm to any animal .
For a small deposit of only $ 50 , you can be assured that your pets will be well cared for from the time that you are raptured until the end of their natural life .
They will get adequate amounts of food , water , and shelter as well as plenty of exercise and socialization as I would imagine there will be a lot of pets that will be abandoned by Jesus the pet hater that will need to be cared for .
If interested , please email me for my PayPal address ( you can also send me a check if you prefer ) so you can assure that your pets will be taken care of after Jesus comes to take your soul to heaven .
$ 50 is only a small price to pay to know that while you are enjoying everlasting bliss , your pets will be cared for until their end days .
Thanks and have a great day !

Megan
Fox is the sexiest woman alive .
Last year she was n't sexy at all .
In 2007 , the 21 - year - old starlet did n't even make the top 100 in FHM 's annual ranking of the world 's women .
In 2008 , she 's number one .
The obvious reason for her sudden rise up the charts is the popularity of Transformers and its key scene in which she appears in a short skirt bent over a 1976 Camaro .
But she could n't have entered the list at all if she had n't made the wise career decision to change her last name from " Foxx " to " Fox . "
One more x and she 's a porn star ; one less and she 's an object of aspiration – perfect for FHM .
For Him Magazine , and the other lad mags like Maxim and Umm , occupy a strange , liminal place in the territory of contemporary male desire .
They exist to allow men to look at women 's bodies sexually but not pornographically .
With the emphasis on suggestion rather than revelation , the women in their pages are slick materialistic ideals , as current in their smooth plastic forms as the Prius or iPhone .
The downside to such manufactured people is that they 're all the same .
If you were mugged by any one of the women in the top 10 , you could n't pick the perpetrator out of a lineup .
They 're all white .
They all have long hair and they 're almost all blonde .
They all have the same high cheekbones .
They all have the same nose .
Each woman is allowed exactly one deviation from the norm , and the deviation is immediately remarked on – her tattoos or her extra - dark eye makeup or her curves .
The girls of FHM are obviously products of a fundamentally icky consumerist objectification , but their engineered homogeneity also reveals an incredibly limited imagination .
In some ways , it 's a surprising development .
If the lad mag is the latest chapter in the long , toxic and ancient book called " Men Staring at Women , " it 's very different than anything that 's come before .
The nude throughout the history of art offered a social expression for forbidden sensuality , which is why the women , sprawled on exotic beds or on picnic lawns , emerging from the bath or from the sea foam , are always sexually available .
In FHM , the women are totally unattainable – " too good for you , buddy " – and their way of dressing , in the context of a world in which seemingly every celebrity has a home sex video on the market , is comparatively modest .
The subjects of nudes were womanly – whether the plump nymphs cavorting in pastoral scenes of Rubens or the cubistic chest - thrusting models in Picasso's Demoiselles D'Avignon .
Their womanliness reminded male audiences of their manliness .
The women in FHM 's top 100 are almost all rail thin , with whittled down bodies and faces .
Every year there is less and less to them .
Naomi Wolf in The Beauty Myth complained that women in the media were " mock -ups of living mannequins , made to contort and grimace , immobilized and uncomfortable under hot lights , professional set - pieces that reveal little about female sexuality . "
She was right and she 's still right .
But the women in FHM are an equally false representation of male desire .
FHM is not a men's magazine like GQ or Esquire .
It 's a magazine for lads – for 15 - year - olds .
It serves adolescent boys with the fantasy that there is something or someone out there who is the " sexiest , " a comforting norm of male desire which does not exist and has never existed .
If only it were so simple .
Men ( as opposed to boys ) know that male desire does n't fit any pattern ; it changes unpredictably , sometimes over years , sometimes over an afternoon .
Male desire is particular – some men like women in tutus , others like women who are morbidly obese .
Who can say what men are attracted to ?
It could be the second joint of the middle toe , or green eyes , or a certain ineffable way of walking .
Shakespeare found the world 's sexiest woman in Cleopatra , but her sexiness was a shifting bizarre mass of contradictions and complications : " She makes hungry where most she satisfies ; for vilest things become themselves in her . "
The appeal of FHM's list of sexy women is n't the women so much as the list :
It imposes order on what is inherently chaotic .
It 's a false order of course , but the lads reading FHM can pretend for a while .
How this ranking of the parade of gleaming pneumatic women will affect young men is n't clear .
Will it terminally limit their budding libidos or only provide a kind of temporary simple - minded refuge from the gathering deluge of sexual complications they 're about to face ?
As with everything when it comes to male desire , nobody knows .
The great Victorian art critic John Ruskin , a man who spent half his life among pictures and sculptures of naked women , was nonetheless shocked to discover on his wedding night that his bride Effie had pubic hair .
On coming into contact with a real woman , the poor man actually went into spasms .
We can only hope there 's a better fate for the lads whose first image of womanhood is Megan Fox with one x .
Stephen Marche is the author , most recently , of Shining at the Bottom of the Sea .
Richard Dawkins
Creation �scientists � have more need than most of us to parade their degrees and qualifications , but it pays to look closely at the institutions that awarded them and the subjects in which they were taken .
Those vaunted Ph.D.s tend to be in subjects such as marine engineering or gas kinetics rather than in relevant disciplines like zoology or geology .
And often they are earned not at real universities , but at little - known Bible colleges deep in Bush country .
There are , however , a few shining exceptions .
Kurt
Wise now makes his living at Bryan College ( motto � Christ Above All� ) located in Dayton , Tennessee , home of the famed Scopes trial .
And yet , he originally obtained an authentic degree in geophysics from the University of Chicago , followed by a Ph.D. in geology from Harvard , no less , where he studied under ( the name is milked for all it is worth in creationist propaganda ) Stephen Jay Gould .
Kurt Wise is a contributor to In Six Days : Why 50 Scientists Choose to Believe in Creation , a compendium edited by John F. Ashton ( Ph.D. , of course ) .
I recommend this book .
It is a revelation .
I would not have believed such wishful thinking and self - deception possible .
At least some of the authors seem to be sincere , and they don�t water down their beliefs .
Much of their fire is aimed at weaker brethren who think God works through evolution , or who clutch at the feeble hope that one �day� in Genesis might mean not twenty - four hours but a hundred million years .
These are hard - core �young earth creationists � who believe that the universe and all of life came into existence within one week , less than 10,000 years ago .
And Wise�flying valiantly in the face of reason , evidence , and education �is among them .
If there were a prize for Virtuoso Believing ( it is surely only a matter of time before the Templeton Foundation awards one ) Kurt Wise , B.A. ( Chicago ) , Ph.D. ( Harvard ) , would have to be a prime candidate .
Wise stands out among young earth creationists not only for his impeccable education , but because he displays a modicum of scientific honesty and integrity .
I have seen a published letter in which he comments on alleged �human bones� in Carboniferous coal deposits .
If authenticated as human , these �bones� would blow the theory of evolution out of the water ( incidentally giving lie to the canard that evolution is unfalsifiable and therefore unscientific : J. B. S. Haldane , asked by an overzealous Popperian what empirical finding might falsify evolution , famously growled , � Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian ! � ) .
Most creationists would not go out of their way to debunk a promising story of human remains in the Pennsylvanian Coal Measures .
Yet Wise patiently and seriously examined the specimens as a trained paleontologist , and concluded unequivocally that they were �inorganically precipitated iron siderite nodules and not fossil material at all .�
Unusually among the motley denizens of the �big tent� of creationism and intelligent design , he seems to accept that God needs no help from false witness .
All the more interesting , then , to read his personal testimony in In Six Days .
It is actually quite moving , in a pathetic kind of way .
He begins with his childhood ambition .
Where other boys wanted to be astronauts or firemen , the young Kurt touchingly dreamed of getting a Ph.D. from Harvard and teaching science at a major university .
He achieved the first part of his goal , but became increasingly uneasy as his scientific learning conflicted with his religious faith .
When he could bear the strain no longer , he clinched the matter with a Bible and a pair of scissors .
He went right through from Genesis 1 to Revelations 22 , literally cutting out every verse that would have to go if the scientific worldview were true .
At the end of this exercise , there was so little left of his Bible that
. . . try as I might , and even with the benefit of intact margins throughout the pages of Scripture , I found it impossible to pick up the Bible without it being rent in two .
I had to make a decision between evolution and Scripture .
Either the Scripture was true and evolution was wrong or evolution was true and I must toss out the Bible . . . .
It was there that night that I accepted the Word of God and rejected all that would ever counter it , including evolution .
With that , in great sorrow , I tossed into the fire all my dreams and hopes in science .
See what I mean about pathetic ?
Most revealing of all is Wise�s concluding paragraph :
Although there are scientific reasons for accepting a young earth , I am a young - age creationist because that is my understanding of the Scripture .
As I shared with my professors years ago when I was in college , if all the evidence in the universe turns against creationism , I would be the first to admit it , but I would still be a creationist because that is what the Word of God seems to indicate .
Here I must stand .
See what I mean about honest ?
Understandably enough , creationists who aspire to be taken seriously as scientists don�t go out of their way to admit that Scripture �a local origin myth of a tribe of Middle - Eastern camel - herders �trumps evidence .
The great evolutionist John Maynard Smith , who once publicly wiped the floor with Duane P. Gish ( up until then a highly regarded creationist debater ) , did it by going on the offensive right from the outset and challenging him directly : � Do you seriously mean to tell me you believe that all life was created within one week ? �
Kurt
Wise doesn�t need the challenge ; he volunteers that , even if all the evidence in the universe flatly contradicted Scripture , and even if he had reached the point of admitting this to himself , he would still take his stand on Scripture and deny the evidence .
This leaves me , as a scientist , speechless .
I cannot imagine what it must be like to have a mind capable of such doublethink .
It reminds me of Winston Smith in 1984 struggling to believe that two plus two equals five if Big Brother said so .
But that was fiction and , anyway , Winston was tortured into submission .
Kurt Wise �and presumably others like him who are less candid �has suffered no such physical coercion .
But , as I hinted at the end of my previous column , I do wonder whether childhood indoctrination could wreak a sufficiently powerful brainwashing effect to account for this bizarre phenomenon .
Whatever the underlying explanation , this example suggests a fascinating , if pessimistic , conclusion about human psychology .
It implies that there is no sensible limit to what the human mind is capable of believing , against any amount of contrary evidence .
Depending upon how many Kurt Wises are out there , it could mean that we are completely wasting our time arguing the case and presenting the evidence for evolution .
We have it on the authority of a man who may well be creationism�s most highly qualified and most intelligent scientist that no evidence , no matter how overwhelming , no matter how all - embracing , no matter how devastatingly convincing , can ever make any difference .
Can you imagine believing that and at the same time accepting a salary , month after month , to teach science ?
Even at Bryan College in Dayton , Tennessee ?
I�m not sure that I could live with myself .
And I think I would curse my God for leading me to such a pass .
Today 's proposed reform comes directly from a reader of the blog who writes :
While I was reading your latest entry in " 61 Reforms to C - 61 , " I realized that the " one copy per device " limitation on " format shifting " as described in Section 29.22 ( 1 ) ( d ) ( i ) makes a common practice of mine illegal – one that I do n't believe has been touched upon yet .
I rip ( err , " format shift " ) some of my audio CDs in two different formats : a lossless encoding ( such as Apple Lossless or FLAC ) and a lossy encoding ( such as AAC or MP3 ) .
I keep both copies in my iTunes music library on my computer .
I use the lossy versions on my iPod shuffle and iPod touch where space is in short supply and the lossless versions on my iPod classic and Mac .
Although only one copy usually exists on any of my iPods ( although sometimes I 'll accidentally get both versions with my Smart Playlists ) , both copies always exist on my Mac within iTunes as it acts as my sole repository .
I do n't know if this is common or not , however , it is another example of how the strict requirements penalize purchasers of music .
In this case , the law effectively limits users to a single format since making duplicate copies in different formats is forbidden .
These examples do not involve commercial infringement but rather target individual , private uses , yet Bill C - 61 scarcely differentiates between the two .
Clinton ’s list of regional targets also includes the areas around Pittsburgh in the S.W. as well as Erie and its surroundings in the N.W. Clinton needs big margin in industrial Pa .
SCRANTON , Pa. —
When Hillary Rodham Clinton rallied supporters Monday morning in this former coal town , there were fewer of the “ Welcome Home Hillary ” signs than there were six weeks ago when she began her push to re-energize her presidential campaign with another Scranton rally .
But campaign paraphernalia notwithstanding , Clinton , whose father grew up here and took her to a nearby lake for vacations , has long counted on Scranton — as well as neighboring northeastern Pennsylvania cities such as Wilkes - Barre and Hazleton — to give her a boost when Pennsylvanians go to the polls Tuesday .
Advertisement
That potential boost , though , has become more important for the New York senator since her first rally here .
That ’s because her rival for the Democratic nomination , Illinois Sen .
Barack Obama , seems to have closed what was once nearly a 20 - point deficit in Pennsylvania polls to single digits .
And for Clinton to win the Keystone State by a margin large enough to justify her continued candidacy , she ’s going to need to rack up big victories in the heavily Democratic northeastern part of the state and a few other industrial areas to offset an expected Obama landslide in Philadelphia and its suburban collar counties .
A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday showed Clinton with her biggest regional lead in the northeastern part of the state : an impressive 30 - point margin that might actually be on the low side .
Compare that to the rest of the state , where Quinnipiac showed Clinton with a 51 percent to 44 percent lead , and the influence of Philadelphia is clear .
“ People will be looking at Pennsylvania — and I will be looking at northeastern Pennsylvania , ” Clinton said at Monday ’s rally at the Scranton Cultural Center .
The enthusiastic crowd of hundreds , which Clinton said sounded “ more like a pep rally than a political ” one , included her mother , Dorothy Rodham , two brothers , a sister - in - law and a niece .
There was also an old family friend from Scranton who provided grainy footage of Clinton as toddler in Scranton that the campaign has used in an ad .
“ I will never forget the people here , ” Clinton said , imploring the crowd “ make those phone calls .
I need you to drive people to the polls .
I need you to make sure that the last - minute canvassing is done .
This is what will make the difference . ”
Clinton ’s list of regional targets also includes the areas around Pittsburgh in southwestern Pennsylvania as well as Erie and its surroundings in the northwestern part of the state .
But northeastern Pennsylvania is at the top of Clinton ’s must - win - big list for three reasons .
Her family ties may be the least of them , though they certainly feature prominently in her Pennsylvania campaign , from the toddler ads to her frequent references to her grandfather ’s work in a lace mill here .
More important , though , are the area ’s demographics and the support its local leaders are providing Clinton .
The area ’s voters skew older , whiter , less educated and more union , Catholic and blue - collar than many other parts of the state .
Clinton has consistently outpolled Obama among those groups , according to exit polls .
And Clinton ’s 30 - point lead in the northeastern Pennsylvania in the Quinnipiac poll , which the groups ’ surveys have shown to be steady for more than one month , may underestimate her actual lead in the region .
That ’s because pollsters included the Lehigh Valley , which is south of Scranton , Wilkes - Barre and Hazleton and is considered a potential battleground between Clinton and Obama .
Clinton has lined up an impressive array of local backers , which can be particularly important in the Northeast , where vestiges of machine politics and patronage still loom large .
In addition to popular two - term Scranton Mayor Chris Doherty , who introduced Clinton on Monday , she has the backing of Wilkes - Barre Mayor Tom Leighton .
Clinton also is being supported by the Democratic Party chairman in Luzerne County , where Wilkes - Barre and Hazleton are located ; the Luzerne commission chairwoman ; Rep. Paul E. Kanjorksi , who represents Scranton and Wilkes - Barre ; and most of the area ’s state lawmakers .
Obama has the backing of two newly elected county commissioners in Lackawanna County , where Scranton is located .
And he scored a coup when he picked up the endorsement of Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. , who ’s from Scranton and whose family name ( his dad , after whom he ’s named , was a popular two - term governor ) is golden in the northeast .
But Casey is n’t known for his ability to mobilize a huge political organization and Doherty said local leaders like him can do more for candidates than Casey can .
“ I ’ve got 300 or 400 people that are going to be out working , ” he said after the Scranton rally .
“ All these people you see here , they ’re all part of my group for the last eight years .
We are committed to this and to win .
That ’s the difference between being a mayor and somebody else .
I ’m out everyday .
Everybody knows who I am .
When I tell people I need you to do it , they ’re going to do it . ”
Plus , he pointed out , there are “ 1,000 people who work for the city — whether for the city proper or the authorities — and the mayor appoints those jobs . ”
Obama is not conceding the area , though .
Fueled by his superior fundraising , he ’s outspent Clinton on television in the northeastern Pennsylvania media market — as he has in the rest of the state .
And he ’s made at least four visits to Wilkes - Barre and Scranton , while Clinton in recent weeks paid five visits to those cities .
Obama ’s volunteers and canvassers have been more visible , said Ed Mitchell , a veteran Democratic operative in the area who ’s not working for either candidate .
“ In the last two weekends , I ’ve gotten two pieces of literature dropped at my house from him and I have n’t gotten anything from her , ” he said .
Obama “ has a great ground operation under way up here , ” said Mitchell .
“ He knows he has a chance to hold [ Clinton ] down here .
I do n’t think anybody doubts that she ’s going to win northeastern Pennsylvania , but she might be concerned about how big she wins it . ”
David Gaus , a 57 - year - old retiree from outside Scranton who attended Monday ’s rally wearing one a green “ Welcome Home Hillary ” shirt , predicted Clinton would win big in the northeast .
“ There ’s a lot of family history here , ” he said .
“ Scranton people are behind Hillary because they know her politics .
They know where she stands . ”
Nothing Found
Hmm ... that 's odd .
There 's nothing there !
In the death throes of this nasty anti-male Labour Government , before they are unceremoniously booted out , they have officially declared war on men .
After the publication and announcement this week by Harriet Harman ( the enemy of men ) of the Equalities Bill ( Bill - Debate ) , following on from the abolition of fatherhood ( here ) , no sane man can ever vote Labour ( worse even the Liberal Democrats support it all as well ) .
It is anti-men in its intent , its action and in it prescription .
It is dangerous not just to men but to society as a whole .
As Philip Davies MP states , " how can the party that introduced anti-discrimination laws now reintroduce discrimination into the workplace . "
There are so many angles to look to at this from , so I will restrict it to just a few .
Langauge
Trawling through the annoucement and the interviews , it is clear , in the politically correct food chain , men are the plankton .
Every example quoted , all the phraseology and all the emotion is based on that men are the masters of the universe and are still subjecting women .
It is straight out of the Marxist feminist doctrine that all men are bastards .
Such across the board , sweeping generalisations ignore the fact that we are individuals and our gender is secondary .
Not every man receives better pay than every single a woman , not every man has more opportunities in life than a woman .
These are dangerous assumptions .
It is very rich that Harman , who went to posh girls - only public school , St Paul 's ( here ) believes she and the rest of the female population have less opportunity in life than a working class boy from a council estate in her Peckham constituency .
Positive Action
One of the great lies and weasel phrases of the politically correct is the term " positive action " .
There is no such thing , it is a phrase used by the politically correct to put a positive gloss on discrimination against men .
By its very nature , positive action means negative action for somebody else .
It means that positive action is just plain old discrimination .
Effects on Men
The most concerning part of the proposed Bill is that when faced with people of equal qualifications and equal ability , employers can discriminate .
This will be 99.9999 times out of 100 against men .
In the politically atmosphere of language and debate , employers will feel they would have to select / promote a woman and this new law will only to apply to women .
There is no why they will discriminate in favour of a man .
They would be hung drawn and quartered if they did and if a complaint was made to the supine anti-male Equalities and Human Rioghts Commission , they would support a woman , whatever the evidence .
In addition , the way the Bill is being discussed shows that it is aimed at women and not men .
Men will be discriminated against on the basis of the gender not on their ability .
Furthermore , in areas where men are under - represented - education , social services , HR for example , do you think that the authorities will actively discriminate in favour of men .
No chance .
In addition , the assumption is made that every man has had more advantages in life than every women .
How iniqitous would be for a man from the Peckham council estate to have lost out in this politically correct box - ticking to a girl who went to St Pauls .
Effect on Women .
There are two effects :-
Firstly , for talented , qualified women , an air of suspicion already exists that many have got their position solely because they are a woman .
For many women , this is completely unfair because it suggests they have not got the talent to succeed .
As the BBC's Mark Easton pointed out this week ( link ) ; women run 700,000 companies ; they now sit on 78 of the FTSE - 100's boardrooms ; they are more female millionaires than male millionaire 's between 18 - 44 ( 47,000 women / 38,000 men ) .
The second effect is of course that it ignores the fact that men and women do not live in isolation from each other .
If a man loses out to " positive action " , then that will have an effect on his daughters , wife / partner , sister , mother and any female friends .
Gender Pay Gap Myth
The main argument used by Harman to justify the Bill is that there is a gender pay gap , 13 % overall but 40 % for full time workers .
It has been rehearsed many times on this site and elsewhere ( link ) but the gender pay gap is a lie and a myth .
A clear mis-use of statitics by the politiaclly correct to justify their hatred of men .
It does not exist for women who are doing the same job , with the same degree of talent , experience working for the same company where they add the same value .
It occurs becuase men tend not to take career breaks to bring up children , a choice that many women want .
In addition , men take on more dangerous , dirty work so are likely to be paid more for it .
What has Labour done for men ?
Nothing , of course .
If Harman and Labour were interested in helping men , they would have tackled a number of issues such as : -
The biased family court system
The educational underachievement of boys
The fact that three times as many men commit suicide than women
The lack of treatment for male cancers
The lack of support for male domestic abuse victims .
Conclusion
As stated in the beginning , this piece could have flowed for tens of thousand more words .
The foundation stone of the modern United Kingdom has been based on meritiocracy and liberty , where people succeed based on their talents and abilities .
Harman and Labour have abandoned this , they want men to be consigned to the dustbin of humanity .
They want all men in chains and this Equalities Bill will mean exactly that .

PCall
PCall , or parallel call , is a Common Lisp library intended to simplify ' result - oriented ' parallelism .
It uses a thread pool to concurrently run small computations without spawning a new thread .
This makes it possible to exploit multiple cores without much extra fuss .
Note that there exists a fork of PCall , Eager Future , which is ( at this time ) more actively developed .

( There used to be a Google - group , but that got overrun by spammers , and I 've closed it down . )
Quickstart
PCall is a rather simple library .
There are only three basic concepts that you have to come to grips with :
The thread pool , which mostly manages itself , but whose existence you should be aware of .
It starts inactive , but as soon as a task is created , it is initialised .
See thread - pool - size and finish - tasks for ways in which it can be managed .
and for ways in which it can be managed .
Creating tasks , done through pcall and pexec .
This creates a computation that may be parallelised , and enqueues it .
When given the chance , the threads in the thread pool will take such a task , execute it , and store its result .
and .
This creates a computation that may be parallelised , and enqueues it .
When given the chance , the threads in the thread pool will take such a task , execute it , and store its result .
Joining tasks ( join ) , which extracts the value from a computation .
This blocks when the task is still running .
If it has not yet started , the joining thread will claim and execute the task itself .
Imagine that we have this wonderful algorithm for computing ( once again ) Fibonnaci numbers :
( defun fib ( n ) ( if (> n 2 ) (+ ( fib (- n 1 ) ) ( fib (- n 2 ) ) ) 1 ) ) ( time ( fib 40 ) )
Depending on your machine , this might take some 2 to 10 seconds .
We do n't have that kind of patience .
You can see that this algorithm is entirely optimal , so our only option , it seems , is to use more hardware ― or make better use of the hardware we have :
( time ( let ( ( f39 ( pexec ( fib 39 ) ) ) ( f38 ( pexec ( fib 38 ) ) ) ) (+ ( join f39 ) ( join f38 ) ) ) )
On my 2 - core machine , that speeds things up by about a third ― which makes sense , since computing fib ( 39 ) is about twice as much work as computing fib ( 38 ) .
A nicer way to write the same thing is :
( time ( plet ( ( f39 ( fib 39 ) ) ( f38 ( fib 38 ) ) ) (+ f39 f38 ) ) )
plet takes care of the wrapping and joining in cases like this .
Why do we need the let anyway ?
You could try this :
( time (+ ( join ( pexec ( fib 39 ) ) ) ( join ( pexec ( fib 38 ) ) ) ) )
... but that wo n't buy you anything .
The tasks have to both be created before you join the first one , or the second task will not exist when the first one runs , and thus wo n't be able to run concurrently with it .
You might be tempted to write something like this :
( defun pfib ( n ) ( if (> n 2 ) ( plet ( ( a ( pfib (- n 1 ) ) ) ( b ( pfib (- n 2 ) ) ) ) (+ a b ) ) 1 ) )
... but do n't .
There is some overhead associated with creating and executing tasks , and for a function like naive - fibonacci , which recurses a zillion times even for small inputs , this will radically slow your algorithm down .
A parallel mapping function , as shown below , works great for mapping a relatively heavy function over a list of limited length , but is no use for mapping 1 + over a million elements .
( defun pmapcar ( f list ) ( let ( ( result ( mapcar ( lambda ( n ) ( pexec ( funcall f n ) ) ) list ) ) ) ( map - into result #' join result ) ) ) ( defvar * numbers * ( loop : for i : from 0 : below 30 : collect i ) ) ( time ( mapcar #' fib i ) ) ( time ( pmapcar #' fib i ) )
Note that joining tasks is not required .
When you do not care about the result of a computation , you can just spawn the task and leave it at that .
As a final note , PCall can also be used when a program is not CPU - bound , but needs to do some tasks that are hampered by other bottlenecks ( network latency , disk speed ) .
If they can be executed in parallel , you can have the thread pool run them .
In the following example , the second version runs three times faster on my machine :
( defvar *urls * '( " http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/pcall " " http://common-lisp.net " " http://eloquentjavascript.net " " http://xkcd.com " ) ) ( time ( mapc ' drakma:http- request * urls * ) ) ( time ( mapc ' join ( mapcar ( lambda ( url ) ( pexec ( drakma: http - request url ) ) ) * urls * ) ) )
In some applications , doing multiple database queries at the same time could really help .
You might need to increase the size of the thread pool in such a situation , since some threads will be sitting idle , waiting on a socket .
Reference
function pcall ( thunk )
→ task
Create a task that will call the given argumentless function .
macro pexec ( &body body )
→ task
A shorthand for ( pcall ( lambda ( ) ... ) ) .
macro plet ( ( bindings ) & body body )
Follows the behaviour of let , but wraps every bound value into a pexec form , and automatically adds join calls around uses of the bound variables .
function join ( task )
→ result
Waits for the given task to finish , and then returns any values the task produced .
When executing the task raised an uncaught error , this error will be raised when joining the task .
( Note that this re-raising might cause problems with condition handlers , which might not be active in the worker threads .
If you are using handlers , take extra care , and look at set - worker - environment . )
When , at the moment join is called , the task has not been assigned to any thread , the joining thread will execute the task itself .
( Note that this makes the dynamic environment in which the task runs unpredictable . )
A task may be joined multiple times .
Subsequent joins will again return the values , without re-executing the task .
function select - one ( &rest tasks )
Waits until at least one of the given tasks is finished and then returns that task .
function done -p ( task )
→ boolean
Tests whether a task has been executed .
function thread - pool - size ()
Returns the current size of the thread pool .
Also supports setf to change this size .
The default value is 3 .
function set - worker - environment ( wrapper )
This can be used to make dynamic variables or bound handlers available in the worker threads .
wrapper should be either nil , for no wrapping , or a function that , given a function argument , calls its argument in the new environment .
Works best with local thead pools .
function finish - tasks ()
Takes the current threads out of the pool , waits for the task queue to empty , and then for the threads to finish executing any tasks they might be busy with .
This is intended to be called when shutting down ― killing the threads might cause some tasks to be aborted , which could result in data loss .
If you join every task you create , this should not be necessary .
Note that if you call this function while other threads are still creating tasks , it might never return .

[ This article is excerpted from an unpublished report to the Volker Fund , written in the summer of 1960 , on their Symposium on Relativism , at which Ludwig von Mises presented the paper , " Epistemological Relativism in the Sciences of Human Action . " ]
I think it important to delineate briefly what relativism is and what the issues are on this important topic .
Let us first consider the polar opposite of relativism : absolutism .
The absolutist believes that man 's mind , employing reason ( which according to some absolutists is divinely inspired , according to others is given by nature ) , is capable of discovering and knowing truth : including the truth about reality , and the truth about what is best for man and best for himself as an individual .
The relativist denies this , denies that man 's reason is capable of knowing truth , and does so by claiming that rather than being absolute , truth is relative to something else .
This something else may be different things , and so there can be many kinds of relativist ; some of these things have been the subject of psychology of each individual , the economic interests of the individual ( or of the " class " to which he belongs ) , the " Spirit of the Age " in which the person happens to live , the social structure of the society in which he lives , his " culture , " his race , etc .
Philosophically , I believe that libertarianism — and the wider creed of sound individualism of which libertarianism is a part — must rest on absolutism and deny relativism .
The bulk of this essay by Mises , the preeminent economist and praxeologist of our time , deals in his profound and unique way with a defense of economics against such relativist opponents as the historicists , who claimed that economic laws must be relative to each historical epoch .
There are many excellent points made : an exposition of the Windelband - Rickert refutation of positivist methods in the sciences of human action ; a critique of the deficiencies of the classical economists in confining themselves to a study of wealth and production , and therefore in fragmenting action into the " economic " and " noneconomic " spheres ; critiques of the radical empiricists such as the intuitionalists , of Max Weber , and of the nature of historical events
In short , Mises attacks the various schools of epistemological relativism in the sciences of human action , and defends the absolute and eternal truths arrived at by the science of praxeology .
As a result , this paper , as is almost any by Mises , is excellent and worth reading by every scholar .
( I would consider the fundamental axioms of praxeology as based empirically on the nature of man rather than on " the logical structure of the human mind " as Mises does , but this is not important here . )
Having said this , and never being able to express how much of an enormous intellectual debt I owe to Mises , I must record two important defects in the paper , which stem from what I consider basic weaknesses in the Mises worldview .
One is Mises 's attempt to deny anyone the use of the concept " irrational . "
Mises categorically denies that anyone can ever act irrationally , either in the means he undertakes or in the ends for which he strives .
I think this is flatly wrong , especially since Mises wishes to retain the concept of rational , and apply it to all of man 's actions .
I cannot see how we can retain the term rational , while denying anyone the use of its opposite : " irrational . "
If Mises maintains that no one can ever act irrationally , then he is simply using " rational " as a synonym for " purposive , " and this means that he is using the term rational in a sense that no one else uses and is therefore illegitimate .
Instead of denying that anyone could act irrationally , Mises should simply not use rational or irrational at all , and leave the term to psychology and ethics .
Thus , Mises asserts that we cannot say that the tribe using medicine men or a person in the Middle Ages using magic to attain their ends was irrational ; after all , says Mises , they believed that their means were helping them to attain their ends ( say , rainmaking or cure of disease ) , and a hundred years from now a doctor could just as well say that present - day doctors are " irrational " for using such a quaint method of cure as penicillin .
The belief of the people using magic , however , is irrelevant to the issues ; nobody denies that they thought they were accomplishing something .
Furthermore , magic is not in the same category as penicillin ; for the use of penicillin rests on a scientific method , on an epistemology that can discover , by reason and by sense experimentation analyzed by reason , that penicillin can be used as cures for disease .
The fact that , fifty years from now , the advance of science will discover better cures does not make the present use of penicillin irrational — although , by the way , it would make the use of penicillin a hundred years from now irrational .
But magic is in a completely different category ; magic , by its very methodology is totally irrational and incapable of arriving at what it is supposed to achieve ; and we can be assured that no " advance " a hundred years from now in the ritual of magic could ever improve its performance .
The use of magic is therefore irrational , whether in the past , present , or future .
Moreover , not only can we say with absolute assurance that certain methods and means are irrational , but can also go on to say that certain ends are irrational .
Suppose that A's end is to torture B , because A enjoys it .
Even if it lies within A's power to do so , and even if A need not fear retaliation by the police or by B or B 's friends , I think it can be demonstrated that such torture and love of torture is contrary to the nature of man and to what is required by that nature for man 's true happiness ; I think it can be demonstrated that such perversions of man 's nature are profoundly irrational .
Yet Mises would insist on adding " from my personal point of view . "
It is not just my or your subjective " point of view " that decrees this ; it is our objective , absolute insight into the discoverable nature of man .
What has happened here , and elsewhere , is that Mises has strayed off his great stomping ground , praxeology , on to a field , ethics , where he is , I believe , tragically wrong .
For irrationality or rationality of ends involve an ethical judgment , and Mises 's subjectivity that we have just noted means simply this : that Mises , while a praxeological or epistemological absolutist , is , unfortunately , an ethical relativist .
To Mises , there is no such a thing as absolute ethics ; man , by the use of his mind , cannot discover a true , " scientific " ethics by insight into what is best for man 's nature .
Ultimate ends , values , ethics , are simply subjective , personal , and purely arbitrary .
If they are arbitrary , Mises never explains where they come from : how any individual arrives at them .
I can't see how he could arrive at any answer except the subjective , relative emotions of each individual .
This , Mises 's ethical relativism , is his second great defect in this paper , and we have seen how it is intimately tied up with the first .
As a result , Mises , excellent when he criticizes governments for opposing economics because economic science shows that governments cannot accomplish their objectives , falters when he tried to refute the ethical contentions of the statists .
Thus , Mises says , in his final section , that the enemies of economics and of capitalism blame private enterprise as immoral , and materialistic , and praise Soviet Russia as well as equality of incomes as more ethical .
What can Mises reply to this ?
Only that it is all " emotional talk , " that praxeology and economics are neutral to ethics ( true , but irrelevant ) , and that these statists should try to refute economic teachings by " discursive reasoning , not by … appeal to arbitrary allegedly ethical standards . "
We can surely agree that it is illegitimate for anyone , leftist or libertarian , to ignore and not fully consider the value - free laws of economics .
But precisely because economics is neutral to ethics , this is hardly an answer .
For to Mises , all ethics is " arbitrary , " and yet , even Mises must admit that no one can decide any policy unless he does make an ethical judgment .
The man who understands economics and then chooses liberty is , or should be , considered by Mises to be just as " arbitrary " as the man who chooses egalitarianism , after accepting , say , the economic consequences of lessened productivity .
And since either decision , according to Mises , is ultimately arbitrary , he cannot finally refute the interventionists in this way .
And as for the opposition being " emotional , " this may well be , but we have seen that emotion is the only groundwork that Mises can find for ultimate values anyway .
How has Mises been able to be an ethical relativist and still be the great champion that he has been of economic liberty ?
By what I consider an illegitimate assumption .
Thus : " Economics pointed out that many cherished ( interventionist ) policies … bring about … effects which — from the point of view of those who advocated and applied them — were even more unsatisfactory than the conditions which they were designed to alter … "
It is this assumption — that even the advocates really are worse off — that permits Mises to say that they are " bad . "
But how can Mises know what motivates the statists ?
Suppose , for example , the price controller wants power , and does n't care if it creates shortages ; he has power and the perquisites of a soft job in the bureaucracy ; suppose that he is a Communist , and wants to create shortages ( or is a nihilist and hates everyone , and wants to create shortages ) ; suppose that someone who wants to confiscate the rich has a very high time preference and does n't care if the economy will be wrecked in twenty years .
What then ?
In short , it is illegitimate for Mises to assume that , knowing all the consequences shown by economics , everyone will consider himself worse off from the statist measure .
When Mises says that repeal of such measures " would benefit the rightly understood or long - run interests of all the people , " and are championed by vested " short - run interests , " suppose , as we have just indicated , the time preferences of the latter are high ; or suppose , even aside from the time preference , that the amount X can mulct from everyone by some interventionist measure is greater than the amount he will lose as a consumer .
What I have been trying to say is that Mises 's utilitarian , relativist approach to ethics is not nearly enough to establish a full case for liberty .
It must be supplemented by an absolutist ethic — an ethic of liberty , as well as of other values needed for the health and development of the individual — grounded on natural law , i.e. , discovery of the laws of man 's nature .
Failure to recognize this is the greatest flaw in Mises 's philosophical worldview .
In his final section , Mises says that " there are authors who combine praxeological relativism with ethical relativism . … there are also authors who display ethical absolutism while rejecting the concept of universally valid praxeological laws . "
Yes , and there is also a third category of writers : those who accept both praxeological and ethical absolutism , and recognize that both are vitally necessary for a complete philosophical view , as well as for the achievement of liberty .
I hope it is clear that this extended discussion is not intended to deny the great overall merits of Mises 's paper and its importance for all scholars of human action .
The earthquake that rattled Southern California on Tuesday might have caused devastation if it had taken place in some parts of the world , but relatively strict building codes ensured that most of the region ’s infrastructure -- homes , schools , freeways and rail systems -- rolled with the magnitude 5.4 punch , which was centered near Chino Hills and felt as far away as Las Vegas .
As aftershocks continued to reverberate , officials inspected airports , freeways and buildings and reported little damage from the quake , which occurred at 11:42 a.m. and was the first significant temblor in more than a decade to be centered in an urban area of California .
The biggest strains were felt in phone and Internet systems , which buckled because of overwhelming demand in the minutes after the jolt .
The quake struck hardest in an area of San Bernardino County that has seen massive growth in population and housing in the last decade .
That meant that the buildings shaken the hardest were mostly built under California ’s strictest building codes , updated in 1997 in response to the 6.7 Northridge quake of 1994 .
That kept damage to a minimum .
Only minor injuries were reported , three at an outpatient medical clinic in Brea and five at a building in the Wilshire district of Los Angeles .

“ The most interesting thing to us is that this is the first one we ’ve had in a populated area for a long time , ” seismologist Kate Hutton of Caltech said .
“ People have forgotten what an earthquake feels like .
We should look at this as an earthquake drill for the Big One that will come one day . ”
Although moderate in intensity , the quake rumbled up from a relatively shallow depth , making it feel sharper , stronger and scarier than its magnitude suggested , especially in areas close to the epicenter .
“ It ’s the first time in my life I actually got under my desk , ” said Anaheim Police Sgt. Ken Seymour , a native Southern Californian .
Robert Heded , 32 , a Time Warner technician who lives in Culver City , was about 30 feet up a telephone pole at La Cienega and Pico boulevards in Los Angeles when the quake hit .

“ I just sat there and waited , kinda rode it out , ” he said a while later as he bought an energy drink at a 7 - Eleven , still dressed in his reflective safety vest .
The lines were “ swaying a lot more than usual , about four feet from side to side , ” he said .
“ I was n’t sure what was happening , if it was an earthquake or if it was me . ”
Heded said he finished up his work , still strapped to the pole in his safety gear .
Then made his way down .
“ It was bad , ” said Nirmala Dawson , the director of the Montessori School of Chino .
She said the school performs frequent earthquake drills .
“ But at that moment , to be honest , we forgot them .
We just evacuated . ”
No one was injured , she said , but a few children were frightened by the shaking .
Then , after the quake , phones began ringing off the hook with calls from parents .

That nearly universal instinct to call loved ones -- or someone -- strained the capacity of the regional phone network , perhaps instructive for officials planning emergency responses to the next massive earthquake .
Verizon lost some phone service Tuesday in several quake - affected areas .
“ We have some outages on our land - line side , ” said Jonathan Davies , Verizon spokesman .
“ We ’re not sure yet if it ’s physical damage or just due to high call volumes . ”
AT&T ;'s cellphone service was spotty in some areas .
Sitting in a Starbucks in Pasadena , Paul Roberts was able to get calls on his cellphone .
“ But I am sitting here with my buddy , who has AT&T ; , too , and he ca n’t make outgoing calls , ” said Roberts , a student at Art Center College of Design .
The Los Angeles Times ’ website , latimes.com , was briefly unavailable to many users when heavy traffic swamped its servers immediately after the earthquake .
Full access returned in about 10 minutes , according to Meredith Artley , the executive editor of the site .
It had about 630,000 page views in the hour after the temblor , roughly double the usual amount .

The earthquake slowed , but for the most part did n’t stop , the region ’s transportation network .
A section of the southbound Interstate 5 near Bake Parkway in Irvine was briefly closed to traffic so that Caltrans workers could inspect it , according to Tom Marshall , spokesman for the California Highway Patrol .
No problems were found .
No disruptions were reported on Los Angeles County highways .
Raja Mitwasi , chief deputy director of the Caltrans office in Los Angeles , said Caltrans was inspecting highway bridges and pavement , but had not found any signs of damage .
The biggest delays were on passenger trains , which were slowed to allow inspectors access to tracks .

Denise Tyrrell , a Metrolink representative , said there were delays of about an hour on Metrolink trains serving Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties .
Metrolink use is at an all - time high because of rising gas prices .
Similar delays were reported on Amtrak ’s Surfliner trains , with shorter ones on Los Angeles County ’s Metro Rail lines .
On Tuesday afternoon at Union Station in Los Angeles , some passengers affected by the delays said they understood the need to check tracks for damage .
“ They had to do what they had to do to make sure it was safe , ” said Pete Paladino , 64 , a special needs teacher who was delayed about 30 minutes on the Red Line to downtown and was headed home to Upland .
The quake briefly knocked out the ground radar system at Los Angeles International Airport but did not affect any flights , LAX officials said .
The radar is linked to a safety system that warns air traffic controllers of potential collisions .
Nancy Castles , a representative for the airport , said no damage has been found at LAX except for a broken water heater that caused some flooding in the checked baggage area of Terminal 7 .

One terminal at Ontario International Airport sustained cosmetic damage , but flights were not affected , according to spokesman Harold Johnson .
Staffers at John Wayne Airport in Santa
Ana closed one runway for five minutes after the quake to inspect it , airport spokeswoman Jenny Wedge said .
They found no damage .
The quake did cause its share of damage , mostly in the form of shattered glass and dislodged bricks .
In Los Angeles , problems included flooding at a Macy ’s in Woodland Hills ; some people stuck in an elevator at Pershing Square ; some cracking and other minor damage to some downtown buildings ; and five minor injuries to people in the 3600 block of Wilshire Boulevard “ who were rushing and trampling each other out the building , ” according to City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel , who was serving as acting mayor in the absence of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , who was on vacation in London .
The quake gives new urgency to a drill , the Great Southern California Shakeout , being planned for November by a consortium of public and private organizations .
It will simulate the response to a magnitude 7.8 quake on the San Andreas fault .
Seismologists consider such a quake to be inevitable , although they cannot predict when it might hit .
To put the latest temblor in perspective : A 7.8 quake would be 3,981 times more powerful than one of magnitude 5.4 , according to Anthony Guarino , a seismic analyst at Caltech .

The recent devastating earthquake in China ’s Sichuan Province was calibrated at magnitude 7.9 .
As powerful as that quake was , it also demonstrated what can happen when buildings are not built to the highest earthquake standards .
Hutton , the Caltech seismologist , said even a 5.4 quake could cause widespread damage “ anyplace where there ’s no earthquake regulation , where no reinforcement is required . ”
The Chino Hills quake hit hardest in an area of relatively new development .
Valerie McClung , community relations manager for the city of Chino Hills , said almost all of the residential and commercial development in the city began no earlier than 1991 , the year the city was incorporated .
Most development , she said , occurred after the Northridge quake .
“ It ’s the best possible location , ” said Lucy Jones , chief scientist for the Multi-Hazards Initiative of the U.S. Geological Survey .
“ If this had happened in San Bernardino , where there are over 200 unreinforced masonry buildings , we would have had a lot of downed buildings . ”
Advertisement
Jones said big earthquakes often lead to an upgrade in building codes .
For instance , she said , unreinforced masonry was outlawed in California in a 1935 code , adopted in the aftermath of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake .
The 1997 code , adopted after Northridge , banned brittle steel and mandated that builders use a stronger welding material to join steel parts .
“ Each time there ’s a big earthquake , we say ‘ Oops , we had n’t thought about that one before , ’ ” Jones said .

It helps when the quake occurs in an urban area .
When that happens , said Thomas Heaton , a professor of engineering and seismology at Caltech , “ It means 10 million people feel it .
If it happened in the Mojave Desert it sure would n’t have been as big a deal at all . ”

Vice - Minister for Labour Carlos Mateu said the current system - in place since the communist revolution in 1959 - was no longer " convenient " .
He said wage differentiation should improve production and services .
President Raul Castro has introduced a series of reforms since succeeding his ailing brother Fidel in February .
Writing in the communist party newspaper Granma Mr Mateu said workers would receive a minimum 5 % bonus for meeting targets but with no ceiling on salaries .
Managers could earn a 30 % bonus if the team working under them increased production , he said .
The minister pointed out that the current wage system sapped employees ' incentives to excel since everyone earned the same regardless of performance .
" It 's harmful to give a worker less than he deserves , it 's also harmful to give him what he does n't deserve , " the newspaper article said .
Challenging Marxist orthodoxy
But the impact in terms of purchasing power will be limited , the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana says .
Raul Castro has brought in a series of gradual social reforms
The average wage in Cuba for everyone - from doctors to farm labourers - is about $ 20 ( £ 10 ) a month .
Even before the recent sharp rise in oil and food prices Cuba was spending billions of dollars on imports , and that bill is likely to rise sharply , our correspondent says .
So far most of the reforms announced since Raul Castro took over the presidency have involved lifting restrictions such as the bans on mobile phones and computers .
The latest change is a more fundamental challenge to Marxist economic orthodoxy , our correspondent adds .
Mirror Universe
Caren Golden Fine Art
539 West 23rd Street , New York , NY
March 20 - April 26 , 2008
Spock 1 , 2007 , 1102 spools of thread , stainless - steel ball chain and hanging apparatus , clear acrylic sphere , metal stand ( 44.5 x 36 x 60 inches )
Premise :
The exhibition Mirror Universe exemplifies my continued interest in the links between art and science -- in particular how consciousness and the act of seeing create the illusion of a stable , predictable , and singular universe .
Constructed from ordinary materials such as spools of thread , tightly packed chenille stems , or semi- transparent colored beads , the works in Mirror Universe merge high and low art forms , scientific concepts and TV culture , to present " reality " as a subjective experience vs. an absolute " truth . "
Background :
The exhibition title Mirror Universe was inspired by the 1967 Star Trek episode Mirror , Mirror in which a transporter mishap switches the crew of the Enterprise with their evil counterparts , trapping them in a " savage parallel universe . "
This struck a poignant chord .
Although I am not a " Trekkie , " I have a vague recollection of watching reruns of the original Star Trek series in the 1970s with my father .
I also watched Star Trek : The Next Generation ( a.k.a. TNG ) for a while in late 1980s , but I was never a fanatic until 2002 , when for a few months , I began scheduling my days so I could watch reruns of Star Trek : TNG shown every afternoon on Spike TV .
I remember wondering why I was so intrigued .
Eventually I realized that series Star Trek : TNG offered an escape from the tumultuous post 9 - 11 world by presenting a utopian perspective of humanity at its best .
The mission of the TNG Enterprise was exploration and with the exception of the Borg ( their defining motto was " resistance is futile " ) , the crew 's confrontations with alien life - forms were mostly based on misunderstandings and cultural differences vs. battles between good and evil .
The idea of doing a series based on Star Trek has been gestating since that time .
The concept and title for this exhibition gelled when I realized every Star Trek series had at least one episode based on the concept of a mirror or parallel universe , which fit in with my ongoing interest in the link between art and science , human perception , and subjective reality .
About Parallel Universes : " For years Parallel Universes have been a staple of science fiction .
Scientists now believe there may really be a parallel universe - in fact , there may be an infinite number of parallel universes , and we just happen to live in one of them .
It started when superstring theory , hyperspace and dark matter made physicists realize that the three dimensions we thought described the Universe were n't enough .
By the time they had finished they'd come to the conclusion that there are eleven dimensions and that our Universe is just one bubble among an infinite number of membranous bubbles which ripple as they wobble through the eleventh dimension . " -
Quoted from the BBC Television Program : Parallel Universes ( February , 14 , 2002 )
The exhibition Mirror Universe consists of conceptual and visual interpretations of characters , scenes and sets from the original Star Trek television series ( 1966 - 1969 ) and Star Trek : The Next Generation ( 1987-1994 ) .
In addition to the concept of Mirror ( or Parallel ) Universes , most of the works incorporate actual mirrors and can only be fully comprehended when seen reflected in the mirrors .
Partial installation view of Mirror Universe as seen in a convex mirror , Caren Golden Fine Art , NYC
Two large thread spool installations installed in the front gallery are interpretations / renditions of sets from the series Star Trek : The Next Generation .
The three semi- transparent beaded figures hanging in front of the gallery windows are slightly larger - than - life interpretations of Captain Kirk , Spock and Dr. McCoy in the process of " beaming - in " from the original Star Trek series .
Thread Spool Installations :
( studio view ) Holodeck : Simulation Program , 2007 - 2008 , , * 9,600 spools of thread ( 95 x 149 inches thread only ) , stainless steel ball chain and hanging apparatus , convex mirror mounted on opposing wall
The thread spool installation titled : Holodeck : Simulation Program : Chelsea , New York , 2008 is a rendition of the interior view of the Holodeck doorway and arch ( TNG ) .
This perspective places the viewer inside the holodeck ( vs. outside looking in ) .
Thus , the gallery and everything and everyone in it , as well as the city seen through the gallery windows , can be thought of as part the holodeck 's virtual - simulation program .
The title of this work will change with each exhibition , to reflect the time and location of each simulated Holodeck program .
Holodeck : Simulation Program expresses my ongoing interest in presenting " reality " as a subjective experience vs. an absolute " truth " more literally than any work I have created to date .
It supports the idea that " reality " is an illusion created by the human brain through unconscious processes by which raw perceptual data is input , filtered , and organized to create a holographic illusion of a solid , predictable universe .
About Holodecks : ( from Wikipedia )
A holodeck is a simulated reality facility located on starships and starbases in the fictional Star Trek universe .
A holodeck is an enclosed room in which objects and people are simulated by a combination of replicated matter , tractor beams , and shaped force fields onto which holographic images are projected .
Sounds and smells are simulated by speakers and fragranced fluid atomizers , respectively .
The feel of a large environment is simulated by suspending the participants on force fields which move with their feet , keeping them from reaching the walls of the room ( a virtual treadmill ) .
Perspective is retained through use of sound damping fields and graviton lenses , which make objects , people , and sounds appear to be more distant .
The effect is an ultra-realistic simulation of an environment , with which the user can interact .
User controls for a holodeck are typically located near its door ( inside and out ) ; on the inside an arch surrounds the exit and can be revealed by a user to start , modify , or stop a simulation ( as seen in the thread spool installation Holodeck : Simulation Program ... ) .
Star Trek : TNG Bridge , 2007 - 2008 , * 5,822 spools of thread ( 94 x 120 inches ) , stainless - steel ball chain and hanging apparatus , mirror panels mounted on adjacent wall ( 96 x 120 x 2 inches )
Star Trek : TNG Bridge is a thread spool rendition of half of the Enterprise Bridge from Star Trek : The Next Generation series .
Because the bridge is highly symmetrical , mirror panels mounted on the adjacent wall complete the illusion of the entire bridge , with the thread spool imagery appearing to continue along a single plane as it extends beyond the gallery walls .
A mirrored sphere , positioned in front of the installation ( not seen here ) , shrinks or condenses the thread spools into a seamless rendition of the bridge .
Beaded Figures ( Beaming - In ) :
The Beaming - In beaded figures are slightly larger - than - life , beaded renditions of Captain Kirk , Spock and Dr. McCoy in various stages of " beaming - in " via transporter beams .
In the front gallery , three barely - beamed - in figures hang near the gallery windows .
Spock , Kirk , and McCoy Beaming - In ( barely there ) , 2007-08
In the rear gallery , two beaded figures ( Kirk and Spock ) appear to be almost entirely beamed - in to a transporter set .
Because viewers can only see one set of figures at a time , the Beaming - In figures can be thought of as either being in the front and rear galleries at the same time , or as beaming from one gallery to the other .
" Transporter : Kirk and Spock Beaming - In , " 2007 - 08 , 2 beaded figures hanging in front of mirror panels installed in a corner to create the illusion of 6 figures beaming in , 100,000 + loose beads on mixed medium platform ( 104 x 72 x 72 inches )
About the tranporter :
Due to the low budget nature of the original series , Roddenberry created the transporter to avoid having to build elaborate sets for space ships or shuttles to fly towards and then land on .
It was far easier and cheaper to transport the crew directly onto a planet 's surface .

Chenillle Stem Works :
The Enterprise , 2007 , 133,668 chenille stems , MDF board , 48 x 80 inches
Constructed from over 133,000 tightly - packed chenille stems , The Enterprise presents the Starship Enterprise as though it is being seen passing by the forward - viewing window from the bridge of the Starship Enterprise .
NOTE : When the chenille stem works are viewed up - close , the imagery dissolves into an odd mix of colored pixels / stems , in reference to the way images are transmitted via electronic beams to light up the 200,000 + television - screen pixels which make up the images we see while watching TV .
In addition , all four stem works sparkle as light reflects off the twisted wire cores of the chenille stems .
The following three smaller chenille stem works are visual interpretations of scenes from the 1967 Star Trek episode Mirror , Mirror in which a transporter mishap switches the crew of the Enterprise with their evil counterparts , trapping them in a " savage parallel universe . "

I 've been struggling to blog recently , and have been unable to figure out why .
It then dawned on me that I have been suffering from severe campaign fatigue from the Clinton / Obama hullabaloo .
An entire year of incessant media coverage and intense scrutiny , I feel like I know Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton more than my own mother .
The truth of it is that I did n't particularly agree with either candidates politics , I just desperately wanted a candidate with a vague moral center who was n't a Republican .
A blind dog with no ears could beat any Republican candidate this time round , and now we have a Democratic nominee , I just do n't care about the campaign any more .

John McCain is a decrepit , washed up politician who has sold his moral center to appease the lunatic right that helped elect the last Republican into office .
He offers no serious challenge to Barack Obama , and the media 's desire to make this into a tight , nailbiting horse race just wo n't work any more .
In truth , the race wo n't be close , and McCain ( barring any terrorist attacks ) , will hopefully disappear into a retirement home with his tail between his legs .
McCain has boldly pronounced his deep committment to everything Bush stands for , and can not be taken seriously .
However , there is a strong possibility that the media 's desire to make this close , could actually make this close .
The more they insist it is a 50 - 50 toss up , the more enthusiastic McCain 's supporters will become .
Myth could become reality , and we could be lumbered with a 72 year old Grandfather who still believes America should be in Vietnam .

But for now , I 'll take some time off the campaign trail .
Somebody wake me up when Florida starts to vote .
Tom DiLorenzo , in his new book , Hamilton 's Curse : How Jefferson 's Archenemy Betrayed the American Revolution - And What It Means for Americans Today ( see his The Founding Father of Constitutional Subversion ) , shows how Hamilton helped to subvert the superior ( and more libertarian ) Jeffersonian interpretation of the Constitution .
But though Jefferson was clearly better than Hamilton in his ideas and constitutional interpretation ( see Jefferson on Nullification ; Fourteenth Amendment Resources ) , he was also a pretty bad president .
In Forrest McDonald great article , The Bill of Rights : Unnecessary and Pernicious , McDonald ( pp. 404-405 ) gives the the example of how Jefferson blatantly violated the 4th and 5th Amendments in enforcing an 1807 embargo .
More intriguing to me was the description ( p. 407-408 ) of the Jefferson administration 's blatant trampling of the Constitution during an incident when martial law was declared in the Territory of Louisiana by U.S. General James Wilkinson .
As McDonald recounts ,
" A fourth set of circumstances under which the Bill of Rights is apt to be trampled upon arises whenever there is a general sense of emergency , justified or unjustified , local or national .
On the local level , the city of New Orleans offers instructive examples .
In the winter of 1806 - 7 Gen. James Wilkinson , commander of the small American army in the Louisiana Territory , asked Territorial Governor William Claiborne to declare martial law , on the ground ( which Wilkinson knew to be false ) that Aaron Burr was about to invade New Orleans with his rebel band .
Claiborne refused , whereupon Wilkinson imposed martial law anyway ; and in the name and authority of the United States , he proceeded to crush the Constitution and the Bill of Rights beneath his boot .
He arrested without warrants and held incommunicado three of Burr 's associates , and when writs of habeas corpus were obtained in their behalf he had them chained and sent sea to Washington .
In addition , he jailed their attorney , the judge , the judge 's closest friend , a newspaper editor , former Senator John Adair , and about sixty other citizens .
None was charged with a specific crime , none was allowed his constitutional rights , and a number were transported from the vicinage , where they had a constitutional right to a speedy and public trial , and were shipped in secret to Washington .
The president of the United States [ Jefferson - SK ] approved of these doings , his only reservation being that Wilkinson must stay within the limits , not of the Constitution , but of what public opinion would bear [ emphasis added ] . "
And , of course , there was Jefferson 's ownership of slaves , and the Louisiana Purchase ...
Now , granted , McDonald is a Hamilton worshipper , and can be expected to trash Jefferson .
But the point is even Jefferson -- the author of the Declaration of Independence , the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom , the Kentucky Resolutions -- did terrible things as President .
It 's awfully difficult for a politician to avoid being a politician , it seems .
But as a friend noted , " If even Jefferson is pressured to ignore the Constitution , then the argument for limited government really is absurd . "

UK scientists have developed a drug which may halt the progression of Alzheimer 's disease .
Trials of the drug , known as Rember , in 321 patients showed an 81 % difference in rate of mental decline compared with those not taking the treatment .
The Aberdeen University researchers said the drug targeted the build - up of a specific protein in the brain .
Alzheimer 's experts were optimistic about the results , but said larger trials were now needed .
Presenting the results at the International Conference on Alzheimer 's Disease , Professor Claude Wischik said the drug may be on the market by 2012 .
This bodes well for a Phase III trial , but we need more human trials to assess the treatment 's possible side effects
Rebecca Wood , Alzheimer 's Research Trust
The Long Goodbye - Part 2 The Long Goodbye - Part 1 Patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer 's disease were given either 30 , 60 or 100 mg of the drug or a placebo .
The 60mg dose produced the most pronounced effect - over 50 weeks there was a seven - point difference on a scale used to measure severity of dementia .
At 19 months there was no significant decline in mental function in patients taking the drug , the researchers said .
Imaging data also suggests the drug may be having its biggest effect in the parts of the brain responsible for memory .
The link between clumps or " tangles " of protein inside nerve cells in the brain and Alzheimer 's disease was first made over 100 years ago .
Later shown to be made up of a protein called Tau , the tangles build up inside cells involved in memory , destroying them in the process .
SUCCESS STORY
Among the trial patients was Jimmy Hardie , 72 .
He began taking Rember in March 2006 .
His wife said his improvement was gradual , but he is now much more confident .
She said he used to panic when faced with something difficult to do , but now copes much better .
He keeps busy maintaining old tractors , running a trout fishery , and doing a lot of gardening .
Mr Hardie said : " It has made a difference to my life .
I have my off days - but I had a lot before . "
Praise from patients Rember , or methylthioninium chloride , is the first treatment specifically designed to target the Tau tangles .
Other treatments for Alzheimer 's tend to focus on combating a waste protein in the brain , beta - amyloid , which is known to form hard plaques .
The latest work suggests targeting Tau may produce better results .
Methylthioninium chloride is more commonly used as a blue dye in laboratory experiments .
Professor Wischik discovered it by accident 20 years ago , when a drop in a test tube led to the disappearance of the Tau protein he had been working on .
" We have demonstrated for the first time that it may be possible to arrest the progression of this disease by targeting the tangles which are highly correlated with the disease , " he said .
" We did an analysis of the effect size at 24 weeks and at 50 weeks compared to the average effect size of the current treatments and it was about two and a half times better , " he added .
Larger trials of the drug are planned to start in 2009 , and researchers are also investigating whether the drug has a role in prevention of the disease in the first place .
Professor Clive Ballard , head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " This is a major new development in the fight against dementia .
" It is the first realistic evidence that a new drug can improve cognition in people with Alzheimer 's by targeting the protein tangles that cause brain cell death .
" This first modestly sized trial in humans is potentially exciting .
" It suggests the drug could be over twice as effective as any treatment that is currently available . "
Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " In this exploratory trial , rember reduced the decline in blood flow to parts of the brain that are important for memory .
" This bodes well but we need more human trials to assess the treatment 's possible side effects . "
She added the fact the trial was funded by a pharmaceutical company highlighted the lack of funding for Alzheimer 's research in the UK .

Capitol Hill 's Nerd in Chief
A physicist in Congress weighs in on electronic voting , missile defense and why politicians tend to ignore science
“ They ’ve been using this method for a long time , ” said Zhang Jianping , a contributor to the Web site who has known Mr. Huang since 2005 .
Nobody knows the grounds for his arrest , but many people have the same idea .
Mr. Zhang said , “ It may be because the schools collapsed , and so many children died . ”
In the days after the earthquake , the authorities allowed reporters and volunteers to travel freely in the disaster zone .
Some commentators even saw the dawning of a Chinese glasnost .
In an interview with National Public Radio that aired in May , Mr. Huang said he believed that the human rights situation in China had greatly improved .
“ He actually thought things were heading in the right direction , ” said John Kamm , who is pressing for Mr. Huang ’s release and is the executive director of the Dui Hua Foundation , which has helped free prominent Chinese political prisoners .
“ That ’s one of the tragedies of his detention . ”
A volunteer at the Tianwang center , Pu Fei , 27 , was detained minutes after Mr. Huang .
He said that the officers who interrogated him demanded that he hand over the password needed to post information on their Web site .
They also wanted to know whom Mr. Huang had met and where he had gone in the disaster zone .
Mr. Pu was detained in a hotel for two weeks and then released .

Mr. Pu and other volunteers said the authorities might have singled out Mr. Huang because he disseminated information about parents whose children had died in collapsed schools  a group whose protests began to snowball into something like a movement in early June .
Those of us who sounded off on Mark Udall ’s capitulation on the FISA bill apparently all got the same nice form letter in response to our concerns .
He ’s happy to hear from us .
Let me begin with what he wrote .
Dear Sam :
Thank you for letting me know your views on H.R. 6304 , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) Amendments of 2008 .
I appreciate hearing from you .
This bill is designed to update FISA while putting an end to abusive domestic spying , and I voted for it in order to prevent a future program of warrantless surveillance by the executive branch .
The bill is explicit that complying with FISA is the only way for the government to conduct surveillance .
At the same time , it updates FISA , which was originally passed in 1978 , to give us important capabilities to discover and stop terrorist activities .
I fully understand why there is confusion and even anger that the legislation does not do more to require some telecommunications companies to respond to lawsuits for alleged privacy abuses in their actions to implement the Bush Administration ’s warrantless surveillance after 9 - 11 .
But it does require a comprehensive review of that surveillance program by the Inspectors General of the Justice Department , the Directorate of National Intelligence , the National Security Agency , and the Defense Department , including a report to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of Congress .
This will mean that past abuses by the Bush Administration will not go uninvestigated .
Also , the bill does not provide absolute or criminal immunity for these companies , and no government official will receive civil or criminal immunity for past abuses .
The bill – like any compromise – is not perfect , but I decided voting for it was the best way to protect both our national security and the civil liberties that make our nation worth defending .
A fact sheet and other materials about this bill and the issues raised by its passage are available at my website .
Thanks again for contacting me .
For more information , please visit http://www.house.gov/markudall.
Warm Regards , Mark Udall
Member of Congress
At this point it should be noted that I ’m not a lawyer , and even if I were the corpus of the bill sounds like a meticulously crafted Machiavellian gauntlet aimed at flummoxing even the most gifted of analysts ( Howard Dean called it a “ 114 page monster ” ) .
So I wo n’t be presenting myself as someone with a nuanced grasp of what we can and ca n’t and will and wo n’t do about the telecoms that knowingly violated our civil liberties .
It seems evident enough that we probably had very little chance on that front anyway , and that the “ compromise ” provides further procedural smoke - and - mirrors covering the getaway .
That said , I do have some problems with Udall ’s letter .
Let ’s take this piece by piece .
This bill is designed to update FISA while putting an end to abusive domestic spying , and I voted for it in order to prevent a future program of warrantless surveillance by the executive branch .
That ’s nice , but the need to prevent future bank robberies and the need to do something about the people robbing the bank right now are not mutually exclusive goals .
I fully understand why there is confusion and even anger that the legislation does not do more to require some telecommunications companies to respond to lawsuits for alleged privacy abuses in their actions to implement the Bush Administration ’s warrantless surveillance after 9 - 11 .
The problem here is n’t that we ’re confused , Rep. Udall .
The problem is your reliance on weasel words and near - Rovian rhetorical misdirection .
For instance , “ alleged ” ?
Please .
Second , it ’s not that the bill does n’t force telecoms to respond , it ’s that it guarantees that they wo n’t have to .
Third – and I ’m really disappointed in you on this one – is the “ after 9 - 11 ” ruse .
Because we pretty much know that the spying was happening well before 9/11 , do n’t we ?
But it does require a comprehensive review of that surveillance program by the Inspectors General of the Justice Department , the Directorate of National Intelligence , the National Security Agency , and the Defense Department , including a report to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of Congress .
“ Review ” – what a great word .
It wants us to hear that something is being done , but in actuality it says no such thing .
The bill does n’t require the administration to do anything .
What value would a criminal trial be if the judge had no authority to impose sanctions ?
In short , the IG thing is a ruse designed to allow Vichy Democrats like you claim that you ’re doing something when , in fact , all you ’re doing is insulating a criminal administration and enabling its corporate co-conspirators .
This will mean that past abuses by the Bush Administration will not go uninvestigated .
You ’d use words like “ punished ” here if you could .
Your failure to do so makes clear the sleight - of - hand game you ’re playing .
Also , the bill does not provide absolute or criminal immunity for these companies …
The bill does protect corporate individuals , if I ’m reading correctly , and I ca n’t help smelling a weasel with that word “ absolute . ”
In the end , though , it ’s hard to imagine how , precisely , a successful prosecution – either criminal or civil – might be conducted once this bill becomes law .
It may have been impossible anyway , but your actions have helped seal the door even more tightly .
Now we get to the part that bothers me the most :
The bill – like any compromise – is not perfect , but I decided voting for it was the best way to protect both our national security and the civil liberties that make our nation worth defending .
First , I ’m all in favor of national security .
I think we all are , so you can stop pandering and playing into the GOP ’s “ Dems are weak on defense ” frame .
The issue , though , is the way you present the twin goals – national security and civil liberties .
There ’s a balancing act here , and it ’s being played out in a way that suggests that somehow there ’s an either / or dynamic at work .
I ’m not 100 % sure I buy that , but the more you say it that way , the easier it makes life for those who wish the rabble were a little more under control .
In essence , you ’re explaining how you “ compromised ” between security and liberty .
If you ’ll recall , that word has a couple definitions .
First : “ settlement of differences by arbitration or by consent reached by mutual concessions b : something intermediate between or blending qualities of two different things . ”
This is what happens when I want something and you want another – we wind up with something that splits the difference .
The other definition is a little more sinister , though : “ a concession to something derogatory or prejudicial . ”
In this sense of the word compromise signals a breach , a failing , a loss of position or stature or well - being .
We can have our security compromised .
We can have our principles compromised .
We can have our democracy compromised .
I ’m beginning to think that Rep. Udall and his collaborationist fellow Dems are using this sense of compromise instead of the first .
I know the Republicans want and need us scared , and sadly the Democrats have been all too willing to help .
But there are still a few of us who do n’t want our liberty compromised .
We do n’t want the word compromise anywhere near the 4th Amendment .
We want representatives who understand , as we do , that if we undermine our freedoms , al Qaeda can go ahead and declare victory , pack up and go home to their families .
I ’m not going to be so extreme as to suggest that if telecom immunity passes then the terrorists have won the war , but I ’d be a fool not to acknowledge that they ’ve won a meaningful skirmish .
Congressman Udall , you ’ve compromised on the Constitution .
And while I ’m not so stupid as to invest a lot of faith in elected politicians of any party – even if that pol is a “ Boulder librul ” – there ’s no getting around a sad fact : you ’ve compromised my trust .
Time will tell if , in doing so , you ’ve also compromised your chances of victory in November .

Hillary Clinton is expected to concede defeat in the race for the Democratic nomination against front - runner Barack Obama
Senior advisers to Senator Hillary Clinton prepared the ground yesterday for her to abandon her presidential ambitions within days rather than disputing the Democratic nomination all the way to the party convention in August .
Senator Barack Obama is expected to be able to declare himself the party 's candidate against Senator John McCain as early as tomorrow , when South Dakota and Montana become the final states to hold their primaries .
Just after the polls close , Mr Obama , who could be accompanied by senior Democratic Party figures , is to hold a huge rally in Minnesota , at the venue where Mr McCain is due to accept the Republican nomination in September .
His aides were working furiously yesterday to amass the two dozen or so ' super - delegates ' -- party officials whose convention votes are not tied to the primaries -- he would need to ensure that the South Dakota and Montana results would give him a majority .
Terry McAuliffe , Mrs Clinton 's campaign chairman , told ABC News : " We 'll see where we are when we finish up Tuesday .
Then super - delegates will begin to move .
But we 're going to make our argument right up until someone has that number . ''
Howard Dean , the Democratic National Committee chairman , said it would be decided this week : " We do n't want to go to the convention , have a big fight at the convention , and lose the presidency . ''
A dispute over whether and how to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida was resolved on Saturday by giving each delegate only half a vote as a penalty for those states defying the party by holding early primaries .
The Clinton camp was unhappy with the decision , which raised the number of delegates needed for victory from 2,025 to 2,118 , but showed little appetite to challenge .
Stake
According to the non-aligned RealClearPolitics website , Mr Obama has 2,051 delegates to Mrs Clinton 's 1,876 .
There were 55 delegates at stake in Puerto Rico , which voted yesterday and 31 will be at stake in South Dakota and Montana .
Mrs Clinton was expected to win in Puerto Rico while Mr Obama appears to have clear leads in the last two states .
If the two candidates split the delegates , that would leave Mr Obama needing just 24 of the remaining 178 undecided super - delegates for outright victory .
Even Harold Ickes , Mrs Clinton 's fearsomely combative senior adviser , appeared to be close to conceding defeat .
When asked whether the former First Lady would congratulate Mr Obama tomorrow , he said : " We expect to get the nomination and we 're making the case . ''
Last week , Mrs Clinton said she expected undecided super - delegates to make up their mind quickly after tomorrow .
Her rapidly fading hopes rested on her being able to persuade 90pc of them to overturn Mr Obama 's delegate lead because of her contention that she would be the stronger candidate against Mr McCain .

An unusual coalition of interest groups from left and right is launching a drive today to head off an American military attack on Iran by pushing America into high - level negotiations with Tehran .
The Campaign for a New American Policy on Iran , which bills itself as " transpartisan , " consists of more than three dozen organizations , most of them left - leaning , such as the American Friends Service Committee , the Institute for Policy Studies , and the Open Society Policy Center , which is backed by George Soros .
However , the campaign also has the backing of a smattering of right - of - center groups , including the American Conservative Defense Alliance , the Libertarian Party , and the American Cause , which is headed by Patrick Buchanan .
" The current rumor here in Washington is that Bush will attack after the November elections so it wo n't hurt the Republican nominee politically .
Many around him say he feels he has to do something before he leaves office , " a campaign organizer , Carah Ong of the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation , said .
" Part of this is to raise the fact that a military attack is likely and it needs to be prevented . "
The campaign to push for direct talks with Iran 's mullahs is kicking off with a press conference this morning on Capitol Hill expected to feature the Libertarian nominee for president , Robert Barr , as well as several members of Congress , including Reps.
Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Barbara Lee of California , both Democrats , and Rep. Ron Paul , who mounted a bid for this year 's Republican presidential nomination .
Brandishing red telephones supposed to symbolize a hotline to Tehran , the group will urge supporters to call Congress and press for talks .
The campaign 's lobbying day follows close on the heels of a lobbying effort last week by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , which encouraged its members to promote legislation that would put stricter sanctions on Iran .
Ms. Ong said the timing was a coincidence .
Others involved in the talk - to - Iran campaign include a former CIA official , Philip Giraldi ; a former adviser to President Reagan , Douglas Bandow ; a former State Department official , Flynt Leverett , and the president and founder of the National Iranian American Council , Trita Parsi .
Messrs .
Leverett and Parsi are best known for asserting that in 2003 the Bush administration essentially ignored a proposal for a " grand bargain " peace deal in which Iran proposed to normalize relations with America .
Current and former administration officials have said they did not consider the proposal serious because of the diplomatic route by which it arrived and because of contradictory signs from Iranian officials .
Ms .
Ong said the new campaign grew out of a meeting of liberals and conservatives in November 2007 at the headquarters of Americans for Tax Reform in Washington .
A spokesman for that group said it was not involved in the Iran issue .
The president of the American Conservative Defense Alliance , Michael Ostrolenk , said his group has office space in the building and borrowed the conference room for the session .
" With the Iraq war ... there was not enough left - right effort against the war to prevent it from being launched , " Mr. Ostrolenk said .
" Iran is not a direct threat against the United States .
They are a threat against other players in the region , but as a conservative , I 'm more concerned with the United States . "
One advocate of a tough line toward Tehran , Michael Ledeen of the American Enterprise Institute , disputed the coalition 's suggestion that America has been unwilling to talk with Iran .
" We 've tried everything .
There 's no stick we have n't brandished .
There 's no carrot we have n't dangled , " he said .
" They do n't want us .
They 're our enemies . "
Some campaign participants could draw unwanted notoriety to the effort .
Last year , federal prosecutors named one member of the coalition , the Council on American Islamic Relations , as an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal case linking the Texas - based Holy Land Foundation and Hamas .
Cair denied the claim and asked a judge to strike the co-conspirator list from the public record .
Jurors acquitted the defendants on some counts and could not reach a verdict on most , but Cair 's motion was never ruled on .
Mr. Bandow was a senior fellow at the Cato Institute but resigned in 2005 after it was disclosed that he had taken money to write op - ed pieces favorable to clients of a lobbyist at the heart of an influence - peddling scandal , Jack Abramoff .

BBC removes Doctor
Who fan ’s knitting patterns from the Web
Update #2 : The BBC have agreed to meet with Mazz and turn her knitted designs into , at the very least , a limited edition of exclusive promotional products .
Apparently the production team love her works and can’t wait to get their own .
Although we ’re pleased with this outcome , intellectual property law is still in urgent need of reform and similar situations will continue to arise until this is addressed .
The Government have agreed to look at the question and popular outcry over this story shows the urgency of the matter .
Update :
Thanks to this article published by The Times today , the ORG phones have been buzzing all morning .
BBC Worldwide have released a statement ( copied in the comments below ) and Mazz has updated her homepage to reflect what ’s been going on .
If you appreciate the work ORG does to raise the profile of digital rights issues like this one , please consider becoming an Open Rights Group supporter .
The Open Rights Group often receive calls from UK citizens who have found themselves on the wrong end of online copyright disputes .
Because we ’re not a legal advice service , very often we cannot offer them any help .
We ’re working on a way to change this situation – watch this space for an announcement in the Autumn .
In the meantime we tend to pass these queries onto our informal law - discuss list for further analysis .
This week , Andres Guadamuz , who sits on the list , has published details of a very interesting dispute between the BBC and a knitting enthusiast and Doctor Who fan who goes by the screen name of Mazzmatazz .
Mazz has been posting knitting patterns to help other people re-create characters from the cult series using only two sticks and ball of wool .
Impressive ?
The BBC , producers of the series , did n’t think so .
They sent Mazz a letter , which states :
“ We note that you are supplying DR WHO items , and using trade marks and copyright owned by BBC .
You have not been given permission to use the DR WHO brand and we ask that you remove from your site any designs connected with DR WHO .
Please reply acknowledging receipt of this email , and confirm that you will remove the DR WHO items as requested . ”
Fearing legal action , Mazz has now removed the knitting patterns from the Web .
As part of our response to OfCom ’s public service broadcasting review , we ’ll be making arguments similar to those we made last Summer during the iPlayer / DRM debate .
That is , that in the future , organisations like the BBC with a public service remit should have a role in stimulating the creative economy in the UK , by allowing budding creators to remix its content .
Even if this is only allowed to happen in a non-commercial context , the BBC could seed a new generation of creators and remixers , just as it nurtured a generation of computer games developers in the 1980s with its computer literacy project , centred around the iconic BBC micro .
This approach does n’t mean giving all the BBC ’s content away for free , although in some situations that might be appropriate .
But it does mean being more flexible in the approach the BBC takes to controlling who gets to use its content and how .
The approach the BBC have taken with Mazz ’s knitting patterns demonstrate a distinct lack of flexibility .
It is quite possible that through transforming the characters in Doctor Who into knitting patterns , Mazz may have infringed upon the BBC ’s copyright .
But it ’s hard to see how Mazz ’s non-commercial knitting patterns actually damage the commercial interests of the BBC .
The situation also touches on the growing need for UK copyright law to allow transformative use of works .
In 2006 , the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property asked the UK Intellectual Property Office to propose amendments to the European Copyright Directive that allowed for creative , transformative or derivative works .
In ORG ’s recent submission to the UK IPO , we urged the UK IPO to take this recommendation forward .
For a compelling legal analysis of the issues that Mazz ’s sitaution touches upon , including the tricky area of transformative use of works , visit Andres ’s blog , Technollama .
Maricopa County law enforcement violated the constitutional rights of this newspaper 's readers in October .
Using secret grand jury subpoenas , County Attorney Andrew Thomas sought records that would reveal the identity of anyone who'd looked at New Times online in the past four years .
When the paper 's leaders revealed the grand jury probe in a cover story , sheriff 's deputies arrested them .
The assault on New Times began in 2004 when the paper published Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's address as part of an investigation into his hidden commercial real estate transactions .
Arpaio demanded that the newspaper be prosecuted under an arcane statute that makes it illegal to publish law enforcement officers ' addresses in cyberspace , even though that data is readily available on government Web sites and is perfectly legal to publish on newsprint .
Thomas responded by appointing a special prosecutor , who demanded not only the records and e-mails of the paper 's writers and editors — but also sought sensitive information on the Internet - viewing habits of our readers .
On October 18 , New Times published a cover story revealing the invasive subpoenas .
That story violated grand jury secrecy statutes , but the revelations in the article , compounded by the subsequent arrest of Village Voice Media Executive Editor Michael Lacey and CEO Jim Larkin , sparked public outrage .
County Attorney Thomas fired the special prosecutor and dropped all charges .
He also abandoned the Arpaio - inspired probe of the paper .
As the smoke began to clear , this newspaper began a series , " Target Practice . "
The project sprang from a fundamental question :
Why did law enforcement — the sheriff and the county attorney — believe they could force a newspaper to reveal the identities and habits of the publication 's readers ?
Our investigation has made one thing clear : Maricopa County 's sheriff has a vivid history of ignoring the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
He 's trampled the rights of prisoners , political enemies , and media critics .
In partnership with the county attorney , the pair have expanded their enemies list to include the judiciary and immigrants .
Private citizens and their Internet - viewing records were merely the latest victims in a long line .
" Target Practice " seeks to explain how we arrived at this moment .
Like most attorneys , Kathleen Carey leads a busy life .
So she did n't take much time to examine what looked like a pimple on her arm .
Twelve days later , Carey 's arm had ballooned to nearly twice its normal size , and pus was oozing from a boil where the zit had been .
After $ 180,000 in medical bills , four doctors , and two hospitals , Carey learned that the supposed pimple was actually the flesh - eating " superbug " bacteria commonly known as MRSA staph infection .
You may recognize MRSA from recent news reports , following a study concluding that more Americans die each year from antibiotic - resistant MRSA infections than from HIV / AIDS .
MRSA commonly spreads through hospitals , but Carey had n't been to a hospital or doctor for months before her infection .
So where did she get the potentially fatal infection ?
Carey says she knows exactly where she got it — the Maricopa County Jail .
She was n't there as an inmate , but as an attorney visiting her client .
She was used to inmates complaining about skin infections .
Then one day after her visit , Carey noticed the zit .
Two weeks later , she was in the hospital with an IV in her arm .
Now , more than a year after her hospitalization , she still has a scar from the ordeal .
The damage did n't stop there .
Once Carey learned about the deadly and contagious nature of MRSA infections , she paid to have her home professionally cleaned .
Everything was sanitized , she was told .
Two months after Carey 's battle with MRSA , her 17 - year - old son asked to use her computer .
Within 48 hours , he contracted the same strain of MRSA .
Even with the family 's early detection and knowledge about MRSA , he nearly lost his arm to the aggressive flesh - eating bacteria .
He now has a two - inch scar where the infection began .
Carey is one of many Maricopa County residents who 've never been booked into Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's jails but who are paying dearly for conditions inside his lockups .
Vermin , filth , medical care suggestive of POW camps , chronic mismanagement , the wanton destruction of records , and a steady parade of corpses in Maricopa County jails have cost taxpayers an astonishing — and until now , undisclosed — 41.4 million dollars .
Joe Arpaio has perpetuated his reign as " America 's toughest sheriff " with an open checkbook .
Your open checkbook .
The Sheriff has captured the imagination of voters with his almost cartoonish contempt for the prisoners in his charge .
He 's subjected inmates to pink underwear , chain gangs , and rancid bologna sandwiches , and he 's garnered big wins at the polls .
But Arpaio 's jail policies have generated a tsunami of lawsuits from prisoners and their families .
There simply is n't another jail system in America with this history of taxpayer - financed litigation .
New York City , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Houston , for example , collectively housed more than 61,000 inmates per day last year .
From 2004 through November of this year , these same county jails had a combined 43 prison - conditions lawsuits filed against them in federal courts .
In the very same three - year time frame , despite housing a mere 9,200 prisoners per day , Sheriff Arpaio was the target of a staggering 2,150 lawsuits in U.S. District Court and hundreds more in Maricopa County courts .
With a fraction of the inmate population , Arpaio has had 50 times as many lawsuits as the New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Houston jail systems combined .
Based on records produced under the Freedom of Information Act , a review of federal and state records and a comparison with other correctional facilities , the picture that emerges is clear : Cruelty costs .
Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office spokesman Paul Chagolla refused to arrange an interview with Arpaio for this story .
Earlier this month , the front pages of local daily newspapers were dominated by stories about the sheriff exceeding his budget by a million dollars .
The courthouse was shuttered for a day .
Positions were slashed , and visiting hours for attorneys and court personnel were cut drastically .
Naturally , that meant another lawsuit ( Arpaio lost and has appealed ) .
County taxpayers have footed an undisclosed fortune to sustain Arpaio 's image as a tough lawman .
The $ 41.4 million taxpayers coughed up to insure for , defend , or settle lawsuits is just the edge of the cesspool — one result of inhumane conditions that have long made Arpaio 's jails the target of investigations from both the federal government and advocates like Amnesty International .
Arpaio has an 11 - year history of ignoring expert warnings that his jails violate basic tenets of the U.S. Constitution and threaten life and limb .
At least 11 inmate deaths have directly resulted from Arpaio 's refusal to heed such warnings .
In that time , the deductible for the county 's insurance policy to cover lawsuits against the sheriff has jumped from $ 1 million to $ 5 million .
The annual premium has quadrupled in recent years .
These dollars come out of the county 's coffers , not from Arpaio 's annual budget of $ 288 million , which he 's already overrunning this year .
And which is $ 60 million more than the sheriff budget in a county jail of similar size in Houston .
While the sheriff has long argued that his crude jails prevent crime , a study that his office commissioned , and that cost $ 19,900 , found that Arpaio 's jails have no effect on inmate recidivism .
Despite the cost , the primary victims of Arpaio 's mismanagement are not taxpayers , or even attorneys like Kathleen Carey , but indigent inmates like Michelle McCollum .
McCollum , who was arrested for drug possession , could not make bail and , therefore , waited for trial in Arpaio 's lockup .
She eventually was sentenced to nothing more than probation .
A medical test administered when McCollum was admitted to jail confirmed that she was pregnant .
On August 22 , 2005 , McCollum sat on the concrete floor of the Fourth Avenue Jail , a facility un-affectionately known by inmates as " The Matrix " ( because the lights never turn off ) .
She longed for a mattress and tried hard to overlook the rotting food and soiled feminine napkins on the floor .
Suddenly , two inmates attacked her , pummeling her face , back , and abdomen .
McCollum and another cellmate reported the beating to detention officers , pleaded for medical help , and reminded deputies that McCollum was pregnant and had been hit in the stomach .
McCollum also put in a medical request to the infirmary .
No doctor or nurse looked in upon the injured McCollum .
Two days later , McCollum sat in the courthouse , chained to a row of inmates , when she started to bleed .
She bled for five hours , looking frighteningly like Stephen King 's infamous Carrie .
The inmates chained to McCollum to await their arraignments began to complain .
Detention officers ignored the prisoners .
When she arrived at the E - Pod in Sheriff Arpaio 's Estrella Jail , a bloodstained McCollum again told guards about her beating and her need for medical care .
An officer put in a priority request for medical attention , but nobody came .
Alarmed at McCollum 's loss of blood , a guard finally ushered her to see a doctor .
Infirmary workers called an ambulance and rushed McCollum to Maricopa Medical Center .
Doctors there found her baby with an ultrasound , but they could n't find the baby 's heartbeat .
The baby was dead .
Doctors told the jail guards that McCollum must return to the hospital in two days — on August 26 — to see if the fetus would pass on its own .
Ten days later , the jail had yet to deliver McCollum to her hospital appointment .
On September 5 , while McCollum stood holding her tray in the food line , the bleeding started again .
Still , nothing was done .
Three weeks after the ignored doctor 's appointment , McCollum was finally rushed to the county hospital for the second time .
She had lost so much blood that doctors gave her a massive blood transfusion .
Then they removed the dead fetus .
It 's important to note that McCollum had n't been convicted of a crime .
Like inmates whose deaths are recounted later in this story , McCollum was awaiting trial — innocent under the law .
Ignored cries for medical attention and resulting agony are not uncommon in Arpaio 's jails .
" Only 40 percent of inmate sick - call requests are responded to in a timely manner . . .
Because sick - call requests are not responded to in a timely manner and health appraisals are not completed within the required time frames , an inmate 's health status is likely to deteriorate while in the custody of Maricopa County , " concludes an audit of jail conditions done for the county two years before McCollum lost her baby .
Every sheriff gets sued over jail conditions .
The problem is that Joe Arpaio gets sued thousands of times more than any of the others .
Before Arpaio 's reign , Maricopa County did n't bother to pay for liability insurance .
And with good reason — the county was n't losing multimillion - dollar lawsuits or paying families millions to settle their claims .
Peter Crowley , Maricopa County 's risk manager , says the county 's insurance rates have skyrocketed during Arpaio 's tenure .
" I was n't here back when [ the Scott Norberg case ] happened , " Crowley says of Arpaio 's first major loss , a suit the county settled for $ 8.25 million .
" But I can tell you this :
Our deductible was only $ 1 million a few years back .
Now it 's $ 5 million . "
Early into Arpaio 's reign , county officials realized they needed insurance .
They were able to get a relatively cheap policy , and from 1995 to 1998 , the county paid $ 328,894 a year for an insurance policy with a $ 1 million deductible .
But now , after Arpaio 's lawsuits have cost the county $ 30 million in legal fees and cost insurance companies millions more , it pays four times as much for a policy .
That policy does n't even cover lawsuits under $ 5 million .
Today , Maricopa County pays a yearly premium of $ 1.2 million for outside insurance with a $ 5 million deductible .
For any lawsuit that costs $ 5 million or less , the county foots the entire bill .
It 's the best policy the county can get given Arpaio 's dismal track record .
Since 1995 , that yearly insurance premium alone has cost taxpayers $ 11,345,609 , according to the county 's Risk Management Office .
More staggering is the official grand total of Arpaio 's attorney 's bills , lawsuit settlements and payments : $ 30,039,928 .
Both figures were listed in a report produced by county officials after a recent New Times public - records request .
Combined , they show the cost to insure for and defend against Arpaio lawsuits totals $ 41.4 million .
In Joe Arpaio 's jails , even the paperwork is deadly .
For $ 6 million , the jails could have built a computer database of inmate health problems .
Such a database , advised jail auditor Moore and Associates in 2000 , would improve healthcare for inmates and improve efficiency for jail employees .
Three years after that finding , a 2003 audit concluded , " Personnel report that medication errors occur on a regular basis " and " there is a significant backlog in health - record filing that has been estimated to be between eight months to one year . . . the health records are not current and continuity of care cannot be maintained . "
Five years after that first warning , the jail still had n't built an electronic database for inmate health problems .
Deborah Braillard died as a result .
She had been arrested for riding in a stolen car .
When Braillard , 46 , an insulin - dependent diabetic , started shaking , vomiting , and fading into a diabetic coma , Arpaio 's detention officers decided against taking her to the infirmary .
She had been in perfect health when she entered Arpaio 's jail , but after two days without insulin , she was on the verge of a coma .
Numerous inmates , including Braillard 's cellmates , who rattled cell bars and hollered for guards , say asking for medical treatment in Arpaio 's jails often merits a reply from guards that you 're faking it .
Braillard was n't faking it .
Tamera Harper was one of three Estrella Jail cellmates of Braillard 's who told an identical story of what happened next .
" I woke up to hear Deborah Braillard moaning and crying for help .
The detention officers moved her to a television room to keep her from disturbing other inmates , " Harper wrote in a court declaration .
The detention officers did n't take Braillard to the jail infirmary .
The cellmates all say that when officers flopped Braillard back into her bunk the next morning , January 23 , 2005 , she was unconscious .
The inmates attempted to feed Braillard sugar , but she began convulsing .
Jail employees eventually arrived , lifted Braillard into a wheelchair , and opted for non-emergency transport to the Maricopa County Medical Center , where she was quickly transferred to the intensive care unit .
Hospital doctors reversed the diabetic coma with basic insulin and fluids .
But the damage was done .
Eighteen days later , Braillard 's daughter Jennifer watched as a county physician , Dr. Scott Van Poppel , declared her mother dead — ultimately from going 70 hours without insulin in Arpaio 's jail .
When Sheriff 's Detective J. Bryant arrived to check out Braillard 's body , he pulled back the blue hospital blanket to note that Braillard 's limbs were swollen , her toes were already black , and her calves were spotted with sores .
Hospital tubes and IVs were still in her body .
The problem is n't just that the jail denied Braillard insulin and refused to treat her .
It 's that the jail knew Braillard was diabetic before she was even arrested .
Like many inmates , Braillard had passed through the jail months earlier .
On that visit , she had marked the jail 's intake sheet , declaring her diabetes .
The jail 's health records documented Braillard 's need for insulin .
Yet , on her second incarceration , jail employees denied her insulin , ignored her cries for help , and failed to get her insulin when she became unconscious .
A shoestring budget - records system of paper folders ( with misspelled and misfiled names ) costs healthcare employees hours of time spent inefficiently , warned the 2000 Moore and Associates audit .
It also probably cost Braillard her life .
An electronic database ( as was standard in most jails of Maricopa County 's size by 2005 ) would surely have shown Braillard was diabetic and saved her life .
Consider that Harris County ( Houston ) , Texas , operates a jail and sheriff 's department of a similar size on a budget of $ 60 million less than Arpaio's .
Harris County is no model jail , but officials there say they 've had an electronic database of inmate health concerns for years .
An electronic database for Maricopa County jails was finally started in July of this year — 18 months after Braillard died and eight years after auditors advised its installation .
The $ 6 million database was commissioned not by Arpaio but by healthcare officials , on the advice of a third - party consulting company recently hired by the county to " turn around " jail healthcare .
The database should be finished by 2012 — 13 years after it was recommended and seven years after Braillard 's death .
Even without the database and even with detention officers misdiagnosing her , Braillard should not have died .
Fearing the ineptitude of Arpaio 's jails , Braillard 's friend , Deborah Fouts , faxed a note to the jail at 9:42 p.m. the night before Braillard went into diabetic coma .
The note reminded Correctional Health Services , the jail 's healthcare agency , that Braillard was diabetic and would die without insulin .
" Inmate Braillard , Booking # P037486 is diabetic and has not had insulin for two days , " Fouts wrote in the fax , sent to the sheriff and the jail infirmary .
So what happened ?
An internal Sheriff 's Office report after Braillard 's death concluded that the faxed note " slipped through the cracks . "
And with a quick point of the finger to nobody in particular , Arpaio 's detectives wrapped up the investigation .
Physicians and attorneys outside the jail say it 's still common for prescriptions to slip through those same cracks that killed Braillard .
They say inmates are being denied medication for diabetes , seizures , high blood pressure , asthma , thyroid conditions , and mental health disorders .
Braillard 's was a costly slip - up indeed , not only for her , but for the county and its taxpayers .
The county now faces a wrongful - death lawsuit brought by attorney Michael Manning , who has collected more than $ 18 million in settlements and judgments from wrongful deaths in Arpaio 's jails .
Like the thousands of other lawsuits against Arpaio , it 's impossible to predict the outcome of the suit by Braillard 's family .
Easier to calculate are the multimillion - dollar suits Arpaio already has lost from deaths that would have been prevented if Arpaio had only listened to expert warnings .
On March 29 , 2006 , a $ 9 million court judgment was leveled against Arpaio and the county in the beating and restraint - chair death of inmate Charles Agster III .
Agster , 33 and mentally retarded , was arrested for trespassing on August 6 , 2001 .
Detention officers at the Madison Street Jail pulled a hood over his head and slammed him into a medieval - looking restraint chair .
The hood around Agster 's throat smothered him to the point that he became brain dead .
He was pronounced legally dead three days later on August 9 , 2001 .
Agster 's death should have been prevented .
Two years before he was killed , the county had paid $ 8.25 million to settle the Norberg suffocation suit .
Surveillance video shows officers wrestled Scott Norberg into a restraining chair , bound his mouth with a towel , and continued to beat and Taser him after he was handcuffed .
Even after the multimillion - dollar payout to Norberg 's family , Arpaio kept using the chairs — costing Agster his life and the county another $ 9 million .
But , really , the restraint chairs should have been discarded before that first payout .
Three years before the Norberg settlement , in 1996 , detention expert Eugene Miller warned Arpaio , " The best recommendation I can professionally make in respect to the Restraint Chair is to remove it from any use associated with the MCSO jail . "
Then in 1997 , Amnesty International protested the restraint chairs — an odd move considering that Amnesty usually focuses on prison conditions in Third World countries .
The U.S. Department of Justice also took Arpaio to court twice over the chairs and other concerns .
In December 2005 , Clint Yarbrough died as Norberg and Agster had died — bound and suffocated in a restraint chair .
On April 18 , 2007 , the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors approved a classified settlement in excess of $ 1 million to Yarbrough 's family .
Norberg , Agster , and Yarbrough were never tried for the charges they were arrested on .
They did n't live to see their first court dates .
These legally innocent Maricopa County residents died in Arpaio 's jails because the sheriff refused to listen to expert advice .
They 're not the only ones .
Arpaio ignored warnings from experts about suicidal inmates , as well .
Even before the sheriff was warned about understaffing , unorganized records , and restraint chairs , the Department of Justice warned him that his mental wards were unfit for suicidal inmates .
Arpaio's refusal to heed that Justice Department 's warning led to at least four more preventable jail deaths .
Months before Thomas Bruce Cooley , 44 , was found hanging by his bed sheets in his Madison Street Jail cell , a federal inspector told Arpaio that his psychiatric ward was a tragedy waiting to happen .
The 1996 report specifically cautioned that inmates could use " overhanging structures " to hang themselves .
" Given that acutely psychotic patients are housed at Madison jail , psychiatric housing there is dangerous , " the DOJ report stated .
" Acute psychiatric patients should not be allowed in this unit unless major structural and staffing deficiencies are corrected . "
After Cooley 's death , at least three of Arpaio 's other psychiatric inmates died in the same manner .
In 2003 , the Arizona House of Representatives passed a bill requiring that jail healthcare meet national standards .
The Department of Justice has also required Arpaio to meet national jail standards .
But neither government body has taken steps to make sure Arpaio is meeting its standards .
And according to the county 's own auditors , he is n't .
They say Arpaio 's jails fail to meet constitutional and state standards required by law .
In 2003 , the county hired Jon Bosch , a corrections consultant with 20 years of experience , to audit Arpaio 's jails .
" The current correctional healthcare program at Maricopa County is not in compliance with the basic healthcare rights provided to inmates under the U.S. Constitution , " Bosch concluded .
He found that Arpaio 's jails violate the Eighth Amendment prohibiting " cruel and unusual punishment . "
National jail inspectors like Bosch are not bleeding - heart prisoner advocates .
They 're a jaded breed familiar with corrections law and have spent decades walking the stinking , cramped corridors of jails .
Bosch would be out of a job if he threw claims of constitutional violation around casually in the hundreds of jails he audits .
Attempts to interview Bosch , who still works as a corrections auditor , were unsuccessful .
In addition to constitutional violations , Arpaio 's jails have also broken Arizona law , according to another county - hired inspector .
" The Sheriff is required to verify that healthcare services are [ in ] compliance with nationally accepted correctional healthcare standards .
The current program would not qualify , " concluded the 2003 Maricopa County Correctional Health Services Staffing Proposal Draft .
Under Arizona law , Arpaio must obtain certificates showing successful inspections and keep this certification on file .
Despite the statute , when New Times asked to see these certificates , Arpaio spokesman Paul Chagolla said he could not hand them over because the sheriff no longer keeps them .
In the next breath , Chagolla assured New Times that the jails do meet the required standards .
Arpaio has paid no more attention to federal mandates .
On December 6 , 1999 , Arpaio agreed to change a number of jail policies after federal attorneys took the sheriff to court a second time over alleged civil rights abuses .
" We have concluded that unconstitutional conditions exist at the Jails with respect to ( 1 ) the use of excessive force against inmates and ( 2 ) deliberate indifference to inmates ' serious medical needs , " stated a federal audit of jail conditions .
The DOJ wrote up a civil rights " settlement " that Arpaio signed .
However , records show that not once in the past seven years have the feds checked to see if Arpaio made the changes he promised .
According to local inspections , as well as complaints from inmates , Arpaio ignored the following terms of the settlement :
• " Inmates assigned to tents will have free access to adequate cooled interior areas . "
• " Inmates will have free access to adequate indoor toilet facilities 24 hours per day , and inmates will have adequate access to shower facilities . "
• " All Medical Request Forms received will be triaged by [ Correctional Health Services ] nurses within 24 hours . "
• " Inmates may make oral requests for medical attention . "
• " When an inmate has not received prescribed medication relating to infectious , chronic , or life - threatening conditions during a regular medication [ distribution ] , the nurse will take appropriate action to ensure that the inmate receives the medication as soon as is feasible . "
When the DOJ put Arpaio in a headlock , he cried " uncle " by claiming he had implemented a list of to - dos .
But he has n't , and the Justice Department has n't made him .
Health code violations in Arpaio 's kitchens go beyond the usual jailhouse whining about the quality of chow .
The conditions cited by inspectors create a breeding climate for disease .
Arpaio 's mess halls routinely fail reviews by Maricopa County Environmental Services inspectors — the same inspectors who monitor restaurants and public facilities across the county .
County Attorney Andrew Thomas could literally shut down Arpaio 's jails and arrest the sheriff for criminal public health violations .
That 's exactly what Thomas did last year to a number of Phoenix restaurant owners whose kitchens had fewer violations than Arpaio's .
During Thomas ' botched " Dirty Dining Crackdown , " he pursued Tepic Restaurant 's owner with criminal charges that resulted in jail time , fines and two years of probation .
He also held a press conference to announce the criminal charges against the owners of Ajo Al's .
The owners demanded a trial ; Thomas lost .
Another targeted restaurant during this campaign had only four violations .
Meanwhile , a single one of Arpaio 's jail kitchens has netted more than 30 such violations in the past two years .
Here 's a glimpse into Arpaio 's kitchens based on county inspection reports from Environmental Services :
• Roaches are frequently spotted swarming behind major appliances , scuttling through food - preparation stations and lurking where food is stored .
The presence of flies and rodents is routine .
• " Pest control is not properly performed , " noted one report dryly .
• Just as prevalent are piles of rodent excrement and nests polluting food areas .
More alarming , inspectors repeatedly note the presence of rodents and rodent feces in the water wells .
• Sanitation is hardly better .
Inspectors report human waste on shower floors , standing water , a frequent lack of hot water and , again , vermin infestations .
While chain gangs outside the jail garner national publicity for Sheriff Joe , his captive pool of labor is not directed to clean the festering conditions inside the jails .
Instead , this cesspool breeds contagious infections that healthcare employees can only hope to contain .
When Arpaio 's culture of violence has produced corpses and lawsuits , his staff has destroyed records and faked documents repeatedly .
In fact , Arpaio 's first major legal payout of $ 8.25 million came as the result of obvious records tampering by the Sheriff 's Office .
Attorney Mike Manning had smoking - gun proof that jail employees fabricated a fake health intake report for Scott Norberg ( who died after being beaten by guards and strapped into a restraint chair ) .
Not only that , but half of Norberg 's postmortem X - rays were missing , and his name was deleted from the X - ray logbook .
So conclusive was the proof of records destruction that the county opted to pay Norberg 's family to drop the case .
In other words , the county 's legal experts looked at the evidence of records - tampering and decided they would be better off not letting the case get to court .
A further obvious effort to destroy records was proved in March 2006 , when Arpaio lost a wrongful - death suit filed by the family of Charles Agster III .
During the Agster court case , jail nurse Betty Lewis testified that jail authorities commanded her to create a series of false documents after Agster 's death .
Some of Agster 's health records also disappeared from the jail , and his falsified booking number did n't exist until the day after he was transferred out of the jail into the hospital .
The Agster case also documented a second nurse who collaborated with sheriff 's detention officers to make up fake entries and notes after Agster 's death .
Next month , on January 8 , 2008 , a trial is scheduled in Maricopa Superior Court in a lawsuit filed by deceased inmate Brian Crenshaw 's family .
The family can't present jail - records evidence because the Sheriff 's Office destroyed it — even after the court ordered it to hand over the evidence .
Crenshaw , 40 , was legally blind and serving a short sentence in Tent City for shoplifting .
After a documented struggle with Arpaio 's detention officers , Crenshaw was transferred to solitary confinement at the Madison Street Jail .
Six days later , he was found comatose in his cell with a broken neck , ruptured intestines , broken toes , and severe internal injuries .
Only sheriff 's guards had contact with Crenshaw in his cell , but Arpaio still maintains that Crenshaw sustained the life - ending injuries when he fell off his four - foot bed .
On September 26 , 2006 , the court ordered Arpaio 's office to produce the jail 's videotaped recordings that lawyers suspected would have shown officers beating Crenshaw .
Then , on August 31 , 2007 , nearly a year later , the sheriff 's attorney replied that the records had been destroyed — even after multiple requests and court orders to preserve the videotapes .
In November , New Times requested information about antibiotic - resistant MRSA staph infections and inmate - reported spider bites ( which national jail experts say are often actually MRSA or other staph infections ) among inmates .
Betty Adams , the jail 's interim healthcare director , officially answered that the jail tracks spider bites .
" Data indicates zero occurrences for 2004 , 2005 , 2006 and 2007 year - to - date , " Adams wrote .
Ironically , Arpaio 's spokesmen have said exactly the opposite .
On April 23 , 2006 , Arpaio 's publicists told the Arizona Republic , " Inmates routinely complain about spider bites at Tent City . "
Somehow , jail healthcare officials say they have recorded " zero " spider bites when asked in the context of deadly and contagious MRSA staph infections .
Yet inmates " routinely " complain about spider bites when asked in the context of a puff story highlighting animals in the jail .
Whatever the statistics on spider bites actually are , attorney Kathleen Carey , who caught MRSA while visiting her client in jail , says deputies take precautions to protect themselves .
" In court , you 'll often see detention officers wearing gloves .
That 's because they do n't want to catch MRSA from the inmates , " Carey says .
Jail healthcare directors reported 41 incidents of " lab confirmed " MRSA infections in the 2006 - 07 fiscal year .
They also reported " zero " spider bites from 2004 to 2007 .
At the same time , multiple caseworkers , attorneys , and inmates have reported rampant skin infections and spider bites in the jails .
Attorney Carey is living proof that infectious diseases are n't confined behind bars .
They spread to the general public from the jail through lawyers , guards , caseworkers , hospitals , courtrooms , and released inmates .
Other counties and the Centers for Disease Control have targeted MRSA in jails , but jail healthcare officials refuse to produce a policy on the flesh - eating bacteria — if they have one .
Interim Correctional Health director Adams told New Times , " CHS does not maintain a database that shows the number or frequency of categories of health concerns . "
Adams then canceled a previously scheduled interview with New Times to discuss MRSA and other infectious diseases among inmates .
She also did n't produce requested records of MRSA - related deaths in the jails .
Even without official statistics , it is n't hard to confirm that MRSA is killing inmates .
Dr. Patrick O'Neill is one of the last doctors to see patients dying of MRSA at the Maricopa Medical Center , where Arpaio 's office sends dying inmates .
O'Neill says , " The majority of [ MRSA ] patients I see will come from jail , either the sheriff 's or the prison system's .
You also have to realize the ones I see are the most severe cases .
There could be a whole other class of patients that our ER guys see , whereas I only see the nearly dying . "
Requests to interview county hospital emergency room physician Dr. Frank LoVecchio went unanswered .
But there 's good reason to believe LoVecchio sees MRSA cases , as well .
He just received an $ 8.9 million federal grant to study MRSA infections .
O'Neil says patients who do n't die from organ failure or other MRSA - related causes require amputation or skin excising .
" I only typically see patients who are sick enough to require the inpatient hospitalization and treatment .
So there are a whole lot more who have the less - complicated skin and skin- structure infections , " O'Neil says .
O'Neil would n't estimate the actual number of MRSA patients he sees , from the jails or otherwise , but he says , " I do know that it 's increasing , and it 's something we 're very aware of . "
Former inmate Jay Carey had an MRSA infection when he entered the jail .
Despite telling jail employees about the contagious and deadly infection , he says he was left in the general jail population and did n't see a jail physician until the day before his release .
In a court complaint , Carey also says a jail nurse then told him and his attorney , " We handle these MRSA cases all the time .
We know what we 're doing . "
In all fairness , MRSA thrives in jails and prisons across the country .
It 's just that other jails are doing something about the problem .
For example :
• Los Angeles County Jail authorities identified MRSA as a major problem in 2002 , and invited federal and clinical researchers in to help study and contain the MRSA " superbug . "
• In October of this year , the Tulsa County Jail in Oklahoma scrubbed its entire 1,700 - cell facility with a chemical bacteria killer that targeted MRSA .
• County jails in Kentucky created a MRSA training course so corrections officers can identify MRSA - infected inmates within 24 hours and take them to health officials .
Meanwhile , Maricopa County inmates report skin infections weeks before treatment — if they get medical attention at all .
As the infections ooze , they contaminate the overcrowded cells and spread to other inmates .
Recent figures estimate that 70 percent of inmates are pretrial detainees .
Meaning many of them will soon walk out of court hearings and back to their lives outside jail .
One inmate tells of getting the infection on her buttock after she sat on a toilet in the jail .
Inmates with skin infections interviewed for this story reported a two - to - three - week wait to see a jail physician — even after filling out medical requests to report staph or skin infections .
" The operation of the jail facilities is a constitutional mandate of the sheriff and the delivery of medical services within the jail system falls within that constitutional mandate , " Arpaio wrote in an October 7 , 2004 , memo to the County Board of Supervisors .
This proves that Sheriff Joe Arpaio clearly understands that he is responsible for the conditions in his jails — even though he does little to improve them .
The decrepit health and sanitary conditions within Arpaio 's jails breed lawsuits as well as disease .
The cost to taxpayers to finance this culture of cruelty is $ 41.4 million , and counting .
The $ 41.4 million is just the edge of the cesspool — a single result of standards that have long made Arpaio 's jails the target of investigations from both the federal government and advocates like Amnesty International .

“ Sony represents some great building blocks to make the transformation of Apple Computer into Apple , the electronics company .
Owning Sony would combine the strengths of two great companies into a conglomerate that might blow the competition away .
Sony has recently lost its way and needs focus to regain its former glory .
Its value is down enough to make it a takeover target in the right situation , ” Greg Mills writes over in our Opinion section today .
“ Apple has a big fat bank account , a virtual mountain of cash and perhaps it is time to spend some of it to control Sony .
There are a lot of creative ways to do it and I wonder if the thought has crossed the mind of Mr. Jobs .
I am thinking Wall Street would like the idea .
And Sony might even favor a merger as well , ” Mills writes .

Britain 's economy is tipping headlong into a recession that could last more than a year and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs , warns Professor David Blanchflower , a member of the Bank of England 's interest rate committee , in an interview with the Guardian today .
Blanchflower says the Bank must cut interest rates rapidly to prevent the downturn being too painful , and thinks the UK could be in for a worse time than even the United States , where interest rates have already been slashed and taxes cut to stimulate the economy .
The economist said the recent rises in unemployment are " the tip of the iceberg " .
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit is 840,000 but the broader measure of unemployment is 1.6 million , 5.2 % of the workforce .
Blanchflower said it could climb to more than 7 % - a figure that would mean several hundred thousand people losing their jobs .
His warning comes days after the chancellor acknowledged that the slowdown could be " profound " and hinted he would change the Treasury 's fiscal rules as the slowing economy looks set to bust them .
Today a leading thinktank , the Ernst & Young Item Club , says the economic outlook for Britain is like a " horror movie " as a result of the credit crunch and tumbling house prices .
Blanchflower has been voting for interest rates cuts for nine months but is unhappy that the other eight members of the monetary policy committee are reluctant to cut rates .
" I think we are going into recession and we are probably in one right now .
It 's not too late to stop it but we have to act right now .
Monetary policy has been far too tight for too long . "
He wants interest rates cut sharply and says his colleagues should worry less about the recent rises in inflation , which he thinks will be temporary .
The MPC has cut rates three times since the end of last year to the current 5 % level .
The last reduction was in April , but in May and June the other eight members did not follow Blanchflower in voting for further cuts .
The this month 's vote will not be announced until Wednesday .

Expanding on a program feature that was first launched at last year 's Anime Expo , AX 2008 again features a line - up of four roundtable discussions bringing together key speakers from around the North American anime and manga market .
The first of these , held at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday , July 3 , touched upon probably one of the most controversial issues the industry is coming up against : fansubs .
Over the next hour , eight media , licensing , distribution , production and legal professionals shared their own thoughts and their companies ' views on unauthorized fan distribution of anime .
Anime Insider 's Summer Mullins led the discussion , joined by Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation CEO Trulee Karahashi , Axis Entertainment 's Jeff Conner , Funimation 's Lance Heiskell , Shawne Kleckner ( The Right Stuf International ) , ANN's own Justin Sevakis , Ken Iyadomi of Bandai Entertainment , and Bandai 's general counsel , Cynthia Ishimoto .
Mullin opened the talk by acknowledging that fansubs are an " often emotional and difficult issue " , especially as anime is clearly becoming more and more popular while anime DVD sales have declined by a fifth .
Her first question asked the panelists to talk about how , in their opinion , fansubs have hurt the industry , how - if ever - they have been a help , and whether at least some aspects of fansubbing can be legitimized .
Answering whether fansubs have ever had a legitimate place in anime , Heiskell acknowledged that while illegal , at least at one time , fansubs did spread the word about new anime when there was no other way to educate fans .
Now , however , even the ethic of fansubbing has changed from being involved with promotion to simply a means of showing status as an anime fan .
Justin Sevakis added that from the point of view of the anime industry , fansubs have no had a viable role since at least the midpoint of the " VHS days " , in the mid to late 1990's .
At the same time , for anime consumers , fansubs are still the only way to reacha fairly significant percentage of the titles that are potentially available , and almost the only means to stay current with the latest Japanese releases .
" They are the only choice for any number of series - and that 's a problem , " he concluded .
Heiskell then returned to the history of fansubbing by describing the four generations of fansubs .
In his view , the first generation was marked by original sources taped from Japanese television or copied from Japanese laser disks , and distribution of fansub VHS tapes via the mail .
The next step saw tapes replaced with CD - R's , then , as broadband access grew , came the emergence of peer - to - peer download sites , from Napster to Hotwire , to BitTorrent .
The current - and fourth - stage , about a year and a half old now , is driven by user - created content sites , the most well - known - though by far not the only one of which - is YouTube .
At this stage , fansubbing has gone from something that requires a significant time investment and a level of technical expertise on the part of the potential viewer to mass penetration , with video quality that is sometimes beyond what the anime companies themselves are able to provide on their legit releases .
One root of this entire issue , notes Sevakis , lies in the fact that the entire demographic of anime fans has been shifting younger .
Most fans are now in their teens , without a lot of discretionary income , and at the same time , convinced that the idea of paying of anime is ludicrous , not necessarily out of malice , but out of simple ignorance of the economics of content .
All of the panelists , led by Bandai 's Iyadomi , strongly supported the need to educate fans in the ethical , legal , and economic aspects of fansubbing , in particular of the ways illegal distribution is beginning to affect anime 's Japanese producers and creators .
Parallels will have to be drawn to the current plight of the movie industry , noted Kleckner , especially as rising costs begin to limit the added value that anime companies can provide with dubs , packaging , and bonus features .
More specifically , Conner argued that an " iTunes model " will need to be developed for anime distribution , with a global approach that seeks the goal of day - and - date download options for fans around the world .
Once this is in place , the entire American anime market could split into a side providing access to unpackaged content , and a second area offering " fetish objects " ( i.e. packaged products ) .
Heiskell followed this up with an appeal to all of his panelists to do a better job of matching fans ' expectations .
No matter what happens , " great stories " will still be created by Japan 's animators , and American fans will want to access them .
The real task for the strategists of America 's anime industry will be figuring out a way of participating in this process .
Of course , there will be many difficulties .
Karahashi brought up anime fans ' increasing frustration with delay times between licensing and release of anime in America .
Sevakis noted that even in principle , comparing the mechanics and scheduling details of a Japanese television show and an American DVD release is difficult , if not impossible .
Sevakis noted that it 's tough to compare Japanese TV to American DVD ; download - to - own sites and services bring their own issues , in particular having to do with digital rights management , many of which have not yet been resolved .
There are several other issues that are just now emerging in the media distribution space both in Japan and in the U.S. that may affect unauthorized fan distribution .
One of these , noted by Conner , has to do with Internet providers increasing interest in returning to monitoring and potentially limiting bandwidth use .
Another , which Heiskell cited as a major issue , is the emergence of fee - based Internet sites that do not have relationships with anime license - holders , and in fact , operate entirely within the realm of media piracy .
Releasing English - subtitled or dubbed anime online at the same time that it is aired in Japan has been mentioned frequently as a possible solution to the fansub crisis , but Klenckner reminded his fellow panelists that appealing as that sounds , often it is simply not feasible .
Episodes are frequently delivered to Japanese broadcasters with very little lead time before their scheduled broadcasts , there are often significant differences between TV and DVD versions of Japanese anime , and if nothing else , significant time is needed to actually put together licensing contracts .
He also reminded both the panelists and the audience that while it is easy to imagine that Japanese customers get free access to televised anime , what needs to be kept in mind is that they are also exposed to advertising and subscription fees .
Iyadomi brought in a further complicating factor .
When anime series are created and produced in Japan , often by committees of tens of individual companies , digital rights are frequently simply not considered .
Any digital distribution contracts may have to be approved by all of the participants in the process , and that too is likely to take time , money , and effort .
Another question all of the panelists approached centered around ways of educating anime users .
Funimation very much has , with an FAQ of Fansubbing hosted on their company 's website , and an overall strategic three - pronged approach .
Fan education is one of its aspects , providing legal alternatives to fansubs is the second , and the third and final is active enforcement of its licenses and copyrights , although with an emphasis on interdiction at the level of fansub distribution sites , not individual downloaders .
To this end , Funimation 's legal staff monitors its properties daily on eBay and various user - generated content sites .
In the last six weeks , for example , some 20,000 clips of Funimation 's anime series and movies have been taken out of illegal distribution , five thousand of them from a single site .
In a span of six unspecified months , there were 200,000 such clips removed from a range of websites .
In Heiskell 's words , the fight against fansubs is a mountain , but with sufficient resources , companies can climb it .
As an outside , third - party observer without a direct stake in the industry , Sevakis noted that ultimately , the anime industry has lost control over how its content is used and disseminated .
Fansubs and illegal distribution in general will always go on at some level , so emphasis should fall on addressing the demand for anime first , while of course limiting the supply of illegal content by going after the worst offenders .
This , of course , is also not always nearly as easy as one would hope .
Ishimoto noted that many individuals and sites are located outside the U.S. , and there is little an American company can do against them .
At the same tiime , in Japan , anime companies like Sunrise are beginning to directly pursue those who upload anime for online distribution .
Until the " safe harbor provision " of America 's Digital Millennium Copyright Act , which places the burden of enforcing distribution of unauthorized content on its producers , rather than on the hosts is addressed by U.S. courts , as it may be in the current litigation by Viacom against YouTube , anime companies will remain constrained in their ability to respond to fansub distribution .
Recently , there has been at least one case of a website known for illegal distribution actively working with Japanese anime distributors and attracting investment capital .
The panelists were asked whether , in their opinion , it would ever be a good move to ally their own companies , or others in the industry , with sites of this type .
Heiskell 's answer was that if a service has broken off all ties with its shady past and has gone " 100 % legit " , there should be no issues cooperating with it .
In general , Funimation has been viewing its corporate role as one of acquiring rights , not DVDs , and that in general , there is no reason for any company to be particularly attached to distribution via DVD , as opposed to any other method .
As the panel wrapped up , Sevakis predicted that ultimately , the anime DVD market in North America will be reserved for the " really A - list " , collectible titles , while the average Japanese animated television series , dozens of which come out every season and float off into obscurity several months later , not particularly missed by anyone , will be prime candidates for digital distribution .
Kleckner agreed , though noting that a significant number of American fans are still interested in hearing English voices on their anime , a sevice that fansubbers ( though not illegal distributors ) will be unable to provide by definition .
For the final question of the hour , the panelists were asked to talk about the changes they see in how anime is distributed in the U.S. Conner is of the opinion that anime companies need to look at other ways of expanding revenue .
DVD distribution may not be enough , and even anime itself may be too niche a market to support the costs that any company is faced with .
Karahashee agreed , saying that anime companies both in the U.S. and in Japan need to be more revolutionary in their thinking in order to create a bigger market for Japanese animation .
At the same time , more anime fans need to be aware of the full results and implications of illegal and unauthorized distribution of fansubs .
For Funimation , continuing the three - pronged approach of fan education , ownership of digital distribution , and active enforcement will continue to be the priority .
Kleckner 's view is that the DVD - is - dead mantra is at least a few years too early .
The anime industry has to keep adapting to user needs .
Bandai , for its part , is committed to studying the feasibility of simultaneous worldwide releases of its anime and ways of increasing advertising revenue .
Sevakis wrapped the panel up by reminding that the issue of unauthorized content distribution is not limited to anime .
Ishimoto closed the hour by stating unequivocally that from a legal perspective , fansub distribution is stealing ; it can be explained , but not justified .
JUNE 24 -- A Florida man shot a teenager after ordering him to pull up his sagging pants , according to police .
John Constantin , 54 , was arrested Saturday afternoon after allegedly shooting David Mitchell , 18 , once in the stomach .
According to witnesses , Constantin directed Mitchell to pull up his pants while he followed the teenager in the courtyard of his Jacksonville apartment building .
After Mitchell asked Constantin why he was trailing him , the pair began to scuffle .
During the confrontation , Constantin shot Mitchell with a small caliber handgun ( the teen was later released from the hospital with the slug still in his side ) .
Constantin , who works at Light Bulb Depot , told cops that he ordered Mitchell to pull his pants up , ' but then the victim assaulted him . '
As he was being transported to jail , Constantin told a cop , ' This is bullshit ' and that , 'an innocent man is going to jail just because I was just protecting myself . '
Constantin , pictured in the mug shot at left , was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon , a felony .
He may also face a drug rap pending lab results on a ' white rock like substance ' that field tested positive for crack cocaine .

The disease has left Tasmanian Devils at risk of extinction
Australia experts say a Tasmanian Devil called Cedric could hold the key to the survival of the embattled species .
The world 's largest marsupial carnivore is facing extinction from a mystery facial cancer .
But scientists say Cedric appears to be naturally resistant to the contagious tumours which have killed half the devil population in Tasmania .
Cedric is the first Tasmanian Devil to have shown any immunity from the disfiguring disease .
Infected animals become so consumed by the cancer they can no longer eat or see and eventually die of starvation .
Breakthrough
Cedric was captured in western Tasmania last year , along with his half - brother , Clinky .
Both were injected with dead tumours by scientists .
Clinky produced no antibodies , but Cedric did and appears to have built - in defences against the mystery illness .
The experiments have now moved up a gear .
Researcher Alex Kriess says the pair have had live cancer cells inserted into their faces .
" They have n't developed a tumour so far , " he said .
" We injected very few cells so it might take a while until they develop anything that we can see . "
Cedric 's apparent resistance to the disease has been seen as a significant breakthrough .
The facial tumours are decimating devil numbers on Tasmania 's east coast .
Cedric is from a genetically different population on the other side of the island .
Scientists hope marsupials that share his genetic pattern could also be immune to the cancer or capable of responding to a vaccine .
If real progress is not made soon , experts worry that the Tasmanian Devil could be extinct within 20 years .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Oil could shoot up to $ 200 within the next two years as part of a " super - spike " driven by poor growth in oil supplies , investment bank Goldman Sachs GS.N said in a research note .

“ We believe the current energy crisis may be coming to a head , as a lack of adequate supply growth is becoming apparent , ” Goldman said in the note made available to Reuters on Tuesday .
Oil hit a new record near $ 121 a barrel on Tuesday , continuing an advance which has seen it double over the past 12 months .
“ The possibility of $ 150 - $ 200 per barrel seems increasingly likely over the next 6 - 24 months , though predicting the ultimate peak in oil prices as well as the remaining duration of the upcycle remains a major uncertainty , ” Goldman said .
Goldman , which was one of the first to point to a triple digit oil price more than two years ago , said it believed the market was approaching the crunch in the “ super - spike ” .
The “ super - spike ” theory argues that a lack of adequate supply growth along with price - insulated demand growth in non-OECD countries will lead to a dramatic and continuous rise in oil prices that will ultimately lead to a sharp correction in oil demand .
Goldman analysts said the underlying drivers of the rise in oil prices remained firmly in place , noting poor growth in non-OPEC supplies , low OPEC spare capacity , restriction on foreign investment in key oil producing nations and healthy demand growth in non-OECD economies .
“ In our view , a gradual rally in prices is likely to be longer lasting than a sharp , sudden spike , ” the note written by U.S. - based analyst Arjun Murti said .
Goldman said it had raised its spot oil price forecasts for U.S. WTI crude for 2008 through to 2011 to $ 108 rising to $ 110 and $ 120 a barrel , up from $ 96 rising to $ 105 and $ 110 respectively in its earlier forecast .
“ We see risk to our 2008 and 2009 forecasts as distinctly to the upside , ” it said .
The folks from RadioHead just released a new video for their latest song “ House of Cards . ”
The thing that makes this video so special is that no cameras or lights we used to film it .
Instead , the producing team used two 3D technologies to capture motion and images : Geometric Informatics and Velodyne LIDAR .
Geometric
Informatics scanning systems produce structured light to capture 3D images at close proximity , while a Velodyne Lidar system that uses multiple lasers is used to capture large environments such as landscapes .
In this video , 64 lasers rotating and shooting in a 360 degree radius 900 times per minute produced all the exterior scenes .
Check out the video below , and once you ’re done , hit this link to manipulate the video ’s data in real time .
SWAY
WINDS sweeping across New England , in the north - east of the United States , blow at an average of about 4 metres per second ( m / s ) .
But a few hundred metres offshore they blow more than twice as fast .
This increase in speed is found offshore in much of the world .
But although engineers know how to build turbines to turn offshore wind into electricity , they can do that only in waters up to about 40 metres deep .
Wind - turbine towers are pounded deep into the seabed , or anchored in massive blocks of sunken concrete .
Now wind power could be taken into deeper waters .
Building offshore wind farms is expensive : a turbine can cost at least 50 % more than one built on land .
But the stronger winds out at sea can generate more revenue : a wind of 10m / s can produce five times as much electricity as wind blowing half as fast , and this greatly favours building more offshore wind farms , says Walter Musial , a senior engineer at the National Wind Technology Centre , a government research lab in Boulder , Colorado .
Yet just 300 to 400 offshore wind turbines have been built worldwide , most of them in British or Danish waters .
None have been built in America .
The main reason why there are so few is that people think they ruin the view and spoil the immediate offshore area .
Typical is a project known as Cape Wind , based on plans by Energy Management , an American company , to build 130 turbines 9.6 km offshore in Nantucket Sound , Massachusetts .
Although it is backed by a number of green groups , local opposition has been fierce .
Jim Gordon , Energy Management 's boss , says “ visceral ” local protests have delayed the project by at least three years and cost his company millions of dollars .
But what if the turbines could be put much farther out to sea ?
A growing number of experts say new technology now makes floating turbines feasible , which means they could be sited a long way from land .
Devices known as “ floaters ” are already used to support more than two - thirds of the 4,000 or so oil and gas rigs in the Gulf of Mexico , says Paul Sclavounos , a marine engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
With finance from ConocoPhillips , Mr Sclavounos is developing a turbine floater for the windy North Sea .
He says the engineering obstacles have , for the most part , been overcome .
The big task left is to keep costs down .
Mr Sclavounos expects an industry making floating wind turbines to flourish in about five years .
Many experts think it may take longer , but few doubt it will happen .
Sites for more turbines on land can prove just as controversial , suitable locations for fixed - base shallow - water turbines are limited and a new generation of massive turbines need to be placed no closer than a couple every square kilometre .
SWAY , a company based in Bergen , Norway , is developing turbine floaters for installing in 150 metres of water .
The firm , partly funded by Statoil , Norway 's energy giant , estimates that each will cost about as much as a fixed - base turbine placed in 30 or 40 metres of water .
Its design uses a hollow , buoyant cylinder that extends down from the tower for about 100 metres underwater .
It is weighted at the bottom to keep the tower from heeling in heavy winds .
The cylinder is anchored to gravel ballast on the sea floor .
SWAY plans to float a full - scale prototype in 2010 .
In December a company called Blue H Technologies , based in Oosterhout , Netherlands , placed a half - size prototype turbine about 20 km off the coast of southern Italy in water 108 metres deep .
It uses a broad flotation framework known as a “ tension - leg platform ” , which is similar to that used to float oil rigs .
Construction of full - size floating turbines for the site has now begun .
The company has had to convince Italy 's naval - certification agency that a floating turbine could withstand a “ 100 - year wave ” — which in that part of the world amounts to a 9.7 metre wall of water .
When it blows at sea , it can blow very hard .
THINGS happen when you own a DeLorean , the sports car turned ultimate time machine in the “ Back to the Future ” films .
The car was larger than life .
Its creator , John Z. DeLorean , was a self - promoting swinger in tailored suits who dated models and Hollywood starlets .
He was caught in an F.B.I. sting with 55 pounds of cocaine , which the authorities said he planned to sell to prevent the collapse of his company .
Though he was acquitted , the trial further cemented his name and his car as irresistible emblems of pop culture .
“ Having a DeLorean is like 5 percent being a rock star , ” said Lauren J. Reilly , a bubbly 31 - year - old producer at the Deutsch advertising agency who owns a 1981 DeLorean DMC - 12  the only model DeLorean built ( and for just two years ) .
It was an unseasonably warm winter Sunday when Ms. Reilly drove her DeLorean in a several - block radius around Midtown Manhattan , where she lives and keeps her car .
Tourists were out in full force , convening at every street corner with directionless awe .
In front of Radio City Music Hall , a tall man in a black raincoat stared at the DeLorean , eyes squinting , as he strode up the block .
In Times Square , a cluster of red - faced teenagers pointed , bursting into a fit of giggles .
Geeky art comes in many forms , from paintings and sculpture to graffiti and tattoos .
The subject matter can be anything from video game characters to complex math problems .
In some cases , what makes the art geeky is n’t the subject – it ’s the materials used to create the art , as in the case of a retrofuturistic motorcycle created entirely from used computer parts .
One thing that each of these 20 examples of art have in common , though , is that they ’re awesomely geeky .

WASHINGTON  A German graduate student in oceanography at M.I.T. applied to the Transportation Security Administration for a new ID card allowing him to work around ships and docks .
What the student , Wilken - Jon von Appen , received in return was a letter that not only turned him down but added an ominous warning from John M. Busch , a security administration official : “ I have determined that you pose a security threat . ”
Similar letters have gone to 5,000 applicants across the country who have at least initially been turned down for a Transportation Worker Identification Credential , an ID card meant to guard against acts of terrorism , agency officials said Monday .
The officials also said they were sorry about the language , which they may change in the future , but had no intention of withdrawing letters already sent .

The dramatic hearing on presidential crimes and abuses of power
held on Friday by the House Judiciary Committee was both a staged
farce , and at the same time , a powerful demonstration of the power of a
grassroots movement in defense of the Constitution .
It was at once both
testimony to the cowardice and self - inflicted impotence of Congress and
of the Democratic Party that technically controls that body , and to the
enormity of the damage that has been wrought to the nation ’s democracy
by two aspiring tyrants in the White House .
As Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , chairman of the committee , made clear
more than once during the six - hour session , this was “ not an
impeachment hearing , however much many in the audience might wish it to
be ”
He might well have added that he himself was not the fierce
defender of the Constitution and of the authority of Congress that he
once was before gaining control of the Judiciary Committee , however
much his constituents , his wife , and Americans across the country might
wish him to be .
At the same time , while the hearing was strictly limited to the
most superficial airing of Bush administration crimes and misdemeanors ,
the fact that the session — technically an argument in defense of 26
articles of impeachment filed in the House over the past several months
by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) -- was nonetheless a major victory for the
impeachment movement .
It happened because earlier in the month , House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , who has sworn since taking control of the
House in November 2006 , that impeachment would be “ off the table ”
during the 110th Congress , called a hasty meeting with Majority Leader
Rep. Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) , Rep. Conyers , and Rep. Kucinich , and called
for such a limited hearing .
It was no coincidence that shortly before Pelosi ’s backdown , peace
activist and Gold Star mother Cindy Sheehan announced that her campaign
had collected well over the 10,000 signatures necessary to qualify for
listing on the ballot as an independent candidate for Congress against
Pelosi in the Speaker ’s home district in San Francisco .
Sheehan has
been an outspoken advocate of impeaching both Bush and Cheney .
“ Pelosi
is trying to throw a bone to her constituents by allowing a hearing on
impeachment , ” said Sheehan , who came to Washington , DC to attend .
“ It’s
just like her finally stating publicly that Bush ’s presidency is a
failure — something it has taken her two years to come to , but which
we ’ve been saying for years . ”
So determined were Pelosi and Conyers to limit the scope and
intensity of the hearing that they acceded to a call for Republicans on
the Judiciary Committee to adhere to Thomas Jefferson ’s Rules of the
House , which prohibit any derogatory comments about the President ,
which was interpreted by Chairman Conyers as meaning no one , including
witnesses or members of the committee , could suggest that Bush had lied
or deceived anyone .
Since a number of Rep. Kucinich ’s proposed articles
of impeachment specifically charge the president with lying to Congress
and the American People , this made for some comic moments , with witness
Bruce Fein , a former assistant attorney general under former President
Ronald Reagan , to say he would reference his listing of crimes to the
“ resident ” of the White House .
In the end , the rule imposing a gag on calling the president a
criminal fell by the wayside , with witness Vincent Bugliosi .
A former
Los Angeles deputy district attorney , accusing Bush of being guilty of
the murder of over 4000 American soldiers and of hundreds of thousands
of innocent Iraqi civilians because he had “ lied ” the country into an
illegal and unnecessary war , and with committee member Shiela Jackson
Lee ( D - TX ) suggesting that the president may have committed treason in
invading Iraq , and that he appeared to be preparing to do it again with
an unprovoked invasion of Iran .
Conyers also acquiesced in a Republican effort to minimize public
monitoring and involvement in the hearing , allowing the minority party
to fill most of the available seats in the hearing room with office
staffers who showed little interest in the proceedings .
Only a few
dozen of the hundreds of pro-impeachment activists who had come to the
Rayburn Office Building at 7 am in order to get seats in the Judiciary
Committee hearing room were allowed in , with the rest having to remain
in the hall or go to two remote “ overflow ” rooms to watch the
proceedings on a TV hookup .
Conyers also went along with a call by
Republican members of the committee to have some of those who did make
it into the hearing ejected simply for wearing buttons on their shirts
calling for impeachment ( the Republican members referred to these as
“ signs ” ) , though such small personal tokens are routinely allowed in
congressional hearing rooms .
It was clear that this was to be a tightly controlled and strictly limited hearing .
It was also clear that it was intended to go nowhere .
At one point , after hearing witnesses like Fein , Bugliosi , former
representative and Nixon impeachment committee member Elizabeth
Holtzman , former Salt Lake City mayor and impeachment activist Rocky
Anderson , former House Clinton impeachment manager Bob Barr , former
Watergate Committee counsel and current senior counsel of the Brennan
Center for Justice Frederick A.O. Schwartz , and Elliott Adams ,
president of the board of Veterans for Peace , lay out the
administration ’s crimes and abuses of power — which included charges of
usurping the legislative powers of Congress , violating international
treaties , war crimes , lying to Congress , an illegal war , felony
violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Fourth
Amendment , defying Congressional subpoenas , obstruction of justice and
more , Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) , chair of the Constitution
subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee , appeared convinced that the
abuses were real and serious .
But Nadler , who for two years has been a major obstacle on the
Judiciary Committee to any efforts to move impeachment to a formal
hearing , said , “ No president has been removed from office through
impeachment . ”
He asked the witnesses , “ How would you approach
impeachment today so it would be a viable option ? ”
Former Rep. Holtzman responded , “ The real remedy to a president who
believes he is above the law is impeachment .
There is no running away
from that . ”
She said , “ An impeachment inquiry , handled fairly , could
work .
Maybe I ’m a cockeyed optimist , but I believe it could work . ”
The basic point , made by Holtzman , by Fein and by many others ,
including this writer , is that worrying about the political opposition
to impeachment , both in the House , and in the Senate , not to mention
among the broader public , is completely wrongheaded .
Even when
impeachment articles were first filed against Nixon , the public and the
bulk of the Congress were against the idea .
It was during the hearings
that the tide turned , as evidence of malfeasance , criminality and abuse
of power became evident through hearing testimony .
The same would
happen in the case of President Bush and / or Vice President Cheney .
Most
Americans do n’t even know that the president made up evidence to
justify the war against Iraq out of whole cloth .
They do n’t know what
the Geneva Conventions are with regard to torture .
They do n’t know why
Congress passed the FISA act , which Bush has been feloniously violating
to spy on them ( it was passed because Nixon was using the National
Security Agency to spy on Americans without judicial warrants ! ) .
They
do n’t know the Bush has been refusing to enact laws passed by the
Congress .
Public hearings by an impeachment panel would make all these
high crimes and misdemeanors clear on national TV to all sentient
Americans .
Moreover , as Holtzman pointed out , the president would not
be able to use the claim of “ executive privilege ” to withhold testimony
from aides in an impeachment inquiry , the way he has done when they
have been subpoenaed by other House and Senate committees .
Impeachment
would be about violations of the very executive actions he would be
claiming privilege on .
As well , an impeachment committee , unlike any
other committee of the Congress , is specifically sanctioned and
empowered in the Constitution , meaning that even strict
“ constructionist ” Federalists on the bench would have a hard time
backing presidential obstruction .
As Holtzman noted , “ There is no executive privilege in impeachment ,
because refusing to testify is itself an impeachable offense . ”
Committee Republicans , aided by two law professors they had brought
in to testify , Stephen Presser of Northwestern University School of Law
and Jeremy Rabkin of George Mason University School of Law , tried to
argue that impeachment was only meant for crimes in which the official ,
or the president , was seeking personal gain .
This nonsense was knocked
down by most of the speakers , who quoted numerous founders who made it
clear that what high crimes referred to were actions — even taken with
the noblest of intentions — that undermined the Constitution or abused
the powers of the office .
As Rep . Nadler said , “ Impeachment has nothing
to do with intentions or with good faith .
Impeachment has to do with
abuse of power which weakens the balance of power . ”

Before They Were Famous Guess Who 07/04/2008
The son of an accountant and flower shop owner , this international star began ballet lessons at age 16 , which he studied for five years .
He likes classical music and his favorite composer is Beethoven .
He was nominated as the " Worst New Star " in the 1988 Golden Raspberry Awards .
Proud of his physique , he has appeared nude in many of his films .
A full - contact fighter , controversy arose regarding his fight career as his film stardom took off .
The Mortal Kombat character Johnny Cage was modeled after him .
Who is he ?
Continue reading for the answer .
Jean Claude Van Damme was born in 1960 in Belgium .
Of ballet he has said it " is an art , but it 's also one of the most difficult sports .
If you can survive a ballet workout , you can survive a workout in any other sport . "
Although his breakout role in " Bloodsport ' earned him the Golden Raspberry nomination , the film proved to be a stepping stone to more lucrative roles .
The movie became a cult classic and is seen as one of the major contributors to the rise in popularity of Mixed Martial Arts .
Van Damme has expressed pride in his body , especially his rear end .
This was the subject of parody in the television show Friends , where , guest - starring as himself , he tells Rachel and Monica that " I can crush a walnut with my butt . "
Controversy arose when researchers were unable to verify Van Damme 's matches due to the fact that his entire full - contact career was fought under his birth name of Van Varenberg .
Ironically , Van Damme turned down the part of Johnny Cage in the Mortal Kombat movie , although the character was modeled after him .
“ As with other government interventions , here too the politicians will achieve the exact opposite of their stated intentions .
By reducing the likelihood that ‘ hoarders ’ will be able to profit from their speculative activities , price controls and windfall profits taxes weaken the incentives for price smoothing . ”
O n March 3 , oil prices surpassed the inflation - adjusted record set back in 1980 during the Iranian hostage crisis .
Since then , they have set all - time highs — over $ 111 per barrel as of this writing .
These sky - high prices , as well as the “ unconscionable ” profits earned by the oil companies , have led to predictable calls for government to hike taxes on Big Oil and to subsidize alternative energy sources .
Only wise politicians , we are told , can steer the myopic market away from its dependence on foreign fossil fuels .
When oil prices hit record levels , many people look for a scapegoat , and hugely profitable oil companies are an easy target .
Even so , the typical political “ solutions ” overlook the crucial role that market prices play in resource allocation , both among competing uses in different areas of the world today and among competing uses in different time periods ( i.e. today versus the future ) .
Contrary to popular belief , it is private sector professionals who will ensure an adequate supply of oil and other commodities for our descendants .
It is the politicians — not the speculators — who are notoriously shortsighted and threaten to cripple our energy supply .
To refine our thinking on this complex topic , we ’ll start with a simplistic case , and then gradually add more layers of realism .
This will help us understand the basics of oil prices and make sense of the present state of the market .
In particular , we ’ll see that the best remedy is a return to market guidance , not top - down political directives .
Hotelling ’s Rule : A Known and Fixed Pool of Oil Read more about depletable Natural Resources in an article by William J. Baumol and Sue Anne Batey Blackman in the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics .
The simplest case is actually probably how most people think about a finite , depletable resource such as oil .
Assume that every last drop of oil in the world is conveniently located at the surface of the earth , dispersed among thousands of small pools , each of which is owned by a different individual .
Each of these owners — who controls a tiny fraction of the world ’s total stockpile of oil — knows exactly how big his own pool is , and the pools of oil owned by his competitors .
Further suppose that it costs each owner virtually nothing to extract a barrel of oil and sell it on the market .
Assume also that the cost of storing the oil is zero , and further that each owner can predict with perfect foresight the demand for oil at every date into the future .
There is no doubt that the known oil in the various pools is the only oil that will ever be available .
Finally , suppose that each owner is also quite confident that there will always be people wishing to buy some barrels of oil , for virtually any price , into the foreseeable future .
Under these very unrealistic yet convenient assumptions , what can we say about the price of oil ?
Harold Hotelling provided the elegant answer back in 1931 .
On the margin , an owner of the oil must be indifferent between selling an extra barrel of oil today — and earning the spot price — versus holding it off the market and selling it in the future .
Since we have assumed away storage and extraction costs , and any risk that the quantity demanded of oil will drop to zero if the price rises too far , we can conclude that the spot price of oil ( the spot price is the current price at any given time ) must rise over time with the interest rate .
For example , if a barrel of oil sells today for $ 100 , and the interest rate is 5 % , the spot price of oil in twelve months ’ time must be $ 105 in order to make it worthwhile for the owner to keep some oil off of the market today and carry it forward to next year .
The idea is that the amount he earns by having the oil sit in the ground must equal the amount he would earn in interest on a portfolio of bonds .
For example , if the spot price of oil were $ 101 while the expected price next year were only $ 103 , then the owner would rearrange his plans , and devote more barrels for sale today , and fewer barrels for sale next year .
( This is because $ 101 rolling over at 5 % interest would be worth more than $ 103 in the following year . )
This shift would push down the spot price of oil today , and raise the anticipated price next year .
If the spot price were finally pushed to $ 100 while the expected price next year had risen to $ 105 , the owner would be happy with his allocation , because whether he sold one more barrel in the present and invested the revenue at 5 % interest , or whether he kept the barrel in the ground , he would have $ 105 at his disposal in the following year .
( A similar argument shows that if oil prices rose more than 5 % per year , then the owner would devote more of his supply to future markets , ultimately bringing oil prices back into conformity with Hotelling ’s Rule . )
Of course , Hotelling ’s Rule does n’t tell us what the actual spot price is at any time ; it merely tells us how quickly it must rise .
To come up with the specific numbers , we would need to know the demand for oil over time .
In a general equilibrium , the spot price would rise with the interest rate ( Hotelling ’s Rule ) and consumers of oil would purchase their optimal number of barrels per day ( depending on the price at the time ) , such that the total consumption into the future would just equal the original size of the pool .
The first modern economic work forecasting an imminent catastrophic future because of a depletable resource was The Coal Question , by William Stanley Jevons .
The 1865 book vaulted Jevons to public notice .
Even at this stage , we can see that the standard question , “ Will we run out of oil ? ! ” is the wrong one to ask .
Even in the “ worst case ” scenario outlined above — where there is no chance for new supplies to be discovered , and all of the oil is controlled by an unregulated monopolist bent purely on profit — the world would n’t suddenly run out of oil , and it would never experience a jolting shock in prices .
On the contrary , the price of oil would rise steadily over time in a predictable manner , with consumers at some point reducing their total annual consumption as ever higher prices made it more economical to substitute away from oil and into other fuels .
This observation is neither optimistic nor pessimistic ; depending on the initial size of the pool , and the availability of other options , this eventual weaning of oil usage could be either uneventful or catastrophic .
The point , however , is that the scarce commodity would be distributed in a perfectly efficient manner among competing uses in the present and in the future .
At any moment , the spot price would already reflect the fact that consuming a barrel today necessarily meant future generations would have one fewer barrel .
Burn All You Want : We ’ll Find More Obviously
Hotelling ’s model is not an accurate description of the oil market in the real world .
For one thing , oil prices have not risen steadily and exponentially over time .
In real terms , that is , adjusted for inflation , they were fairly flat during much of the twentieth century , spiked during the 1970s and early 1980s , then fell sharply , only to rise again in the 21st century .
Clearly there is more at work here than the simplistic scenario described above .
One major difference is that in the real world , oil is not concentrated into neat little pools with zero extraction costs .
On the contrary , oil deposits offer varying degrees of difficulty of extraction .
In the Middle East , for example , average total production costs per barrel were $ 14.31 during 2004 - 2006 , while average total costs per barrel in offshore U.S. operations were $ 69.75 during the same period .
Keep in mind that in addition to the varying costs of extraction , there is also the matter of finding the deposits in the first place , which costs scarce resources .
Now given that there are vast resources of oil spread throughout the earth , some obvious and some well - hidden , and , further , where each deposit offers a harder or easier time of extraction , what would be the rational thing for people to do ?
Naturally , they would first concentrate on developing the deposits that have already been located and which had the lowest costs of extraction .
Then , as those deposits were exhausted , resources would be spent locating new reserves , and also developing techniques to allow for better exploitation of existing sites .
This quite rational approach is in fact just what the oil industry has done .
At any given time , of course there is only a finite amount of known reserves of oil .
It is only as that available window begins to shrink — because of rising consumption rates and continued depletion of known reserves — that it makes sense to invest in finding new reserves .
This principle is no different from a household ’s weekly routine , where the pantry is stocked with only , say , a month ’s worth of food at any time .
This is why the alarmist warning of , “ At present consumption rates , we have only x years of oil left ! ” is silly ; we always have “ only ” x years of oil left , whatever x is .
There is no a priori reason to expect that x will steadily diminish with the passage of time , just as we do n’t expect the typical household to starve after one month .
In fact , the window of oil availability generally improved over the 20th century .
At the end of 1944 , “ proved reserves ” of crude oil were 51 billion barrels worldwide .
By 2003 , the number had grown to 1.27 trillion barrels of proved reserves .
Given the annual rates of consumption in the two years , the world went from a proven supply of under 25 years ’ worth of oil in 1944 to a supply of about 44 years in 2003 .
Meeting Demand : The Customer Is Always Right Another major simplification we made in our initial thought experiment was to assume that the demand for oil ( as a function of price ) was known , even into the distant future .
In reality , the demand for oil is unpredictable , and this fact partially explains the recent record - high oil prices .
When the major oil companies were making investment decisions during the 1980s and 1990s , they underestimated the explosive economic growth in countries such as China and India in the 21st century .
Because of this mistaken forecast , the necessary infrastructure was not in place to adequately service the increase in oil consumption .
Consequently , spare capacity margins have become extremely narrow , leading to price spikes .
In this situation , the major oil companies have again done just what we would expect ( and desire ) from Adam Smith ’s famous “ Invisible Hand ” :
They have ploughed hundreds of billions of their profits into further investment , in order to expand production capacity in the future .
Indeed , from the early 1990s through 2006 , new investments have tracked ( and usually exceeded ) earnings ( see Chart 1 ) .

The Social Function of Speculation and Derivatives
As our discussion so far has made clear , it is not the finite supply of oil but rather the uncertainty over its supply , and the demands on it , that leads to trouble .
Even though the average person is hostile towards these exotic practices , it is here where speculation and derivative markets play a crucial role .
The motto of the speculator is to “ buy low , sell high . ”
The only way to be a successful speculator is to make better forecasts than others .
For example , if a speculator makes a bundle by stockpiling crude at $ 100 today and selling it for $ 110 next month , there must have been plenty of other people who were surprised by the price hike : otherwise they would have bid up the price today .
Here we see the true social function of speculation .
By buying when prices are relatively low , and selling when prices are relatively high , the speculator makes prices less volatile than they otherwise would be .
More important , the speculator snatches up oil during times of relative plenty , and delivers it to times of relative scarcity .
It ’s true that the speculator earns personal profit in proportion to the superiority of his forecasts , but this is no different in principle from the fact that the best brain surgeons earn a fabulous salary on the market .
Modern financial markets have sophisticated derivatives markets , such as futures contracts and forward contracts , and even options on these contracts themselves .
These more exotic instruments allow market participants to more effectively allocate risk and , thus , increase total production .
One of their specific benefits is to greatly enhance the effectiveness of speculation .
For example , suppose an oil analyst receives an intercepted communication , and is quite sure that Huge Chavez , in an effort to harm the U.S. , will completely cut off oil exports in one month .
Obviously , the analyst stands to profit tremendously from this intelligence , because the rest of the market has no idea that oil prices will skyrocket in 30 days .
Naturally the analyst should buy oil now , at its relatively cheap price , and then sell it once the news breaks .
Yet this raises many practical questions .
For one thing , what is the analyst supposed to do with thousands of barrels of oil ?
Store it in his shed ?
And it certainly sounds fine in theory to say , “ Buy oil and then sell it in one month ! ” but whom do you call about buying that much oil ?
How can you trust them ?
Do you need to pay someone to inspect the barrels upon delivery ?
And what if your neighbors like to have bonfire parties this time of year — is that going to pose a problem ?
Believe it or not , an organized futures market solves all of these difficulties .
Rather than buying and physically storing oil for one month , our hypothetical analyst can simply buy the desired amount of futures contracts .
These contracts entitle the bearer to buy 1,000 barrels of oil on a particular date in the future for a set price ( the futures price ) .
As new information becomes available , the futures price ( for a particular date ) is constantly readjusted , with the gains or losses accruing to those holding the contracts .
Assuming his forecast about Chavez is correct , our analyst can invest as much as he wants in futures contracts on oil , wait until the market sees the storm coming , and then unload the contracts before the delivery date .
He can thus profit from his superior foresight , without ever dealing with a drop of actual oil .
Even so , his actions have still helped equilibrate the intertemporal market for oil , as his initial purchases of the futures contracts pushed up the spot price of oil .
Note , also , that the successful speculator serves as a kind of “ distant early warning ” system for future disruptions .
In addition to facilitating those wishing to engage in pure speculation , futures markets also help those who wish to hedge away their exposure to commodity price movements .
For example , the owner of an oil field might be uncertain whether he should invest millions to increase his pumping capacity .
If the price of oil over the next five years averages above $ 85 , the project will be worthwhile , whereas he will lose money if oil should fall below that threshold .
At the same time , an airline company might be uncertain whether to add a new city to its list of destinations .
Its accountants have determined that if oil prices exceed $ 90 per barrel over the next five years , the route will lose money .
With only a spot market in oil , risk aversion might lead the oil producer and the airline to play it safe , thus missing out on gains from trade .
Yet if the airline can enter into a forward contract with the oil producer , where it agrees to buy a certain number of barrels every year at , say , $ 88 per barrel , then the oil producer can confidently invest in expanding his production , while the airline can confidently expand its services .
Conclusion : Let the Free Market Do It ’s Job !
Thus far we ’ve seen that as we relax the unrealistic assumptions in our initial scenario , the free market jumps to the rescue .
Unfortunately , the last assumption we need to consider is that the owner of oil was allowed to charge whatever the market would bear , and to keep all of his earnings .
This is clearly at odds with political realities , what with talk of “ windfall ” taxes or even outright price controls .
As with other government interventions , here too the politicians will achieve the exact opposite of their stated intentions .
By reducing the likelihood that “ hoarders ” will be able to profit from their speculative activities , price controls and windfall profits taxes weaken the incentives for price smoothing .
Moreover , confiscatory taxes and price controls reduce investment in the development of further reserves , as investors seek less - dangerous projects for their money .
The end result of political interference is thus a less - efficient exploitation of our scarce supply of oil .
The free market does just what we want it to , if only the politicians allow it to function .
As one wag put it , the government needs to leave prices alone : they have important work to do !
Fox host gets heated when author disses his network David Edwards and Nick Juliano

This " Do n't you Fox on me , " anchor Shepard Smith snapped at a guest after what seemed a fairly innocuous barb about Fox News fired him up .
Afternoon anchor Smith briefly lost his cool Wednesday during an interview with Naomi Wolf , author of The End of America .
A Republican talking head also appeared on Smith 's show .
Wolf observed that Democrats did n't have to " hold our nose and walk into the [ voting ] booth , " and as she tried to finish her answer Smith jumped in .
" So you were holding your nose walking into the booth with John Kerry , the last time ?
You were holding your nose walking into the booth with Bill Clinton ? " he asked , as GOP strategist Kellyanne Conway laughed in the background .
" When was the nose - holding exactly , if you could pin it down for me ? "
Wolf began to explain , without explicitly bad - mouthing Clinton or Kerry , and Smith returned to the subject at hand .
" You said , the nose - holding ; I just want to know when the nose - holding was . "
" This is why I love Fox News , " Wolf said sarcastically .
That , apparently was too much for Smith .
" No , no , no .
That is unfair .
You said it , I did nt say it !
You said you were holding your nose when you went in the booth , and I asked you when , " Smith said , wagging his finger at the camera .
" That s fair .
And anybody who doesnt ask you that is not being fair .
Id like an answer please .
You did it .
Dont you  Fox on me .
Ever . "
Wolf explained that she was glad about the historic prospects in this election , where for the first time the Democratic nominee will be a woman or a black man .
Later in the program , Smith apologized for his outburst .
" I want to apologize to you for pointing my finger at you .
I just get tired of people like you saying every time you 're challenged on something that you say that it 's something about Fox , " he said .
" It 's not something about Fox .
I do n't have a horse in this race and for you to suggest such a thing is both inaccurate and insulting . "

- In yesterday 's presentation , Dan Grigsby said " You ' re not really on the Fringe
if you work for the Man . "
- I was in a meeting with " The Man " : Steve Ballmer , talking about how to recruit
young programmers straight out of school who might not think of Microsoft as
an option -- perhaps they 've bought into the hype about Google
- " Are you gonna go work at Google and just so you can increase their market
share from 65 to 66 % ?
Come to MS where every day is a glorious day ! "
- I believe that if you want to change things , the best way to do so is work in
difficult circumstances
- Three things I want to talk about
- Go see Steve Jobs ' Stanford commencement address
- He talks about " connecting the dots backwards " in viewing his life
- Looking at that path , he was able to see that he was going to end up where
he was today
- People talk about how they accidentally wind up where they are ,
but really , it 's all a result of the choices you make
- Back when I was a kid , 6502 - based machines were all the rage ( Apple ] [ ,
Commodore 64 and so on )
- ( I 'm old but I have the Asian mystique working for me )
- I came up with a lot of things that I did n't know already existed
- Metaprogramming
- 6502 assembly very limited
- Built a 16 - bit interpreter kind of thing
- All my 16 - bit instructions were prefixed with a BRK ( break ) instruction ,
which triggered a call to an IRQ routine which would then start the
interpreter
- Another thing I did as a kid : building bridges between tech
- Commodore disk drives had their own processors
- I used to build bridges to conenct these smart peripherals to all sorts
of things
- Kids today , they 're spoiled !
You have to remember that a floppy drive
back then had throughput similar to a 1200 baud modem .
Anyone remember
those ?
- Went to University for a while
- Did not do computers in university , I did chemistry and got a doctorate
- I used computers , but did not program them
- Learned lots of skills , the most of important of which are :
- Teaching
- Writing
- In undergrad , when you turn in a paper , you just get a grade and
do n't care about the feedback
- In grad school you can't do this ; your supervisor wo n't okay it
until s/he likes it
- When I graduated , I realized I did n't want to " do the science thing "
and ended up doing computers
- Looked to see of there was a hot new thing that people were n't doing --
in a drag race , if there are fewer competitors , I 'd have a good
chance of winning
- I took up Delphi
- My advice : look for something that people are n't much into and link it to
someething hard
- I did this by building bridges between Delphi and COM
- By doing this work , introduced to Michael Edigan , who ended up
being a mentor who opened my eyes to new things , including GSL jam
- One of these things was XML , which was trendy , hip and even
fringe at the time
- Ended up working with Don Box ( SOAP spec , amongst other things ) --
SOAP was awesomeness if you looked at the original intent
- This was all before I got into dynamic languages , so I built code
generators to make my life easier
- Does anyone remember the Treedragon blog ?
( a couple of hands go up ,
including mine )
- I remember its author , Rhys , ranting about dynamic languages , saying they
sucked
- I truly believed this
- I recommend this book : " Advice to a Young Scientist " : P.B. Medawar
- Back when I was getting started , wanted to build stuff for people to use
- Like many people , the way I did this was via open source
- There 's an open Source entrepreneur problem : the belief that " if you
build it they will come "
- Building it might actually be the easy part ; getting people to come to
your solution may be the hard part
- You can get around that by working for a big company
- When I interviewed at Microsoft , they did n't tell me what I was
interviewing for
- I met with Scott Guthrie , who created ASP .
NET , after my interview -- he
told me about the plan to release a cross-platform version of the CLR
and its support for dynamic languages
- IronPython is the fastest implementation of Python out there
- Of course , " fastest " needs to be defined .
After all , there are three kinds of
lies , damned lies and bechmarks
- It 's fastest in terms of throughput , but its startup is slow
- It was harder to build IronPython than it should have been
- It took a smart guy ( Jim Huginin ) and a smart team to make lots of
little decisions well
- Could we get a win the second time and extract a DLR -- dynamic language
runtime -- from IronPython ?
- To prove it would work , we would use the DLR to build other dynamic languages
- That was the ideal , then there 's the reality
- Back in May , we demoed Rails running under IronRuby -- really slowly and
consuming a lot of memory
- We 're now working on performance
- Startup time turns out to be more important than you think it is
- Unit tests are the worst kind of code you want to run through a compiler
-- many are run only once
- Realized that we had to go off and build an interpreter
- We were working backwards from a compiler
- In getting from the language front end to IL , you have to build two trees --
a language - specific tree and a corresponding , more general DLR tree
- There 's cost in building those 2 trees , and the DLR tree is 10 x as costly
as the language - sepcific tree
- The ideal : we could put effort into building the DLR
- We have a working interpreter , just not that fast
- Have to adjust goals
- The world of Ruby development is " a sea of Macs " , which sometimes makes people
wonder who the intended audience of IronRuby is
- Ask yourself :
What parts of my app should I write in Ruby ?
What should n't I write in Ruby ?
- You 're on .NET because of the library
- If Rails were " done " -- for some level of " done " -- should portions of it be
written in a statically - typed language ?
The Home Office yesterday agreed to pay an undisclosed sum in an out - of - court settlement with a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin who was deported to Pakistan in error .
The settlement , thought to be for tens of thousands of pounds , was agreed as Tula Miah , 34 , was about to take his compensation claim to the high court .
Miah , from south London , who was diagnosed as schizophrenic in his teens , was put on a plane by immigration officials after they mistook him for a Pakistani failed asylum seeker and absconder .
He claimed he had been held in chains and beaten in Pakistan , partly because his custodians were angry that he could not communicate with them .
Miah came to Britain from Bangladesh at the age of 12 and spoke no Pakistani languages .
As a condition of the settlement , he and his lawyers are not allowed to discuss its term or even the fact that it has been reached .
A UK Border Agency spokesman said : " The UK Border Agency carries out all removals with dignity and compassion , and takes very seriously any claim that proper procedures have not been followed .
" We are currently undertaking the biggest shake - up of our border security in over 40 years .
This includes locking people to one identity by linking their fingerprints to a secure database and to any visa issued around the world .
" Later this year , we will roll out ID cards for all foreign nationals .
This will make it easier than ever to confirm people 's identity and remove those with no right to be in the UK . "
A Narnia - like battle has erupted over a domain name that one party argues will leave an 11 - year - old child without a birthday present thanks to greedy , powerful rightsholders .
Control of the domain , narnia.mobi , was taken away from its original registrant this week by the World Intellectual Property Organization and awarded to the estate of C.S. Lewis , author of the popular The Chronicles of Narnia series , a decision that the original registrant is referring to as " scandalously one - sided . "
Scotland natives Richard Saville - Smith and his wife , Gillian , originally registered naria.mobi in September of 2006 , not long after the " sunrise period " for trademark owners to register . mobi domains had closed .
Allegedly , they registered the domain in order to give their then - nine - year - old son — a huge Narnia fan — the gift of an e-mail address with " narnia " in it for his 11th birthday .
Why 11th and not , say , his 10th birthday ?
Supposedly , the couple wanted to give it to their son on May 20 , 2008 , to correspond with the release of the second Narnia film in the UK .
C.S. Lewis Ltd. first offered to buy the domain from Saville - Smith for £ 70 ( about $ 140 ) , according to The Scotsman , an offer the family rejected .
After several attempts to play nicely , the estate submitted a domain dispute resolution request on May 28 , 2008 to WIPO .
Since then , both parties have submitted a number of documents arguing that they are the rightful owners to the domain .
Saville - Smith told WIPO that , since he has no commercial motive for registering the domain , he should be allowed to keep it .
However , a handful of evidence seems to have convinced WIPO that he registered it in bad faith .
For one , Saville - Smith registered 12 other .mobi domains just days after the registration of naria.mobi , including middleearth.mobi , ovaloffice.mobi , pentagon.mobi , primeminister.mobi , and uspresident.mobi .
( For those who do n't recognize some of these names , Middle Earth is a fictional land where stories by Lord of the Rings author J.R.R .
Tolkien take place , and Spooks is a TV drama on the BBC ) .
Almost all of these pages were parked at Sedo with plenty of clickthrough advertising on them .
Additionally , Saville - Smith registered two more Narnia - related domains on June 17 , 2008 — freenarnia.com and freenarnia.mobi—long after the dispute over narnia . mobi began .
WIPO stated in its decision that the panel arbitrating the dispute was disturbed that Saville - Smith would register more names that could potentially cross the Narnia trademark after beginning a proceeding over the first , showing that he was not registering them in good faith after all .
On top of that , WIPO states that there was no evidence that he had made preparations to use narnia .
mobi as an e-mail address before being placed on notice for the dispute , eight days after the son 's 11th birthday .
Finally , despite Saville - Smith 's initial protests , he eventually admitted he had knowledge of the Sedo pages with advertising to WIPO .
With that evidence , WIPO ruled that narnia .
mobi was registered in bad faith and ordered it to be transferred to the C.S. Lewis estate .
Although the family can appeal WIPO 's decision , the Saville - Smiths told The Scotsman that they could n't afford to continue the legal fight .
" We are shocked by the decision , " Gillian Saville - Smith said .
" We put up a spirited fight because we wanted to prove that you do not have to hand something over just because someone richer and more powerful tells you to do so . "
Woman Spends Up to 11 Hours Turning Herself Into the Most Stunning Optical Illusions
Fannie and Freddie
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
Ron Paul in the House Financial Services Committee , September 10 , 2003
Mr. Chairman , thank you for holding this hearing on the Treasury Department ’s views regarding government sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) .
I would also like to thank Secretaries Snow and Martinez for taking time out of their busy schedules to appear before the committee .
I hope this committee spends some time examining the special privileges provided to GSEs by the federal government .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , the housing - related GSEs received $ 13.6 billion worth of indirect federal subsidies in fiscal year 2000 alone .
Today , I will introduce the Free Housing Market Enhancement Act , which removes government subsidies from the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) , the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) , and the National Home Loan Bank Board .
One of the major government privileges granted to GSEs is a line of credit with the United States Treasury .
According to some estimates , the line of credit may be worth over $ 2 billion .
This explicit promise by the Treasury to bail out GSEs in times of economic difficulty helps the GSEs attract investors who are willing to settle for lower yields than they would demand in the absence of the subsidy .
Thus , the line of credit distorts the allocation of capital .
More importantly , the line of credit is a promise on behalf of the government to engage in a huge unconstitutional and immoral income transfer from working Americans to holders of GSE debt .
The Free Housing Market Enhancement
Act also repeals the explicit grant of legal authority given to the Federal Reserve to purchase GSE debt .
GSEs are the only institutions besides the United States Treasury granted explicit statutory authority to monetize their debt through the Federal Reserve .
This provision gives the GSEs a source of liquidity unavailable to their competitors .
The connection between the GSEs and the government helps isolate the GSE management from market discipline .
This isolation from market discipline is the root cause of the recent reports of mismanagement occurring at Fannie and Freddie .
After all , if Fannie and Freddie were not underwritten by the federal government , investors would demand Fannie and Freddie provide assurance that they follow accepted management and accounting practices .
Ironically , by transferring the risk of a widespread mortgage default , the government increases the likelihood of a painful crash in the housing market .
This is because the special privileges granted to Fannie and Freddie have distorted the housing market by allowing them to attract capital they could not attract under pure market conditions .
As a result , capital is diverted from its most productive use into housing .
This reduces the efficacy of the entire market and thus reduces the standard of living of all Americans .
Despite the long - term damage to the economy inflicted by the government ’s interference in the housing market , the government ’s policy of diverting capital to other uses creates a short - term boom in housing .
Like all artificially - created bubbles , the boom in housing prices cannot last forever .
When housing prices fall , homeowners will experience difficulty as their equity is wiped out .
Furthermore , the holders of the mortgage debt will also have a loss .
These losses will be greater than they would have otherwise been had government policy not actively encouraged over - investment in housing .
Perhaps the Federal Reserve can stave off the day of reckoning by purchasing GSE debt and pumping liquidity into the housing market , but this cannot hold off the inevitable drop in the housing market forever .
In fact , postponing the necessary , but painful market corrections will only deepen the inevitable fall .
The more people invested in the market , the greater the effects across the economy when the bubble bursts .
No less an authority than Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed concern that government subsidies provided to GSEs make investors underestimate the risk of investing in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Mr. Chairman , I would like to once again thank the Financial Services Committee for holding this hearing .
I would also like to thank Secretaries Snow and Martinez for their presence here today .
I hope today ’s hearing sheds light on how special privileges granted to GSEs distort the housing market and endanger American taxpayers .
Congress should act to remove taxpayer support from the housing GSEs before the bubble bursts and taxpayers are once again forced to bail out investors who were misled by foolish government interference in the market .
I therefore hope this committee will soon stand up for American taxpayers and investors by acting on my Free Housing Market Enhancement Act .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .

Girls Bridge Gender Divide in Math
New research shows that girls score just as high as boys on math tests .
July 24 , 2008  --
Fifteen years ago , the gender gap was an issue that filled the headlines :
By high school , girls were falling 50 points behind boys on the math section of the SAT , the leading college - entrance exam .
But a new study , published in this week 's edition of the journal Science , shows the gap has disappeared .
Researchers looked at standardized test scores of more than 7 million students , ranging from the second grade to high school junior .
Whatever gender differences there once existed between girls and boys in terms of math performance are gone .
" The differences are now trivial , " said Janet Hyde , a professor of psychology and women 's studies at the University of Wisconsin , who led the research .
Most parents -- and even girls themselves -- accepted the stereotype that girls were simply not hardwired to excel in mathematics .
" Every time I see math , I just , I try and stay away from it , " said one teenage girl , interviewed by ABC News in 1994 .
" You do n't get it , and you feel like you 're the only one that does n't get it , " said another .
But that was then .
" The fact is that I understand it , " says Romona Twiddle , a 14 - year - old who is part of a special girls - only program at the New Jersey Institute of Technology this summer in Newark .
" It just comes natural to me . "
Romona and three classmates are building a robot together .
A few buildings away , younger girls are playing " Environmental Science Jeopardy " with their teacher .
Teachers have reached out aggressively to girls , urging them to get involved in science projects and to take math classes .
Among other things , high tech has turned cool .
Students text and download at new highs , and geeky role models show students that math is the gateway to a future in technology .
" Being interested in science , engineering and technology does not make you a geek , and as a matter of fact it 's the geeks who rule the world , " said Suzanne Berliner Hayman , who heads the summer program at the New Jersey Institute of Technology .
The message seems to be working , say researchers .
For the first time , girls are taking math as often as boys .
" We are not born knowing how to do calculus , " said Hyde , the University of Wisconsin professor .
" When girls take classes at the same rate as boys , we tend to get a narrowing of the gender gap . "
That program in New Jersey happens to be girls only , which makes things easier for them .
" Boys are always very competitive , and they want to prove that they 're better , " said 15 - year - old Kate Goodman , a classmate of Romona 's at the New Jersey Institute of Technology .
" Boys like to fool around a lot too . "
While most of America 's engineers are still men , that demographic is also shifting .
Half of the students who continue on to get math degrees are now female .
GNOME 3.0 worries
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .
Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
The mood on some GNOME mailing lists in the weeks prior to the recently - concluded GUADEC conference was somewhat somber ; some members of the community were clearly feeling that GNOME development had slowed down , that the project lacked vision , and that GNOME was threatening to lose its relevance with users .
GNOME subsequently emerged from GUADEC with a new executive director , plans for a 3.0 release , and a new burst of enthusiasm .
It 's amazing what a week in an exotic city with large amounts of beer can achieve .
Since then , however , the enthusiasm has dropped a bit , and work on a proposed 3.0 press release appears to have stalled .
GNOME is now faced with some big decisions , and it's not clear what the project will do .
The initial driving force behind this effort appears to be a plan by the developers of the GTK + toolkit to move to a new ABI without concerning themselves with backward compatibility .
Years of enforced ABI stability have left GTK + with a large pile of compatibility cruft which the developers would like to leave behind ; in addition , there are major changes planned which would be hard to do in a backward - compatible mode .
So the GTK + developers would like to start over with a 3.0 release .
Lots of planning is being done to make the transition easy ; among other things , care will be taken to ensure that GTK +
3.0 will coexist nicely with older installations .
But , in the end , it 's an incompatible ABI change .
At this point , the loudest objections seem to come from Miguel de Icaza .
He fears that a new version of GTK + will leave independent system vendors behind and , perhaps , lead to a series of ABI - breakage events .
In particular , Miguel takes issue with the plan to make the ABI changes for the GTK +
3.0 release , and only add the new features ( which , like much of the GNOME 3.0 plan are somewhat fuzzy at the moment ) later .
The needed new features , he says , should be driving the whole process .
And , if at all possible , those features should be added in a way which does not require an ABI flag day .
It would appear that the GTK + developers are determined to make this change , though , so expect it to go forward .
But a GTK + change is not the same as a GNOME change ; there is no particular need for GNOME to make a major release just because an important library it uses has done so .
Anybody who has looked at the linkage of a GNOME application knows that GNOME uses a lot of libraries ; they cannot all drive major GNOME releases .
So , one might ask , what is happening with GNOME in particular that warrants a 3.0 release ?
This question was , arguably , most eloquently asked by Luis Villa , who has described GNOME 3.0 as " a terrible idea . "
Luis 's point is that an ABI change is not enough to motivate a major release ; instead , there must be a fundamental vision of a better way to do things .
That vision , he says , is not there now .
This is not an unprecedented situation in the GNOME community :
2.0 almost failed for this exact reason - before there was a clear vision about doing usability / simplicity - centered design , the new version number was a huge invitation to insert $ VISION here , leading to all kinds of crack .
A 3.0 process without a clearly - articulated vision will invite the same sort of " crack . "
It will also throw away the rare public relations opportunity that comes with a major update :
Finally , from a media perspective : the reason GNOME 2.0 was a success in the Linux media , and the reason KDE 4.0 has been a failure , is that GNOME 2.0 had a clear , persuasive story around it : simplification and usability .
No one in the media cared that we had a new toolkit , except where it had specific features ( mainly i18n ) that had user benefits .
Writers ate up our usability story - they could tell their readers the story we put out there , and it made sense to them .
KDE 4 has no coherent user - focused story , so this incredible opportunity to reach out to the press has been squandered .
There are , certainly , interesting ideas to be found in the GNOME community .
The online desktop ideas , Document - centric GNOME , and the mobile initiatives are examples .
But it is true that nobody has , yet , put together a concept of GNOME 3.0 which is broad enough to unify and direct all that work while simultaneously being concise enough to fit onto a bumper sticker .
Chances are good that most GNOME developers do not know what GNOME 3.0 really means ; those outside of the development community will have even less of a clue .
The KDE 4.0 experience should be on the GNOME project 's collective mind as it ponders a possible 3.0 release .
Future KDE users may see KDE 4.0 as the turning point where their desktop started becoming truly great , but , for now , it does not look like a whole lot of fun for the KDE development community .
GNOME developers , one assumes , would prefer not to have a similar experience .
GNOME 2.x has been around for some time ; it may well be true that it is time to make a big jump .
It would be gratifying to see some new energy and directions from the highly creative GNOME development community .
If the project can come up with a set of overall goals which can inspire that community toward a set of common ends , GNOME 3.0 could be a spectacular success .
But those goals , if they exist , have not been communicated to the community yet , and that is making some GNOME developers nervous .
There used to be dinosaurs in Brooklyn
[ Ed. note : El Great Burcho published this on February 2007 .
It 's one of our Golden favorites . ]
No , I 'm not being ironic , or corny , or funny .
Neither am I drunk , stoned , nor under the influence of outside forces requiring me to like the Super Mario Bros movie anymore than I already do .
I simply wish to inform you , the reader , as to the reasons why it seems to get an undeservedly bad vibe from the gaming community at large , and why we should all treat it with a hell of a lot more respect than we really do .
Do you think you 're prepared for how long this article is going to be ?
You have no idea how long this article is going to be .
Hit the jump for a prepared dosage of cinematic excellence , complete with screencaps of my favorite bits .
The special effects .
You 've gotta give them credit where credit is due : while the blue screen shots are very easy to spot with my older , wiser , not - eight - years - old - and - therefore - prone - to - believe - everything - I - see - in - a - movie - is - real eyes , the FX shots have so far managed to stand the test of time .
Whether we 're talking about the CGI shots ( like , say , Koopa and Mario disintegrating between both worlds at the very end ) or the practical puppetwork ( the Goombas ) , it 's hard to complain about the quality of how the effects themselves were pulled off .
Hell , nine years later The Mummy even ripped off the " face in the sand " effect seen above .
Bob Hoskins as Mario .
Complain all you want about Luigi 's lack of mustache , but you can't deny that casting Bob Hoskins as Mario was a stroke of genius .
He nails the accent , and manages to make a well - developed character out of what was essentially written as a two - dimensional cartoon .
In case you did n't know , Hoskins -- who also played badass Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit -- is one of the most versatile British actors still alive today .
For God 's sake , the man played Iago in Othello , and he had the balls to play a fatass , Italian plumber for a children 's movie .
And evidently , he did n't even know that Super Mario Bros was based on a video game : after already accepting the job , he went home and told his son , who promptly went apeshit and showed daddy the video game .
I can only assume that by this point , it was too late for him to back out of the film .
The girl who plays Daisy is really cute .
Look at her .
Pouty lips , big eyes , hot eyebrows ... she 's like my dream girl , except not cheating on me with a 24 - year - old guitarist from an underground Emo band .
Gave John Leguizamo his start .
I think this is a good thing .
Regardless , he was n't bad as Luigi , and this is the film that allowed him to make the jump from standup comic to big - screen actor .
Granted , it only took a couple of years for him to make the same jump in the exact opposite direction , but you get my point .
Mario does some actual goddamn plumbing .
Mario , the plumber , is actually doing some plumbing that does n't involve jumping into a pipe .
Until Superstar Saga , this was the only evidence we had of the fact that Mario occasionally , you know , works .
Political satire .
In case you can't read , the poster behind Koopa reads " KOOPA THE ENVIRONMENTALIST , " and he 's holding a chainsaw .
It 's not exactly Jonathan Swift , but you have to admit that , it 's pretty clever viewed in the context of a kids ' movie .
In changing Koopa from a king to a president , whilst keeping all of his fascist traits , the writers simultaneously made the film ( A ) more accessible , and ( B ) more socially relevant .
Plus , we get a lot of cool - looking " VOTE KOOPA " posters , complete with pictures of Dennis Hopper kissing babies .
Come on , it 's pretty clever .
It taught us Super Mario 's last name .
It makes sense that their last names would be Mario , considering you do n't usually classify siblings by the first name of the most popular one ( e.g. , my sister and I are not " The Anthony Siblings " ) -- but nobody really put two and two together until the movie did it for us .
Mario Mario and Luigi Mario .
Say what you will about the canonicity of the film , many fans ( myself included ) still accept that Super Mario 's last name is the same as his first .
You can reject everything else about the film , but this aspect of it has still endured over the years .
The set design .
Sets like those in Super Mario Bros really make me miss the 90's : it was a time when CGI was too expensive and risky to use in great quantities , thus requiring the use of practical sets and special effects .
Honestly , look at that city ; it 's only used in about two scenes , but it 's extremely , extremely detailed on a Blade Runner kind of level .
Neon lights , huge crowds , big buildings ... after films like Mario Bros and Dark City , this kind of set workmanship does n't exist anymore .
The Goombas .
One of the main critiques of the Mario Bros movie during its release was that it was too scary and adult for kids , but too silly and childish for adults .
While I loved the flick as a kid , I can now see what those reviewers meant : the Goombas are pretty fucking creepy .
They 're about nine feet tall with heads the size of my fist , they never speak in anything but guttural gibberish , and their faces are WAY too expressive .
The Goombas are a case of special effects done too well : despite the limited surface area of their faces , the Goombas are capable of expressing pretty much every emotion known to man .
This is kind of cool , but also kind of terrifying .
I 'm not even sure if this is necessarily one of the movie 's good points , but it bears mentioning nonetheless .
Some of the dialogue is pretty funny .
Not knee - slapping hilarious , but clever :
Luigi :
That ’s incredible .
There used to be dinosaurs in Brooklyn ?
Mario :
Do n’t get excited , Luigi .
There used to be Dodgers , too .
Radio :
Be on the lookout for two aliens …
Luigi :
What , now we gotta deal with aliens , too ?!
Mario : Luigi , we ’re the aliens !
Luigi : We are ?
( Mario nods )
Luigi : Woah , cool !
Spike ( pointing at Koopa ) : Fascist !
Iggy ( also pointing at Koopa ) : Oppressor of the proletariat !
Koopa ( pointing at himself ) : Guy in charge .
Anthony Anderson 's first big role .
I kid , I kid .
The most unintentionally slow chase scene ever filmed .
While most of this list is filled with genuinely great things about this movie , even I can't ignore how bad the sewer chase scene is : after rescuing some kidnapped girls from the Goomba lair , Mario and the hostages grab a mattress and proceed to surf down the frozen sewer pipes , at which point they are pursued by the Goombas .
I do n't know why , but the way the chase is filmed makes it feel as if the characters are moving at roughly two miles an hour -- and sadly , it 's the major setpiece of the film ( I used to have a glow - in - the - dark - poster depicting this scene ) .
It 's hard not to watch the scene and laugh at how utterly unexciting it is , but therein lies the film 's accidental genius : you just laughed at how bad the chase was !
You are unintentionally enjoying yourself !
Ha !
The evil granny .
She comes out of nowhere and does n't really fit the tone for the rest of the movie , but at one point Mario and Luigi are mugged by a cattle - prod - wielding granny who shrieks , " I WANT KOOPA KOINS !
I WANT KOOPA KOINS ! "
She 's only around for about ten seconds before Anthony Anderson throws her into traffic , but the granny remains one of the more memorable ( and sadly , one of the most well - developed ) characters in the film .
The grossest prop / character ever designed .
When Koopa took over , he de-evolved the previous Mushroom King into his primordial state of fungus .
Ew .
The entire plot is actually a tweaked version of Hamlet .
The old Mushroom King ( King Hamlet ) is de-evolved ( killed ) by King Koopa ( Claudius ) , and it's up to an inexperienced hero ( Mario / Luigi ) to restore balance to the kingdom by avenging the king .
Daisy is Ophelia and Spike and Iggy are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .
Except , you know , nobody dies .
Mario and Luigi 's leisure suits .
Lookin ' gooooood .
" BOB - OMB ! "
Mario stands on a bridge , weaponless and defenseless .
King Koopa stands across from him , armed with a flamethrower .
What does Mario do ?
He takes out the small windup bomb given to him by the old , fungi - fied king and proceeds to wind it .
Koopa squints , trying to see what he 's doing .
Suddenly , the realization hits him :
" Bob - omb . "
At this point , everyone in the city sees what Mario has in his hands , and they proceed to FREAK THE FUCK OUT .
Cars crash , people trample each other in an effort to run away , and chaos generally ensues .
All based around a small black ball wearing plastic Reebok shoes ( seriously , the Reebok logo is on the Bob - ombs shoes .
I 'm not posting a capture of it , you 'll have to look for yourself ) .
There is n't a kid alive who saw the movie and did n't want one of these .
Dennis Hopper actually signed up to play a giant , evil lizard .
And I have n't the slightest idea why .
Did they lie to him and say he was n't going to have the silliest hairdo ever put on film ?
Or did they fail to mention that he spends an entire scene up to his neck in mud ?
I do n't get it , but it 's damn entertaining to watch one of the guys who starred in Easy Rider shoot fireballs at a mustachioed Shakespearean actor .
This waiter .
He 's at the very beginning of the movie .
WORSHIP HIS MULLET AND YE WILL FIND TRUE ENLIGHTENMENT .
Yoshi !
The inclusion of Yoshi is pretty damn cool .
He shows up about halfway through the third act , which is when most movies choose to stop introducting new characters .
So , if you 're a fan of the games , you 've been looking for references , waiting for your favorite characters , and so on -- by the time Mario and Luigi don their trademark costumes , you assume that we 've already gotten all the Mario characters we 're gonna get .
But , who is that small , chained dinosaur in Daisy 's cell ?
It 's Yoshi !
How cool !
And he has at least one of his abilities from the game ( his long tongue ) , and he actually uses it to help Daisy ( he trips up Koopa 's bitch of a wife and helps Daisy escape ) !
Of course , he gets stabbed in the throat soon after he does so and we never see him again , but it 's still the thought that counts .
The " meteorite bluffing " scene .
At the very end , when Mario and Koopa face off , we 've been led to believe that the meteorite piece Daisy keeps as a necklace is the most important item in the movie : by reuniting the shard with the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs , the universe's two parallel dimensions will merge and Koopa will be able to take over Earth .
Koopa has it in his mouth and all seems lost , until Mario bitchslaps him in the back of the head and Koopa drops the rock to the street below .
Mario , knowing that he has to give Luigi time to make it to the rock , decides to bluff .
He takes off one of his shoelaces and holds it in his hand , pretending that he is actually holding Daisy 's meteorite necklace .
" You want the rock ?
Come and get it ! "
This scene is cool for two reasons .
Firstly , it shows that Mario is a pretty smart sonofabitch .
Secondly , it allows the viewer to avoid the annoying cliche where the hero and the villain fight over a small , precious object , constantly trying to balance their desire to kill one another with their desire to get the object back .
Considering Mario and Luigi are in two different places at the film 's climax , Mario 's decision to bluff allows the viewer to be worried for both characters at the same time : if Mario actually had the rock , we would n't care about Luigi , and if Luigi had it , then there 'd be no reason for Mario and Koopa to fight .
From a screenwriting point of view , Mario 's bluff is actually a pretty clever way of avoiding cliche and keeping the suspense up for both protagonists .
The " de- evolution gun " is just a spray painted Super Scope .
Cool , huh ?
Awkward pre-9/11 use of the World Trade Center towers in a destructive capacity !
Eeeeeeeesh .
Moving on .
The sheer number of references to the video game .
Including , but not limited to : Bertha the fish , Kuribo 's shoe , Bullet Bill , Thwomp , Mushroom Kingdom , Toad , Yoshi , the Koopa Kids , Boom - Boom , Wigglers , Snifits , Fry Guy , Ostro , Bob - Omb , Mario and Luigi 's use of the peace sign , the mushroom powerup , the climax 's recreation of the end boss fight from Super Mario World , Koopa Troopas , and Goombas .
And people complain that the movie is n't faithful enough to the video game .
Come on .
The " let 's make a sequel " ending .
If there 's a more depressing type of ending than the " please let us make a sequel " cliffhanger , I do n't know what it is .
When Daisy , clad in super - hot battle gear kicks open the door to Mario 's flat and declares that " I need your help , " the movie joins the ranks of The Italian Job and Serenity as one of those films whose hypothetical sequel had great potential that was never realized .
So , there you have it .
If you 've already seen the movie , I hope you have a new appreciation for it .
If you have n't seen it , I hope you do .
It 's great for nostalgia value , if nothing else .

The evil doctor : Neil Patrick Harris .
HEADLINES FROM PEOPLE.COM HEADLINES FROM PEOPLE.COM
Horrible is wonderful on the Internet .
Conceived by Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon , Dr. Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog , a three - part musical miniseries , has become an online sensation since Part 1's release Tuesday .
The traffic quickly crashed the server for free - view website drhorrible.com , and iTunes ' downloadable version instantly became , at $ 1.99 , the No. 1 video .
' HORRIBLE ' HIT : ' Dr. Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog '
The musical stars How I Met Your Mother actor Neil Patrick Harris as tongue - tied super - villain Horrible , who hopes his freeze - ray gun will gain him standing with the Evil League of Evil and win him the girl of his dreams .
Nathan Fillion ( Desperate Housewives ) co-stars as self - absorbed hero Captain Hammer .
Felicia Day's Laundromat girl captures both their hearts .
" I love singing and combining that with portraying a rather heinous character , " says Harris .
" We 're getting about 1,000 hits per second , " says Jed Whedon , who worked on the project with his brothers , Joss and Zack , and his fiancée , Maurissa Tancharoen .
" Joss has a lot of crazed fans .
A fan leaked the trailer we were preparing for our website .
Virally , it spread like wildfire . "
Joss
Whedon set out on the low - budget project during the writers ' strike as a lark and a labor of love — and to show the industry an out - of - the - box project could find an audience .
But the overwhelming response has caught him by surprise .
" We had this home - baked idea that we love and we 're proud of , " Whedon says .
" We made this on the understanding that we 'd never make a dime .
But it 's blown up beyond our expectations . "
Made in under a week and at a cost described as in the low six figures , Whedon may have stumbled onto a commercially viable formula for scripted Web video .
" We 're hearing from a lot of people .
We 're giggling that we 're being treated like savvy business people , " Whedon says .
" There 's not a lot of money to be made yet — and you can't throw a lot on it if you have no idea how to get it back , " says Harris .
" Joss has found a happy medium . "
The second episode of Dr. Horrible is online today .
The third will be released on Saturday .
With a revenue sharing agreement with iTunes for all three and business opportunities opening up , Whedon is now considering further webisodes , as well as Broadway and film .
" We love the characters .
We 've done some cool things , and we think there 's more to do with them , " says Tancharoen .

PASADENA , Calif . –
The chief judge of the nation ’s largest appellate court suspended an obscenity trial over which he was presiding Wednesday after a newspaper reported he had posted sexually explicit photos and videos on his own Web site .
Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said he thought the material , which included a video of a man cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal and a picture of nude women on all fours painted to look like cows , could n’t be seen by the public .
The judge said he did n’t believe any of the images were obscene .
“ Is it prurient ?
I do n’t know what to tell you , ” he told the Los Angeles Times .
“ I think it ’s odd and interesting .
It ’s part of life . ”
Kozinski is presiding in the criminal case against a porn movie distributor under a program in which appellate judges are assigned federal trials .
Defendant Ira Isaacs is accused of violating obscenity laws by selling movies depicting bestiality and extreme fetishes involving feces and urination .
The suspension of the trial came after jurors spent hours at the Pasadena offices of the 9th Circuit watching the video evidence in the obscenity case .
Kozinski granted a joint prosecution and defense motion to postpone the proceedings after the prosecution said it needed time to look into the issue of the judge ’s Web site .
The jury was ordered to return on Monday .
The judge indicated to attorneys he would be willing to recuse himself but noted that the trial had already begun and jurors had already seen two of the graphic movies .
“ My personal preference would be to walk away , ” the judge said .
“ But here we are , much is at stake .
Jurors suffered through this afternoon .
We do owe up to go on . ”
Opening statements were under way Wednesday morning when the Times ’
Web site reported that Kozinski ’s personal site contained explicit material and that public access to it was blocked after he was interviewed about it Tuesday evening .
“ If this is true , this is unacceptable behavior for a federal court judge , ” Sen . Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said through a spokesman .
Kozinski , 57 , heads the nation ’s largest federal appeals court , serving nine western states , the territory of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands commonwealth .
The court is known for controversial decisions and has the highest number of cases overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court .
Kozinski told attorneys he had no comment on “ the merits ” of the news story and said he did n’t know about it before the jury was sworn in Tuesday .
The judge told the lawyers he wanted to give them “ an opportunity to think about whether they wish to move to disqualify me . ”
Defense attorney Roger Jon Diamond said he opposed recusal , but Department of Justice lawyer Kenneth Whitted said the government was conferring about its options .
Diamond volunteered to the court that a Beverly Hills attorney , Cyrus Sanai , had recently called him and indicated he had a dispute with the 9th Circuit and knew about the material on the judge ’s Web site .
“ He called me to get my view and I said , ‘ It ’s not right , do n’t do it , ” ‘ Diamond said without elaborating on what that attorney planned to do .
Sanai said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press that he informed the newspaper about the pornographic images on the judge ’s Web site .
Sanai said he discovered the graphic material in December on Kozinski ’s Web site , which he was monitoring as part of a long - running dispute with the 9th Circuit tied to his parents ’ divorce case .
After downloading the files , Sanai said he began contacting reporters at various publications in January to bring attention to what he called widespread ethical problems on the 9th Circuit .
The court “ refuses to acknowledge the existence of judicial ethics , ” Sanai said .
“ I expected people to be shocked and revolted . ”
Cathy Catterson , circuit executive for the 9th Circuit , told the AP that the issue was “ a private matter of the judge at this point . ”
Catterson said the material was on a home server that was maintained “ for use by his family ” and that it made up only a small percentage of the items , which also included family pictures and documents .
“ Most of it was jokes , ” Catterson said , adding that she had not personally seen the material .
“ The contents are a private matter .
It was not meant to be accessible by others , ” Catterson said .
“ He would have been more careful of the contents had he known what was on it . ”
Catterson said that after the story broke , one of the judge ’s sons called Kozinski to say he had been responsible for uploading some of the material onto the computer .
However , she could not say how much or what material was involved .
The Times reported that Kozinski said he must have accidentally uploaded the images to his server while trying to upload something else .
He also said he would delete some material including the pictures of women as cows , which he called “ degrading , ” the Times said .
Kozinski said he began saving the sexually explicit materials and other items of interest years ago , the Times said .
“ People send me stuff like this all the time , ” he said .
Kozinski became the youngest federal appeals court judge in the nation when he was appointed at age 35 to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan in 1985 .
He is known as a strong defender of free speech and First Amendment rights .
Before his site was blocked , visitors to alex.kozinski.com saw a message : “ Ai n’t nothin’ here .
Y’all best be movin ’ on , compadre . ”
Visitors who knew about a subdirectory could see the materials that also included some of Kozinski ’s legal writings and personal photos .
Jean Rosenbluth , a former federal prosecutor and law professor at University of Southern California , said she had not seen the contents on Kozinski ’s
Web site but said if prosecutors move to recuse the judge , he should step down to ensure there is no conflict of interest .
“ He should do the right thing , ” Rosenbluth said .
“ There ’s such an importance that the public perceive justice be fairly administered . ”
Jurors in the trial will decide if the films appeal to a loathsome or degrading type of sexual intercourse and whether the sexual conduct is “ patently offensive , ” judging by the community ’s standards .
Isaacs , 57 , is charged with four counts , including importation or transportation of obscene material for sale .
He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison .
Prosecutors also are seeking forfeiture of assets obtained through his video sales .
Kozinski refused to comment as he left court .
“ I ’m not going to say anything , ” he said .
“ The trial is ongoing . ”

Associated Press Writer Michael R. Blood and Robert Jablon contributed to this report .
John McCain is seemingly imitating the campaign strategy Hillary Clinton used against Barack Obama during the Democratic primaries and caucuses .
Like Mrs. Clinton , Mr. McCain is emphasizing his experience and foreign - policy credentials .
His campaign is also mirroring her campaign focus on winning big states , courting swing voters , and wooing the white , blue - collar vote .
Mrs. Clinton achieved some success with this formula .
Yet in the long run , her strategy failed .
Why , then , is Mr. McCain adopting an approach that ultimately failed for Mrs. Clinton ?
* Experience : Mrs. Clinton stated throughout her campaign that Mr. Obama did not have sufficient experience .
Exit polls from the Democratic primaries and caucuses revealed that the majority of voters agreed with Mrs. Clinton .
Voters nonetheless concluded that he has good judgment and is a capable leader .
Also , change mattered more to them than experience .
Mr. McCain is touting his many years of experience .
The latest Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll reveals that the majority of voters state that Mr. McCain is indeed more experienced than Barack Obama .
Yet they regard Mr. Obama as more likeable and inspirational .
By a margin of 54 percent to 42 percent , voters declare that they prefer a candidate who will bring “ greater changes ” rather than one who has more experience .
* Foreign policy : During the campaign , Mrs. Clinton repeatedly stated that Mr. Obama would not be an effective commander - in - chief .
In February , she launched the infamous 3 a.m. campaign ad .
However , Mrs. Clinton ’s emphasis on her foreign - policy credentials backfired .
It led to highlighting her 2002 vote in support of the Iraq war resolution - a war that the majority of Americans are weary of .
It also led to placing her foreign policy record in the spotlight .
As a result , any gaffe in this area received much press coverage .
Recall her statement that she landed in Bosnia , in 1996 , under sniper fire .
Video footage surfaced revealing that she arrived peacefully and was greeted by a young girl .
The press and public lampooned her as a liar .
Also , in March , when her schedule as first lady was released to the public , it was clear she had been little more than her husband ’s informal adviser during his presidency .
In short , Mrs. Clinton appeared weak and inconsequential in foreign affairs - an area she had claimed was one of her major strengths .
By the time she refocused her campaign message on the economy , it was too late .
Similarly , Mr. McCain is touting his foreign policy credentials .
And this , too , puts attention on the Iraq War - which 68 percent of Americans oppose .
Also , Mr. McCain ’s foreign policy gaffes - such as confusing Sunni and Shi’ite , declaring that American troops might be in Iraq for “ one hundred years , ” and stating that it is not “ too important ” to bring the troops home but to keep them from harm ’s way - are magnified by the media .
The rest of his message is drowned in the roar .
Simultaneously , Mr. Obama ’s campaign is deftly linking Mr. McCain ’s foreign - policy credentials to an unpopular war , an unpopular president and the “ failed politics of the past . ”
* Big states and swing voters :
In her campaign strategy , Mrs. Clinton focused on the big states .
She tried to woo swing voters such as Jews , Hispanics and women .
She did indeed succeed in winning many of the big states and she won the support of the majority of swing voters .
Yet , she still lost the overall pledged delegate count and the superdelegate count .
Mr. McCain , is still campaigning as though we were in 2000 or 2004 - as though the 2008 Democratic primaries had not occurred .
Was he awake during the Democratic primaries ?
Like Mrs. Clinton , he too is focusing on battleground states and swing voters .
Indeed , he needs to make these efforts .
However , he cannot take the conservative base for granted - which he has yet to secure .
He must also have a broader national strategy that attracts new voters .
* White , blue - collar voters : Mrs. Clinton was successful at the end of her campaign in courting white , blue - collar voters .
She emphasized pocketbook issues , portrayed Mr. Obama as an elitist and - to the nation ’s horror - played the race card .
Her campaign rebounded in the final months .
She won West Virginia , Kentucky and Puerto Rico by large margins .
Mr. McCain is attempting to woo the white , blue - collar vote with his economic platform and his straight - talk personality .
Mr. McCain is trailing Mr. Obama by a margin of 42 percent to 47 percent with blue - collar voters .
The Arizona senator has a slight lead with white voters , 47 percent to 41 percent .
Will this be enough to win the election when it was not ultimately sufficient for Mrs. Clinton ?
Mr. McCain has yet to grasp that the old electoral map and the old politics are dead .
In interviews held recently at The Washington Times , leading Republicans , such as former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Rep. Tom Davis , drew attention to Republican deficiencies .
They called for greater party cohesion and better campaign planning .
Mr. McCain should heed their advice .

First , let me start by saying McAfee ’s Total Protection Service is a total piece of shit .
If you value your time , sanity , and the security of your machines – do not purchase this product .
At least not yet .
The current versions suck so hard I actually ate the loss money - wise and got rid of this fucking joke of a service / product .
I spent more time helping their “ support ” groups troubleshoot the clearly released - to - soon turd than I did not worrying about threats to machines .
What makes this kind of funny / sad / frustrating is the graphic they use to help sell this heap of fuck .
[ Courtesy of : mcafeeasap.com ]
Yea .
I do have the knowledge , but do n’t have the time for this .
That ’s why I mistakenly chose your piece of shit product / service .
Instead of concentrating on all the other tasks I need to take care of .
I ’m constantly in contact with you and un-installing and re-installing ( in various ways ) this pathetic excuse for protection .
I ’ve wasted more time on this than I have anything … ever – that ’s remarkable in itself .
You fail so miserably I can not put it into words .
Take your shit back to the production team and tell them they suck so hard that instead of outsourcing all this to India , you ’re going to outsource it to a middle school in Ohio .
I ’ve never been a huge fan of McAfee , but I did n’t think their products were total pieces of shit either – until now .
The main thing I hated about McAfee ’s products was the fact that it seemed like any time an update was released ( even just a . DAT file update ) , it forced you to reboot your machine .
What a huge inconvenience .
Especially considering the frequency of updates to .DAT files .
Most other protection services do not require a reboot for just a .DAT file update .
Lately though , it seemed that their stand - alone protection products had finally gotten the hint and started enabling updates without you needing to reboot your machine every single time .
Major updates to the software still required you to reboot your machine , but .DAT file updates did not ( at least in most cases . )
So one day I was looking for a more consolidated solution to protecting several machines on a network .
I gave McAfee Total Protection a try using their trial version .
Things seemed to work fine , there were a few features I wished were there that were n’t , but I figured it would only be a matter of time before they implemented these features .
What I ’ve come to find out is this .
You basically get a neat little web portal to login to that shows all the computers you have protected by this steaming turd .
You get an overview of the crap it ’s found – which is mostly cookies .
You get to see how many computers who ’s .DAT files are out - of - date ( which will be most of them . )
And that ’s about it .
Oh , by the way , you cannot force updates to machines like you could with Norton like 6 fucking years ago .
Seriously ?
Yes , seriously .
This is not a consolidated solution in the least .
It ’s not a corporate solution like they say – it is at best , a beta , trial , help us make money piece of junk .
I ’d rather install some clunky widget software bloated with malware and advertisements than McAfee ’s Total Let Down Service .
McAfee says that their service can be installed on desktops and servers including Vista ( I know , ) and that it is “ compatible with all mail applications ” .
This is all utter bullshit .
It does not work on Vista ( Seriously , I was forced to buy Vista . )
And it is not compatible with all mail applications .
I installed this on 2 different Vista machines , they never got automatic updates .
They still would n’t update when you tried to force an update .
When using Vista , it does not install on all mail applications as described .
Office 2003
Pro will throw at least 3 errors when trying to start Office Outlook , all of them due to a supposedly missing .DLL file – which is not missing .
Manually registering the file does not help .
When I first installed this complete blunder , no machines would update automatically .
Matter of fact none of them would update at all until I un-installed using all sorts of McAfee ’s whack - ass tools and the re-installed it .
Then it would grab the latest update and then never update again .
I ’ve gone so far with their “ support ” ( through 3 different tiers ) that they actually wanted me to allow them to remote into my machines to try and resolve the issues .
Fuck that shit .
Get your product working correctly on your own machines .
I tried everything they recommended and followed instruction to the letter .
I lost count how many times in un-installed and re-installed it from executables to command line installs .
I used all the available methods of un-installing and re-installing – nothing fixed the issues .
Basically , it ’s become clear to me that this product was released way too early and they are essentially using me as a beta tester .
No thanks .
For the amount of money I paid , I ’ll be damned if I ’m going to help them refine their products and services without some sort of compensation .
If you ’re running a single desktop based on Windows XP Pro – most likely you wo n’t have many problems now that they ’ve released more updated versions .
If you ’re running Vista – you ’re going to have serious troubles .
If you ’re running some server software , you ’re going to have issues .
I seriously have no idea how this company stays in business .
Update : June 30 , 2008
Check out this completely unhelpful and bogus “ Resolution ” McAfee gives for when your machine just wo n’t update with the latest .dat file .
Resolving the “ Unable to Create Cabinet Installer Object ” error Presented below are common causes and solutions to the “ Unable to Create Cabinet Installer Object ” error .
Before contacting Customer Support , McAfee recommends you first verify the below items .
If none of these resolve your issue or if you require assistance , please contact our technical support .
If you are seeing this issue it can be resolved by cleaning up Total Protection for Small Business and installing again .
This issue is normally created by conflicts with an out of date Microsoft Internet Explorer .
It is highly recommended , but not required that you visit Windows Update and install all the latest patches for your version of Internet Explorer or upgrade to the latest version .
Do n’t believe that shit .
This machine has all the latest Windows updates , it ’s running Internet Explorer 7.0.5730.11 , and has been rebooted .
I ’m so sick of completely uninstalling and reinstalling McAfee ’s shit service every time there ’s a .dat update .
Update : April 27 , 2010
Boy , am I glad I stopped using McAfee .
Broken McAfee DAT update cripples Windows workstations .
Great lyricists ?
Bah !
Humbug !
In the 1960s and 70s , I battled students who wanted me to teach Bob Dylan rather than Donne or Yeats .
Ever since , I have had screeds of stuff sent to me by people who thought that rhyme equalled reason , to whom I had gently to explain that their agonised posturings would n't pass for poetry .
I blame Dylan .
In my eyes , he was n't fit to tie Woody Guthrie 's shoelaces .
I have never forgiven him for keeping his fans waiting at the Isle of Wight festival in 1969 for three hours , from 9 o'clock till midnight , before he would sing a word .
Creeps sometimes make good poets , but Bob Zimmerman is n't one of them .
And Madonna , she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler , he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything 's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish - trucks that loads
While my conscience explodes ...
( Visions of Johanna )
Fustian of this ilk crosses my desk every week .
It 's not verse , not even doggerel .
Nor is it prose , because it does n't make sense .
Its combination of pretentiousness and illiteracy is n't surprising , which would be something ; it 's just annoying .
God knows why the texts put to 20th - century music began to be called lyrics rather than words .
Words is fine with me .
Historically , a lyric is a poem in song form , and poets from Wyatt and Surrey to Heaney have been very good at writing them .
Many of our best lyrics were written for music , some of them dittied - that is , written to be sung to a pre-existing tune .
Others are songs that carry their music within them .
Blake 's Songs of Innocence and Experience is his undisputed masterpiece , and five minutes with this tiny sample will show why :
O rose , thou art sick .
The invisible worm ,
That flies in the night
In the howling storm ,
Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy :
And his dark secret love
Does thy life destroy .
The punctuation is from the original engraving .
Chances are if you set this song to music you 'd get it wrong , because its own internal music would be overlaid by another music that neutralised it .
Mapping the music of such an utterance is not easy , but it can be partly understood in terms of musical notation .
Each line has two bars , say , but the downbeat comes on the last note of the bar rather than the first .
If we think of each bar as of the value of a minim , we can see that it may contain any combination of crotchets and quavers that will add up to the minim .
So the first line goes tum tum ta ta tum ( crotchet - crotchet - quaver - quaver - crotchet ) , the next ta ta tum ta ta tum , and so on .
This pattern overlies another pattern of recurring sounds , one in the paired vowel sounds , like the tolling " O rose " ( bong bong ) , a tocsin to begin the poem , followed by eye - eye , ow - ow and oy - oy , and the anxious clickety - click of the short vowels in between .
Yet another kind of patterning can be discerned in the slithering interplay of voiced and unvoiced consonants , which acts like a dynamic , speeding the utterance up and then slowing it down .
The singer - songwriter transforms his words in the way he writes the music and the way he sings his song ;
Blake 's achievement is to encapsulate the entire process in silence .
The other aspect of a lyric is its mystery .
A lyric does not explain itself , nor does it tell a story , except by implication .
Blake 's song is an invocation , to whom or what we do not know .
Is the rose a hedgerow flower or the mystical rose or the barmaid at the Rose and Crown ?
The poem is as simple as may be , being composed of three sentences , the first and third simple and the middle one with a subordinate clause .
The words are all common : we know what each means but not what is meant by them together .
The theme of love and death that permeates our entire literary tradition lies coiled upon itself in this tiny poem , capable at any moment of setting off a chain reaction in the mind .
When Morrissey sings a Morrissey song , he knows exactly what colour every part of every word is meant to be , and whether it crosses the rhythm to build up tension , or cannons into it to gain emphasis .
If Morrissey repeats a line , he may vary it in a new context , or he may keep it exactly the same , as he does with " Every day is like Sunday " , because part of the point of the song is the anguish of monotony as perceived by hapless youth - but the music catapults the repetition towards us like a javelin .
The music does what the words alone cannot do .
To present the words without the music is to emasculate them .
The Italian government was ordered to pay 100,000 euros ( $ A165,000 ) to a gay man who received a driver 's licence for the disabled after he declared his sexual orientation on an official form , the man and a gay - rights group said today .
Danilo Giuffrida , 27 , said he told officials about his homosexuality when he took a physical after being called up in 2000 for Italy 's mandatory year of military service , which has since been abolished .
Giuffrida told AP from his hometown , Catania , he had hoped to avoid service and keep working to help support his family .
Giuffrida was disqualified for psychological reasons .
The popular media hosting website ImageShack just launched a new service that lets you download torrent files onto their servers .
When the download is complete , you can download the files from Image Shack via an http link .
ImageShack ’s torrent download service is still in Beta , but it works just fine .
The only thing you need to do is point ImageShack to the torrent file and press start .
The download will start immediately , and once it ’s finished you can download the files via http onto your computer .
Services like this are not new , but up until now I have n’t seen one that does n’t charge money .
There are some limitations though .
Per month you can download a maximum of 15 GB to your computer , and the storage on ImageShack ’s servers is also limited to 15GB .
Jack Levin , the founder of ImageShack told TorrentFreak : “ We think its going to be a great service for users , especially in the light of ISPs ratelimiting torrent traffic .
There is a lot of free and legal torrents out there , that people should have easy access too
to .
We have the capacity to do it , and the world needs it . ”
For those people who are concerned about the anonymity of the service ( or think it ’s a honeypot ) , Levin said : “ We will not look at what you download and simply provide you , an account , with bandwidth and space .
What you do with it is up to you .
The DMCA applies , so , if we get reports from copyright owners to take down content , we will comply . ”
The service comes with some great features .
It supports selective downloading , which means that you can deselect files from the torrent if you do n’t want to download them all .
This can be quite useful if you only need one album from a complete discography for example .
ImageShack also provides some basic details about the progress of the downloads .
Under the “ status ” link they list information about the download progress , connected seeds and leechers , share ratio and more .
The status reports are not yet working perfectly , as it keeps reporting that a torrent has stopped , while it was downloading just fine .
However , the torrents I have tested were downloaded very fast , and I had no problem downloading the files from Image Shack onto my computer .
A more serious point of critique is that the torrent seems to disconnect as soon as the download has finished .
This basically means that you will be sharing less than you should .
I hope that ImageShack will add a sharing friendly feature in the future , and will at least continue seeding until the share ratio is 100 % .
Levin told us , however , that there are no plans to include such a feature .
They will offer ( paid ) premium accounts , but this will be only for bandwidth and storage upgrades .
Overall I must say that Imageshack ’s new torrent download service looks very promising , especially for a free service .
Decide for yourself , we think it ’s worth a try .

Socratic Skepticism
by Priscilla Sakezles
It is frequently claimed that Socrates said , “ All I know is that I know nothing . ”
For instance , Skeptic magazine makes this claim in its self - defining article in the front matter of the magazine , “ What is a Skeptic ? ”
It uses this quote to justify a long historical tradition for skepticism , but it then castigates Socrates for making this claim , saying : “ this pure position is sterile and unproductive and held by virtually no one .
If you are skeptical about everything , you would have to be skeptical of your own skepticism . ”
This is a misquote that I would like to correct the record for the readers of Skeptic magazine .
The source of this misquote is Plato ’s dialogue the Apology , and there are five different Socratic claims that may superficially appear to justify it .
I will go through the relevant parts of the Apology , reviewing these claims to prove that they are not equivalent to , nor do they imply , the infamous quote .
The Apology is Plato ’s record of Socrates ’ trial on the charges of impiety and corrupting the youth of Athens .
In it we hear the story of Chaerephon asking the Delphic oracle at the temple of Apollo , “ Is there anyone wiser than Socrates ? ”
The priestess replies that there is no one .
Thus , Apollo himself proclaims , “ no one is wiser than Socrates . ”
Socrates cannot believe that this is literally true , because , he says , “ I know very well that I am not wise , even in the smallest degree ” ( 21b4–5 ) .
The Delphic oracle has a reputation for speaking in riddles that require interpretation , so Socrates sets out to discover what the oracle really means .
Attempting to find someone wiser than himself , Socrates goes to those people reputed to be wise , questioning each about his area of expertise .
A military general , for instance , should know “ what courage is ” ( the subject of Laches ) .
A religious zealot prosecuting his father for impiety certainly should know “ what piety is ” ( the subject of Euthryphro ) .
What Socrates discovers , time after time , is that each man is not in fact wise , although he is thought by many people — especially himself — to be so .
Under Socratic cross-examination each man fails to define the concept he claims to know so much about .
Socrates hopes to prove to each man how ignorant he really is .
This process of repeated public humiliation of well - known citizens makes Socrates very unpopular and is what ultimately results in his trial and execution , at least as Plato tells the story .
Socrates says he regrets this effect , but he thinks that the oracle ’s message is meant as a divine command to expose the ignorance of his fellow citizens .
He is thus morally bound to devote his life to this noble , if annoying , cause .
He is confident that Apollo has commanded him to spend his life searching for wisdom , examining both himself and others .
In fact , he claims to be a “ gift from the god ” to the Athenian people , acting as a “ gadfly ” to the large and well - bred but sluggish horse that is Athens ( 30de ) .
Socrates ’ final conclusion after years of such examination is this : “ I am wiser than this man : neither of us knows anything that is really worth knowing , but he thinks that he has knowledge when he has not , while I , having no knowledge , do not think that I have .
I seem , at any rate , to be a little wiser than he is on this point : I do not think that I know what I do not know ” ( 21d7 ) .
Socrates is not claiming that all knowledge is impossible .
For instance , his examination of the artisans shows that they know many things related to their skills that he does not , and so in a sense they are wiser than he .
He says of his own artisan knowledge : “ for I knew very well that I possessed no knowledge at all worth speaking of ” ( 22c9–d1 ) .
However , having this specialized knowledge or skill makes the artisans think they are also wise in “ matters of the greatest importance . ”
Socrates proves they are not .
Again , he decides that he is better off in his current condition , possessing neither their wisdom nor their ignorance .
Socrates ultimately interprets the meaning of the oracle to be that human wisdom is worth little or nothing .
The oracle merely uses Socrates as an example , “ as though he would say to men , ‘he among you is the wisest who , like Socrates , knows that his wisdom is really worth nothing at all ’ ” ( 23b3 –4 ) .
So Apollo is right after all : no one is wiser than Socrates because only Socrates admits his own ignorance .
Socrates , of course , is found guilty and sentenced to death .
But he is not afraid of death , because to fear death is to think oneself wise without really being so , “ for it is to think that we know what we do not know ” ( 29a6 ) .
Socrates does not know what will happen when he dies , although he does suggest two alternatives ( 40 c –41 c ) .
He may cease to exist and so lose consciousness , which would be like a long dreamless sleep .
Or his soul may relocate to another place , where he could spend eternity cross-examining other dead people .
Either option would be fine with Socrates , he does not know which is correct , and so he is not afraid .
We have seen five Socratic quotes that may appear to mean or imply “ All I know is that I know nothing . ”
They are :
( S1 ) I know very well that I am not wise , even in the smallest degree ( 21b4–5 ) .
( S2 ) I do not think that I know what I do not know ( 21d7 ) .
( S3 ) I knew very well that I possessed no knowledge at all worth speaking of ( 22c9–d1 ) .
( S4 ) He among you is the wisest who knows that his wisdom is really worth nothing at all ( 23b3 –4 ) .
( S5 ) To fear death is to think that we know what we do not know ( 29a6 ) .
Are any of these statements really equivalent to “ All I know is that I know nothing ? ” No. ( S1 ) does say that Socrates knows something : that he is not wise .
( S2 ) makes no positive knowledge claim , but rather says quite the opposite : he does not think that he knows anything that he does not really know .
He lacks the false pretensions to knowledge of his interlocutors .
( S3 ) may come close to saying “ I know that I know nothing ” if it is removed from its context and universalized .
But within its context it is obviously limited to saying that Socrates knows that he has no knowledge of the artisan ’s special skills ( for instance , he does not know how to build a house ) .
( S4 ) does make a positive knowledge claim : the wisest person knows that his wisdom is worthless .
( S5 ) says that to fear death is to suppose that one really does know something that one in fact does not know .
Socrates does not fear death precisely because he does not suffer from this epistemological delusion .
“ All I know is that I know nothing ” is not an expression of skepticism , but of dogmatism .
It asserts that I do in fact have positive knowledge of one and only one truth : that I do not have knowledge of any truths .
This is obviously self - contradictory , and is a mistake often falsely attributed to Socrates .
What Socrates does say is that he does not think or claim that he knows anything that he does not in fact really know .
He has the “ human wisdom ” ( 20d ) of recognizing his own ignorance , unlike his many unfortunate interlocutors .
This is the attitude of an honest and sincere skeptic : he does not proclaim knowledge to be impossible , but merely is humble about his own and continues the search , always critically examining any knowledge claim .
Socrates never says that he knows nothing at all , and he certainly does not say that he knows that he knows nothing .
Rather , he says neither he nor anyone else “ knows anything that is really worth knowing ” ( 21d ) .
The meaningful knowledge that Socrates seeks , but never finds , is the real definitions of ethical concepts such as courage , piety , moderation , and justice .
As it turns out ( at least as we can interpret from Plato ’s development ) , he cannot find them because he is looking in the wrong place — the true answers are to be found in the realm of “ forms , ” which his student Plato discovers .
And with that discovery , the philosophical tone of Plato ’s dialogues shift from skeptical to dogmatic .
We must conclude that the attribution of this famous quote to Socrates is wrong .
He is skeptical in a certain sense , but he is not the sort of dogmatic and self - contradicting skeptic that he is often made out to be .
To return to Skeptic magazine ’s self - definition , skepticism is “ the application of reason to any and all ideas … it is a method , not a position . ”
It is the Socratic method , always vigilant to expose false pretensions to knowledge , whether about the real meaning of piety or virtue , the nature or existence of God , ghosts , or UFO’s .
Socrates should be given the credit he deserves as the pioneer of this form of skepticism .

Almost everyone has something to say about the current crisis and the serious trouble our little greenback friend is in .
We are about to be reminded that empires do not fall because of barbarians at the gates , wars of civilizations , or free trade .
It 's the inflation that kills them .
What is stunning about the current situation is the sudden disappearance from the stage of the not - so - long - ago fashionable Keynesian and monetarist doctrines .
Even more surprising , most Keynesians and monetarists speak now in the language of fundamentals about micro problems and malinvestments .
Keynesian Is as Keynesian Does
Let us start with the Keynesian doctrine , whichever you want , orthodox - , new - , or post - .
We can even create a new one under the label paleo- , but it would not change the substance of the dogma .
The essence of Keynes 's analysis of the price system is that it needs a specific kind of stimulus in order to keep the level of aggregate spending that drives the economy to its full employment level .
What matters from the Keynesian perspective is that , for some reason , the free - market mechanism fails to achieve this goal .
It might be a sudden collapse in the marginal efficiency of capital ; it might be the fault of real and nominal rigidities , a decrease in consumption , or maybe , well , animal spirits are to blame for all the mess .
Depending on the particular story , we reach various versions of the Keynesian ideology , which apparently has a universal cure for the economy : government policies .
Again , it may be fiscal policy , or monetary policy .
Pick a version of your Keynesian story , and you 'll know which solution to pursue .
But the conclusion is rather obvious : the state , through its compulsory means , has to boost the level of aggregate demand in some way to stop the economy from falling into recession .
But if the usual Keynesian explanation is that one needs aggressive monetary and fiscal policy to boost the national income to survive recession , then how are we supposed to view the current crisis ?
Obviously current policies in the United States can be called many different things , but not conservative or even moderate .
For a sustained amount of time the US government did everything it could to aggressively engage in monetary and fiscal pumping .
Budget deficits soared and the interest rates were lowered to absurd levels .
This helped the supply of dollars to go through the roof and prepare the green paper money for a remarkable collapse .
Of course , Keynesians can in no way explain the bust by referring to any of their official stories .
Moreover , any serious economist saying now that the economy needs even more loose monetary policy would be considered a monetary crank , singing in the rain of falling dollars .
At the same time a cry for an increase in government borrowings and issuance of more bonds to the credit markets would also be considered highly irresponsible .
Although Keynesians do not use their usual tales to analyze the real estate meltdown , nonetheless , in their theoretical analysis , on the academic level , they keep talking about the need to boost spending .
Once again , neatly formulated theory detached from reality prevails .
The First Rule of Monetarist Reasoning Is that You Do Not Talk about Monetarist Reasoning
Just as a neoconservative lives in symbiosis with a social democrat , a Keynesian has a younger brother : a monetarist .
The monetarist is definitely narrower in his investigations than the Keynesian , and his name fits him perfectly , for to him , all of economics is about money .
What matters for economic activity is the money supply and the consumer price index ( CPI ) determined by it .
The most famous monetarist , Milton Friedman , was primarily obsessed with money supply and keeping the CPI stable .
If the CPI is unwavering , then the economy has to be in good condition .
Problems might arise only when the official rate of inflation gets out of control .
But if it is kept at low levels , then the economy is under control , and the monetary policy is sound .
In an interview from 2003 ( conducted by Henri Lepage ) , Friedman stated that the conditions of prosperity are secured .
The inflation monster has been tamed , unemployment is low , there is no financial crisis and no deflation , productivity is growing , and banks are in good shape .
For many years Friedman praised Alan Greenspan 's monetary policy .
And although he did differ in some way from others ( as most Keynesians differ one from another ) and did not accept the discretionary tools that the Fed used , he still believed that policies of monetary pumping were a good idea and brought enormous prosperity .
So for a monetarist , the main macroeconomic aspect is the CPI , driven by Fed actions .
If the CPI increases , the Fed should tighten , and in the case of decreasing CPI , the Fed should step in and loosen , to stimulate the economy .
Serious recessions take place , according to this view , because the Fed does not pump enough money ; this was supposedly what happened in 1929 .
It is easy to see why the monetarist story is in as deep trouble as is its Keynesian relative 's story .
The overgrowing boom , which started many years ago , has been accomplished with a stable Consumer Price Index .
During those days , monetary policy could be called anything but too restrictive .
Under current conditions , with the banks in the kind of trouble that Austrians have foreseen for many years , the Fed 's policy has never been so relaxed .
Both Keynesians and Monetarists are Quiet
Now , as we see , the current problems can be explained neither by the monetarist way of thinking nor by the Keynesian .
Both macroeconomic approaches are flawed and cannot be applied to the recent crisis .
The remarkable silence from those two doctrines proves the point .
I do not mean that they do not discuss the crisis .
Mainstream economists do talk about it , but they are not using the Keynesian and monetarist doctrine .
Nobody talks about CPI as the only sign of economic stability , and nobody seriously states that the crisis is a result of decrease in aggregate demand and lack of loosened policies .
Instead , what most of us hear about are fundamentals and the crucial investment mistakes that were stimulated by lowered interest rates and a growing debt bubble .
It appears that , for the purpose of explaining the current meltdown , macro gibberish about CPI and GDP seems unimportant .
CPI does not reflect micro changes in the relative price structure , and GDP can impressively grow through malinvestments that eventually have to be liquidated .
Price relations , resource scarcity , the structure of liabilities and expected revenues between the firms in the market are the key issues .
Welcome to the world of Austrian economics .
Due to banking bailouts , we could echo Paul Krugman , who says the same thing as William Poole of the Federal Reserve — that there is a difference between liquidity and insolvency .
The central bank might pump the money in case of sudden leakage of the money from the system .
But the case of insolvency is much more troubling , for it means that even if the central bank helps the commercial bank in the short run , the bank is still in trouble , since it started the expansion process that cannot be sustained over the long run through temporary offset of liquidity shortages .
Although the story of liquidity and solvency is a little overstated , one thing should be recognized .
This difference cannot be made in the Keynesian macro framework .
Nor can it in the monetarist .
It can only be made at all by referring to the micro sphere , which has always been the subject of Austrian analysis .
Middle - of - the - Road Banking System Leads to Financial Socialism
Current monetary and fiscal policies , whether you prefer the Keynesian or the monetarist version , ended up in complete failure .
So what is left for the mainstream economists after their favorite tools failed ?
Abolish the Fed and move toward a free - market monetary system ?
Of course not : if Fed policies failed , then it's not really the policies that are bad , but the free market itself !
There had to be something inherently wrong with the market system that it did not comply with marvelous government policies and the theories behind them .
In this manner , for example , Irving Fisher — the Gandalf the Grey of paper money ( Friedman being Gandalf the White ) — before the Great Depression , argued that the gold market should have been manipulated in order to provide a sound monetary policy .
Since the Great Crash brutally verified this idea , Fisher did not blame the inflationary policies of the roaring ' 20s and the manipulation of the gold market , but proposed more interventionist measures , i.e. , a partial nationalization of the banking industry by subjecting the banks to a 100 % fiat - money system .
One should not forget about Mises 's great insight that middle - of - the - road - policy leads to socialism , which applies well beyond price controls .
His contribution was that the price control imposed upon the market would not lead to expected results , but instead would create chaos .
The endgame is to either abolish all controls , or go along the way of extreme interventionism and end up with full socialism , in which the government runs the economy .
How similar is the current situation in the case of the American banking system ?
After a tremendous bubble , not only in real estate , but the whole financial system , the day to pay the bills came at last .
The necessary steps would be to liquidate bad investments and allow the recovery process to take place .
Instead , we see more cries from the banking sector for more government intervention .
The Fed tries desperately to bail out any falling giants .
It began to destroy the very last instances of the market mechanism in the banking sector .
Now the wasted assets of the banks , mortgage based securities , are being exchanged ( via innovative " TAF " and " TSLF " operations ) by the Fed for government bonds in order to improve their balance sheets .
At the same time , interest rates are being lowered to provide even more liquidity and to socialize risk , increasing moral hazard .
What we are witnessing is a great demonstration of one of the most important Austrian contributions to monetary economics : that a central bank has socialistic potential .
Think about it .
In socialism , the central planner increases the amount of goods he possesses by means of expropriation .
If he needs anything , a decree is the way to acquire it .
In the central banking system , the decree is replaced by something else : printing money .
If something is needed , direct expropriation and an official decree are not required ; fiat money is enough .
Print the money and you can buy anything you want .
The ultimate boundaries differ of course .
Under old - fashioned socialism , there is always the possibility of creating enslavement through direct use of force .
In contrast , in the financial socialism that is being created right now , the last stop is hyperinflation , which will ultimately destroy central bankers ' only way of redistributing property — fiat money .
Mainstream economists will not advise the abolition of this tool .
Instead they will search for the cause in the liberalization of the banking system , poor accounting standards , and rating agencies that absurdly gave collateralized debt obligations high grades .
Once we find the guilty parties , we will be ready to increase intervention on the market .
The solution will probably include the issuing of new , extended Sarbanes - Oxley Acts , regulating even more rating agencies ( despite the fact that it is the Security Exchange Commission that created the cartel of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ) , or maybe tighten the rules of BASEL regulations for the banks .
All this is necessarily like extinguishing a fire with gasoline .
It can only end up producing more turmoil and trouble in the future and at the same time move us further away from the free market system .
The only way to get out of the current mess it to go to its roots , and return to the personal responsibility that is inherent in the private - property order .
Otherwise , any change in modern regulations will only open new doors for doing shaky business .
It is time to reject the nominalistic and positivistic view that words coming from the mouths of lawmakers can change the nature of reality .
Conclusion
To answer the title question , our Keynesian friend has put his usual monetary and fiscal policies back into his pocket , at least for now .
Unfortunately , he still wants the government to run the economy — and this time move us even closer to financial socialism .
What do crocodiles , breast milk , pickles , a skeleton , and a camel costume have in common ?
Believe it or not , they were all found by amazed airport security in the bags of some unforgettable travelers .
Read on to learn the bizarre stories surrounding these astounding airport incidents and many more .
A Skeleton in the Luggage
An elderly woman was stopped at Munich airport , after the staff found something seemingly sinister in her bag : a skeleton in a sealed plastic bag .
No , this old duck was n't the killer .
She just wanted to fulfill the dying wish of her brother who passed away 11 years ago .
Grandma was simply taking him to his homeland of Italy for a proper burial .
Better late than never I suppose !
As the woman was not violating any laws she was allowed to continue her journey , skeleton and all .

Camel Costume Causes Airport Chaos
What would compel a traveler to pack their camel costume on vacation ?
Or to even have one in the first place ?
We might never know , but this weird piece of luggage caused chaos at Sydney Airport .
A baggage handler was so taken by the disguise he stole it from a suitcase and donned it on the tarmac !
The incident may have gone undetected had the traveler not spotted his costume when he boarded his plane !
Yes it was a security breach , but it 's hilarious nonetheless .

Breast Milk Mistaken for Poison
An American mom was unconcerned when staff at JFK Airport approached her for a random search .
She never imagined the stir her three bottles of breast milk contained within her travel bag would make .
The poor woman was ordered to drink from each one to prove the liquid was n't poison !
She offered to simply place a drop of breast milk on her arm and taste it but airport security insisted she gulp it down .
Her lawyer commented , " I think the number of Caucasian , lactating mothers who have passed through al Qaeda training camps is negligible ! "

Seal 's Head in a Suitcase
Logan International Airport staff were in for a surprise when they found a severed seal head in the bag of one of their passengers .
The man was a biologist who cut off the head of a dead seal he found on his travels .
He hoped to keep the specimen for educational purposes , but was refused because he did n't have a permit .
Personally I think that 's a good thing .
Can you imagine the smell of clothes packed in near a dead seal 's head ?

Snakes and Pickles in India
It seems some interesting things pass through the airports in India .
A local newspaper reported that a passenger was found travelling with a snake only after the plane was in the air .
Thankfully it was nothing like that Samuel L. Jackson movie , but you 've got to wonder how airport staff miss these things .
But they were on their toes when a young girl was found carrying a bottle of pickles in her bag .
Her treats were snatched away at Dabolim Airport .
Sure it 's a little weird to carry them , but do pickles pose a bigger security threat than snakes ?

Dead Snakes and Birds in Jars
More snakes this time , but they 're no longer slithering .
A man travelling from South Korea to Atlanta was stopped with 30 dead snakes in jars and bottles , and some dead birds to boot .
The story does n't explain exactly why anyone would travel with so many deceased critters in their suitcase , so I guess we 'll just have to make up that bit for ourselves !
Maybe they were travel snacks !

Think those stories were weird ?
Well check out these disturbing reasons never to look in a woman 's handbag !
To great fanfare in the Western media , the Serbian government recently arrested Radovan Karadzic , leader of the Bosnian Serb nationalist cause during the war in the former Yugoslavia in the early to mid-1990s , on war crimes charges .
Karadzic and Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic , who is still at large , have been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) , located in the Hague , in connection with the siege of Sarajevo , during which up to 11,000 people were killed , and the massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the town of Srebrenica .
That Karadzic is responsible for war crimes should not be in question .
Under his political leadership , Serbian nationalists engaged in terrible atrocities –including the shelling of cities and towns , massacres of civilians , rapes and herding people into concentration camps –to drive people out and create an “ ethnically pure ” swath of Bosnia and the Krajina region of Croatia that they hoped to annex to Serbia .
But this fact alone does not close the case .
As with all war crimes tribunals in history , there is selectiveness about what is considered a war crime and who ends up on the dock .
After the Second World War , some Nazis were put on trial in Nuremburg ( though because of U.S. Cold War interests in establishing a strong German state and utilizing former Nazis as spies and scientists , the trials were wound up quickly ) .
But as a court of the victors , no Americans were tried for the nuclear obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki or for the firebombing of Tokyo and Dresden .
Throughout the Balkans conflict , Serbs were systematically demonized in the Western press , while atrocities and ethnic cleansing committed by Croats and Muslims were either omitted or played down .
On first look , the ICTY offers an image of impartiality .
In addition to indicting Slobodan Milosevic , Karadzic and Mladic , it has also indicted Milan Babić , president of the Republika Srpska Krajina ; Ramush Haradinaj , former prime minister of Kosovo ( recently acquitted ) ; Rasim Delić , who served as commander of the main staff of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina from June 1993 until September 200 ; and Ante Gotovina , former general of the Croatian Army ( currently on trial ) .
However , of the 161 individuals indicted by the ICTY , from common soldiers to generals , police commanders and political leaders , three - quarters are Serbs or Montenegrins .
This is not surprising considering the court was established by the UN Security Council , under pressure from the U.S. –making it , again , a “ court of the victors . ”
While it is true that the conflict in the region developed out of the ambitions of Slobodan Milosevic for a greater Serbia , uniting the Serbs of Serbia with those living in Bosnia and Croatia , Croatia ’s nationalists under Franjo Tudjman were no less ruthless in their efforts to create a “ greater Croatia , ” based on the ethnic cleansing of Serbs from the Krajina and Serbs and Muslims from parts of Bosnia .
Croatian paramilitaries massacred hundreds of Muslim civilians in the town of Ahmici , to give just one example .
After shelling the town to force townspeople to flee , Croatian forces sprayed them with machine gun fire across an open field through which the people were forced to run , a scenario similar to the atrocities committed by Serbian forces in many Bosnian villages during the war .
Indeed , as Bosnia came under attack from Serbian and Croatian paramilitaries , Muslim nationalists , with ( eventually ) military aid and air support from the U.S. and Europe , engaged in similar acts of ethnic cleansing as their Serbian and Croatian counterparts .
Journalist Misha Glenny , in his excellent book The Fall of Yugoslavia , offers an example :
Wherever they could , the Muslims used the considerable sympathy which they enjoyed in the outside world as a cover to undertake military operations .
In December and early January [ 1993 ] , they launched an intensive offensive from Srebrenica with the aim of regaining control of Bratunac , to the east on the river Drina .
The Serbs were caught unawares by the attack , and the Muslims moved swiftly through Serbian villages , slaughtering a large number of civilians on the way .
Because the atrocities were being perpetrated by the Muslims , they received relatively little attention in the world media .
They also provoked a fearsome counter - attack by the Serbs , who had soon driven the Muslims back to Srebrenica .
Politicians and journalists were quick to condemn the Serbs for this operation , but they entirely neglected to point out that it had been provoked by the original Muslim offensive .
But what really throws the impartiality of the court into question is that no individuals–military or political leaders –from NATO countries that intervened in the war have been indicted .
Yet there can be no doubt that the United States and NATO forces committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia–first , in the Bosnian war , and later , in the air war against Serbia in 1999 during the conflict over Kosovo .
From the start , there was the complicity of the Western powers in creating the conditions that made war and ethnic cleansing inevitable .
As Phil Gasper wrote :
In the end , Germany ’s recognition of Croatia ’s independence –without any guarantees of the Serb minority ’s national rights in Croatia–made the outbreak of war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia inevitable .
The same holds true for Bosnia .
Germany and the U.S. recognized Bosnian independence even though the majority of Bosnian Serbs and Croats–about 51 percent of the republic–had rejected it .
By doing so , they put their seal of approval on Bosnia ’s descent into war .
Then there is the direct complicity of the United States in the greatest single act of ethnic cleansing that took place during the war–Operation Storm in August 1995 .
By 1993 , the U.S. was finally able to strong - arm its reluctant European war partners into adopting a new policy ( the old one being an arms embargo on Bosnia ) –NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs , combined with arming the Bosnian Muslim army .
The policy was called “ lift and strike . ”
Peter Galbraith , U.S. ambassador to Croatia , brokered a new alliance–after the two sides had been fighting for months in central Bosnia–between Croatia and the Bosnian Muslims .
To “ level the playing field ” further , a group of retired U.S. generals helped Croatia to devise a military plan , with U.S. and German military aid , to overrun the Serb - held Krajina region .
A private U.S. mercenary company , Military Professional Resources Inc. , provided training to the Croatian Army .
The August 4 , 1995 , Croatian offensive , dubbed “ Operation Storm , ” drove upwards of 200,000 Krajina Serbs from their homes .
Human rights observers reported the burning of homes , looting and massacres of elderly Serbs too old to flee the region .
Croatia was completely “ cleansed ” of its historic Serbian population , and in the following weeks , U.S. air support for Muslim and Croatian forces allowed them to seize 20 percent of Bosnia back from the Serbs .
According to Mark Danner , writing in the New York Review of Books :
During two weeks beginning at the end of August , NATO pilots flew 3m400 sorties , destroying Serb antiaircraft batteries , radar sites , ammunition depots , command bunkers , bridges .
Meanwhile , the Croats and Bosnians pressed their combined attacks in northwest Bosnia , conquering town after town .
Indeed , NATO planes had in effect become the Croatian and Bosnian air force , ensuring that they would succeed , in just over two weeks , in changing the balance of power in Bosnia .
Bill Clinton praised Operation Storm , saying that he was “ hopeful Croatia ’s offensive will turn out to be something that will give us an avenue to a quick diplomatic solution . ”
The three - pronged offensive –the Croat invasion of Krajina , a Muslim attack in central Bosnia and punishing air strikes–pushed all sides to the negotiating table in 1995 to sign the Dayton Accords .
Today , Ante Gotovina , the Croatian general who led Operation Storm , along with two other generals , is currently facing trial on war crimes charges associated with that operation .
But Bill Clinton and the U.S. generals who helped plan it and gave the green light for it remain at large .
Finally , the 11 - week NATO air assault on Serbia during the Kosovo war in 1999 is a war crime that the tribunal wo n’t touch .
The U.S. claimed that it went to war to help Kosovar Albanian refugees under attack by Serbian forces .
However , the NATO bombing produced another several hundred thousand Kosovar refugees and later helped facilitate the cleansing of the Serb minority from Kosovo .
U.S. and NATO planes conducted several thousand sorties , destroying Serbia ’s power grid , factories ( 372 industrial sites ) , railways , bridges , schools and hospitals .
Between 1,200 and 1,500 Serb civilians and as many as 5,000 Serbian military personnel were killed .
At one point , NATO planes destroyed a bridge filled with fleeing refugees , killing 87 people .
After blowing up Belgrade ’s TV station with a cruise missile , killing 16 people , NATO officials justified it by claiming that the station had been a source of “ propaganda . ”
Directing and encouraging ethnic cleansing , playing one nationality off of another , bombing civilian infrastructure and murdering civilians –these acts engaged in by the U.S. and its NATO allies took place under the pleasant halo of “ humanitarian intervention . ”
The perpetrators of these great “ humanitarian ” deeds will likely never see the inside of a jail cell or face criminal prosecution for their crimes against humanity without a massive alteration in the balance of forces in the world between the powerful and the dispossessed .
The legal fortunes of Darryl Barnes have waxed and waned over the many years since he was shot by a police officer on a Bronx street -- a wound that left him paralyzed -- but finally ended for good this week .
Darryl Barnes was shot in 1988 by NYPD Officer Franz Jerome , who apparently saw Mr. Barnes running down the street carrying a Tec - 9 assault pistol .
When Jerome ordered Barnes to stop , Barnes shot at the policeman , who returned fire and struck the runner - and - gunner in the spine .
Back in 1998 , Barnes was awarded $ 76.4 million by a Bronx jury .
That award was reduced to $ 8.9 million and then overturned by the State Appeals Court in 2002 .
In 2003 , Barnes brought the case to a second trial where the jury awarded $ 51 million , which was later reduced to $ 10.75 million .
The State Court of Appeals finally said this week that Barnes would be receiving nothing from the City , and also fined him $ 100 in court costs as a sort of final insult - to - injury parting gift .

The US Republican presidential candidate , John McCain , is attracting millions more dollars in funding than expected , which could allow him to match the much - vaunted Barack Obama donation machine .
He is on course to raise $ 400 m ( £ 201 m ) for the November election , which he said would put him roughly level with Obama .
McCain surprised US political pundits by raising $ 22 m in June , his best showing since he launched his bid for the White House early last year .
Obama remains favourite to win the election , with polls showing him on average five points ahead , but McCain is showing increasing signs of making a fight of it in spite of his lacklustre campaign so far .
Obama opted out of a public finance scheme - which provides $ 84.1 m in federal funding to cover election expenses but sets that as a ceiling - in expectation of raising hundreds of millions more .
But he is suffering for several reasons : a failure so far to win over the big Democratic fundraisers who bankrolled Hillary Clinton 's failed campaign for the nomination ; an unwillingness of his supporters to help cancel Clinton 's $ 23 m debt ; and , to a lesser extent , a creeping disillusionment among sections of the party grassroots with his recent shift from left to centre .
Obama 's campaign team has yet to post its fundraising figures for June .
His fundraising has been on a downward trend : he raised $ 55 m in February , $ 41 m in March , $ 31 m in April and $ 22 m in May .
The June figures are expected to reverse that trend but still fall significantly short of the total needed to meet election budget needs .
Obama 's campaign team said yesterday that a Wall Street Journal report that he had raised $ 30 m in June - $ 20 m less than expected - was " way off the mark " .
A spokesman , Dan Pfeiffer , said : " Some in the press still have n't realised that anyone who is talking about numbers does n't know what our numbers are . "
In addition to what he raises himself , McCain will have access to the funds of the cash - rich Republican party - about $ 68 m - while Obama will have only modest help from the Democratic party , which has about $ 3 m at its disposal .
Obama devoted much of this week to private fundraising events , courting in particular Clinton 's wealthy supporters .
Obama can return again and again to the small donors he has attracted on the internet but needs the big donors as well .
" It 's one of the reasons why the Clinton people are so important , " Kirk Wagar , Obama 's Florida finance chairman , told the Washington Post .
" Most of us have beaten our Rolodexes [ contact lists ] pretty badly . "
Obama is hoping to raise about $ 500 m - $ 300 m for himself and the rest for the Democrats fighting for seats in Congress .
Michael Jackson became well known for his trademark moonwalk dance Michael Jackson 's song Billie Jean has been voted the greatest dance record of all time by BBC Radio 2 listeners .
Written by Jackson , and co-produced by Quincy Jones , the track won two Grammy awards and went to the top of the UK charts in 1983 .
Donna Summer 's I Feel Love , which topped the UK charts in 1977 , took second place in the music poll .
In third place was soul legend James Brown with Get Up ( I Feel Like Being A ) Sex Machine .

" This is Jackson at his best .
This track is way up there for me - Jacko's rendition of it at the Motown 25th anniversary show has got to be one of the great live performances of all time .
" The bassline is awesome , the production is killer .
It 's just perfect . "
' Sonic personality '
The beginning of Jackson 's Billie Jean is instantly recognisable because of the first few drum beats in the introduction .
Sound engineer Bruce Swedien said Jackson asked for the song to have " the greatest sonic personality that you can possibly put on a track - starting with the drums " .
A panel of music experts , including DJs Trevor Nelson and Danny Rampling , drew up a shortlist of 20 records , which were then voted for by listeners online .
The songs , dated from 1966 to 2001 , were selected for their " musical merit , and importance in the narrative of UK dance music " .

What are these ?
No two nachos are created equally .
When somebody offers you a nacho from their appetizer plate at a restaurant or while on the couch at home in front of a movie , you need to move fast :
First up , quickly scan their entire plate .
What stage is this offer being made ?
Are you in the game when the plate is hot and full , or are we dealing with mostly crumbs and surplus jalapenos at this point ?
Size up the prize and give a quick yes or no .
Now if you ’re going in , do n’t wait too long to make your move .
If it ’s obvious you ’re putting too much thought into it , you ’ll come across as selfish .
Definitely do n’t move any toppings around to build yourself a massive All - In Salad Nacho , but there ’s no need to pull out that bland , naked chip at the bottom of the Jenga stack either .
You were n’t offered crumbs and you do n’t deserve crumbs .
Remember that .
Next up , locate your prey and dive in .
Everyone has their personal preferences , though I ’m a big fan of 90 – 100 % melted cheese coverage and about 25 - 50 % salsa coverage .
Any less cheese coverage , and it ’s just taco shell to me .
Any more salsa coverage and I feel like I ’m drinking the stuff .
And hey , if I grab an olive , green onion , or jalapeno , that ’s great too , but I do n’t push my luck .
Lastly , for my money , you can keep that shredded lettuce .
That ’s just grated water in my books .
Bottom line : know your tastes , size up the game , and dig in quickly .
Mastering that perfect pick is a valuable life skill .
Now go grab life by the nachos .
AWESOME !
Obama Bashing , Extra Crispy State Farm Style Posted by Pile ( 30963 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Activists ]
A friend of mine sent these pictures to me , taken by someone in Louisiana .
I wonder what State Farm Corporate thinks of this ?
And it 's further ironic considering what this insurance company did to residents in the region post - Katrina .
I had to personally drive out and verify this .
Yes , it 's there .

Posted by Pile on 2008-07-06 13:22:08 I was in New Orleans during Katrina .

It really annoys me when people make ignorant statements like yours .
We even ran stories on state farm more than a year ago .
State Farm was my agent .
I know what they did to me and other people .
State Farm accused of Racketeering over Hurricane Katrina claims
NEW ORLEANS - State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. engaged in a " pattern of racketeering " by manipulating engineering reports on Hurricane Katrina damage so the company could deny policyholder claims , lawyers for a group of Mississippi homeowners allege in a lawsuit filed Wednesday .
The federal suit against State Farm represents a new legal strategy for attorney Richard " Dickie " Scruggs , who has played a prominent role in challenging the insurance industry for its handling of Katrina claims .
Hundreds of homeowners in Mississippi and Louisiana have sued their insurers for denying their claims after the Aug. 29 , 2005 , storm .
The suits typically accuse insurers of bad faith and breach of contract for refusing to pay for damage from Katrina 's storm surge .
State Farm settles lawsuit the day of the trial
State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. agreed Monday to settle a Mississippi policyholder 's lawsuit over Hurricane Katrina damage before a jury could be picked to try the case .

669 homeowners sue State Farm 30 year history of screwing customers
Posted by 72 Dawg on 2008-07-06 16:23:46
I dropped State Farm 30 years ago when they tried to screw me out of a fairly small claim when my car was broken into and burglarized .
They tried to say that because the car was 5 years old that they would depreciate my loss by 1 % a month .
That 's 60 months or 60 % .
This is patently illegal is 50 states .
They wanted me to sign an agreement to this effect and I was physically intimidated by the claims adjuster .
I got in my car and drove away with the man yelling at me that I would never see a dime of my claim .
I reported this to the state , and a few months later I received 100 % of my claim thanks to the State insurance commission .
State Farm is sleazy .
Stay far far away from them .
No problem !

Down there in green - toothed gooberland , all the nice clean white folks are voting for McCain .
And I 'm guessing that Bud Gregg do n't sell no insurance to no Nigras anyhow .

Not surprising for Mandeville
Posted by Horizons 500 on 2008-07-07 10:47:40
If this is in Mandeville , Louisiana , as I 've been led to believe , nothing would surprise me .
The mayor there is still on the job , despite causing three Lake Pontchartrain Causeway policemen and their chief to lose their jobs when they tried to cover for him on a DWI recently .
The same mayor who nearly swerved into a police car two years earlier while driving drunk , and drove off drunk again when one of the officers dropped him off at city hall .
Mandeville is an upscale , nearly all - white Republican stronghold north of New Orleans where racial incidents have occured at Mardi Gras parades and Klan activity has been strongly rumored .
David Duke lives there , too .
Need I say more ?
Gooberland
Posted by Diverwpg on 2008-07-09 09:48:14
I take offense at being lumped in as a resident of " green - toothed gooberland " .
Mandeville is 30 miles from New Orleans but is light - years away from the general political climate of New Orleans .
We New Orleans voters traditionally vote Democratic .
Mandeville traditionally votes Repugnican .
Most all of us have white teeth except for the black - toothed meth addicts in the Mandeville piney woods .
- lol
I was fortunate enough not to have flooded but had extensive wind and subsequent rain damage .
My insurance company , Horace Mann , treated me pretty fairly .
Most of my friends , co-workers and acquaintances who had State Farm homeowners insurance have been very dissatified with the service and damage awards .
My personal experience with State Farm was with auto insurance over 20 years ago .
They used a quitclaim award of $ 60 to move a $ 140 case to the $ 200 threshold to make the claim chargable .
Six months later thay cancelled my insurance when my ex-wife got into a fender bender .
F*** State Farm !!
Setting the Record Straight
Posted by Mike Fernandez - VP , Public Affairs , State Farm on 2008-07-09 17:53:34 " Pile on " is perhaps an appropriate moniker but let me try to set the record straight .
One , you are right , Mr. Gregg 's sign is not endorsed by nor consistent with State Farm 's corporate practices .
Two , the company does not endorse nor attack candidates .
For that matter , we do n't even have a corporate political action committee ( PAC ) like most other major companies .
Three , State Farm employees and agents are free to engage in political activities as individuals , but not as representatives of State Farm ( by the way , several in fact , like me , actually support Senator Obama ) .
Four , while we are not perfect , it is our commitment to our policyholders to pay what we owe , promptly , courteously , and efficiently .
Five , when it comes to Hurricane Katrina , more than 5,600 employees and independent adjustors were assigned to the Gulf Coast to help pay claims ( not deny them ) .
In fact , we managed an unprecedented number of claims ( more than 295,000 homeowner , commercial and National Flood Insurance Program claims and more than 99,000 auto claims ) and most of these claims were settled in fairly short order .
In all , State Farm has paid more than $ 3.6 billion in Hurricane Katrina claims not including payments made under the National Flood Insurance Program .
All that said , there were lawsuits ( some legitimately arguing points of law , others frivolous -- some of the second variety are featured in " Pile on " posts ) and there were situations that could have been handled better than they were .
In the end , we feel for those who were negatively impacted by the hurricane and whose lives were lost or changed forever by Mother Nature .
We learned from the experience and hope coastal residents all across the U.S. have come to appreciate the value of buying flood insurance ( sadly fewer than 20 % of coastal residents in Mississippi had flood insurance ... more than 60 % had flood insurance in Louisiana ) .
Who Do You Think You Are ?
Posted by GiveMeABreak on 2008-07-11 08:33:43
While I do n't support Mr. Gregg 's sentiments and can see that State Farm does n't appreciate being linked to his political opinions , I am just as appalled and insulted by the comments made on here generalizing about the population of people in what is called the Northshore which includes Covington / Mandeville .
I would be interested to know if you have ever visited the area and , if you have , wonder exactly what kind of person you are if the individuals you stayed with gave you all of the impressions in prior posts .
Say what you want about the Mayor of Mandeville ( most of us are as disgusted as you are ) or voice your opinion about Mr. Gregg 's political view points , but do n't make us all out to be green - toothed , Nigras labeling , ignorant KKK members .
I am sure your town has a few skeletons , too .

Gregg gets to express his point of view you commie bastard .
What a cheap shot to report him to State Farm .
Thank goodness State Farm shut your effort down .
Grow up you POS !
Read the signs .........
Posted by soprano1 on 2008-07 - 12 16:34:53
While most of you have managed to talk about anything other than what the signs stated ..... read them !
That quote is accurate from Obama .
And if you have n't been following the politics , or have only been listening to archaic dinosaur times t.v. news , then you are way out of tune with his true intentions for this country .
He DOES mean to tax YOU more .
That 's his official answer for dealing with the deficit .
And , mind you , there has historically always been a deficit whenever there is war .
He DOESN'T intend to drill here , which leaves you with turning to smaller cars , less driving , and even higher gas prices .
He plans to take all your tax breaks away .
He wants national medical care , which will leave you waiting in line for mediocre care for weeks before getting seen by a doctor .
I 've been there .
All of Europe is that way !
And why do you think Canadians cross over to the U.S. to seek medical care ?
Think !
Do n't be mesmerized by his words , but actually do your research before you make a decision .
( Hitler gave great , uplifting speeches , too , and was voted in by the German people ) .
I am from Germany , a naturalized citizen , who came here legally and had to earn my status as a U.S. Citizen .
I am against letting every John , Dick , and Harry into our country illegally and then giving them benefits that WE ALL have to pay for from our taxes .
Have you ever seen the immigration laws of Mexico ?
Try getting in there illegally and see what happens to you .
They have NO problem kicking you out .
And pulling out of the war in Iraq would be crazy at this point .
We are winning that war ... but , if you are only listening to traditional , liberal oriented t.v. news , then you are out of touch and have n't heard this .
Branch out to get information .
It 's your responsibility in this day and age .
Our country is at risk of becoming a socialist government .... and yes , I have been there , too .
It is non-opportunistic , depressing , and economically deadening .
What does Germany pay for gasoline ?
Close to $ 8 a gallon !
Jobs are temporary and hard to find .
The people of the U.S. know NOT how lucky they are to live in a capitalist world .
You have opportunities here for freedom of speech and building businesses like no other country !
Count your blessings .
As for State Farm ..... I agree ... I dislike the company and have had bad experiences with them .
This is not about Louisiana , it 's just the way State Farm operates as a whole , and has since it 's existance .
Yet , in my dealings with their representatives , there are some caring agents .
Why they are willing to work for State Farm is beyond me .
Gregg should n't be advertising on his State Farm ad , however , it IS humorous , and this IS a free country ..... at least , for now .
Posted by California Girl on 2008-07-12 19:52:59 Hooray for Bud Gregg , this man has principle and is not a sellout for money .
Posted by Pile on 2008-07-12 23:20:23 Obviously State Farm has their spin on the issue .
I 'm just curious if they 're going to tell Mr. Gregg to remove the sign or not ?
It makes no difference to me .
If he wants to advertise that he 's a right wing nutjob who thinks somehow that Obama is going to destroy America , that 's his prerogative , and it's my prerogative to call attention to it .
Although I cannot imagine how anyone could screw up the economy and everything in between worst than Bush has .
He might not have raised taxes , but taxes will have to be raised to pay for his deficit - spending .
It 's unfortunate his conservative idiot followers do n't seem to have a simple grasp of basic economics -- just because a republican does n't pay his bills does n't mean they do n't have to be paid at some point .
Long after Bush is gone , someone has to pay for his irresponsibility .
If McCain does n't have the balls to raise taxes , then he 'll just make things worse until another leader steps up and starts to act fiscally responsible .
I think it 's in bad taste for a businessman to use his affiliation with a national corporation to promote his personal political agenda .
I am not saying he should n't be able to .
I just think it 's stupid .
Obviously , if you support him and his point of view you 'll like it , but I think there 's a minority of people who feel the way he does - though I do admit , David Duke did very well in the governor 's race in that area , so his clients probably are n't that offended .
By the way , I am very amused that the Vice President of a huge corporation came up with such a clever pun of my name , " Pile on " - presumably I guess to characterize my dinky little story as some kind of horrid attack against your puny little company .
Oh how unfair ... some guy is " piling on " poor 'ol State Farm .
Yea , you guys are going to get a ton of sympathy from these parts .
We know what you did .
Hey Mr. Fernandez .... why do n't you tell the truth about how much State Farm is covering people in the area ?
You all have avoided writing new policies for years .
You pulled out of Mississippi after you got sued .
I have been a State Farm customer for more than 25 years and I still could n't get homeowners from you all .
And I 'm not even in a flood zone .
Your company does the absolute minimum down here when it comes to homeowners ' coverage .
Snopes disagrees with what is posted on the sign .
Posted by Katrina Surviver on 2008-07-13 01:13:04
I would suggest that people take a careful look at the sign and then check out this SNOPES posting .
http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/change.asp
I am so sick of seeing these distortions of the truth and the outright lies that continue to circulate ad infinitum .
Funny how there are SO MANY rumors , lies , etc being spread about Obama and how so few are circulated by McCain followers .
The sign is in error
Posted by Pile on 2008-07-13 01:15:27
That 's very interesting , but not surprising that this State Farm agent actually has a totally erroneous quote from Barak Obama on his sign .
Obama never said what he claims .
But that makes sense considering the obvious intelligence of someone stupid enough to post such partisan political trash on his business signage in the first place .
Katrina ?
Posted by Working Class Dog on 2008-07-15 14:34:26
What does this have to do with Katrina .
He is simply trying to remove the blinders from your eyes .
It 's his opinion , so why are you bringing up Katrina ?
Focus on the issues .
By the way , how has the fact that most people in New Orleans vote for the Democrat party worked anyway .
Lets see .
Leaders , per capita , in crime , poverty and illiteracy .
What a great pary to belong to .
Go ahead , keep throwing away your freedoms with the party that should be called the communist party of control .
Slip-ups ?

Per the snopes link , Obama " slipped up " with that quote .
Obama is a great speaker .
I doubt he would " slip up " enough to make it sound like something completely different from what he meant .
Sorry , but I wo n't vote for somebody with socialist views .
Social healthcare does n't really work .
Social Security is failing , so why would this work ?
You people think Bush has caused all of our deficit ?
I pity you .
No , I 'm not a hillbilly deluxe white boy with three teeth .
I just happen to care about the future of this great country .
I believe that the gentleman from Germany could n't have said it any better .

Mike ,
We met in NYC for the CEO Roundtable .
I was the photog .
I was checking out these pictures they 've posted and tried saving them down to my home PC .
They have a very unusual extension , not the typical jpeg extension one would use to save and post photos .
It 's the kind of extension you would use after manipulating photos .
I do n't know whether all this is on the level or not , but it 's something to consider .

As an ex Mandeville resident and former Bud Gregg client ( I moved form the area after Katrina ) I can tell you that Mr Gregg holds strong convictions unlike the target of his sign .
It is interestiing that all the leftie civil libertarians forget about freedom of speeh when the speech does n't line up with their marketing plan of Mr. Obama / Sotero .
If State Farm were half the people of their word that Mr. Gregg is , they would not have the image problem they have now .
As for dissing Mandeville ..
Check your facts .
They area is one of the fastest growing and has one of the highest household incomes in the Louisiana area .
Additionally they have good schools and low crime , which is why most of the larger New Orleans comapnies are moving their operations to the Northshore post Katrina .
Obama is a chameleon : he is whatever the current audience wants him to be .
If he went to the Republican convention , he would extol the virtues of the elepahnt just to suck up !

Bud ,
I think you should post these on you car in they wo n't let you post them on the sign --- or better yet , buy some ad time on the blinking Causeway signs .
Keep on , brother !
Posted by MIKE on 2008-07-15 21:39:03 STATE FARM SHOULD BE KISSING GREGG AND COLONEL SANDERS FOR ALL THE FREE PUBLICITY THEY'RE GETTING .
REMEMBER THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BAD PUBLICITY
What a waste of 8 years ................
Posted by Tomcat on 2008-07- 16 08:30:32 Soprano1 , oh please - enough with your political spin .
Alleging a quote from Obama that he " will raise taxes " and to accuse those that do n't know that fact as " Archaic dinosaur t.v. news viewers " suggest that YOU are mentally held hostage of the FOX news spin-cycle .
Agreed , FOX is great entertainment but , so are the tabloid headlines at the supermarket checkout .
With Obamas ' stated plan , anyone making under $ 200 K annually will see a modest tax credit .
I guess YOU are fortunate enough to fall in the $ 200 K and Above tax - bracket and have a gripe about a tax repeal .
NOT an increase , a REPEAL so that our federal and state goverment can once again pay the bills and provide basic service to the taxpayer .
Thanks to George W. and Dick , ( and what McCain wants to continue ) the oil companies excutives have received BILLIONS of dollars in tax credits while gas prices increased 300 % to the working consumer .
Thats right , the oil companies got everything they asked for with record profits , big bonuses and sticking - it to the consumer - thanks George !
Thats the kind of kick - backs and ABUSE that Obama will repeal .
YOU speak of national medical care , illegal immigration and the Iraq debacle as if Bush / McCain have a strong - hold on the issues and that Obama is clueless .
Question - besides being mesmerized by FOX ( faux new ) where have you been the last seven years ??
Education , Medical , Immigration , National security , the constitution and the national debt have taken a back - seat to this President ( and McCain ) while the invasion / occupaton of Iraq has become a distraction and the REAL war on terror continues to threaten our national security unabated .
McCain / Bush " stay the course " mentality does n't cut it .
I want to know my President at the very least knows the difference between sunni and shitte BEFORE he invades a country that is NOT an immenient threat to our security .
We need REAL leadership , someone who can " think , walk and chew gum at the same time " .
Even for this REPUBLICAN , Obama offers that change .
As far as the sign , I find it humorous and can only hope the sign - owner can educate himself on fact rather than hype .
Same goes for poster , soprano1 .
State Farm
Posted by Big Picture on 2008-07- 16 11:33:42 State Farm did n't get a chance to screw me .
They dragged a friend of mine through the mud in her claim when she had an accident in her car .
That 's when I dropped them and went with USAA .
Hey , but the guy is right about Obama .
He sucks and will fleece the tax payer and punish small businessmen for being successful .
They will stop hiring and lay off their employees and this country will go down the toilet .
Go ahead Tomcat

Posted by Tomcat on 2008-07- 16 12:14:18 Sorry Big Picture ... but , I 've gotta ask the same question " where have you been the last seven years " ?
You are worried about the country going down the toilet - granted , under Bush / McCain we are just one flush away .
Under George W. Bush ( rubber - stamped by McCain ) - the Dow has tanked , the dollar is worthless against the euro , jobs sent overseas , and the highest national debt in history has us just steps from becoming a third - world country and John McCains wants more of the same .
Honestly , I admire McCains military record and service to our country however , like George W. Bush that does n't mean he should be anointed President .
Hopefully our country does n't elect the next president based on fear or ignorance .
Posted by Fair Taxer on 2008-07- 16 16:14:17
I have no clue if Bud Gregg is a racist or not , but he is right about Obama raising taxes .
Repealing the Bush tax cuts will raise ALL of our taxes .

Posted by SC Flip Flop on 2008-07-16 21:07:03 State Farm Agents are independent contractors .
State Farm will not make Mr. Gregg remove his sign .
It 's his office , his sign , his land , and his freedom of speech .
I have been a State Farm customer for 18 years and will never change .
I have seen first hand what an awesome company it is .
I just hope that this is Bud Gregg 's sign and not someone who has altered this photo and made his life a living HE *#!!
Good luck Bud !!

Posted by mn2long on 2008-07-16 22:22:31 SC
Flip Flop is wrong .
I work for State Farm and took it upon myself to report this to MR Gregg 's superiors .
While he is an independent contractor , State Farm owns the rights to the name and he is forbidden to attach anything he wants to it .
I was notified that as of July 3rd the sign was taken down .
I myself would like to see him let go .
Being a State Farm agent is a privilege , not a right , and this idiot needs to go to his clan meetings on his own time .
I would personally like to let Mr Gregg know how embarassing it is to be associated with him and his idiotic politics .
As for all of you defending him and cutting down Obama .
How do you propose we fix the economy that Bush and his cronies have ruined ?
You spend money , you pay it back .
Hopefully you have the money BEFORE you spend it .
No taxes equal a larger deficit .
Any of you who dont get that , dont deservce the right to vote .

Good grief , Yank in TX , learn to read !
The Snopes article says that while it sounds like the sort of slip - up a politician might make , Obama did NOT say it .
Snopes furthermore goes on to explain the genesis of it , which was a foreign e-mail sent to a blog writer , and it was actually about McCain !
The link is here : http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/change.asp.

You haters are all idiots .
Just because you like Obama does n't mean everyone else has to .
Just for the record I am for Obama .
If this is they way this guy feels then he is entitled to his opinion .
Also just because Obama is black does n't mean he will have a black uprising in the White House like some of you racist think .
Heck even Jesse Jackson does n't like him and everyone knows Jesse is always up for ANY black cause be it right or wrong .
The only reason Jesse is backing him is because he is black .
Jesse said Obama is talking down to black people and I think quite a few black folks feel the same way so I do n't believe he will get as many black votes .
Anyway what I am trying to say is everyone is entitled to their own opinion and if you do n't believe that then go to some communist country where they tell you what to think .

Posted by guyfroml on 2008-07-19 02:59:51
Please , do n't hold , back tell us how much you REALLY HATE WHITE PEOPLE !
I 'm about to drop a bomb on you ... I'm the guy who took the first picture of Bud Gregg 's sign and posted it all over the internet .
It was an interesting experiment because I sent it to only two people , neither of which are in my regular email group .
I wanted to see how long it would take to make its way back to me .
I did this without Bud 's knowing - not that he would have had a problem with it - and the results of my little experiment have been fascinating .
Yes , the sign did come down - but NOT because of State Farm .
Bud NEVER received any specific request from Illinois to take the sign down .
It was only after receiving threats from " kooks " - possibly you - did the sign have to come down since two ladies often work in the office with Bud out on business .
How do I know all this ... like I said , I started all this , I am a client of Bud , and Bud , his wife , myself and my wife are all close friends .
I 'm proud to be his friend and be a part of all this .
The one thing I 've learned from all this is Chris Rock has it wrong - his famous punch line .." it 's alright if it 's white " is a farce .
This entire experiment has proven only liberals , blacks , gays and the like appear to have a 1st Amendment Constitution right , but whites and conservates - we 're supposed to keep our mouths shut !
Talk about your " two - faced " idiotic notions .
Can you or anyone else tell me exactly when was it that God came down from the heavens and made you kooks of minority opinion the judge and jury over the moral majority ?

To the guy who claims he started it all , your facts are incorrect .
That sign did come down and he was told to have it down by 5 pm July 3rd .
In the contract he signed , it says anything detrimental to State Farm could be considered a breech of contract .
Sound like a breech to me !
He is intitled to his opinion and the first amendment , but to attach that garbage to the State Farm sign is cleary not intelligent .
Fact , that sign belongs to him , but the words State Farm Insurance written in big red letters belong to State Farm .
So in essence , he does not have an opinion or first amendment rights when using someone else 's registered trademark .
Hopefully , you understand that .
If he were smarter , he would have put that shit in his own yard ....
By the way , Barack has more education that you and Bud Gregg put together ...... Face it , he will be your president .
And you will like it .

Former La Resident
Posted by John M on 2008-07-21 20:11:45
What ever happened to the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America .
If he believes , as I do , that Barack Obama is an idiot and dangerous to the future of our country , let him say it or post it .
What happens to his business is ... well ... his business .
I appreciate the poster near the top of the page who said he was in New Orleans during Katrina .
That should say it all ... why in the world would you be in a bowl during a hurricane ?
Why risk it ... but that is his business also , as is the right to complain about help not coming soon enough ... wait it did come , but they were shot at by the residents who stayed .
Oops .
I have used State Farm my entire adult life and have been treated fairly by them .
I only recently moved from La for a business oppty , after spending my entire life there .
And imagine that , New Orleans voting Democrat .
Let 's all pause for a moment and let the shock of that one sink in .
High crime rates , corrupt government and police , gay pride parades rivaling San Francisco ... I could go on and on ... a perfect example of the values that this country was founded on .
ha.
LONG LIVE FREE SPEECH , and all the freedoms that Obama wants to take away .
Racist Fools
Posted by Le Bron Jackson on 2008-07-22 13:47:07
Wow I never thought that the so very open - minded democrat population would be so prejudice in their statements about southern whites , State Farm , Louisiana and Republicans .
But I guess I should not be surprised because democrats are the real racists and ignorant fools in the country .
Your ignorant and prejudice statements have all distracted from the issue at hand .
The fact is that Obama did say what the sign states .
But somehow this all became about Katrina .
It ’s like this huge trump card that people think they can play .
It ’s not .
People who bring up Katrina as some means in which to play the victim are fools .
The fact is that anyone in New Orleans KNEW that they were living in hurricane alley .
They KNEW that they lived in an area that was BELOW sea level .
They KNEW a gigantic hurricane was coming toward them and yet .
So many people stood there and did nothing .
The Democratic mayor of New Orleans did nothing .
In fact he told people who were evacuating to turn around and go home .
The Democratic government of New Orleans had no plan for this kind of thing .
And all the money that was supposed to be used to fix the levies went to corrupt pet projects of the mayor and other politicians .
The police force quit and ran away .
The citizens were looting and pillaging instead of helping each other out .
If this is was Democrats do , then I can’t wait to see what a Democrat Congress and Obama try to do in the next two years .
I would not be proud of anything that happened during Katrina except for one thing .
I was there in the US Navy bringing supplies and helping rescue people during those times and so were a few others in the Coast Guard and FEMA .
You can say that FEMA was a failure but in reality if New Orleans and Louisiana ’s governments had done their job correctly it would never have been the disaster it was .
So you can be proud and vote Democrat all you want but apparently the only thing that the heavily democrat population of New Orleans was able to accomplish was to create a society of victims who were unable to think or act for themselves .
All they did was stand on top of their houses and cry that the Federal Government was n’t coming fast enough to rescue them .
Some people truly needed help and for those I felt badly but then again the Democrats that the New Orleans people put into office were unwilling or unable to do anything for them .
For the rest of the able - bodied that were in New Orleans in those days I ca n’t say I felt all that bad for them .
What were they thinking ?
I was born and raised in Florida and I know that when a hurricane is coming , you need to get the h*ll out of there .
This is the kind of society that Obama and his Democrats want to create everywhere .
A place where we are all victims and incapable of defending or taking care of ourselves .
No thank you .
I ’ll take the old white guy and the Republicans .
I grew up in poverty and I know what Democrats “ do for us . ”
They do n’t do anything but hand out scraps and make us vote for them again and again because they “ care about us . ”
It is BS .
Democrats are the most racists SOB ’s in the country and are always first to point out a man ’s race , color , religion etc …
My republican ( white ) friends never treated me different because I was black .
I felt like they liked me for who I was and not for what I was .
Some of you fools will never get it though …

US Navy Veteran Response to " WOW "
Posted by guyfroml on 2008-07-23 19:29:30
Wow , I stand affirmed and correct in what I initially posted in regards to the story of how the sign came down .
Bud Gregg told me he was contacted on the morning of July 3rd by a State Farm executive in Illinois .
According to Bud , the nature of the conversation went like this - the executive asked him about the sign .
Bud immediately replied the sign had already been taken down .
Bud said the executive 's immediate response was " Thank you , Bud " and hung up .
Bud says the telephone conversation barely lasted 30 seconds .
Now , I do not know " if " State Farm was going to ask him , but for the record NO ONE ASKED HIM to take it down - or got the chance to .
Bud said there was no discussion about so called " contractual agreements " or the like between himself and the executive that called ... nothing else was discussed .
After the threat , the sign came down on July 2nd - or it might have been July 1st .
Also , as a point of trivial interest , and to give credibility to my account of events - that white Toyota 4 - Runner you see in the background behind the famous sign - that 's my car .
The photo you 're looking at - I took .
As I said , I was there in the middle of this thing from the beginning .

Reading through the opinions expressed here about Bud Gregg´s expressed opinions there -- we can all agree on that , right ? -- has certainly made me think a little .
Consider that beginning with Mr. Gregg and continuing on down to whomever this issue touches , each of us as people of a country as free as ours are guaranteed the right to offer an opinion of our own .
It ´s a good reminder to me of one of the reasons I ´m pround to be an American .
Ironically , some of the actual views shared here are an equally good reminder of how embarassing it can be to call myself American .
Maybe
I´m just unable to distinguish sarcasm from true anguish any more but I sure hope there´s a middle ground out there opinion - wise , and that they have wisely refrained from offering it here .

Reading the blogs on this site makes me proud to be an American , A State Farm policyholder , and a policyholder of Bud Gregg .
Hope it does not offend you to know that I will stick with State Farm and my agent Bud Gregg .
Is n't it great to enjoy our Freedom to express our thoughts and feelings .
We all have important things to say .
Thank you America , Thank you State Farm & Thank You Bud Gregg .
I am not green - toothed , nor have I never been affiliated with the KKK , nor would I want to be .
My family , my friends , my business associates who all reside in Mandeville all have full sets of Pearly Whites , we are well - educated and hold good - paying jobs that support our great tax base for which we are proud .
We are every day Americans that make Mandeville , LA one of the fastest growing commmunities in St Tammnay Parish and our Great State of LA .
Our schools are blue - ribbon public schools and we enjoy some of the best crime stats in the entire GNO area .
I am a Proud resident of Mandeville , LA .
My early childhood was spent in New Orleans , I attended and graduated from high school and college in New Orleans .
Myself as many fled to the North Shore of New Orleans for numerous reasons : CRIME , SCHOOLS , FLOODING , FEAR , LOCAL GOV'T , in general a better way of life to raise our children and grandchildren .
The hateful postings on this site are not surprising but extremely hurtful .
It is truly scandalous .
Being a 54 year old female who raised a 28 year old daughter on her own without gov't socialistic support I am once again reminded of how truly hateful our liberal friends ???? can be .
What a sorrowful time we live in when one can't express their feelings though they may not be in agreement with yours .
I have read the sign over and over again and can't seem to find the racism in the statements made .
I pay more than my fair share in taxes and understand the relation to the chicken voting for Colonel Sanders .
It is realistic to say that some of us get weary of supporting gov't programs that are so infested with fraud .
Does it surprise you to know that our Medicare / Medicaid program is estimated to have over 32 % fraud ?
What about social security ?
Does the word FEMA strike a chord with anyone ?
What about our public school system ?
What gov't agency has proven to be proficient in anything that they run ???
Can anyone give me a logical answer to that one ??????
Do you have difficulty answering this question ?
Choose your Gov't agency Du Jour and support your GREAT SOCIAL CHANGE to this green - toothed , KKK loving ( according to you ) , goober in Mandeville .
For those of you who may not know we have one of the highest per-capita incomes in the State of La .
This does not happen by a stroke of good - luck but by Hard - Work .
Something some of you may not understand or be aware of .
What about all of this poppycock of our liberal friends being so kind - hearted with offers of GREAT CHANGE to reach across party - lines and hold so called LOVE - INS .
With all due respect I do n't see it , hear it nor see it .
You prove yourselves over and over again with your hateful words , your slander , your spin , your racism , your narrow - minded verbage , your over reaction , your language skills , is it really necessary to call people a---s , d-------s , or drop the F - Bomb to get a point across because we do n't agree with you ?
Since when has it been offensive to be a Proud - White American ?
It 's time to get it right - it is okay to be white .
For that matter it is okay to be who and what you are .
Vote and speak which way you wish , but keep in mind that your hateful spew on a community of WHITE FOLK as you so blatantly refer to will rise to the occassion in November .
We have no need for your psycho - babble nor will we stand on the side - lines .
We will stand our ground with great INTENSITY .
Your candidate is at best a PRETENDER , a great speaker with NO BEEF and No Pork as they say to back up all of his rhetoric .
By the way I am a female that went from being a homeless mother to one that adds and contributes to society .
Anyone can make their way in life if they so choose - in life it is all about choice - not circumstances .
We all have equal opportunity to acquire a public education and to apply ourselves to make a better way in life .
It does require an effort and some personal accountability along with Perserverance .
Now since we always have to bring Katrina into the fold let 's talk about some of the wonderful things that State Farm did for their Policyholders .
State Farm issued upfront checks to their policyholders for $ 2500 no questions asked within a short time frame .
This was in order to help support anyone who had been displaced due to the storm .
The checks were made available immediately .
If you had the proper amount of coverage you were reimbursed for any expenses incurred for repair and replacement .
My husband & I were treated extremely fair with our damages from Katrina .
And yes we did have significant damage .
Three trees in our home and a 35 ft. hole in one area of our roof line .
You did have to prove & support doucmentation that the repair work was indeed completed .
We recieved our money and numerous supplements during our claim process .
Hurricane Katrina was not our first experience with proper Claims handling by State Farm Insurance .
We are living proof of being treated fairly / promptly by State Farm & Bud Gregg .
In 1995 we resided in Metairie another suburb of New Orleans , we had 3 feet of water in our home due to the flood in May .
Again , State Farm repaired our home to the standards that our policy paid for .
We were the first on our block to receive money necessary to get work done on our home .
My vehicle also sat in 6 feet of water , a check was cut within two weeks of the flood for the value of the car no more , no less .
Having an insurance policy does not give us Carte Blanche to make it a Money Making Policy .
Unfortunately many people view their Ins. policy as a way to make money and to come out ahead .
Your Ins policy is there to offer you Peace of Mind and to restore you to the terms of your policy .
And no I do not , nor have I ever worked for State Farm or any Insurance company for that matter .
While we are bringing up Katrina let 's do talk about all the things that went right with Gustav -
Can I hear a Ta - Da for our Governor Bobby Jindal ?
Anyone remember how our local gov't let down an entire State & GNO ?
What a difference a Governor can make .
No second - coming of Katrina - the assesment is encouraging .
Intense planning and people heeding instruction to evacuate .
The relief efforts were great planning between gov't offices - coordination & communication between mayor 's & governor 's make all of the difference .
It makes more sense to cross lines and communicate to ensure the well being of the people - the ones who elect those to public office to serve the people .
Do you recall all of the blame being passed around during Katrina - more focus on Blame instead of Action ?
I for one will take action any day .
I know I am not alone in being grateful to be an American - Why do n't we spend more time on things that make us more intelligent and positive forces in life .
Hopefully , some of you have a heart and quit spewing your hatred , some of us are growing quite tired of your EVIL WAYS .
Why not express yourself and start loving this great country we live in .
Enjoy your freedom of Speech and maybe focus on the things that do go Right In Life .
It can't all be that bad .

In response to ... Setting the Record Straight
Posted by Mike Fernandez - VP , Public Affairs , State Farm on 2008-07-09 17:53:34 .
Mr. Fernandez 's response is a Public Affairs response and not even close to the truth .
Having worked for State Farm for over 20 years until their Enron - like reorganization pre-Katrina I know for a fact they were and probably still are very politically active and opinionated .
State Farm DID have a political action committee but I believe it was under the title of Urban Market Affairs .
State Farm is notorious for protecting their own especially if they are related to Congressman William Jefferson .
Do n't kid yourself .
It is pretty scary !
The company is owned by its policyholders so there is little if any accountability and a grossly misuse of policyholder funds .
At one time the Public Affairs Dept. acted as a liaison to lobby for State Farm in Louisiana ( I suspect the same happened in other states ) and later they hired a local big named politician lobbyist to lobby for their special interests .
He may actually still be on the payroll .
He worked for State Farm only so he was paid handsomely .
Please , Mr. Fernandez , the public is not stupid !

Free Speech
Posted by InNC on 2008-10-05 21:51:30
For those going on and on about free speech , for once in your life , read ..
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .
Does people giving their opinion on this issue constitute Congress making a law abridging freedom of speech ?
No .
As a citizen , you are free to say what you want , and also just as free to get called out over it and have the public hold you up for derision , point out your lies , stupidity , or intolerance .
There is no inherent right not to have the public point at you and shout you down .
There is also no inherent right from having your employer telling you to remove something that appears to suggest they sponsor an idea or opinion that could hurt their business .
You are free to say what you want , but part of that freedom is also taking personal responsibility for your speech .
If some idiots actually threatened harm over this , they need to go to jail .
But those people informing Bud of their opinion of him or others like him , or making their displeasure known through their wallets .
Well , that 's all part of the freedom of this country and my best advice is for him and his peers is to stop whining and going on about how " my rights are being taken away " .
I 'm looking at you guyfroml , ( oh , the backs and gays are out to get me ) having the general public telling you that you are an idiot and frankly should shut up is part of the responsibility you bear for free speech .
If Congress starts passing laws to shut you up by force of law , I 'll be right their fighting for you , until then I 'll tell you that your bigoted idiocy simply reaffirms the stereotypes that you complain about .
So stop whining and blaming the blacks ( gays , liberals , or anyone who is different than you ) for " keeping you down " .

No , InNC , you 're not looking at me .
Clearly you did n't read correctly what I wrote .
My comments point out , and accurately I might add , the hypocrisies of the liberal movement and anyone else who claims to be the oppressed .
They were simple obersavations .
I see no one out go get me , except perhaps Obama with higher taxes .
I 'm a true conservative .
That means I take responsibility for my own life and for my own failures - though I am very successful at what I do for a living .
I am equally content with myself , unlike liberals who vividly , even violently , express such anger at everyone else in the world to does n't totally accept them for who and what they are .
Ever notice liberals ALWAYS point the finger of blame ( for their own failures in life ) at everyone else ?
What liberals fail to understand is all we conservatives want is to really to be left alone .
Live how you want to live , but do n't come to my front door trying to jam your ways and beliefs down my throat .
Your pointing me out in your comments is not only inaccurate but grossly unfair due to its misjudgement .
Your comment implies my being a bigot or even a racist .
Not only is that an insult , but it shows ignorance on your part for not seeing all I 've ever posted is my honest observations - but , to a liberal that would be perceived as an insult or even an attack ... typical .
And it does n't bother me in the least if someone wants to tell me to shut up .
You 're right , it also is their constitutional right if they want to tell me to shut up , but it 's also my right to ignore them - and I do - all the while doing it with a smile on my face .
Because unlike liberals , I 'm not miserable and angry at the world .
And should I ever get angry , it will be directed at myself - I wo n't blame anyone else for my mistake .
Still , I could n't help notice in all your elegent wording I did not see where you actually mention that I was incorrect in anything I said .
Oh , sure you might have accused me of whining , but you still did n't say I was wrong .
Well , I was n't whining and I surely was n't wrong .
But , I 'm sure you will now .

State Farm Agent Bud Gregg

I would assume that Bud Gregg is a Republican from looking at his sign , he must of voted for that stupid George Bush , Dick Channey , & staff that put us in this mess , it will take longer to get us out of this than it did to put us in it .
Their are so many racis in this country still , they want President O'bama to fail , am 71 yrs .
old female white , i voted for O'bama and will do it again if he run 's for office .
He is trying very hard to do what is right for the American People , you should be writing letter 's to Congress & your Legslator 's to help him turn this Country around , to bring our job 's back into the United States , and to get strictor Law 's against Child Melastion , & Crimanals , our prisons are running over , they need to make these people work in prison to support themself's .
The people in USA should never sell a piece of land to foran countries , this is American Soil and it need 's to be sold to American People .
I have had State Farm Insurance since 1967 , if my agent did this i would leave State Farm , and i think Bud Gregg should have his licens taken away , i bet Bud has never served in the Military .
If people does not wise up , and turn back to more moral values , and care more for his neighbor , and country , .. it will not be long until China comes into the United States and takes it over , the Bible is being more full filled everyday .
My state is being destroyed by The Coal Industry , destroying our beautiful Mountains and making a TOXIC Dump out of it , all for the love of MONEY & GREED .
I came back out of retirement to try and save our mountains here , out of love , i do volanteer work to try and stop destruction .
Our Country need 's healing , have a blessed day , and fight for American rights .

Thanks to State Farm , especially Bud Gregg for stating the obvious !!
Thank you so much for having the GUTS to say what most American Citizens are thinking and feeling about Obama and his people who are taking us down in the worst economy in the US History !!
Wake up American !
Stop complaining about the TRUTH !
Thanks so much for us sane American Citizens who see the truth , not the idiots that have their head buried in the sand ..
Looks like Bud and I were right !

It 's been almost two years , so I thought I 'd revisit this site to see what people have since posted .
Boy , did time prove me and Bud to be correct .
Just look at how Obama and the Dempukes Party are INTENTIONALLY trying to destroy our beloved country .
Yes , I say " intentional " because you do n't need a PhD in political science to understand that the only way a socialist - communist can possibly succeed is by first destroying the democratic - capitalistic system presently in place .
Everything everyone warned about Obama has now come to pass .
Dump this idiot on election day .
Get out and vote this November 2010 .
Stop this communist NOW !

I think anyone who blames Bush for our problems now is just plain ignorant .
And , ANYONE who wants another 4 years of Obama socialism ideas just does n't get it .
And , it has nothing to do with race so do n't play that racism card with me like you ALWAYS do .
It 's so easy , is n't it .
A Bud Gregg sequel is coming ?

A little birdie told me everyone should be on the look out this year for a " sequel sign " on or near Bud Gregg 's office .
I can't wait to see it !
Look who 's stupid now !

Thanks to the different materials of which sextoys are made , the manufacturers can obtain textures , constitutions or very varied colors .
But faced with the sometimes obscure names of these subjects , it is difficult to know what they are really made of .
When choosing a sextoy , pay attention to the appearance and sensations they provide .
But it is also important to take a closer look at what they are doing .
First because their material defines their texture and therefore the sensations they bring but also for health reasons .
For example , there is a lot of talk about the health risks of phthalates .
The expert has set standards for all products that can be put in the mouth by children but there is no standard for sex toys .
Yet they are in direct contact with our mucous membranes and one study has shown that this is as dangerous as ingestion .
Manufacturers have become aware of these risks and there are more and more products without or with very little phthalates .
Currently , the main materials found in the composition of sex toys fall into five main categories : elastics , plastics , acrylic , glass , and metal .
But before buying you must have clear idea about what is cyber skin .
Elastics
Elastics are polymers with elastic properties and very resistant to deformation .
They are designated by the manufacturers by the abbreviation TPE or TPR in English : thermoplastic .
In this category , you find mainly rubbers and silicones and a patented material by the manufacturer .
Elastomers , provided they are not mixed with plastic , do not contain phthalates .
The rubbers can be either organic and of natural origin such as latex , or synthetic .
Rubbers are widely used because they are cheap , easy to use for manufacturing and resistant .
However , they are porous and therefore less durable than silicone .
Because of their porosity , it is more difficult to clean and bacteria grow more easily .
So clean them with soap and water or a sextoy cleaner .
You also have to be very careful about the latex that some people are allergic to .
There is synthetic latex that does not cause allergies but the origin of the latex used by manufacturers is only rarely indicated .
It is therefore necessary to remain cautious if one is allergic to this matter .
Silicones are of mineral origin ( silica ) .
It is the most used material for sex toys because it is almost as resistant as rubber , it is flexible and especially its texture is similar to that of the skin .
Not being porous , silicone is very easily cleaned with water ( even boiling ) or with a special cleaner for sextoys .
When choosing a silicone sex toy , care must be taken that it is 100 % silicone or medical grade .
This means that it is hygienic , hypoallergenic , and can be boiled .
Manufacturers who do not specify this quality sometimes use additives whose nature is not always identifiable ( but not necessarily harmful ) .
Cyberskin is a material composed essentially of elastomer gel and some other products that are a priori non -toxic .
Its texture is very similar to that of the skin especially if it is used with " Cyberskin powder " .
It has the same advantages and disadvantages as all the other products mentioned above .
Plastics
Plastics are raw polymers to which fillers , plasticizers and additives are added .
Phthalates ( found only in plastics ) are among the plasticizers .
They allow , among other things , to make plastic more flexible .
In view of their toxicity , we must pay attention to their absence when buying a plastic sextoy .
In the category of plastics used for the manufacture of sextoys , there are in particular PVC and ABS .
ABS is always hard , so it never contains phthalates .
There is a lot of plastic sex toys because it is a cheap and very common material .
In general , plastic products are smooth and easy to clean .
They can be used with any type of lubricant ( water or silicone ) .
In addition , they transmit the vibrations very well .

Acrylic
Acrylic is a crystalline polymer very hard and very resistant .
It is transparent and is therefore often used to imitate glass .
It is non-porous and therefore hygienic and easy to maintain .
Glass
Glass is usually made from silicon oxide ( sand ) .
It is a very suitable material for the manufacture of sex toys : it is non-porous therefore hygienic , hypoallergenic , very smooth and therefore requires little or no lubricant , can be sterilized , does not retain odors and is often very beautiful .
Its maintenance is easy with any type of cleaner .
Metal
Two metals are used in the manufacture of sex toys : steel and aluminum .
While the steel is very strong and heavy aluminum is a little more fragile but it is lighter .
In addition , unlike steel , aluminum does not rust .
In both cases , the metals are easy to maintain with any solvent and allow to make very beautiful sextoys and intimate jewels .
In addition , they can be heated or cooled for different sensations .
There are other materials such as wood or leather to make sex toys but currently their use is still quite limited .
Women are good , but artificial vaginas are sometimes better !
So of course , human relationships are non-existent with a silicone object , but the physical relationships are as good or even sometimes better .
My comparison with a real partner is obviously a little far - fetched , and nothing really replaces the presence of the woman in our lives .
However , as long as you have not found it , then the artificial vaginas are a better solution than the manual handjob .
Here is everything you need to know about inflatable dolls , masturbators or artificial vaginas .
The three main sex toys for men
A few years ago , the most common sextoys were simply dildos , or vibrating eggs .
There were only you ladies !
Now , the sex toy market has exploded and there are thousands of references to indulge with impunity .
The artificial vagina
It is from him that I will speak first , since I have named my site and especially because I love both its use and its practical side .
It is therefore a buttock , or sometimes a bust , usually made of silicone that looks like a real woman .
More than just a masturbator , you can put the artificial vagina on the bed or on a table and have fun giving strokes .
We can also palpate the buttocks or breasts if there is something that makes it easier to activate the imagination .
We always find a vagina and sometimes an anus with which we can obviously have fun too without hearing moaning .
There are also vibrant models that add fun to those who like vibrations .
I must admit that from time to time it is rather nice and pleasant .
When it vibrates it 's a bit of a penis massage that we receive , and the massage is good for the body it seems .
Click here to discover the top 3 best artificial vagina .
Buttocks Silicone vagina and anus Love and Vibes
This small gluteus silicone is simply magic .
His curves are at first quite to my taste .
The texture is really very good quality , and when you close your eyes it really feels like a real little ass very charming .
There is a very deep and comfortable vagina , and a tighter anus but just as nice .
The lips are well done and the realism is quite the rendezvous .
I must admit that I even wanted to kiss and lick this little pussy that presented it to me .
Once inside you feel very good .
Ribs and streaks perfectly reproduce the inside of a female vagina and so we really feel like making love , or kiss ( according to our desires ) really .
In addition to the material is robust , so we can really indulge wildly , it will take round trips before damaging this delicious synthetic kitty .
The masturbator
The masturbator is finally a simple silicone sheath , designed to represent a vagina .
They can be found in different forms : small female body , penis for use as a couple , flashlight for discretion .
The sheath is quite narrow and you can take it with one hand and masturbate with it .
One can also block the masturbator to move the pelvis as with an artificial vagina , but it is a little less convenient .
Anyway , the sensations are much better than with the hand and you get used very quickly to use this type of objects that may seem at first a little weird .
It is a sex toy that is very convenient because it takes up little space , and so it can be easily hidden or carried away on a trip .
BAGHDAD ( AP ) — Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice mocked anti-American cleric Muqtada al - Sadr as a coward yesterday , hours after the radical leader threatened to declare war unless U.S. and Iraqi forces end a military crackdown on his followers .
Miss Rice , in the Iraqi capital to tout security gains and what she calls an emerging political consensus , said Sheik al - Sadr is content to issue threats and edicts from the safety of Iran , where he is studying .
Sheik al - Sadr heads an unruly militia that was the main target of an Iraqi government assault in the oil - rich city of Basra last month , and his future role as a spoiler is an open question .
“ I know he ’s sitting in Iran , ” Miss Rice said dismissively , when asked about Sheik al - Sadr ’s latest threat to lift a self - imposed cease - fire with government and U.S. forces .
“ I guess it ’s all - out war for anybody but him , ” Miss Rice said .
“ I guess that ’s the message ; his followers can go to their deaths and he ’s in Iran . ”
In a statement on his official Web site , Sheik al - Sadr said , “ We denounce the visit of U.S. secretary , asking the government to ban the entrance of the terrorists ’ occupiers to our pure land . ”
The statement asked Iraqis to express their opposition to the visit through peaceful means .
A full - blown uprising by Sheik al - Sadr , who led two rebellions against U.S. - led forces in 2004 , could lead to a dramatic increase in violence in Iraq at a time when the Sunni extremist group al Qaeda in Iraq appears poised for new attacks after suffering severe blows last year .
In a warning posted Saturday on his Web site , Sheik al - Sadr said he tried to defuse tensions by declaring the truce in August , only to see the Shi’ite - led government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki respond by closing his offices and “ resorting to assassinations . ”
He accused the government of selling out to the Americans and branding his followers as criminals .
“ So I am giving my final warning … to the Iraqi government … to take the path of peace and abandon violence against its people , ” Sheik al - Sadr said .
“ If the government does not refrain … we will declare an open war until liberation . ”
Miss Rice praised Mr. al - Maliki for confronting Sheik al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army , which had a choke hold on Basra , Iraq ’s second - largest city .
The assault was Mr. al - Maliki ’s most - decisive act by far against Sheik al - Sadr , a fellow Shi’ite and once a political patron .
Kurdish and Sunni politicians , including a chief rival , have since rallied to Mr. al - Maliki , and the Bush administration argues he could emerge stronger from what had appeared to be a military blunder .
During five days of heavy fighting last month , Iraqi troops struggled against militiamen , particularly the Mahdi Army .
The ill - prepared Iraqi military was plagued by desertions and poor organization and U.S. troops had to take over in some instances .
The offensive was inconclusive , with Iran helping mediate a truce .

TARRYTOWN , N.Y .
COOKING , like farming , for all its down - home community spirit , is essentially a solitary craft .
But lately it ’s feeling more like a lonely burden .
Finding guilt - free food for our menus  food that ’s clean , green and humane  is about as easy as securing a housing loan .
And we ’re suddenly paying more  75 percent more in the last six years  to stock our pantries .
Around the world , from Cairo to Port - au - Prince , increases in food prices have governments facing riots born of shortages and hunger .
It ’s enough to make you want to toss in the toque .
But here ’s the good news : if you ’re a chef , or an eater who cares about where your food comes from ( and there are a lot of you out there ) , we can have a hand in making food for the future downright delicious .
Farming has the potential to go through the greatest upheaval since the Green Revolution , bringing harvests that are more healthful , sustainable and , yes , even more flavorful .
The change is being pushed along by market forces that influence how our farmers farm .
Until now , food production has been controlled by Big Agriculture , with its macho fixation on “ average tonnage ” and “ record harvests . ”
But there ’s a cost to its breadbasket - to - the - world bragging rights .
Like those big Industrial
Age factories that once billowed black smoke , American agriculture is mired in a mind - set that relies on capital , chemistry and machines .
Food production is dependent on oil , in the form of fertilizers and pesticides , in the distances produce travels from farm to plate and in the energy it takes to process it .

Last week AT&T exec Jim Cicconi did his part to spread FUD by claiming that the Internet will reach the limits of its capacity by 2010 , bolstering this doomsday notion with absurd claims that three households could conceivably consume as much bandwidth as the entire existing Internet , or that the entirety of existing networks built today came from private - sector innovation , a claim I ’m sure everyone from Vint Cerf to Al Gore can dispute . 😉
Why would Cicconi make such claims ?
As Ars Technica astutely notes , AT&T has every interest to push bandwith - throttling tactics like those used by Comcast in its blocking of BitTorrent , because like Comcast , AT&T ’s supposed high - speed Internet offering relies upon existing network connections , rather than building true fiber - optic cable to the home as Verizon is doing with FiOS–and is prey to the same bandwith restrictions and infrastructure problems as a result , when it ’s not literally blowing up in people ’s faces .
What Verizon gets–and what AT&T , Comcast , and much of the cable / telecom duopolies fail to understand–is that only with heavy infrastructure investment and network buildouts will we be able to bring real high - speed broadband to the country .
Companies that place short - term profits over long - term gains are constantly looking to squeeze every last customer dollar out of existing networks that they can before putting up the money to build out new connections .
As a result , “ network management ” – what you and I call throttling or cutting customers off–is becoming more and more commonplace .
P2P service Vuze has taken the debate a step further , by developing a user plugin that enables them to measure traffic - shaping efforts and analyze the data .
Vuze recently published their first report detailing their initial findings , and the conclusions are interesting indeed–Vuze claims that Comcast ’s traffic - shaping efforts are widespread , and that they ’re hardly the sole offenders .
Of course , it ’s important to take Vuze ’s findings with a few shakerfuls of salt–they are a P2P service , after all , so it ’s in their interests to counteract any network - controlling techniques that would hinder their business .
And who ’s to say whether or not the app is designed to give back exactly the kind of data they want to publicize ?
Still , even with the necessary skepticism attached , the central question remains –what if they ’re right ?
And it ’s not just happening to Internet traffic as well .
Today a report came out detailing how Comcast , apparently unsatisfied with their reputation as the boogiemen of net neutrality , are compressing high - definition television signals into the bandwith of analog signals , rather than investing in infrastructure upgrades to deliver real HD images to the viewer .
The result :
“ It kind of looked like they took the standard definition and just blew it up , ” said Swanson , a 33 - year - old graphic designer and videographer who subscribes to Comcast Corp . ’s TV service .
“ I could n’t really tell if what I was seeing was really better than what I saw on regular television . ”
This sums up so much of how American communications conglomerates have swindled the public over the years by feeding us crappy second - rate service that we pay through the nose for , because there are often no other options for service in our residential area .
And do n’t think Verizon is a prize just because they get the message about true fiber - to - the - home buildouts .
This is the same company that deliberately redirects Internet searches to its own home pages , blocked text messages from NARAL , and ( lest we forget ) aided and abetted the NSA in spying on American citizens illegally .
Wow , that ’s real competition there .
This week the Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on no less than the future of the Internet itself , and net neutrality supporter Senator John Kerry has taken the opportunity to solicit feedback from citizens concerned about the unchecked power of corporations to subtly warp and twist Internet access to suit their purposes–or simply to save themselves a few bucks while we fall further and further behind in real broadband development .
Do n’t forget that many of those bucks will go to buying off Senators and Congressmen to ensure that their agendas are fulfilled on Capitol Hill .
If you do n’t believe me , ask John “ Straight Talk ” McCain–his infamous “ friend ” Vicki Iseman was a hard - charging telecommunications lobbyist :
Iseman , 40 , who joined the Arlington - based firm of Alcalde & Fay as a secretary and rose to partner within a few years , often touted her access to the chairman of the Senate commerce committee as she worked on behalf of clients such as Cablevision , EchoStar and Tribune Broadcasting , according to several other lobbyists who spoke on the condition of anonymity …
In the years that McCain chaired the commerce committee , Iseman lobbied for Lowell W. “ Bud ” Paxson , the head of what used to be Paxson Communications , now Ion Media Networks , and was involved in a successful lobbying campaign to persuade McCain and other members of Congress to send letters to the Federal Communications Commission on behalf of Paxson .
We ’re in the middle of a shadow war over control of the Internet , and the people who matter the most–you and I–need to make our voices heard over the clamor of lobbyists , paid flacks , and pundits .
The Internet is a public good that was built with your tax dollars .
We need to employ basic principles to build real networks .
If we do n’t , our Internet future will be compressed , distorted , and not quite like the real thing–too much noise , too little signal , and too much cost for too little benefit .
We can do better than that .
We must do better than that .
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) addresses a news conference after meeting with his foreign policy advisory panel of former Democratic U.S. government officials at a hotel in Washington June 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Bourg
JACKSONVILLE , Florida ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama said on Friday he expects Republicans to highlight the fact that he is black as part of an effort to make voters afraid of him .
“ It is going to be very difficult for Republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy , ” Obama told a fundraiser in Jacksonville , Florida .
“ We know what kind of campaign they ’re going to run .
They ’re going to try to make you afraid .
“ They ’re going to try to make you afraid of me .
He ’s young and inexperienced and he ’s got a funny name .
And did I mention he ’s black ? ”
He said he was also set for Republicans to say “ he ’s got a feisty wife , ” in trying to attack his wife Michelle .
“ We know the strategy because they ’ve already shown their cards .
Ultimately I think the American people recognize that old stuff has n’t moved us forward .
That old stuff just divides us , ” he said .
Obama , born to a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya , has cast himself as a candidate who can bridge divides within the country , including those involving race .
It has been rare for him to bring up the topic during his presidential bid .
In March he gave a widely praised speech on the subject after receiving criticism over racially charged comments by his longtime pastor .
Obama , who faces Republican John McCain in the November election , would be the first black U.S. president .
Chaps ,
I am mightily pissed off .
I have addressed this to Owen , Amanda and Ben because I do n't know who i am supposed to be pissed off with ( i'm assuming owen , but i filed to amanda and ben so it 's only fair ) , and also to Tony , who was n't here - if he had been I 'm guessing it would n't have happened .
I do n't really like people tinkering with my copy for the sake of tinkering .
I do not enjoy the suggestion that you have a better ear or eye for how I want my words to read than I do .
Owen , we discussed your turning three of my long sentences into six short ones in a single piece , and how that was n't going to happen anymore , so I 'm really hoping it was n't you that fucked up my review on saturday .
It was the final sentence .
Final sentences are very , very important .
A piece builds to them , they are the little jingle that the reader takes with him into the weekend .
I wrote : " I can't think of a nicer place to sit this spring over a glass of rosé and watch the boys and girls in the street outside smiling gaily to each other , and wondering where to go for a nosh . "
It appeared as : " I ca n't think of a nicer place to sit this spring over a glass of rosé and watch the boys and girls in the street outside smiling gaily to each other , and wondering where to go for nosh . "
There is no length issue .
This is someone thinking " I 'll just remove this indefinite article because Coren is an illiterate cunt and i know best " .
Well , you fucking do n't .
This was shit , shit sub-editing for three reasons .
1 ) ' Nosh ' , as I 'm sure you fluent Yiddish speakers know , is a noun formed from a bastardisation of the German ' naschen ' .
It is a verb , and can be construed into two distinct nouns .
One , ' nosh ' , means simply ' food ' .
You have decided that this is what i meant and removed the 'a ' .
I am insulted enough that you think you have a better ear for English than me .
But a better ear for Yiddish ?
I doubt it .
Because the other noun , ' nosh ' means " a session of eating " - in this sense you might think of its dual valency as being similar to that of ' scoff ' .
you can go for a scoff .
or you can buy some scoff .
the sentence you left me with is shit , and is not what i meant .
Why would you change a sentnece aso that it meant something i did n't mean ?
I do n't know , but you risk doing it every time you change something .
And the way you avoid this kind of fuck up is by not changing a word of my copy without asking me , okay ?
it 's easy .
Not. A. Word .
Ever .
2 ) I will now explain why your error is even more shit than it looks .
You see , i was making a joke .
I do that sometimes .
I have set up the street as " sexually - charged " .
I have described the shenanigans across the road at G.A.Y..
I have used the word ' gaily ' as a gentle nudge .
And " looking for a nosh " has a secondary meaning of looking for a blowjob .
Not specifically gay , for this is soho , and there are plenty of girls there who take money for noshing boys .
" looking for nosh " does not have that ambiguity .
the joke is gone .
I only wrote that sodding paragraph to make that joke .
And you 've fucking stripped it out like a pissed Irish plasterer restoring a renaissance fresco and thinking jesus looks shit with a bear so plastering over it .
You might as well have removed the whole paragraph .
I mean , fucking christ , do n't you read the copy ?
3 ) And worst of all .
Dumbest , deafest , shittest of all , you have removed the unstressed ' a ' so that the stress that should have fallen on " nosh " is lost , and my piece ends on an unstressed syllable .
When you 're winding up a piece of prose , metre is crucial .
Ca n't you hear ?
Ca n't you hear that it is wrong ?
It 's not fucking rocket science .
It 's fucking pre-GCSE scansion .
I have written 350 restaurant reviews for The Times and i have never ended on an unstressed syllable .
Fuck .
fuck , fuck , fuck .
I am sorry if this looks petty ( last time i mailed a Times sub about the change of a single word i got in all sorts of trouble ) but i care deeply about my work and i hate to have it fucked up by shit subbing .
I have been away , you 've been subbing joe and hugo and maybe they just file and fuck off and think " hey ho , it 's tomorrow 's fish and chips " - well , not me .
I woke up at three in the morning on sunday and fucking lay there , furious , for two hours .
weird , maybe .
but that 's how it is .
It strips me of all confidence in writing for the magazine .
No exaggeration .
i've got a review to write this morning and i really do n't feel like doing it , for fear that some nuance is going to be removed from the final line , the pay - off , and i'm going to have another weekend ruined for me .
I 've been writing for The Times for 15 years and i have never asked this before - i have never asked it of anyone i have written for - but I must insist , from now on , that i am sent a proof of every review i do , in pdf format , so i can check it for fuck - ups .
and i must be sent it in good time in case changes are needed .
It is the only way i can carry on in the job .
And , just out of interest , I 'd like whoever made that change to email me and tell me why .
Tell me the exact reasoning which led you to remove that word from my copy .
Right ,
Sorry to go on .
Anger , real steaming fucking anger can make a man verbose .
All the best

Legends relate that Buddha stopped a war between two kings who were quarreling over rights to a river by asking them , " Which is more precious , blood or water ? "
Could ordinary people use the same kind of wisdom – and courage – to check the impulse to fight wars today – over oil , water , or identity ?
Mahatma Gandhi thought so .
He created teams of civilians called the Shanti Sena or " Army of Peace " and deployed them in various communities around India where they could avert communal riots and provide other peacekeeping services .
Over the past 25 years nonviolent peacekeepers have been going into zones of sometimes intense conflict with the aim of bringing a measure of peace , protection , and sanity to life there .
Rather than use threat or force , unarmed peacekeepers deploy strategies of protective accompaniment , moral and / or witnessing " presence , " monitoring election campaigns , creating neutral safe spaces , and in extreme cases putting themselves physically between hostile parties , as Buddha did with the angry kings in ancient India .
Civilian unarmed peacekeeping has had dramatic , small - scale , quiet , and unglamorous successes : rescuing child soldiers , protecting the lives of key human rights workers and of whole villages , averting potentially explosive violence , and generally raising the level of security felt by citizens in many a tense community .
Recently a village on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines was under threat by two armed groups who had come within 200 meters of each other .
The village elders called for help from the Nonviolent Peaceforce stationed there , who intervened and by communicating with all sides persuaded the armed group to back away .
Thanks to mediation , no violence erupted , no lives were lost .
Why have n't you heard about this exciting work ?
Because it is terribly underfunded , for one thing .
There is also a prevailing prejudice that only governments or armed forces – including those of the United Nations – have the responsibility or means to contain conflict .
While the UN Security Council has often authorized " all necessary means " to maintain peace and prevent violent conflict , in fact , the UN has not systematically considered large - scale civilian unarmed peacekeeping .
But the biggest obstacle by far is the widespread – and rarely examined – belief that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun .
It is the belief that there is only one kind of power ; threat power , which in the end can be relied upon to get others to change their minds or , failing that , at least their actions .
That may change .
The failures of war - fighting for peace , most notably now in Iraq , are getting ever more costly – of life , material , and our civil liberties .
The new global norm of " Responsibility to Protect " ( R2P ) should inspire the use of civil society and nonviolent means .
While it includes military interventions , R2P is based on emerging international human security and human rights doctrine that aims to avert further failure by the international community to prevent and stop genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing , and crimes against humanity .
It may yet dawn on the world that these courageous nonviolent peacekeepers are not " unarmed ; " they are armed with what Gandhi made bold to call " the greatest force mankind has been endowed with " – nonviolence .
Nonviolent Peaceforce is working to bring this kind of peacekeeping to greater prominence , with the goal of increasing its current 70 field team members to a cadre of 2,000 by 2012 .
For a recent deployment , Nonviolent Peaceforce had applicants hailing from 55 countries for every position available .
Well - trained unarmed civilians are saving lives and protecting communities under threat in some of the world 's most violent places .
They are growing .
Recently the Geneva - based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue issued a study documenting how and why this type of " proactive presence " works .
People are ready for peaceful change and they 're willing to dedicate their lives to create it .
Civilian unarmed peacekeeping could be the way to recognize and help develop the vital protection role global civil society may credibly , effectively , and legitimately play in human security .
For the benefit of children and women in armed conflict , for refugees , journalists , human rights defenders , peacefully protesting monks , aid workers , or election campaigners – for all of us .
Because ultimately , none of us is secure until all of us are .

Getting a summer job is harder this year , but not impossible for students if they are patient and persistent .
In general , there seem to be more applicants for fewer positions than last year , a result of the slowing economy .
Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo is hiring about 1,400 seasonal workers this year , down from 1,500 last summer .
Yet it received 8,600 applications this year , up from 7,000 last year .
An increase in the state minimum wage pushed its entry - level pay to $ 8 per hour from $ 7.50 last summer .
At California 's Great America , the applicant pool has grown so large that " We do n't have enough people to handle all the interviews , " says Al Garcia , spokesman for the Santa Clara amusement park .
Some applicants have had to come back a second day .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The park has filled most of its regular 2,000 summer slots , but turnover is high and replacements are hired throughout the summer .
Bucking the trend , Great America is hiring 500 people this year to build and staff a new Halloween - themed program that will run in October .
The park is still hiring for those positions , which start in August .
The teen unemployment rate in California , which tracks the overall unemployment rate , has been rising .
It was 18.7 percent in April , 18.3 percent in April 2007 and 16.3 percent in April 2006 .
Tony DiStefano , executive director of Enterprise for High School Students in San Francisco , says its job bank " is thinner than it has been historically . "
There are still lots of household positions open , but fewer commercial jobs .
That 's partly because college graduates " are willing to take jobs they would n't normally be willing to take , " he says .
Also , older people are staying in jobs " you would have expected them to move on from . "
Amari Bolmer of San Francisco had been looking for a part - time job since last August , with no luck .
" I went to a lot of interviews .
I put out my resume , applications , " the 17 - year - old says .
A month ago , he signed up with Enterprise , which found him a couple of domestic jobs such as helping a woman move and helping another with her Web site .
This week , he got a referral to Century Theatres , which hired Bolmer to work in the concession stand starting next week at $ 9.36 per hour , San Francisco 's minimum wage .
" I had to work really hard to find a job , " he says .
Enterprise employs some students directly , in jobs that are subsidized by corporate donors , the city and an antique auction .
Demand for those jobs is way up .
For its Career Exploration Program , " we had 150 applicants , up almost 50 percent , for 41 positions , " DiStefano says .
Yuri Dew , executive director of Jobs for Youth in San Francisco , says " there are retail jobs aplenty . "
But some companies , for economic reasons , have stopped hiring interns through her nonprofit organization , which targets 16 - to 21 - year - olds .
Dew has been able to replace many jobs by working with new industries .
A group of real estate and property management companies has sponsored 29 new internships this summer .
About 15 are still open at $ 12 per hour .
Ruby Tomas , program coordinator with San Mateo County Jobs for Youth , says that while some employers - such as Kaiser Permanente and SamTrans - are hiring more students this year , overall there are fewer job openings .
Only 30 to 40 percent of the young people who come through her county - run program , which requires a job - skills workshop , end up getting jobs .
That 's mainly because their parents pushed them to come but " the kids are n't really ready to work , " Tomas says .
They fail to send applications or show up for interviews .
Any student who is " really motivated " will find a job , Tomas insists .
" You have to be determined and patient .
A job search is an actual job . "
Tomas says she has about 60 job listings - mostly in restaurant and retail - for 16 - and 17 - year olds and about 100 openings for those older than 18 .
It 's harder for people younger than 18 to find jobs because state laws restrict their work hours , says Mayela Gutknecht , a specialist at Jobs for Youth in San Francisco .
It 's also " very hard for youth with any type of criminal background , " even misdemeanors for marijuana possession , she says .
Youth from disadvantaged communities can have trouble getting jobs because of transportation problems or because " they have n't had the family support , " Gutknecht adds .
They sometimes lack the " presentation and interpersonal skills " employers expect .
Students from higher - income families " are more likely to be part of a network where opportunities are made available to them or the basics are taught to them , such as how to prepare a resume or come across as a professional , " DiStefano says .
Gutknecht says students here often have to compete for entry - level jobs with immigrants , including college grads .
" There 's a lot of competition in the city , " she says .
" People from England are coming here with a college degree and working for a restaurant because they want to live here . "
After Antidepressant Warning , Youth Prescriptions Down , but Suicides Way Up
By Daniel J. DeNoon
WebMD Health News
Reviewed By Louise Chang , MD
Sept. 13 , 2007 - Warnings that antidepressants may increase teen suicides appear to have backfired , a new study suggests .
The study shows that a steep drop in antidepressant prescriptions for children and teens followed the FDA and European drug authority warnings .
At the same time , there was an unprecedented spike in child and teen suicides .
The study is n't proof that the antidepressant warnings caused the increase in suicides .
But the circumstantial evidence -- from both the U.S. and the Netherlands -- is very compelling , says study researcher Hendricks Brown , PhD , director of the prevention science and methodology group at the University of South Florida College of Public Health , Tampa .
" The FDA actions look like they had very serious unintended consequences , " Brown tells WebMD .
" Our analyses show that the FDA actions , which should have reduced or at least not changed the number of suicides for youth , had just the opposite effect . "
On the advice of an expert panel , the FDA in 2004 put a " black - box " warning -- its highest warning level -- on antidepressants for pediatric use .
The panel 's advice was based not on actual suicides , but on indications that suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased in some children and teens taking newer SSRI - type antidepressants .
It looks as though the FDA effort backfired , says Boris Birmaher , MD , director of the child and adolescent mood and anxiety program at the University of Pittsburgh 's Western Psychiatric Institute .
Birmaher was not involved in the study .
" Years ago we speculated that suicides -- not suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts but real deaths -- were going down because a lot of doctors , not just psychiatrists , were prescribing SSRI antidepressants , " Birmaher tells WebMD .
" Then comes the black box , and without any other specific reason there was a huge increase in the number of kids dying from suicide .
This is not proof , just a statistical association .
But it is suspicious . "
Researcher Robert D. Gibbons , PhD , of the University of Illinois , Chicago , was a member of the FDA panel .
He voted against the black - box warning .
" The FDA has overestimated the effect of antidepressant medications on suicidality and dramatically underestimated the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of childhood depression , " Gibbons told WebMD in April 2007 .
The study by Gibbons , Brown , and colleagues , appears in the September issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry .
Antidepressant Use Dropped , Suicides Soared After Warnings
Brown and colleagues looked at antidepressant prescription data in a large sample of American and Dutch pharmacies .
They also obtained data on suicide rates from the CDC and from the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics .
They found that from 2002 to 2003 , prescription rates for SSRI antidepressants went up for all age groups -- continuing a steady increase since 1987 .
After 2003 , prescription rates dropped for all ages under 60 .
Then came the warnings :
October 2003 : The FDA issued a public health advisory warning of reports of children and teens who attempted or committed suicide after taking antidepressants .

The label warned of increased risk of " suicidality " in children and teens taking the drugs .

December 2 006 : The FDA ex tended the black - box warning to young adults .
Here 's what happened to antidepressant prescriptions and suicide rates :
1998 - 2003 : U.S. SSRI antidepressant prescription rates went up 91 % and suicides dropped 33 % .
U.S. SSRI antidepressant prescription rates went up 91 % and suicides dropped 33 % .
1998 -2003 : Netherlands SSRI antidepressant prescription rates went up 120 % and suicide rates dropped by 31 % .
Netherlands SSRI antidepressant prescription rates went up 120 % and suicide rates dropped by 31 % .
2003 - 2004 : SSRI antidepressant prescriptions drop 22 % in U.S. and Netherlands .
SSRI antidepressant prescriptions drop 22 % in U.S. and Netherlands .
2003-2004 : U.S. youth suicides went up 14 % ( 2005 figures not yet available ) .
U.S. youth suicides went up 14 % ( 2005 figures not yet available ) .
2003 -2005 : Netherlands youth suicides went up 49 % .
The one - year 14 % increase in suicides among American 5 - to 19 - year - olds is highly unusual .
Since 1988 , suicides in this age group went up only twice : a 1 % bump in 1994 and a 3 % increase in 2000 .
If there really is a link between fewer antidepressant prescriptions and child and teen suicides , Brown and colleagues predict that the CDC 's statistics will show a 44 % increase in child and teen suicides from 2003 to 2005 .
The effects are n't limited to kids .
" There is a spillover effect : SSRI prescriptions in the U.S. for all other age groups have been decreasing for everyone under age 60 , " Brown notes .
If the warnings cut adult antidepressant prescriptions by 20 % , the researchers predict that there will be 10 % more adult suicides .
Kids Not Getting Depression Treatment of Any Kind
Birmaher notes that there 's another disturbing trend going on .
Since the black - box warnings , fewer children and teens have been diagnosed with major depression .
" The fact that diagnosis of major depression has decreased means these kids are going untreated .
Nobody is offering them anything , neither antidepressants nor psychotherapy , " Birmaher says .
" This can be linked to the increase in suicides .
And unfortunately , this looks like a side effect of the FDA warning . "
Why does the Los Angeles Times hate America ?.
They ’re mean .
John McCain was tortured in Vietnam .
So stop talking about his credibility .
You can only ask Barack Obama questions about his credibility , and his patriotism , about whether his preacher loves America and whether Obama has a personal problem with the American flag .
But do n’t ask John McCain anything because John McCain is a hero .
Even though now we find out that our hero was still living with his wife when he started dating his mistress .
It gets even better : McCain was still legally married to his first wife when he got a marriage license for his second wife .
I guess adultery and bigamy are n’t such a big deal anymore with “ family values ” leaders like Ohio ’s Phil Burress who are now supporting McCain .
And in any case , they were youthful indiscretions – McCain was only in his 40s at the time .
In political reinvention terms , that ’s practically puberty .
An examination of court documents tells a different story .
McCain did not sue his wife for divorce until Feb. 19 , 1980 , and he wrote in his court petition that he and his wife had “ cohabited ” until Jan.
7 of that year — or for the first nine months of his relationship with Hensley .
Although McCain suggested in his autobiography that months passed between his divorce and remarriage , the divorce was granted April 2 , 1980 , and he wed Hensley in a private ceremony five weeks later .
McCain obtained an Arizona marriage license on March 6 , 1980 , while still legally married to his first wife .
In all seriousness , putting the snark aside .
Imagine if Barack Obama had two marriages at the same time .
Imagine had Barack Obama lied about living with his first wife while having a mistress on the side .
Imagine that all this happened while Obama had promised to speak out vocally about how gay people are a threat to marriage .
We ’d never hear the end of it from the Republicans and the media .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A top legal adviser to the Pentagon squelched objections from legal experts when the military was writing rules that cleared the way for harsh interrogation of prisoners , a former lawyer for the senior U.S. military commander testified Tuesday .
Sen .
Carl Levin says officials damaged intelligence gathering by approving harsh interrogation techniques .
In November 2002 , lawyers for all the major branches of the armed services objected in writing to some of the recommended interrogation techniques before they were officially approved , Sen. Carl Levin , D - Michigan , revealed for the first time Tuesday .
William J. Haynes , then the Pentagon 's general counsel , indicated he did not want the services to continue reviewing the guidance in the works , retired Adm.
Jane G. Dalton , a former legal adviser to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told the Senate Committee on Armed Services .
Dalton said her boss , Gen. Richard Myers , told her that " Mr. Haynes did not want this process to proceed . "
Myers was then Joint Chiefs chairman .
" I was told to stop the broad - based analysis , " she said .
Sen . Claire McCaskill , a Missouri Democrat , demanded Haynes explain whose legal advice he had relied on in making his official recommendation on interrogation .
Haynes did not give a clear answer to the question , but denied advocating torture .
" Nobody has advocated torture , period , " he said .
" I do n't advocate torture .
Effective interrogation is what we are after .
My job in this exercise is to talk about what does the law permit , and what does it prohibit . "
He later told Sen. Jack Reed , a Rhode Island Democrat , that he had not seen objections from senior military lawyers until this year : " You are referring to a group of memos that I do not recall seeing at the time . "
But he added , " I do n't want anyone to walk away from my statement about that to suggest that I do n't -- did n't know that there were concerns about how the DOD should interrogate prisoners . "
The White House has denied the United States practices torture .
According to Levin , Haynes recommended to Rumsfeld that harsher interrogation was legally justified .
Watch as Levin disputes notion that a " few bad apples " are to blame »
Rumsfeld signed a December 2002 memo approving techniques such as threatening prisoners with dogs and forcing them to stand for prolonged periods .
" I stand for 8 - 10 hours a day .
Why is standing limited to 4 hours ? "
Rumsfeld wrote on the memo , according to Levin .
Senators are seeking to discover who approved harsh interrogations of prisoners held by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" How did it come about that American military personnel stripped detainees naked , put them in stress positions , used dogs to scare them , put leashes around their necks to humiliate them , hooded them , deprived them of sleep and blasted music at them ? "
Levin asked in his opening statement at the committee hearing .
" Senior officials in the United States government sought information on aggressive techniques , twisted the law to create the appearance of their legality and authorized their use against detainees , " said Levin , the committee chairman .
" In the process , they damaged our ability to collect intelligence that could save lives . "
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , a military lawyer by training , said in his opening statement that " bizarre " legal reasoning was used to justify the harsh techniques .
Watch Graham call the legal analysis " irresponsible " »
The South Carolina lawmaker predicted the opinions supporting the techniques would go down in history " as some of the most irresponsible , shortsighted legal advice " ever offered , but he said he is convinced it was put forward with the country 's best interests at heart .
Levin was especially critical of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , who he said pushed for harsh interrogations in the face of objections from top military lawyers .
Rumsfeld was not present at the hearing .
" When Secretary Rumsfeld approved the use of abusive techniques against detainees , he unleashed a virus which ultimately infected interrogation operations conducted by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq , " Levin said .
A former Pentagon official told the panel Rumsfeld wanted the military to conduct interrogations because he envied other agencies .
" I think it would have been unthinkable to say to the secretary ...
' The people who were really good at this are law enforcement ; we should talk to the FBI , talk to the DEA [ Drug Enforcement Administration ] , talk to other law enforcement agencies that have been conducting interrogation for their entire careers . '
I just do n't think he would have accepted that answer , " said Richard L. Shiffrin , the Pentagon 's former deputy general counsel for intelligence .
McCaskill expressed frustration about the committee 's inability to discover who was ultimately responsible for the decision to abuse prisoners .
Watch McCaskill express her frustrations »
" There are still people involved at the periphery of this that are in positions of responsibility in today 's government , so our frustration is that we would like to hold someone responsible , and it 's like trying to catch shadows here , " she said .
At least one witness took responsibility for the legal advice she had offered , but she expressed surprise about how it was implemented , apparently without further review .
" No one tried to influence me , " said retired Lt. Col .
Diane Beaver , a former staff judge advocate at Guantanamo Bay .
But she added , " I did not expect that my opinion ... would become the final word .
I did not expect to be the only lawyer to write an opinion on this monumentally important decision .
...
If my legal opinion was wrong , then I regret the error very much . "

A new type of wound dressing made of silica gel fibers will soon help to heal difficult wounds caused by burns or diabetes .
The dressing forms a supporting matrix for newly growing skin cells and is fully absorbed by the body during the healing process .
In Germany alone , about three million – mostly elderly – patients suffer from poorly healing large - area wounds caused by complaints such as diabetes , burns or bedsores .
The wounds can be treated with conventional collagen dressings or polylactic acid dressings , but the success rate is not as good as it should be .
A new type of dressing made of silica gel fibers , developed by scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC in Würzburg , shall solve the problem .
This novel dressing has many advantages : it is shape - stable , pH-neutral and 100 percent bioresorbable .
Once applied it remains in the body , where it gradually degrades without leaving any residues .
What ’s more , the fibre fleece provides the healthy cells around the edges of the wound with the structure they additionally need for a proper supply of growth - supporting nutrients .
To prevent any infection , treatment of the wound must be absolutely sterile .
“ As only the outer bandage needs to be changed , the risk of contaminating the wound is low , ” explains Dr. Jörn Probst of the ISC .
And thanks to the supporting matrix for the cells , the chances of a scar - free natural closure of the wound are very good .
The fibers are produced by means of wet - chemical material synthesis , a sol - gel process in which a transparent , honey - like gel is produced from tetraethoxysilane ( TEOS ) , ethanol and water in a multi-stage , acidically catalyzed synthesis process .
The gel is processed in a spinning tower .
“ We press it through fine nozzles at constant temperatures and humidity levels , ” explains Walther Glaubitt , the inventor of the silica gel fibers .
“ This produces fine endless threads which are collected on a traversing table and spun in a specific pattern to produce a roughly A4 - sized multi- layer textile web . ”
The dressings are then cut , packed and sterilized .
Dr. Jörn Probst and Dipl. - Ing .
Walther Glaubitt will receive the Joseph von Fraunhofer Prize 2008 for developing the biocompatible dressing .
A partner to support the development and market the dressing has already been found : Bayer Innovation GmbH BIG , a wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer AG .
“ We anticipate that hospitals will start to use the silica gel wound dressing in 2011 , ” states Iwer Baecker , project manager at Bayer Innovation GmbH .
And that is by no means the end of the story .
The scientists plan to integrate active substances such as antibiotics or painkillers in the dressing to improve and accelerate the healing process .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - World Youth Day in Sydney this month is the Catholic church ’s Woodstock , five days of love , peace and Christianity overseen by the Pope , but civil liberties leaders say police will be using “ repugnant ” anti-protest powers .

Police powers for all of July have been increased to allow them to arrest and fine people A$ 5,000 ( US $ 4,800 ) for causing annoyance or inconvenience to participants in World Youth Day , which runs from July 15 - 20 , and permit partial strip searches .
The laws have the potential to make a crime of things such as wearing a T - shirt with an anti-Catholic message , handing out condoms at protests , or even playing music , said critics .
President of the New South Wales Bar ( NSW ) Association , Anna Katzmann , said on Tuesday that the increased powers were repugnant and infringed on civil liberties .
“ They are repugnant for two reasons .
First of all the government has by - passed the normal parliamentary scrutiny ... and secondly they are an unreasonable interference with people ’s freedom of speech and movement , ” Katzmann told reporters .
NSW state Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the extra powers were necessary to ensure security for the event , which organizers say could attract 500,000 pilgrims , and for Pope Benedict ’s first visit to Australia .
Organizers say the event will be bigger than the Sydney Olympics and the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum summit in the city and have advised workers to take holidays to avoid the congestion from road closures and mass people marches as they attend a papal mass and services .
The extra police powers will apply to 40 city locations , including museums , galleries , cinemas , parks , and venues where the Pope will appear .
More than 500 schools and 35 train and bus stations have been listed as “ declared areas ” where people entering will be subject to car and baggage searches that require them to remove jackets , shoes and headwear if requested .
The only people who have threatened to protest World Youth Day and the papal visit are a group critical of the Catholic church ’s views on homosexuals , contraception and abortion .
The group has said it will protest by handing out condoms to pilgrims as they gather for the papal mass .
Victims of sexual abuse by members of the Catholic church in Australia are calling on the Pope to publicly apologize for the abuse , just as he did in the United States earlier this year , but at this stage they have not said they will protest .

People who want to have a good relationship with JavaScript and those who wish to improve the relationship they have will find it most useful .
There are lots of books and tutorials that deal with JavaScript but this approaches the language from the point of view of a survivalist .
I expect this little field guide to retain its usefulness for many years .
As Brendan Eich , the creator of JavaScript , states on his blog , " What was needed was a convincing proof of concept , AKA a demo .
That , I delivered , and in too - short order it was a fait accompli . "
JavaScript was a mock up that got a stamp of approval .
His first draft became the language .
I find that rather shocking .
But Brendan alludes in his blog to the idea that there were many other considerations in play at the time , so the story - boarded code got the go - ahead .
Crockford 's book fills a niche for users explaining how to code with JavaScript and be a better programmer because of the experience .
Douglas Crockford writes in a relaxed , conversational style establishing a connection with the reader that continues through the book 's contents ( all 100 pages ) and the five appendixes ( 50 pages total for the appendixes ) .
I read the book in an evening - away - from - the - screen kind of mood and only followed one piece of code as outlined in the book .
The book is approachable with a cursory acknowledgment of the code and it is also informative with a detailed examination of said code .
Special mention goes to Chapter 7 : Regular Expressions .
There are some topics which are so complex that other authors either skip over them , or use so much jargon as to render the effort useless .
Douglas Crockford gives a guided tour of a regular expression designed to parse a url and it is intelligible and informative .
He identifies the shortcut he uses in his regular expression code and acknowledges the risks he accepts by using it .
I found his twelve and a half pages on regular expressions gave me a reasonable introduction to the subject .
He uses quotes from Shakespeare as an icebreaker for each chapter and appendix .
The book contains code snippets and some recipes for adding your own functions and methods which Douglas feels should have been in the language and are n't .
This I find to be a very interesting feature of the book .
Like the staples for a good kitchen : ganache , bechamel , mirepoix ; Crockford identifies the staples of a scripting language and gives the reader the recipes for the features that JavaScript does n't have ; .integer , .trim , and .curry ( which allows the creation of a new function by combining a function and an argument ) .
One of the things that is missing from this book is the DOM ( the Document Object Model ) .
I could n't be happier about that .
Every other reference I have approached mashes JavaScript to the DOM so fast that as a newcomer to the language I thought that aspects of the DOM were properties of JavaScript .
Douglas Crockford has an episode on Yahoo !
Video talking about that very topic and it was a breath of fresh air for deciphering JavaScript .
By the way , the amount of characters , in the above sentences about the DOM , is about the quantity of characters dedicated to the topic in JavaScript : The Good Parts .
For me , this is a plus .
The author states that the necessary equipment for writing JavaScript programs is a browser and a text editor .
Since both are readily available in a variety of flavors and styles , I am fairly confident that every programmer wanting to learn about the good parts of JavaScript can do so .
My previous attempts to learn JavaScript had not gone well and I did n't have an understanding about why the topic was proving so confusing for me .
Knowing the history of the language and the environment at its birth , I now have a better appreciation for the abilities of this language as well as a higher level of acceptance for its quirks .
I understand now why I should use " var " when assigning a variable , and also why it is a good idea to conclude the line containing " return " that is followed by a block , with the left curly brace that begins the block .
I did n't have the patience to accept these idiosyncrasies before and now that I know the history of JavaScript , I can see why it is a good idea to use Crockford 's suggestions as a consistent coding style .
Charles Jolley suggested that I read JavaScript : The Good Parts as a basis for learning JavaScript .
His tag line was : " I read it in three hours . "
Now , that may be an inappropriate reason for reading a book , but after spending hours and hours with various media trying to understand JavaScript , three hours seemed like a reasonable investment of time .
( It took me a little longer reading at home with the occasional interruption but I still did my first pass in an evening . )
The author wrote the book as an enumerable ( the recipient of an action one or more times ) with each reading revealing layers of understanding .
In the appendixes , there is an appendix entitled " Awful Parts " and one entitled " Bad Parts " .
Global variables head the list in " Awful Parts " .
There are discussions throughout the book about why to avoid JavaScript 's default to global variables and how to do this in your coding style .
The explanation , of why global variables should be avoided in JavaScript , is detailed in the " Awful Parts " appendix .
Also making an appearance in " Awful Parts " : scope , semicolon insertion , and reserved words .
The " Bad Parts " appendix includes : == ( double equal sign ) which can be evaluated unpredictably depending on the circumstances , " with " which can also have unpredictable results , and " eval " which passes a string to the JavaScript compiler and executes the result .
" eval " slows the result when compilation is n't required and can also compromise the security of your application .
But what about its use in JSON you ask ?
Crockford suggests using the JSON .
parse method instead of " eval " .
The file which creates the JSON object with the parse method can be found here .
If this is of interest to you , I suggest you check the link and access the book to hear it from Crockford directly .
I find Douglas Crockford 's perspective on JavaScript in JavaScript : The Good Parts to be useful in my own relationship with JavaScript .
His style is accessible and intelligent .
You can purchase JavaScript : The Good Parts from amazon.com .

The State of the Web - Summer 2008

The basics of creating a tumblelog with Django
On my new homepage , a combined list of my tweets , bookmarks , and user comments on my site appear underneath my latest blog entries .
I use a fun bit of Django code to pull these various items together , sorted by publication date , and I ’d like to share how this bit of tumblelog - like functionality works .
The basic concept is this :
Every time an object of type A , B , or C is created , create an object of type D that does nothing but point to an A , B , or C and keep track of its publication date .
In my case , A , B , and C are Bookmark ( from Del.icio.us ) , Status ( from Twitter ) , and FreeComment ( from Django ) .
D is an object I call a Stream Item .
The basic Django model for this is below :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 from django.db import models from django.contrib.contenttypes import generic from django.template.loader import render_to_string class StreamItem ( models .
Model ) : content_type = models .
ForeignKey ( ContentType ) object_id = models .
PositiveIntegerField ( ) pub_date = models .
DateTimeField ( ) content_object = generic .
GenericForeignKey ( ' content_type ' , ' object_id ' ) def get_rendered_html ( self ) : template_name = ' blog/includes/stream_item_ %s .html ' % ( self .
content_type .
name ) return render_to_string ( template_name , { ' object ' : self . content_object })
Django ’s ContentTypes framework allows us to choose what other model we are pointing to , and what the ID of the specific instance of that model is .
The GenericForeignKey allows us to retrieve that object just like we would with a foreign key to a known model .
We store the pub_date in the StreamItem as well , since objects we point to may use a different field name and we want to have a consistent field by which to sort .
The get_rendered_html method simply passes the retrieved object to a template with that object ’s name .
Now that the model is defined , a StreamItem has to be created whenever a Bookmark , Status , or FreeComment is created .
Conveniently , Django sends a ‘ signal ’ after saving any object , known as post_save , along with an argument ‘ created ’ that returns
True if the object was just created for the first time .
( Signals are sent at other times , as well .
See signals documentation ) .
The idea is this :
Create a function that saves a new StreamItem .
Invoke this function whenever the post_save signal is sent from a Bookmark , Status , or FreeComment object .
The basic function looks like this :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 from django.db.models import signals from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType from django .
dispatch import dispatcher from appname . models import Bookmark , Status from comments .
models import FreeComment def create_stream_item ( sender , instance , signal , * args , ** kwargs ) : # Check to see if the object was just created for the first time if ' created ' in kwargs : if kwargs [ ' created ' ] : create =
True #
Get the instance 's content type ctype = ContentType .
objects .
get_for_model ( instance ) # Special cases for different date fields if ctype .
name == ' free comment ' : pub_date = instance .
submit_date elif ctype .
name == ' bookmark ' : pub_date = instance .
time else : pub_date = instance .
pub_date # Special case for FreeComments to ensure the comment is public #
This prevents comments in moderation or thought to be spam from appearing if ctype .
name == ' free comment ' : if instance .
is_public == False : create =
False if create : si = StreamItem . objects .
get_or_create ( content_type = ctype , object_id = instance .
id , pub_date = pub_date ) #
Send a signal on post_save for each of these models for modelname in [ Status , Bookmark , FreeComment ] : dispatcher .
connect ( create_stream_item , signal = signals .
post_save , sender = modelname )
First , check to see if the object was just created for the first time .
If so , indicate in which field that object ’s model stores its publication date .
Perform any other checks to make sure you want to create the StreamItem .
Then create the StreamItem .
Now , a list of all these objects can be accessed by any view by using StreamItem.objects.all ( ) .
Djangosnippets can be of assistance in helping you pull in feeds from Del.icio.us , Twitter , or any other service you ’d like to use , as can the Python libraries pydelicious and Python Twitter .
This is my first attempt at a code walk - thru , so please leave a comment if anything is not explained clearly .
I do n’t doubt there are more efficient ways to accomplish this same goal , so feel free to share those , too .
There is now a second part “ ) that explains how these items actually show up on the homepage .
In my famously favorite passage from Arthur Machen 's influential short story " The Great God Pan , " just before the end , one of two amateur investigators has just uncovered the secret of what it was that was driving young , healthy , wealthy , secure young men to commit suicide on three continents , in a manuscript left behind by one of the suicides .
After reading only a few words , the partner says , " Take it away , Villiers , never speak of this again .
Are you made of stone , man ?
Why , the dread and horror of death itself , the thoughts of the man who stands in the keen morning air on the black platform , bound , the bell tolling in his ears , and waits for the harsh rattle of the bolt , are as nothing compared to this .
I will not read it ; I should never sleep again . "
The original investigator assures him that it is true , but finishes by agreeing with the sentiment : " Oh , Austin , how can it be ?
How is it that the very sunlight does not turn to blackness before this thing , the hard earth melt and boil beneath such a burden ?
" I think that 30 scientists and researchers from a half dozen or more different fields who gathered in rural France in 1990 to check each others ' work must have felt something of that same horror when they found that they could not disprove their mutual finding .
It was something that none of them wanted to believe .
It was a thought that only one of the 30 of them was willing to confront the implications of , and do further research to explore the implications of .
And I 'm sure that they knew or at least suspected that no matter how important their scientific finding was , they would be vilified for a lifetime if they made society confront this awful truth , and that was a price that they were unwilling to pay .
And see , that , to me , is the fascinating thing , even more fascinating than the awful truth itself .
On the contrary , almost all of my friends that I 've discussed this with since I read the book have agreed with me that , given the weight of the evidence , the awful truth in question is pretty undeniable , is important to know , and ( contrary to what some might think ) it is something we can learn to live with the knowledge of .
If this knowledge becomes widespread , it may and probably will cause some hardship for some innocent people .
But the good to society will , I believe , out - weigh those harms .
So no , really , the awful truth that I 'm about to reveal to you will seem anti-climactic compared to the dread that the scientists who discovered it felt .
After a several year career as one of the second generation of women to do fieldwork in primatology , Sarah Hrdy and her husband decided to have their first child .
She was already in the middle of preparations to shift her career from primatology to a subject that would allow her to do her fieldwork closer to home , with fewer long absences from home , and in a more comfortable setting to raise a baby in , namely evolutionary biology , when it occurred to her ( as a mother to be ) just out of personal interest to study the mothering patterns of the colony of monkeys she was observing .
She knew to expect high infant mortality .
Primatologists have known for over a hundred years that baby monkeys and baby apes are at extreme risk from any male other than their father .
( As are baby humans . )
But Hrdy was startled to discover , when she tracked the mothers of new infants carefully , that infants were at almost as much risk of murder from their own mothers as they were from unrelated male adults .
This baffled her for several reasons , not least of which that while there had been a great deal of research into infanticide in primates , nobody hadreported a case of a female primate killing her own offspring except by freakish accident .
The other reason it baffled her was that , as an evolutionary biologist , she could make no sense whatsoever as to how evolution could produce individuals that destroyed their own offspring , especially among such slowly reproducing species as primates .
So she contacted a few other primatologists studying other colonies of monkeys and asked them to carefully monitor the actions of new mothers ... and to their astonishment , they observed the same thing .
So she gave a preliminary paper on the subject in 1976 , suggesting that more research was needed to explain how this behavior could possibly have evolved in primates , only to be interrupted in mid talk by an audience member , a prominent expert in her field .
He stood up , tried to stop her from finishing reading her paper , announced that primate females absolutely do not ever murder their own children , and that if she had observed a primate colony in which primate females were killing their own children , it could only be because of something she had done to them ; she must have committed some horrible breach of experimental ethics that so deranged these monkeys that she had driven them insane enough to do something that no monkey had ever done before .
He then stormed out of the talk and went directly to the scientific press to denounce her for whatever it was that she had done to that monkey colony , so it probably is a good thing that she was already planning on changing fields , no ?
So she quietly continued her study , working behind the scenes with other researchers while she directed her own studies towards less controversial animals , such as insects .
Eventually she discovered something that appalled even her with its simplicity .
Not only do mothers sometimes kill their own children , they are almost never insane when they do so .
On the contrary , for a mother to murder her own child is an evolutionary adaptation without which our species would not have survived some of the environmental and social disasters of the past .
What 's more , the actual reasoning behind this is so simple that a straightforward simple equation in four variables is sufficient to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that any particular mother will murder any particular infant : the age of the mother , whether or not this child is the gender that the mother wanted ( which , itself , turns out to be easily and universally predicted based on only two variables , the mother 's social status and the predicted reliability of the food supply ) , the child 's birth weight ( and to a lesser extent other indicators of long - term viability ) , and her estimate of whether or not attempting to nurture this particular child will only get both her and the child killed .
When she took her early estimates for this equation to the 1990 conference , she discovered that epidemiologists studying SIDS , primatologists studying infanticide ( following her 1976 tip ) , historians digging through old records to try to quantify infanticide throughout the ages , criminologists and social psychologists trying to come up with statistical models to predict mother - on - child infanticide , and anthropologists trying to statistically analyze what variables are most consistent with cultures that have high versus low rates of infanticide , had all independently discovered the same equation .
And from her viewpoint as an evolutionary biologist , Hrdy demonstrates that any sane , healthy , normal , intelligent mothers who were n't capable of coldly murdering their own infant children almost certainly had no surviving descendants at all to be our ancestors during some of the species - wide threats that have been demonstrated to have happened from the fossil record and from studies of rates of genetic drift .
I mention SIDS .
One of the researchers , she says , was an epidemiologist who , in the process of trying to quantify his hunch , initiated a study in which social workers and police very , very intensively interviewed and background checked a long string of crib deaths that had been explained away as unexplained random respiratory failure .
It turns out that his equation was able to predict , with high ( but not absolute ) reliability , which infants had actually been the victims of homicide or malign neglect .
If the infant was a boy when the mother wanted a girl or vice versa , if the infant was born weighing less than 8 pounds , or if the mother was in any kind of economic or physical danger if this child survived , then the baby was doomed .
His final estimate , from that initial study , was thatof all SIDS cases are actually homicides .
But , he admitted , just acknowledging this possibility puts us in an awful dilemma .
To catch the 3 out of 4 women whose babies suddenly die that were actually murderers , we have to treat all SIDS cases as potential homicides , therefore piling yet more heartbreak and tragedy on the 1 out of 4 who just randomly went through the worst tragedy any family can know , the sudden and unexpected death of a beloved child .
Even using the predictive equation to narrow the field of homicide investigations , we 'd still be casting a very scarily public accusation of homicide on an uncomfortably large number of grieving mothers .
I also mention social psychology .
The central tenet of the field of social psychology is that if under a given situation , all or nearly all individuals will engage in the same unwanted behavior , then there is less to be gained by stigmatizing those individuals and lauding the ones who do n't than by studying the situation with an eye towards changing it .
And you can see in a heartbeat how that applies here : if infants are at extreme risk whenever one or more of three variables are present , then we can reduce the rate of ( massively under - reported , intentionally under- investigated ) maternal infanticide by decreasing the economic and evolutionary pressures behind gender preference , by providing mothers with as much economic assistance and physical protection as it would require for them to feel safe providing for this baby , and by intensify supervision for the first several months of life of mothers of infants who are born weighing less than 8 pounds or looking otherwise sickly .
But addressing the issue in this way , and looking into the roots of the equation that predicts maternal infanticide , makes social psychologists confront the queasy implication of all of their work : if it's that sane and natural for them to do this awful thing , if this awful thing is so hard to resist , how can we justify stigmatizing and punishing them ?
And if we can't , then how can we live with ourselves having just ( the historian points out ) joined the 85 % of all known historical societies , up to and including Christian western Europe as late as the late 19th century , that socially tolerated infanticide any time in the first couple of days after birth ?
There 's pro-choice , I mean , and then there 's beingpro- choice as to join the ranks of societies that have denied the humanity of a breathing infant up to 48 hours old ... are we willing to go there ?
Or to at least show understanding and compassion and tolerance towards societies that did or that do ?
The anthropologists at the conference were especially terrified of releasing their research findings , because they knew that the accusation that a society or tribe kills children has been used to justify no shortage of genocidal invasions .
I cultivate a readership that 's willing to think the unthinkable , so perhaps most of you are still baffled by what part of this spawned such a terror of confronting their own research findings that 29 out of 30 scientists who discovered it immediately and without any external pressure moved to suppress their own research findings .
Frankly , good -- I distrust that impulse , too , and think that we arebetter off knowing the truth than not knowing it .
But as you go about your day , remember this : research shows that your own mother consciously or unconsciously considered murdering you in your crib , off and on for at least the first 48 hours after your birth and not improbably for the whole first two weeks of your life , maybe even the first two months .
And if your mother was under 30 when she had you and you were born male in a poor family or female in a wealthy family during times of economic hardship , or weighing less than 8 pounds , or at a time when your mother thought that her own chances of survival would improve if you did n't survive so ( for example ) she could get pregnant by her new husband more quickly or so she could return to work more quickly , you very nearly did n't make it .
And she would have gotten away with it , too , because mothers have traditionally had a long list of potential murder weapons ready to hand , from handing you over to caretakers or adoption agencies even if she knew they had a 99 % chance of killing you , to smothering you with a pillow , to switching you to infant formula that she knew was diluted with unsafe water , to declining to lift a hand to save you from some mortal peril .
And because " everybody knows " that mothers do n't kill their own children , nobody would have questioned her about it .
Have a nice day !
( CNN ) -- China has rejected a new report which claims it has broken a promise to improve its human rights situation and " betrayed the core values of the Olympics . "
China has tightened security around Beijing ahead of next month 's Olympic Games .
The report by Amnesty International , entitled The Olympics Countdown : Broken Promises , was released Tuesday and outlines particular areas of concern including the death penalty , detention without trial , the persecution of rights activists and the lack of media freedom .
According to Amnesty , China promised an improvement in human rights , media freedom and better provision in health and education .
Instead , it says , Beijing has locked up , put under house arrest and forcibly removed individuals they believe may threaten the image of " stability " and " harmony " they want to present to the world during next month 's games .
" By continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights , the Chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the Games seven years ago , " Roseann Rife , Asia - Pacific Deputy Director at Amnesty International , said on the organization 's Web site .
However , China dismissed the report and said that people who " understood " China would not agree with it .
Watch a report on Amnesty 's statements on China 's human rights record »
Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said : " We hope Amnesty can take off the tinted glasses it has worn for many years and see China in an objective way . "
Elsewhere in the report , Amnesty welcomed China 's move last year to restore the Supreme People 's Court 's role in approving death sentences .
But it criticized the government , which says the number of executions has declined , for withholding data on death penalty cases .
International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) President , Jacques Rogge , recently claimed the IOC 's ' quiet diplomacy ' had led to several human rights reforms in China , including new regulations for foreign media .
" We welcome the IOC 's recognition of its role on human rights , but given the current reality , we are surprised at their confidence that foreign media will be able to report freely and that there will be no internet censorship , " said Roseann Rife .
Learn how China monitors the Internet »
Despite new media regulations that were supposed to allow for freer reporting for foreign journalists , Amnesty says they continue to be prevented from covering " sensitive issues " , including talking to those who suffer human rights violations .
It says foreign correspondents in China reported more than 250 instances of interference with their work since the start of last year .
The group also believes that local activists and journalists working on human rights issues in China are at particular risk of abuse during the Games .
One example given by Amnesty is housing rights activist Ye Guozhu , who continues to serve a four - year sentence for " picking quarrels and stirring up trouble " because of his opposition to the seizure and demolition of property to make way for new Olympic construction projects .
Ye Guozhu 's prison sentence was due to expire on 26 July .
Instead the Chinese authorities say , he will remain imprisoned until at least 1 October , after the end of the 2008 Olympic Games .

Court overturns father ’s grounding of 12 - year - old
A Canadian court has lifted a 12 - year - old girl ’s grounding , overturning her father ’s punishment for disobeying his orders to stay off the internet , his lawyer said .
The girl had taken her father to Quebec Superior Court after he refused to allow her to go on a school trip for chatting on websites he tried to block , and then posting “ inappropriate ” pictures of herself online using a friend ’s computer .
The father ’s lawyer Kim Beaudoin said the disciplinary measures were for the girl ’s “ own protection ” and is appealing the ruling .
“ She ’s a child , ” Beaudoin said .
“ At her age , children test their limits and it ’s up to their parents to set boundaries .
“ I started an appeal of the decision today to reestablish parental authority , and to ensure that this case does n’t set a precedent , ” she said .
Otherwise , said Beaudoin , “ parents are going to be walking on egg shells from now on ” .
“ I think most children respect their parents and would never go so far as to take them to court , but it ’s clear that some would and we have to ask ourselves how far this will go . ”
According to court documents , the girl ’s internet transgression was just the latest in a string of broken house rules .
Even so , Justice Suzanne Tessier found her punishment too severe .
Beaudoin noted the girl used a court - appointed lawyer in her parents ’ 10 - year custody dispute to launch her landmark case against her dad .
Selling Free Software
Some views on the ideas of selling exceptions to free software licenses , such as the GNU GPL are also available .
Many people believe that the spirit of the GNU Project is that you should not charge money for distributing copies of software , or that you should charge as little as possible — just enough to cover the cost .
This is a misunderstanding .
Actually , we encourage people who redistribute free software to charge as much as they wish or can .
If a license does not permit users to make copies and sell them , it is a nonfree license .
If this seems surprising to you , please read on .
The word “ free ” has two legitimate general meanings ; it can refer either to freedom or to price .
When we speak of “ free software ” , we 're talking about freedom , not price .
( Think of “ free speech ” , not “ free beer ” . )
Specifically , it means that a user is free to run the program , study and change the program , and redistribute the program with or without changes .
Free programs are sometimes distributed gratis , and sometimes for a substantial price .
Often the same program is available in both ways from different places .
The program is free regardless of the price , because users have freedom in using it .
Nonfree programs are usually sold for a high price , but sometimes a store will give you a copy at no charge .
That does n't make it free software , though .
Price or no price , the program is nonfree because its users are denied freedom .
Since free software is not a matter of price , a low price does n't make the software free , or even closer to free .
So if you are redistributing copies of free software , you might as well charge a substantial fee and make some money .
Redistributing free software is a good and legitimate activity ; if you do it , you might as well make a profit from it .
Free software is a community project , and everyone who depends on it ought to look for ways to contribute to building the community .
For a distributor , the way to do this is to give a part of the profit to free software development projects or to the Free Software Foundation .
This way you can advance the world of free software .
Distributing free software is an opportunity to raise funds for development .
Do n't waste it !
In order to contribute funds , you need to have some extra .
If you charge too low a fee , you wo n't have anything to spare to support development .
Will a higher distribution price hurt some users ?
People sometimes worry that a high distribution fee will put free software out of range for users who do n't have a lot of money .
With proprietary software , a high price does exactly that — but free software is different .
The difference is that free software naturally tends to spread around , and there are many ways to get it .
Software hoarders try their damnedest to stop you from running a proprietary program without paying the standard price .
If this price is high , that does make it hard for some users to use the program .
With free software , users do n't have to pay the distribution fee in order to use the software .
They can copy the program from a friend who has a copy , or with the help of a friend who has network access .
Or several users can join together , split the price of one CD - ROM , then each in turn can install the software .
A high CD - ROM price is not a major obstacle when the software is free .
Will a higher distribution price discourage use of free software ?
Another common concern is for the popularity of free software .
People think that a high price for distribution would reduce the number of users , or that a low price is likely to encourage users .
This is true for proprietary software — but free software is different .
With so many ways to get copies , the price of distribution service has less effect on popularity .
In the long run , how many people use free software is determined mainly by how much free software can do , and how easy it is to use .
Many users do not make freedom their priority ; they may continue to use proprietary software if free software can't do all the jobs they want done .
Thus , if we want to increase the number of users in the long run , we should above all develop more free software .
The most direct way to do this is by writing needed free software or manuals yourself .
But if you do distribution rather than writing , the best way you can help is by raising funds for others to write them .
The term “ selling software ” can be confusing too
Strictly speaking , “ selling ” means trading goods for money .
Selling a copy of a free program is legitimate , and we encourage it .
However , when people think of “ selling software ” , they usually imagine doing it the way most companies do it : making the software proprietary rather than free .
So unless you 're going to draw distinctions carefully , the way this article does , we suggest it is better to avoid using the term “ selling software ” and choose some other wording instead .
For example , you could say “ distributing free software for a fee ” — that is unambiguous .
High or low fees , and the GNU GPL
Except for one special situation , the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL ) has no requirements about how much you can charge for distributing a copy of free software .
You can charge nothing , a penny , a dollar , or a billion dollars .
It 's up to you , and the marketplace , so do n't complain to us if nobody wants to pay a billion dollars for a copy .
The one exception is in the case where binaries are distributed without the corresponding complete source code .
Those who do this are required by the GNU GPL to provide source code on subsequent request .
Without a limit on the fee for the source code , they would be able set a fee too large for anyone to pay — such as a billion dollars — and thus pretend to release source code while in truth concealing it .
So in this case we have to limit the fee for source in order to ensure the user 's freedom .
In ordinary situations , however , there is no such justification for limiting distribution fees , so we do not limit them .
Sometimes companies whose activities cross the line stated in the GNU GPL plead for permission , saying that they “ wo n't charge money for the GNU software ” or such like .
That wo n't get them anywhere with us .
Free software is about freedom , and enforcing the GPL is defending freedom .
When we defend users ' freedom , we are not distracted by side issues such as how much of a distribution fee is charged .
Freedom is the issue , the whole issue , and the only issue .

How Casimir forces are shaping up
Steve K. Lamoreaux Department of Physics , Yale University , New Haven , CT 06520-8120 .
Modification of electromagnetic zero - point fluctuations by closely spaced conductors causes an interaction between them called the Casimir force .
New experiments with nanostructured silicon substrates show that the geometry of the conducting surfaces has a large effect on this force .

The last great fundamental discovery in quantum mechanics was made in 1948 by Hendrik B. G. Casimir [ 1 ] .
This discovery , the so - called Casimir effect , is the theoretical prediction that two closely spaced plane - parallel mirrors will be mutually attracted due to the modification of the electromagnetic mode structure between the mirrors .
This attractive force comes about from the zero - point energy associated with the modes ; the total energy decreases as the plates are brought together .
As this force is due to zero - point energy , the force persists even at absolute zero temperature .
This effect has been experimentally demonstrated many times , and the fundamental theory appears sound , at least for the simple systems that have been studied .
Now , in a paper published in Physical Review Letters [ 2 ] , Chan et al. at the University of Florida and Bell Laboratories , go beyond plane parallel surfaces and show how more complex surface geometry can influence the Casimir effect .
This may bear directly on the extent to which Casimir forces contribute to the behavior of micro- and nanomechanical systems .
The original discovery of the Casimir effect is more fundamental than one might expect :
Every quantum field has a zero - point energy , so any system that has accessible states governed by external boundary conditions will have a Casimir - like contribution to its energy .
For example , there is a Casimir - like contribution to the energy of quarks bound in a nucleus as a described in the bag model due to boundary that is introduced in this model .
These effects and others are well described in the book by Milton [ 3 ] .
Casimir himself attempted to apply his namesake force to one of the simplest of the elementary particles , the electron .
Casimir modeled the electron as a conducting ball of uniform charge that would contract due to the zero - point energy of the external electromagnetic modes .
This contractive force would be balanced by the space - charge repulsion of the uniform charge density , when the conducting sphere of constant total charge was just the right diameter .
The fine structure constant α ≈ 1 / 137 , which relates to the electron diameter , could then be determined from fundamental parameters along with a calculation of how the electromagnetic mode zero - point energy changes as the sphere contracts [ 4 ] .
So compelling was this possibility of determining the fine structure constant that Boyer did the calculation of the spherical mode problem [ 5 ] .
He found that the Casimir force , or stress , due to the conducting sphere modes , causes the sphere to expand .
Thus Casimir ’s lovely model fails .
Boyer ’s result was interesting enough that it led to the exploration of the effects of geometry on the Casimir force .
It has been shown , for example , that for rectangular bodies , the sign and magnitude of the stress depends on the aspect ratio of the rectangle .
Until now , no significant or nontrivial corrections to the Casimir force due to boundary conditions have been observed experimentally .
The form of boundary deformations so far considered , together with the accuracy and precision of experimental studies , have been adequately theoretically described by straightforward geometrical averaging .
For the systems that had previously been considered , it is not clear that an experimental measurement of the external stress is even possible .
Cutting a sphere in half clearly changes the boundary value problem ; it is unlikely that the two halves of such a sliced sphere will be repelled with a force that is given by the external stress on the unsliced sphere .
However , there are other possible ways to generate a geometrical influence on the Casimir force .
A conceptually straightforward way is to contour the surfaces of the plates at a length scale comparable to the mode wavelengths that contribute most to the net Casimir force .
For a plate separation z , the wavelengths that contribute most are ≈ π z .
This means that a surface nanopatterned at 400 nm level should show significant geometrical effects for separations below 1 µm .
Indeed , the work of Chan et al. has produced a convincing measurement of a nontrivial geometrical influence on the Casimir force [ 2 ] .
These measurements , between a nanostructured silicon surface ( upper left panel of Fig. 1 ) and a gold sphere , were made using a micromechanical torsional oscillator ( upper right panel of Fig. 1 ) .
The change in resonant frequency of the oscillator , as a function of separation between the sphere and the surface , provided a measure of the gradient of the Casimir force .
The gold sphere , actually a glass sphere of radius 50 µm coated with 400 nm of gold , was attached to one side of the oscillator that comprised a 3.5 µm thick , 500 µm square silicon plate suspended by two tiny torsion rods .
The sphere–oscillator assembly was moved toward the nanostructured surface by use of a piezoelectric actuator .
Two different nanostructured plates , compared with a smooth plate , were measured in this work .
The geometry of the nanostructures — rectangular trenches etched in the surface of highly p-doped silicon — were chosen because the effects are expected to be large in such a geometry .
Previously , Büscher and Emig had calculated the effective modification of the Casimir force due to such a geometry , but for the case of perfect conductors [ 6 ] .
Even though the calculations were not for real materials , these theoretical results appeared as a reasonable starting point for a comparison with an experiment .
Casimir ’s calculation addressed perfectly conducting plates .
The theory of the force was subsequently generalized by Lifshitz to real materials at finite temperature in his seminal 1956 paper [ 7 ] .
Although much progress has recently been made toward a realistic and believable accuracy and precision with which the Casimir force can be calculated for real materials [ 8 ] , problems associated with the well - known experimental variability of sputtered or evaporated films were avoided in the work of Chan et al.
by comparing two different nanostructured plates with a smooth plate , all made from the same silicon substrate , and all using the same gold - sphere–oscillatory assembly .
The geometric modification of the Casimir force was detected by measuring a deviation from that expected by use of the so - called proximity force approximation ( PFA ) , or the pairwise additive approximation ( PAA ) .
Briefly , the PFA was introduced in relation to the Casimir force by Derjaguin in 1957 [ 9 ] to describe the force between curved surfaces , and this approximation is known to be extremely accurate when the curvature is much less than the separation between the surfaces .
Indeed , the use of a sphere and a flat plate vastly simplifies the experiment because the system is fully mechanically defined in terms of the point of closest approach and the radius of curvature of the sphere .
For two flat plates the system is specified by two tilt angles , the areas , long - scale smoothness , and a separation , which all need to be defined , measured , and controlled — a daunting problem , particularly when small deviations of the force are being measured .
The success of the PFA is so good that it suggests a means of detecting a geometrical effect .
Basically , the surface is divided into infinitesimal units , and it is assumed that the total force can be determined by adding the Casimir force , appropriately scaled by area , between surface unit pairs in opposite surfaces ; this is the PAA .
Thus , for the nanostructured surfaces used by Chan et al. , roughly a 50 % reduction in force would be expected by the PAA , because the very deep trenches ( depth t = 2 a ≈ 1 μ m ) , etched as a regular array , were designed to etch away about half of the surface , and this fraction was carefully measured .
As mentioned , two different trench spacings , λ , were fabricated and measured , such that λ / a = 1 . 87 ( sample A ) and 0.82 ( sample B ) , and were compared to a smooth surface .
The Casimir force between the gold sphere and the smooth plate , as calculated from the tabulated properties of gold and silicon , taking into account the conductivity due to the doping , agree with the experimental results to about 10 % accuracy .
For sample A , the force is 10 % larger than expected by the PAA , as evaluated by use of the measured smooth - surface force , and for sample B , it is 20 % larger , in the range 150 < z < 250 nm .
The deviation increases as λ / a decreases , as expected .
The theory of Büscher and Emig predicts deviations from the PAA twice as large as were observed .
Nonetheless , the results of Chan et al. indicate a clear effect of geometry on the Casimir force in the clear deviation from the PAA .
This deviation was detectable through the experimental trick of comparing different aspect ratio trenches to a smooth surface in otherwise identical materials .
So even though ab initio calculation of the Casimir force for a real material using tabulated optical properties cannot be accurate to better than 10 % , this problem was simply circumvented by the comparison technique .
Much theoretical work remains to be done toward gaining a complete understanding of the experimental observations .
The already difficult calculations are made more so by the finite conductivity effects of the plates , and the real smoothed shape of the trenches as opposed to ideal sharp features .
However , the creativity of theorists on this subject appears limitless , as does the numerical computing power offered by even a modest cluster of computers for problems of this type .
We can expect that in the near future the discrepancy between theory and experiment will be resolved ; the excitement of further efforts lie in the possibility that our understanding of the Casimir force is incomplete in a significant way .
About the Author Steve K. Lamoreaux received his Ph.D. in atomic physics from the University of Washington in 1986 , where he worked until 1996 at which time he moved to Los Alamos National Laboratory .
In 2006 , he assumed a faculty position in the Department of Physics at Yale .
While at the University of Washington , he performed a high precision Casimir force experiment , the result of a series of undergraduate research projects , using a torsion pendulum .
The charges against Mr. Delayo include third - degree bribe - receiving and first - degree tampering with public records , both felonies for which he could face up to seven years in prison .
Among the charges was the accusation that he had provided a copy of the crane operator ’s exam to a crane company , for which an official involved in the case said Mr. Delayo was paid about $ 3,000 .
The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing , said Mr. Delayo also provided the answers .
As the chief inspector , Mr. Delayo had responsibility for overseeing the inspection of all cranes , including tower cranes , the type that collapsed in the two recent fatal accidents .
The allegations against Mr. Delayo made it easy on Friday for him to be seen as a symbol for the failures that have plagued the Buildings Department for years .
In fact , as he made his way to a cab after court , he was accosted by a street sweeper who dropped his broom and demanded to know if he felt responsible for the crane collapse .
He did not answer .
Mr. Delayo , whose Legal Aid lawyer said little that could be heard during the arraignment , entered no plea during the proceeding before Judge Abraham Clott of Criminal Court .
Mr. Delayo , appearing slightly hunched and wearing a white shirt with thin blue and brown stripes , held his pants up , apparently because he had no belt on .
Later , as he left the building housing Mr. Morgenthau ’s office , he wore a red bandanna as a makeshift belt .
Mayor Bloomberg , in a statement , said that he has “ zero tolerance ” for corruption anywhere in his administration , and that such conduct is “ is all the more deplorable ” in a public safety agency like the Buildings Department .
“ The Department of Buildings has made enormous strides in rooting out corruption over the past six years , but this case underscores that there remains more work to do , ” he said
Mr. Bloomberg , along with the City Council , on Wednesday announced a legislative package aimed at broadening oversight at building sites .
But on Friday , the Manhattan borough president , Scott Stringer , who had said that the measures proposed by the mayor and the Council did not go far enough , called Mr. Delayo ’s arrest “ stunning and frightening . ”
“ The man in charge of issuing city licenses to crane operators has been accused of years of taking bribes to license cranes he did not inspect , and to license operators who did not pass a required test , ” Mr. Stringer said in a statement .
“ Under the circumstances , before we begin any new procedures to implement the administration ’s construction reforms , we must have a top - to - bottom review of the Buildings Department , its procedures and its personnel . ”
Obama on Israel : Both sides should ' look in the mirror '
Obama suggested back in February that he would be pro-Israel without hewing to the Likud hard line , but more recently has expressed more generic backing for Israel .
In Amman today , though , he suggested again that the fault in the region is not the Palestinians ' alone , something you 'll rarely hear from Republicans .
" It ’s difficult for either side to make the bold move that would bring about peace , " he said , noting ( generously ) that the weak , scandal - tarred , deeply unpopular Israeli government is " unsettled , " while the Palestinians are " divided . "
" There ’s a tendency for each side to focus on the faults of the other rather than look in the mirror , " he said .
Obama condemned today 's attack in Jerusalem , but he also cast it in tactical terms : " That ’s why terrorism is so counterproductive as well as being immoral , " he said .
Attacks make " the Israelis simply want to dig in and think about their security … the same would be true of any people when these kinds of things happened . "
And he stressed the role the desperate Palestinian economic situation plays in continuing the conflict .
" What I think can change is the ability of a United States government and a United States president to be actively engaged in the peace process , " part of which is to " recognize the legitimate difficulties that the Palestinian people are experiencing right now , " something he said would be " also in the interest of the Israeli people . "
These are differences of nuance , not dramatic ones ; its also easy to overstate the degree to which American Jewish voters -- who , as Sam Stein catches , much prefer Obama to Joe Lieberman -- will vote a pro-Israel hard line .
Earvin “ Magic ” Johnson announced his arrival as a businessman 13 years ago , when he took part in an unusual meeting with gang leaders from the Bloods and the Crips .
At the time , Johnson was building a movie theater in Baldwin Hills .
Would the gang members , Johnson asked , be kind enough not to shoot it up ?
“ I just laid it out to them that I ’m building this theater for the community , ” Johnson , the former Lakers basketball standout , recalled from his seventh - floor office in Beverly Hills .
“ You ca n’t have anything happen at this theater because we ’re going to hire your cousins , your mothers , your sons and daughters .
You come in here and shoot up the place , it might be your own relatives inside . ”
The theater stands peacefully to this day , largely untouched by violence .
And these days , Johnson meets with corporate CEOs , institutional investors and elected officials nationwide who want a piece of his growing collection of businesses and properties in 21 states .

The orchestrator of the Lakers ’ highflying “ Showtime ” teams in the 1980s , which netted five NBA championships , has crafted a second career by investing his time and , in many cases , other people ’s money in long - ignored urban neighborhoods through his Canyon - Johnson Urban Fund .
Canyon - Johnson , formed in 1998 , has financed 31 real estate developments in 13 states and Washington .
It launched its third and biggest investment fund in April -- and in a matter of weeks drew $ 1 billion from pension funds and others with deep pockets .
What ’s more , the money came in at a time when investments in commercial projects had fallen off dramatically because of the credit crunch and the downturn in real estate values .
Johnson has other ventures cooking as well .
In March , he signed a multiyear marketing deal to help electronics retailer Best Buy Co. bolster sales in urban neighborhoods .

His Beverly Hills - based Magic Johnson Enterprises now has AMC Magic Johnson Theatres in four cities , 116 Starbucks in 14 states and Washington , 31 Burger King restaurants in the Southeast , and 13 24 - Hour Fitness / Magic Johnson Sport health clubs .
He also owns a nearly 5 % share of the Lakers .
Johnson consistently has declined to release financial data for his privately held businesses or himself .
But a business associate , who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak by Johnson , estimated the value of the former NBA star ’s various holdings at $ 700 million .
This associate estimated Johnson ’s personal net worth at nearly $ 500 million .
Many star athletes lend their names to bars or car dealerships and say they ’re in business .
Johnson was n’t content with that .
Instead , he parlayed his fame into a groundbreaking role in urban development .

“ His role was quite revolutionary , ” said Chicago - based real estate investor Quintin Primo , who occasionally competes against Johnson for deals .
“ And you still ca n’t say that urban investment is commonplace today .
His involvement still speaks to the vision Magic Johnson has had . ”
Johnson was a well - known retired athlete in 1995 , when he approached the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , or CalPERS , about a pioneering investment in black , Latino and other urban neighborhoods .
But when the former Laker spoke before the CalPERS board , “ he said , ‘ I ’m almost as nervous as I would be shooting a free throw at a championship game , ’ ” said former CalPERS executive Robert Aguallo Jr. , who now manages the Los Angeles City Employees Retirement System , which invested in the second Canyon - Johnson fund .
“ At the time , there really were n’t many developers going into urban areas . ”
Johnson , 48 , began to shape his business career while commuting to and from Laker games .
He was drawn to the tired Santa Barbara Plaza shopping center in the Crenshaw district .

Though attempts to close deals on the property failed , Johnson saw the potential for profiting from urban redevelopment , a strategy that formed the foundation for subsequent transactions .
His post - basketball career began earlier than expected , after he was diagnosed with HIV in 1991 .
( Johnson said he remains healthy , the virus all but dormant inside him . )
Initially he was frustrated , though , because a string of potential business partners turned down his overtures .
“ A lot of them wanted my autograph and a picture with me , ” Johnson said .
“ But they did n’t want to invest with me .
“ People said , ‘ If you believe in urban America so much , why do n’t you invest your money and prove it ? ’ ”

Johnson did just that in 1995 , taking an equity stake along with what was then the Loews chain in the 12 - screen movie theater in Baldwin Hills .
Three years later , he opened a Starbucks coffee shop in South L.A. and remains the Seattle - based coffee company ’s only joint - venture partner .
--
What people want
He raised eyebrows , but usually was proved right , with ideas such as restocking theater refreshment stands in predominantly black areas with sweeter drinks , spicier hot dogs and Buffalo wings .
Advertisement
He followed the same strategy at many of his Starbucks , changing the music to R&B ; tracks and offering sweet potato pie in addition to scones , he said .
Longtime Johnson business agent Lon Rosen , who is at William Morris Agency , recalled occasions when he second - guessed Johnson ’s untested strategies .
“ He ’d say , ‘ I know my community , Lon. Remember , I happen to be black , ’ ” Rosen said .
Johnson since has struck equity and licensing deals with such diverse partners as Burger King , Royal Caribbean International , food services firm Sodexho and health insurer Aetna .
Johnson also joined forces with L.A. billionaire Ron Burkle on a fund focused on urban markets .
Advertisement
“ Now companies are reaching out to us , saying , ‘ Hey , we want to go into urban America but we do n’t know how to do it , so we need to be with you because you ’re trusted .
You have the blueprint , you can teach us what we should do and should n’t do , ’ ” Johnson said .
Johnson ’s urban investments are run through an alliance with Robert “ Bobby ” Turner , a managing partner of Canyon Capital .
The Century City investment firm manages about $ 20 billion worth of assets .
The first Canyon - Johnson Urban Fund struggled for two years to raise $ 300 million to invest in urban neighborhoods .
A subsequent fund raised $ 600 million in a matter of months and the third iteration was oversubscribed in a matter of weeks , Turner said .
The funds have helped finance affordable housing and retail space in such locales as Los Angeles , Atlanta , Brooklyn , Houston and San Diego .

Canyon - Johnson has had its share of high - profile deals in Los Angeles .
The fund was involved in the $ 100 - million purchase of the 32 - story former Transamerica Center complex downtown that subsequently was renovated and sold for $ 205 million .
Canyon - Johnson also had a stake in Sunset + Vine in Hollywood , which was built for $ 125 million and sold for $ 160 million .
On occasion , though , Johnson has shot the business equivalent of an air ball .
In 1992 , he opened a short - lived sporting goods store in Baldwin Hills .
Rather than listening to younger consumers , Johnson said , “ I lost $ 200,000 because I was messing around and buying everything an old man liked . ”

The man who enthralled high - paying , high - profile Lakers audiences for years was lured -- and burned -- by the bright lights of Hollywood .
The “ Magic Hour ” late - night talk show lasted only two months in 1998 .
A film production company , a talent management firm and a record label were also short - lived .
A few underperforming Starbucks stores were closed , along with two of the original six AMC Magic Johnson Theatres .
But Johnson still warms to the challenge when the odds seemingly are against him , as they were with the original movie complex .
--
Looking ahead
Advertisement
Today , Johnson concedes that the roiled credit markets are forcing Canyon - Johnson to alter its investment strategy .
Johnson plans to focus on somewhat smaller markets where development costs are lower than in major cities .
“ The Carolinas are going to be the place where people are moving now , ” he said .
“ No. 1 , you get more for your money .
It ’s affordable .
We saw where the trend is going , so that ’s where we ’re going to go . ”
The Lansing native attended Michigan State University but credited his business schooling to avid Laker fans such as John Argue ( a local lawyer who spearheaded L.A. 's drive to host the 1984 Olympics ) , Creative Artists Agency co-founder Michael Ovitz and longtime music industry executive Joe Smith .
Johnson ’s hands - on management style was evident when , as a Laker , he bought into a Washington , D.C. - area Pepsi-Cola distributor .
During the off - season , he occasionally rose at 4 a .m. to accompany soft - drink truck drivers on their routes so he could chat up store managers about better product placement .
Advertisement
It was a foundation for his present - day business acumen .
“ The reason my brand is trusted and followed is because I ’m personally involved , ” Johnson said .
“ People from the outside do n’t know that I ’m in here every day .
I get my hands dirty every day .
I do n’t send any of my people .
I go myself .
My name is on that door . ”
Johnson gradually has been turning over decision - making power to his son , Andre , whose first job in the family business was movie usher .
Andre , 27 , works directly with Turner at Canyon - Johnson Urban Funds and manages business development for Magic Johnson Enterprises .
For now , the business remains firmly in Johnson ’s grip .
“ What I ’m trying to do [ is ] leave a legacy for . . . minority people , ” Johnson said .
“ I ’ve always considered myself more than just a basketball player . ”

4 Out of 12 Ballot Selections Printed Out Incorrectly , Myriad Other Laws Violated
ES&S InkaVOTE Plus System Fails Miserably , Mars What Should Have Been a Simple Voting Experience During L.A. County 's Very Low Turnout State Primary Election ...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/4/2008 , 8:04 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman , The BRAD BLOG
As a fairly well - known Election Integrity journalist who has personally covered , for years , the myriad election woes of thousands ( if not millions ) of voters around the country who have tried to bring seemingly endless stories of votes flipped on e-voting systems to the attention of officials , these stories always continue to be remarkable to me , even if not to many others in the rest of the mainstream media .
It 's even more troubling when one realizes that so little ever seems to be done in light of so many of these horror stories , as those very same failed systems are still deployed across the nation , with little or no modification to correct the mountains of documented problems even now , as we head towards an election likely to be of historic proportions this November .
What follows is yet another one of those stories , where a voter had vote selections flipped by the electronic voting system , such that candidates were chosen other than the ones intended to be selected by the voter , though no fault of his own .
But this time , the voter is me .
Though I 've covered so many of these stories , it was nonetheless remarkable to see it happen before ones very eyes , as occurred yesterday when I voted here in Los Angeles during our very low turnout California state Primary election .
The ES&S electronic voting system that I used to try to vote on yesterday , ended up flipping a total of 4 out of the 12 contests and initiatives for which I had attempted to vote .
Right before my very eyes , the computer - printed ballot produced by the voting system I was using , incorrectly filled in bubbles for four of the races I was voting in .
Had I not been incredibly careful , after the ballot was printed out , to painstakingly compare what was printed to what I actually voted for , I 'd have never known my votes were being given to candidates I did not vote for .
Had I been a blind voter --- as the system I was using is largely intended for use by the disabled --- I would have cast my ballot without having a clue that a full 40 % of the votes I 'd tried to cast for various California Superior Court judges were flipped to other candidates ...
After speaking late last night about the problem to Dean Logan , the current acting Registrar - Recorder for Los Angeles County ( the country 's largest voting jurisdiction ) and officials from the CA Sec. of State 's office , I can report the failed e-voting machine in question is now being quarantined for testing to try and determine what happened in this , just the latest in a mounting string of failures by voting systems made by ES&S , the country 's largest supplier of voting equipment .
While the machine is being sequestered for examination --- and one wonders if the same swift action would have been promised to someone not as well known to both the Registrar 's and Sec. of State 's office --- we 'll call that point the " good news " for the moment .
In addition to the stunning error-rate of the failed ES&S InkaVote Plus voting machine I had tried to use , my day at the polls yesterday additionally revealed an amazing number of apparent violations of federal law , the California state Election Code , and a number of local , Los Angeles County provisions .
Yesterday 's election was the final one this year , prior to the very same election equipment being scheduled for use this November as we barrel towards what will undoubtedly be an unprecedented turnout for the General Election .
Here 's what happened to me and my ballot , and what I witnessed yesterday at the polls ...
TROUBLE FROM THE START
Given last February 's now - infamous Super Tuesday " Double Bubble " ballot debacle when the knowingly - bad ballot design of former L.A. County Registrar Conny McCormack ( who quit just a month prior to the election ) resulted in some 50,000 uncounted paper ballots on the ES&S InkaVote system , reports of trouble , so far , from the polls out here yesterday have been few .
No doubt , that comes as good news to McCormack 's hand - picked successor , acting Registrar Logan , who had initially balked at counting those perfectly - countable , but uncounted " Double Bubble " ballots from the Democratic Primary election earlier this year .
Eventually , he counted most of those ballots , while choosing to leave some 12,000 or more voters disenfranchised in that race , despite the vast majority of those ultimately - uncounted ballots being perfectly - countable , as we reported in great detail at the time .
His early response , so far , to the problem I had yesterday , has been decidedly much better , as he called me back within five minutes of my having called his office last night at around 9:30 pm while they were still tallying returns after the 8 pm poll close .
Hopefully that follow through will continue so that we can determine definitively what went wrong when I voted yesterday .
The problem at my polling place was immediately apparent when I arrived to vote late in the day , only to find that , once again , the ES&S InkaVote Plus voting system for my precinct was down when I arrived .
My polling place features two different precincts combined into a single room , each " precinct " being run at a separate table .
Last February , the InkaVote Plus system was also " out of order " when I went to vote , and the pollworkers there were all afraid to touch it for fear of being electrocuted due to exposed wires hanging out of it .
I 'd planned to write that matter up for The BRAD BLOG back then , until my attention was drawn to the astounding " Double Bubble " fiasco .
The InkaVote Plus voting system --- which is an assistive audio device , meant to meet the federal Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) requirements to allow disabled voters to vote " in a private and independent manner " --- was broken yet again this time at my " precinct " .
Additionally , the optical - scanner , used with the InkaVote 's regular , hand - marked paper ballots used by most voters , was also down , as it had been the entire day .
Poll workers told me they had called the county , but as also happened last February , and even though turnout yesterday was far lower , nobody came out to service or replace the system the entire day .
Fortunately , the InkaVote system is a paper - based system , so voters can vote whether the scanner is up and working or not .
Though they wo n't receive warnings about overvotes and such , at least they can cast a ballot on such systems , and hope that they later will be counted ( and perhaps even accurately , but who really knows ? ) at the county election headquarters after the polls close .
The InkaVote Plus part of the system allows disabled voters ( well , actually , only blind voters , read on ) to make their selections and move through the ballot with buttons , as they listen to the ballot read to them via headphones .
At the end of the process , a paper ballot is printed out with the voters ' selections --- theoretically , the actual ones they voted for --- and that ballot is then run through the InkaVote 's optical scanner and counted by the same means as the regular , hand - marked paper ballots used by everyone else .
Fortunately again --- given that the assistive device for my " precinct " had n't worked the entire day --- as in February , there was not a single voter who asked to use either it , or the one that was ( theoretically ) working in the other " precinct " located inside the same polling place room .
HAVA allocated 4.8 billion federal tax dollars to encourage the " upgrading " of polling places , usually with electronic voting systems , in large part under the claim that disabled voters required such electronic devices to vote " in a private and independent manner " under the new law .
And yet , in two elections in a row , not a single voter had used either of the two devices at my large , metropolitan polling place .
As it turns out , given my experience in trying to use it , that 's a very good thing .
Logan would tell me later that night , when I called him to tell him what had gone so terribly wrong , that while he did n't have definitive numbers at - hand , " the number of voters who used [ the ' accessible ' voting devices ] last February , was very low . "
I had told the poll workers that I wanted to try to vote on the InkaVote Plus device in order to learn how --- and if --- it worked .
At first they thought I was kidding , but when they learned I was n't , most of them became interested in helping me to do so , since they had never seen it in action .
As it was the end of the day , and there were very few other voters who came in while I was there , most of the poll workers , including a very helpful precinct captain , oversaw the process as I tried to make it work .
Because my own " precinct 's " InkaVote Plus was down , I was told , I 'd have to vote on a provisional ballot at the other " precinct " across the room , if I wanted to vote on the assistive device .
So I did .
ALL HANDS ON DECK
I filled out the information on the provisional ballot envelope and they sat me down to vote on the assistive device .
After five minutes , or so , of several workers trying to figure out how to tell the system that it should begin my audio ballot , I was finally off and " voting " .
Though it was a laborious process to listen to the entire ballot as it was read , trying to use it to create my ballot was generally easy enough for a fairly technically proficient guy like myself , even if it took about 20 minutes before finally finishing the rather short ballot , on which I had even skipped a number of races , before the device finally printed out my selections ( incorrectly ) .
( As a small aside ... Somewhat maddeningly , during the 2 or 3 minute preamble audio explanation of how the system worked , the instructions said I could hit " the up arrow button " to increase the volume " at any time " .
So I did .
That resulted in the entire preamble instructions starting over again from the beginning .
This time , as I listened to the complete instructions , I learned , as the very last instruction during the introduction , that adjusting the volume button would result in the instructions starting over from scratch .
Nice planning , ES&S !
Had there been a bus load of blind folks who showed up to vote at this polling place , I can only imagine the disaster there might have been as the line to vote would have been nearly endless . )
Luckily , unlike other voters who might need to use the device in order to vote " in a private and independent manner " , I have use of my arms .
So I was able to push the buttons on the machine to make my selections and move through the ballot as instructed .
Had I not , I would have had to have asked for help from someone .
While I could have told my helper which buttons to push for me without them easily being able to figure out who or what I was voting for --- they would n't have been able to hear the audio as I heard it on the headphones , and thus , would n't have known which button pushes were selecting which candidates ---
I would not have been able to vote " independently " as HAVA 's Sec. 301 mandates .
When I asked Logan about the fact that , unlike other " accessible " voting devices , the ones we use in the country 's largest voting jurisdiction do not seem to allow such folks to vote as per federal law , he told me that " jurisdictions all over the country are dealing with that , in terms of accessibility . "
" The post -HAVA environment has focused heavily on visual issues , blind voters , " he explained .
" I think it 's widely recognized that the accessible devices out there are not equipped for every possible disability .
I do n't know that there 's a certified accessible machine out there that deals with all of those possibilities . "
But when I told him I understood there were voting devices for the disabled with " sip and puff " capabilities for voters with dexterity and other motor skills limitations , he said it was his understanding that " there are prototypes for those features , but to my knowledge they 're not widely available on voting systems at this time . "
In fact , a number of theoretically - " accessible " voting devices have such features , including the AutoMark , also distributed by ES&S , which are certified for use in California .
It was Logan 's predecessor , McCormack , however , who selected L.A. County 's current " accessible " voting system .
So , for the moment , we 'll not hold the fact that L.A. uses systems that do n't meet the federal standards against him .
John Gideon , of VotersUnite.org ( who is also a frequent Guest Blogger at The BRAD BLOG ) , was surprised to hear that Logan was unaware of the currently available devices .
" Unless Dean Logan slept through the sales speeches from the AutoMark vendors , at conferences held by NASED , NASS , and the Election Center , he certainly knows that the AutoMark system , and others , have binary switches that allow for voters without use of their arms to vote independently , " he told me this afternoon .
Stephen Heller of VelvetRevolution.us , the Election Integrity watchdog coalition that I helped to co-found ( Heller has also been an occasional BRAD BLOG guest contributor ) , pointed more towards this document [ PDF ] at the National Disability Rights Network which notes that " three voting systems on the market --- AccuPoll , AutoMARK , and eSlate machines --- have a dual switch input option .
A dual switch input on a machine allows voters with dexterity disabilities who use technology , like sip and puff , to mark their choices on a ballot independently . "
The eSlate system is made by Hart InterCivic , and used in several California counties .
The AccuPoll is no longer being marketed , Ellen Theisen of VotersUnite told me .
She added that Sequoia also has a " sip and puff " feature on one of its systems , though she wrote that there have reportedly been problems with that portion of their " accessible " e-voting machine .
But back to the errors that I would discover after I finally finished the audio process and my ballot was printed out .
I had brought a " cheat sheet " to the polls with me , that I had printed out before going to vote , which included the candidates and initiatives I 'd intended to vote for .
As I had been forced to vote provisionally , I presume , I was not allowed the option to vote for any of the partisan races , even though it was an Open Primary and I 'd told them I wanted to vote in a specific party 's primary .
I forgot to mention that to Logan to see why I was n't allowed to vote for all of the races on the ballot for that party .
Nonetheless , I was able to vote in the 10 California Superior Court races on the ballot that I had planned to vote for , as well as for the 2 state initiatives that were on the ballot .
Since I was working from my own pre-printed " cheat sheet " , I was careful to select the candidates in the judge contests that I knew I wanted .
Each candidate 's name was repeated back to me correctly by the audio system just after I selected it as my vote .
I was then allowed to choose from " the candidates " I wanted for the two ballot initiatives .
Yes , the audio voice described my " YES " or " NO " options for the initiatives as " candidates " .
Hopefully the others who used the system were not confused by that inaccurate description .
Finally , after nearly twenty minutes had gone by , and the polls were just about to close at 8 pm , I was done .
Given the late hour , and the fact that I had had the option to confirm each " candidate " selection , by name , after I had selected it while moving through the ballot --- each one was read back to me correctly , as I had selected it each time --- I chose not to listen to the entire ballot read back to me in the summary confirmation that was offered to me .
Instead , I simply chose to go ahead , confirm the ballot , and have it printed out so that I could cast it via the optical - scanner .
The machine seemed to print fine --- except that 4 of my 12 ballot selections were printed incorrectly !
ONE BALLOT , FOUR FLIPPED VOTES
Had I been blind , of course , I 'd not have been able to check printed ballot to ensure that it had been printed as per my intent before putting that ballot into the optical - scanner .
It had n't .
My selections on the two ballot initiatives were correctly printed .
But 4 of the 12 candidates selected in the Superior Court races were for candidates that I had n't voted for !
I was able to check the printed - out ballot against the proper bubble numbers for each candidate , as seen in the regular , non -" accessible " voting booklet .
The error rate , of course , would seem to far exceed HAVA 's federal mandatory requirements for accuracy on such e-voting systems , as detailed by Theisen , of VotersUnite.org , in another recent guest blog posted here at The BRAD BLOG .
For the record , these are the CA Superior Court judge races that were marked incorrectly on my ballot by the ES&S InkaVote Plus system ...
Office No. 72 : I chose to vote for Harvey A. Silberman ( bubble # 117 ) , ES&S InkaVote Plus selected Serena Raquel Murillo ( bubble # 118 ) for me instead .
: I chose to vote for Harvey A. Silberman ( ) , ES&S InkaVote Plus selected Serena Raquel Murillo ( ) for me instead .
Office No. 84 : I chose to vote for Lori-Ann C. Jones ( bubble # 135 ) , ES&S InkaVote Plus marked Pat Connolly ( bubble # 132 ) for me instead .
: I chose to vote for Lori-Ann C. Jones ( ) , ES&S InkaVote Plus marked Pat Connolly ( ) for me instead .
Office No. 95 : I chose to vote for Patricia D. Nieto ( bubble # 141 ) , ES&S InkaVote Plus printed my choice as Lance E. Winters ( bubble # 142 ) for me instead .
: I chose to vote for Patricia D. Nieto ( ) , ES&S InkaVote Plus printed my choice as Lance E. Winters ( ) for me instead .
Office No. 125 : I chose to vote for James N. Bianco ( bubble # 159 ) , ES&S InkaVote Plus filled - in Bill Johnson ( bubble # 158 ) for me instead .
I was stunned .
As were the poll workers who were almost all eagerly following my adventure .
I checked , and double - checked against the ballot booklet to make certain I was reading the print out correctly and that the bubbles filled in on the ballot were indeed printed incorrectly in all four of those races .
Though I was able to document much what happened with cell phone video and photographs , I was kicking myself that I had n't videotaped myself voting the entire ballot , and repeated out - loud , for the camera , who I was selecting in each case as I went through it .
No doubt , as usually happens for even non-Election Integrity journalists who encounter such polling place failures , I had little doubt that ES&S --- as is the norm for most of America 's horrible Voting Machine companies --- would try and describe the problem I encountered as " voter error " .
Luckily , since I was the only voter to have tried to vote on the device that day , and since I have the personal " privilege " of knowing both Logan and many of the officials in the Secretary of State 's office , I was able to contact them directly last night to explain what happened , and ask that they immediately quarantine that particular machine for testing .
Logan says that doing so , in any similar situation , is both " helpful " and what he recommends all voters do .
One of the SoS officials emailed me back quickly late last night to say that they had spoken to Logan about the matter immediately , and that they were assured the machine would be isolated and tested .
The official also added that the SoS office would participate in the testing to find out what went wrong .
Logan himself called me back quickly after I initially called him , late on an election night as they were still tallying votes ( this was much appreciated , since he failed to call me back at all during the " Double Bubble " fiasco , a point which I confronted him about when we met face - to - face some weeks afterwards at a state hearing on the matter . )
After I explained what had happened , the acting Registrar promised that he would " immediately get word out so that we can isolate the machine to see what happened . "
I wanted to make sure that nobody from ES&S would have access to that machine between now and the time they were tested to figure out , if possible , what the hell went wrong with it .
" They have no access to that machine , " Logan assured me .
" They have a few support staff on site , " but otherwise " the initial review will not be done with them .
The machine will be isolated .
That will be the protocol , " he assured me .
I asked him to keep me in the loop as to what the procedure would be and when and where the testing would occur , which he promised he would do .
Of course , I 'd like to be present during the testing of the machine ( serial no .
LAC016054 , as I was able to photograph the back of it ) myself , so hopefully Logan will keep his word and follow up appropriately .
" A GOOD CHANCE IT WASN'T JUST THIS MACHINE "
In relating the story to Voters Unite 's Gideon , he noted that it was likely that the problem might have occurred on other machines as well .
" There 's a good chance that it was n't just this machine , " he mentioned this afternoon .
" If those judges were on the state ballot , there 's a good chance that the problem could have occurred on every machine used in the county .
And that points to how well they did pre-election ' Logic and Accuracy ' testing and if they even did it at all . "
Indeed L&A testing , though it 's supposed to occur on each voting machine prior to Election Day , often does n't , as election officials have told me in many instances that they are simply unable to test each and every electronic machine to ensure that it 's working correctly before Election Day , after the ballots have been programmed for it .
Michael Dean wrote a frightening essay several weeks ago for The BRAD BLOG , describing how Ballot Definition Files ( BDF ) , which are created by employees --- sometimes working for the county , sometimes working for the voting machine companies , none of them necessarily voters or even American citizens --- are almost never fully tested properly for accuracy before they are implemented for use in an election .
Of course , the voting machines themselves are not properly tested in almost any jurisdiction either , much less the BDFs that are programmed to be used with them , often with hundreds of differing formats and languages in all .
Needless to say , we do n't yet know what caused my ballot to be printed incorrectly yesterday ( that would be a 100 % error rate for ballots printed on that ES&S InkaVote Plus machine , since I was the only one to have tried to use it ! ) so it 's impossible to know whether the audio BDF was programmed incorrectly , or whether the machine itself simply failed as ES&S ' often do .
Either way , I 'm lucky I was able to verify the ballot for accuracy , since I would n't have been able to had I actually been a blind voter .
Thus , I was able to VOID that provisional ballot , and go back to my actual " precinct " ( the orange table , as opposed to the green one ) and vote on a normal , hand - marked paper ballot .
In an email this afternoon , Logan confirmed that the very same voting equipment " was deployed and used at 4,383 locations throughout Los Angeles County " yesterday .
RIGHT TO A SECRET BALLOT LOST
Since the scanner at my " precinct " was n't working , as described earlier in this article , after voting on my hand - marked InkaVote ballot a poll worker examined it before I was about to place it in the ballot box ( a plastic tub ) .
He wanted to check my ballot to make sure all the dots had been inked in fully , so the votes would be properly read ( in theory ) by an optical - scanner back at County headquarters later that night .
The task of warning of overvotes is supposed to be done by the optical - scanner which had been broken since the polls opened yesterday morning .
While his efforts to ensure the " integrity " of my selections was appreciated , in truth , I had just lost my right to a private ballot in the process of his well - intentioned examination .
But moreover , it also then occurred to me that I would have lost my right to a private ballot had I been able to successfully complete my attempt at using the " accessible " InkaVote Plus device .
My ballot would have been the only ballot printed out by the machine that day , so it would have been a simple matter to tell my votes apart from everyone else 's that were hand - marked and cast on heavy card stock , as opposed to thermal printer paper , at the end of the day when the ballots were removed from the ballot box by the poll workers .
The issue of secrecy with machine printed ballots has been a rather contentious one across the country for some time , as experts have found that the same problem occurs with the paper trails that are printed by Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) voting machines .
In California , after her landmark , first - of - its kind " Top - to - Bottom Review " of all of the state 's electronic voting systems , Sec. of State Debra Bowen decertified most of the state 's DRE systems , other than for one - per- polling - place use as needed , in order to marginally meet HAVA 's accessibility mandate .
When she issued her findings , she initially required that if one person voted on such a machine , poll workers would be required to ensure that several other voters used it as well , so nobody 's right to a private ballot would be violated .
It was then pointed out , following the announcement of that new requirement , that it would be quite difficult , if not wholly illegal , to force voters to vote on a DRE if they did not want to , when others were allowed to vote with a paper ballot .
In my case , since I was voting just before the polls were to close last night , it would have been largely impossible to find several other voters to vote on the same device , in any case .
" I can't say for sure .
I 'd have to look at the documentation , " Logan told me , when I asked if the InkaVote Plus certification documents required more than one voter to vote on the machine , if someone had used it to create a ballot .
" My recollection is that that became a recommendation [ as opposed to a requirement ] that poll workers should try to do that , because there was a lot of discussion of whether poll workers could actually require someone to do that , " Logan said , though he was unable to tell me for sure what the rules on that were , according to the state 's recent certification documents for the InkaVote Plus system .
" I do n't believe that language is in the InkaVote Plus recertifcation document , but I 'll have to check that , " he added .
I checked it for him today .
Though the certification document [ PDF ] reports that " expert reviewers demonstrated that the physical and technological security mechanisms ... for the InkaVote Plus Precinct Ballot Counter Voting System were inadequate to ensure accuracy and integrity of the election results , " and described " serious design flaws " along with myriad " vulnerabilities " and opportunity for malicious " attacks that could potentially be used to modify any of the information stored in the election results database , " it 's rather amazing that SoS Bowen ending up recertifying the system for use at all .
That the system was allowed to be used is perhaps even more amazing , given that ES&S spent months withholding it from review entirely by the Secretary of State 's independent team of testers .
It was finally recertified , at the last minute , just prior to last February 's Super Tuesday Primary , largely when it was too late to move to another system in such a large county .
Nonetheless , no specific mandates ( or recommendations ) are listed in the recert doc requiring ( or recommending ) that more than one voter use the system , if anybody decides to use the " accessible " portion of the system .
It is , however , required that " No poll worker or other person may record the time at which or the order in which voters vote in a polling place . "
That requirement , presumably , is meant in order to make it difficult to track who voted when , so that it becomes more difficult to discover how a specific person had voted .
That my ballot would have been the only one on at the entire precinct printed on thermal paper , however , means that no matter when I voted , it would have been a simple matter to determine who and what I had voted for .
The recertification also required that a number of " Use Procedures " be created by the voting machine vendors and county officials , though I was unable to find those documents at the SoS website , so can't report whether or not such procedures spoke to the particular privacy issue in question on the InkaVote Plus system .
Of course the AutoMark system , the electronic ballot - marking device which does offer the " sip and puff " functionality I mentioned earlier , and does , as I understand it , use a regular card stock paper ballot which might not be easily noticed as different from the others cast , is also marketed and sold in California by ES&S .
Unfortunately , Bowen was recently outraged to discover that the company had secretly and illegally swapped uncertified AutoMark systems in for the certified versions in several counties .
The company now faces millions of dollars in fines from the state and possible decertification .
Again .
Last November , Bowen filed a $ 15 million lawsuit against the company for that unauthorized use of voting hardware which was " never submitted to , or reviewed by , the Secretary of State . "
The suit was filed after a four - month investigation by her office revealed that they had " repeatedly violated state law . "
" ES&S ignored the law over and over and over again , and it got caught " said Bowen , in the press release announcing the suit late last year .
What will or wo n't " get caught " in light of the extraordinary failures found during my own personal attempting at voting on the ES&S InkaVote Plus voting system in Los Angeles , remains to be seen .
UPDATE 6/12/08 : ' Human error ' ( though not mine ) blamed for my votes being flipped , upon initial investigation , according to the County Registrar .

Defense Solutions has proposed teaming with the Russian arms - export agency , Rosoboronexport , for several arms deals , including supplying Mi-17 helicopters to Afghanistan .
Rosoboronexport is blacklisted by the U.S. government for allegedly violating the Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act.
Former congressman Curt Weldon is helping broker deals between Russian and Ukranian weapons suppliers and the Iraqi and Libyan governments as part of his new job with a private American defense consulting firm , Wired.com has learned .
Weldon , who is currently being investigated by the FBI over alleged corruption during his time in office , visited Libya in March to discuss a possible military deal , according to a letter describing the trip from Weldon to Defense Solutions CEO Timothy Ringgold .
In May , Weldon , together with Ringgold and another company representative , traveled to Moscow to discuss working with Russia 's weapons - export agency on arms sales to the Middle East .
Both trips were part of the company 's effort to tap into the growing – and often legally murky – market for selling weapons from former Eastern Bloc countries to the Middle East and Afghanistan .

The Russians want to sell weapons to Iraq directly , but " must go slow on Iraq because of political reasons " and want to work with an " intermediary " like Defense Solutions , CEO Ringgold subsequently wrote to colleagues .
" They have not spoken with any American company that can offer the quid pro quo that we can or that has the connections in Russia that we have , " he boasted .
A few years ago , an American company proposing to sell weapons to Libya might have triggered a congressional hearing .
So , too , would have a proposal to conduct arms deals with Russia , which the United States has accused of selling high - tech weapons to Syria and Iran .
However , U.S. government efforts to rapidly equip countries like Afghanistan and Iraq – which have largely Soviet - origin weapons – have created legal ambiguities and loopholes in export controls that did n't exist in years past and given rise to a new class of arms trade middlemen .
So , even though both Libya and the Russian arms export agency are on official U.S. blacklists , government officials and analysts involved in weapons sales say the rules have become unclear as the push to equip allies in the global war on terror has blazed new but uncertain legal ground .
Eagerly stepping into that virgin territory is Defense Solutions , a Pennsylvania - based company that is carving out a small but lucrative niche in a new international arms bazaar .
The firm boasts as its advisors a number of influential Washington insiders , such as retired General Barry McCaffrey , the former White House drug czar .
Helping the firm make key connections is Curt Weldon , a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania at the center of an FBI investigation into alleged conflicts of interest during his time in office .
Weldon , now a key executive at Defense Solutions , is working with the company to set up these weapons deals .
Defense Solutions has also proposed refurbishing Libya 's BTR - 60 armored personnel carriers , according to a sales proposal seen by Wired.com .
Defense Solutions denies drafting a sales proposal to Libya .
It 's an unusual , if not an entirely unexpected chapter for Weldon , whose time in office included frequent trips to Russia .
As an influential member of the House Armed Services Committee , Weldon pushed for multibillion - dollar defense programs , like ballistic missile defense , and earned a reputation as a foreign policy gadfly , boasting of his contacts with officials in nations labeled by the administration as " rogue states " such as Libya and North Korea .
Weldon 's wild claims about a 9/11 cover - up and his sensationalist book warning of an Iranian terror plot , sometimes earned him official scorn and public ridicule , but it was accusations that he steered contracts to Eastern European businesses linked to his daughter 's lobbying firm that drew the government 's attention .
Weldon was voted out of office in 2006 just weeks after the FBI raided his daughter 's home , and that of one of her associates .
Weldon did not respond to e-mails and phone requests to be interviewed or comment for this article .
But in a 2006 interview , before the FBI probe was public , Weldon spoke enthusiastically about setting up a " front company " to work with the Russian arms agency , Rosoboronexport .
Weldon hoped this company could sell weapons to the Middle East , and other regions , particularly to countries where the U.S. has strained relations .
He claimed the director of Rosoboronexport approached him to work with " an American company that would act as a front for weapons these nations want to buy . "
Weldon called the proposal an " unbelievable offer . "
The administration , he acknowledged at the time , did not welcome the idea of an American company selling Russian weapons to potentially unfriendly countries .
But two years later , Weldon , now a private citizen and chief strategic officer for Defense Solutions , appears to be working on precisely that sort of deal .
And whether illegal or not , Defense Solutions ' business represents a new phenomenon in the international arms trade business .
In years past arms brokers – firms or individuals who serve as middlemen to facilitate weapons sales between countries – were largely the stuff of spy thrillers .
Unlike traditional American defense companies , like Lockheed Martin or Boeing , which typically sell weapons directly to NATO countries or other governments regarded as friendly to the United States , brokers are often small outfits run by people with sometimes questionable experience and reputations that they will sell to anyone .
One of the most infamous arms brokers , a Russian named Viktor Bout , is charged by the United States , United Nations , Interpol and others of funneling arms to terrorists and rebels around the world .
He was recently arrested in Thailand .
The United States is requesting his extradition on charges of supplying arms to a terrorist organization .
Two Marines lower the trim vane on the front of an Iraqi BMP - 1 mechanized infantry combat vehicle that was captured during Operation Desert Storm .
The American defense consulting firm Defense Solutions has proposed refurbishing Libya 's aging fleet of BMP - 1s .
Defense Solutions denies drafting a sales proposal to Libya .
But ironically , Iraq has fueled a new market for these professional middlemen ; the United States is funneling billions of dollars into modernizing Iraq 's army so that the country 's government can fend for itself after coalition troops withdraw .
And Iraq 's largely Soviet - equipped military is a natural market for Eastern European countries brimming with old or out - of - date equipment they would like to unload .
The middlemen , in these cases , serve a key role by allowing the U.S. government to do business with an American company , which in turn buys equipment from Eastern Bloc countries in deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars , much of it financed with U.S. taxpayer dollars .
One of Defense Solutions ' sales – a deal to sell Hungarian - owed T - 72 tanks to Iraq in 2005 – was typical of these new foreign military sales .
But on the more questionable side is the company 's plans to work with Rosoboronexport , which is barred from doing business with the U.S. government , and Libya , which is still on the State Department 's arms embargo list .
The Eastern European - Middle East arms - brokering business , while in some cases sanctioned by the U.S. government , has run into problems , including outright corruption and quality .
Defense contractor Dale Stoffel , the president of Wye Oak Technology , and another American were gunned down in Iraq in December 2004 after Stoffel alleged that the Iraqi Ministry of Defense was involved in a kickback scheme .
Like Defense Solutions , the company Stoffel worked for was refurbishing the Iraq 's army Eastern Bloc equipment .
Another problem is quality .
Weapons from the former Soviet Bloc , which the U.S. military euphemistically calls " nonstandard equipment , " have been flagged as substandard , acknowledges Brigadier General Charles Luckey , who is in charge of security assistance at Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq .
In an interview from Iraq , Brigadier General Luckey said : " One of the frustrating things about buying nonstandard ( weapons ) , is that I 'm the guy who has to deal with the fact that some broker I 've never heard of allowed weapons to get to Iraq before they were inspected . "
Defense Solutions is carving a new niche in the arms trade , selling Soviet - made weapons to Middle Eastern countries like Afghanistan and Iraq .
Defense Solutions sold Hungarian - owed T - 72 tanks to Iraq in 2005 .
In one high - profile case , Iraqi officials alleged that a corrupt firm sold them $ 400 million in shoddy helicopters from Poland .
More recently , a company led by a 21 - year - old and a former masseur was offered a U.S. government contract worth nearly $ 300 million to sell ammunition to Afghanistan .
The ammunition turned out to be outdated and of dubious origin and several people connected with the company have been indicted .
A congressional investigation concluded that the company , which was on a State Department watch list , was able to take advantage of regulatory loopholes by using middlemen .
For those concerned about illicit arms trade , this new wave of weapons deals is rife with the potential for corruption and abuse , but for companies eager to pursue markets once regarded as dubious , it represents a lucrative business opportunity .
The problem in these cases , according to those familiar with arms sales , is that it 's no longer clear what 's legal and what 's not .
Rachel Stohl , an expert on international arms trade and a senior analyst at Center for Defense Information , says that in many ways , the rush to equip Iraq has led the United States to throw caution to the wind .
She points to a report by the Government Accountability Office last year that found that some 190,000 weapons sold to Iraq have gone missing .
" I think the reality is we wo n't know , until way after the fact , about all of these irregularities with the Iraq weapons provision program , " she said .
" We were providing them all these assault rifles that have gone missing .
Why ?
They were not following the standard procedures that were in place . "
But Iraq and Afghanistan are n't the only markets available to arms brokers like Defense Solutions .
The gradual normalization of relations with Libya opens another door into a quasi-legal area of sales .
Like Iraq , Libya has a substantial arsenal of Soviet - origin military weapons , offering a potential market for brokers working with Russia and other former Soviet states .
But even when there 's not an outright ban , sales to the Middle East are often fraught with controversy , particularly to countries like Libya , which was under international sanction for more than a decade .
Even as sanctions against it have been lifted , European companies proposing to sell arms to Libya have faced steep criticism , particularly since the country is still ruled by dictator Muammar Gaddafi , who took power in a military coup in 1969 .
While the United States lifted Libya 's " state sponsor of terrorism " designation in 2006 , other restrictions , such as on the sale of arms , remain in place .
A State Department spokesperson confirmed that exports of " lethal munitions " to Libya , such as tanks or related equipment , are still banned , although sales of nonlethal equipment are now allowed on a case - by - case basis .
In late March , Weldon traveled to Libya for a weeklong trip at the invitation of the Gaddafi Foundation , a group run by the son of Libya 's leader , and the chairman of Libya 's foreign affairs committee , according to the report he sent to Defense Solutions ( .pdf ) , a copy of which was obtained by Wired.com .
The trip reports states : " Agreement reached for Weldon to quickly return to Libya for meetings with son ( of Libyan leader Gaddafi ) Morti regarding defense and security cooperation . "
A document dated April 16 , just two weeks after Weldon 's trip , outlines Defense Solutions ' proposal to Libya to refurbish the country 's fleet of armored vehicles , including its T - 72 tanks , BMP - 1 infantry fighting vehicles , and BTR - 60 armored personnel carriers .
A copy of the sales proposal , also provided to Wired.com , is on Defense Solutions ' letterhead , appears to bear the signature of company CEO Timothy Ringgold , and is addressed to Libya 's defense procurement council .
" Defense Solutions is committed to delivering a full end - to - end solution to its clients , " the proposal states .
" Besides refurbishing these vehicles , we are capable of providing a full logistics support package , including a two year supply of spare parts , maintenance and repair services , and operator , maintenance , and repair training . "
In an interview with Wired.com , Ringgold admitted that he 's interested in doing business in Libya and confirms receiving Weldon 's trip report from Libya , but denies drafting or signing an arms - sale proposal .
" I 've never made such a document to Libya , " Ringgold insisted , after being read the proposal , and told that his signature is on it .
In addition to the Libyan arms - deal document , Wired.com has also reviewed copies of e-mails from Ringgold discussing the Libyan deal .
While Ringgold denies proposing an arms sale to Libya , he is open about speaking with Rosoboronexport , which has been on a U.S. government sanctions list since 2006 , after the Russian state agency allegedly violated the Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act .
An April e-mail provided to Wired.com describes Ringgold , Weldon and Stephan Minikes , a senior advisor to Defense Solutions and a former ambassador , meeting with Rosoboronexport .
The conversations included a number of potential deals , including supplying Mi-17 helicopters to Afghanistan and spare parts for Iraq 's infantry fighting vehicles .
Ringgold wrote to colleagues following the visit , describing the meetings as a " spectacular success , " saying the Russian agency " has the ability to undercut all cost proposals from brokers . "
Ringgold confirmed those discussions and said that his company has sought to do business with Rosoboronexport .
Asked whether Ringgold considers his dealings with Russia to be legal , he argued that U.S. companies could work with Rosoboronexport on a " case - by - case " basis .
" The particular purpose of the meeting we had – and I want to be crystal clear – was in response to a U.S. government requirement , " he said .
A number of officials at the State Department and in the Pentagon , when contacted for this article , could not say whether working with Rosoboronexport is legal or not .
A Pentagon spokeswoman said she was familiar with the issue , but deferred the question to the State Department .
When asked about Rosoboronexport 's status on the blacklist , John Herzberg , a State Department spokesman replied : " What 's on there is on there . "
Asked whether , given the ban , there was any way a company could legally work with Rosoboronexport , as Ringgold suggested , Herzberg provided an equivocal answer .
" At the stage of the process we 're at , I 'm unable to give you an answer , " he said .
" You can try elsewhere in government , and maybe they 'll be braver than me . "
In an interview from Iraq , General Luckey conceded it was a murky area , but said , " My understanding is they are currently on our no - go list . "
The confusion over debarred parties has even led the U.S. government into its own legal tangles , according to Jim McAleese , a Washington attorney who specializes in government contracting and foreign military sales .
Because the Russian government violated U.S. nonproliferation laws , even NASA had to go to Congress to ensure it could work with Russia on Soyuz flights to the international space station .
" What I 'm warning you about is , do n't be surprised by the confusion , " McAleese said .
" There are a whole bunch of different statutes that were adopted piecemeal and were never intended to be reconciled . "
But it 's the very ambiguity of the law that troubles those who monitor export control .
" It 's highly unusual to do anything with the Russians , particularly Rosoboronexport , " said Scott Jones , director of Export Control Programs at the Center for International Trade and Security at the University of Georgia .
Legal or not , reputable American companies simply do n't want to work with banned entities , Jones said , for fear of risking their reputations and business .
" Even if it 's not an outright prohibition , most companies do n't want to put themselves in a liability situation that has really bad PR … and they stay away from it , " Jones said .
" But if that 's your business , pimping out arms from the U.S. or Russia , that 's the way it works , and you push as much as possible . "
Finding any U.S. defense company working with the Russian government at this point would be " remarkable , " Jones added .
In the meantime , the future for Weldon is unclear .
The FBI investigation continues and Weldon 's former chief of staff recently pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and is cooperating with the government , notes Melanie Sloan , the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , which filed a complaint against Weldon in 2004 .
Sloan speculated that Weldon may be charged with " honest service fraud " for misusing his office for personal gain .
" It 's an easier standard than bribery , " she said .
" I would n't be surprised ( if he 's charged ) with bribery , but I think it will be honest services fraud . "
Ringgold insists that he and Weldon are on the right side of the law .
" Everything we do is in strict compliance with international and U.S. law and we operate only in the best interests of the U.S. government , " he said .
" I did n't serve 30 years in the United States Army to throw that away on a whim . "
Asked if Weldon is still working for the company , Ringgold replied : " Absolutely , proudly so . "

We have arrived in Bar Harbor , Maine .
It was an adventure , my niece and brother got lost coming to my house in New Hampshire .
They did not get in until 3:30 AM .
We were on the road for Maine by 8:00 AM the same morning .
Hard vacationers that we all are , as I write this post , they are now riding their bicycles to the top of Cadillac Mountain .
It is 6:00 AM .
We each , in our own unique way , know how to relax .
We were happy that the weather held out yesterday afternoon and evening .
We were able to do a short bike ride , thirteen miles , on the carriage trails .
The rain hit as the band sounded its last note in the evening .
The carriage roads which lace through the mountains and valleys of Acadia National Park are an engineering feet .
Not , perhaps , in the same line as the pyramids of Egypt , but these roads had to be designed to hold up in the wet weather of Maine – not an easy task .
Originally designed by John D. Rockefeller so that he could travel to the interior of Mount Desert Island via horse and carriage , these roads today provide an excellent avenue on which to explore Acadia by auto , horseback , bicycle or on foot .
During the last two to three million years , 20 to 30 ice sheets intermittently covered most of New England .
Eventually , after the ice melted , some deepened valleys became water basins .
These water - filled hollows became Eagle Lake and Echo Lake , in Acadia National Park .
In one instance , the glacier cut a trough that resulted from an ice - sculpting " binge , " so deep that it filled with sea water .
This formed a fjord now called Somes SoundWe will miss you Cheryl as we eat our blueberry pancakes , and later our lobsters and hot dogs up in Bar Harbor Maine .
Some of us suffer for our sport .
Good luck , hope you bring home some gold .
My Sister - in - law is rowing in a regatta in Philadelphia this weekend .
Up until 1957 it was called The People 's Regatta .
Probably , because of the cold war influences and the Socialist ring to the title , the name was changed to The Independence Regatta .
The event is held on the Schuylkill River , the largest tributary in the Delaware River Basin which accounts for about one third of the Delaware 's total flow .
Philadelphia has a rich rowing history .
There are 8 universities and 31 high schools ( with more every year ! ) in the Philadelphia area with rowing programs .
Most row out of clubs on Boathouse Row .
We will miss you Cheryl as we eat our blueberry pancakes , and later our lobsters and hot dogs up in Bar Harbor Maine .

Waldo County , situated in mid-coast Maine along scenic Penobscot Bay , has genuine New England character evidenced by working port towns and quaint rural villages .
Visitors are awed by the area 's unspoiled beauty .
From striking coastal views to sweeping mountain vistas , dramatic natural settings abound .
In addition great care has been taken to preserve and refurbish numerous historic landmarks , homes and buildings .
Consequently , the Maine of yesteryear is still found here .

" Flabbergasted " NASA scientists say that first analysis of Martian soil appeared to contain the requirements to support life .
Scientists working on the Mars Phoenix Lander mission said preliminary analysis by the lander 's instruments on a sample of soil scooped up by its robotic arm had shown it to be much more alkaline than expected .
" We basically have found what appears to be the requirements , the nutrients , to support life whether past present or future , " Sam Kounaves , the lead investigator for the wet chemistry laboratory , told journalists .
" It is the type of soil you would probably have in your back yard , you know , alkaline .
You might be able to grow asparagus in it really well .
...
It is very exciting for us . "
" We were all flabbergasted at the data we got back , " Mr Kounaves said .
The scientists would not go as far as saying they now believe that life , even mere microbes , definitively existed on Mars , saying the results were very preliminary and more analysis was needed .
" There is nothing about the soil that would preclude life .
In fact it seems very friendly .... there is nothing about it that is toxic , " Mr Kounaves said
Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 after a 10 - month journey .

PARENTS always want to share their passions with their children .
Whether you ’re a fan of baseball or the blues , sailing or tinkering with old cars , few things are as rewarding as seeing a spark of receptivity in the eyes of the next generation .
It usually does n’t take .
Most of the time kids  teenagers , anyway  would as soon snicker at their old man ’s obsessions as indulge him .
Even so , I ca n’t help hoping that my sons might share my taste in music and food , books and movies , ball teams and politics .
Why should wine be any different ?
It ’s the alcohol , of course , which makes wine not just tricky but potentially hazardous .
Nonetheless , I would like to teach my sons  16 and 17  that wine is a wonderful part of a meal .
I want to teach them to enjoy it while also drumming it into them that when abused , wine , like any other alcoholic beverage , can be a grave danger .
As they were growing up I occasionally gave them tastes from my glass  an unusual wine , perhaps , or a taste of Champagne on New Year ’s Eve .
They ’ve had sips at Seders and they see wine nightly at our dinner table .
With both boys now in high school , I thought it was time to offer them the option of small tastes at dinner .
We 're not saying sex is something to be ashamed of , and far be it from us to declare any activity between consenting adults to be unnatural or immoral .
It 's just that some types of sex are weird and yes , even terrifying to us .
But , if you 're going to do something that would make a dominatrix flinch , you might as well do it right .
Thus we offer these sex guides that you 'll either find helpful or nightmarish , depending on your personal preferences .

10 The ToyBag Guide to Erotic Knifeplay The Book Says : Continue Reading Below Advertisement
" A shiny blade against smooth soft skin is terrifying , of course , but for many people also highly erotic . "
Reviews Say : " This was an amazing read , and it really got me thinking about lots of new and fun play ideas . "
We Say : We 're assuming that " erotic knifeplay " is like that scene in The Animatrix where the couple slash each other 's clothes off with swords .
We 're thinking this is one of many things that looks like fun in a cartoon , but should probably be avoided in real life .
So on that count , we have mixed feelings about The ToyBag Guide to Erotic Knifeplay .
On one hand , we do n't like the idea of a book legitimizing the whole knife - sex thing .
On the other hand , if you 're going to start practicing a sex act where you whip out both your dong and a razor sharp blade at the same time , you better damned well study up on how to do it right .

9 Sex in the Golden Years The Book Says : " Now that more people are living to be 70 , 80 , 90 and 100 , research shows quite clearly that sex is as important as ever . "
Reviews Say : " Our sex life has truly changed and is now the best we 've ever had - even though we are both in our early seventies ! "
We Say :
The above quote scares the shit out of us .
If the best sex you 've ever had is in your 70s , you may have ruined your life somehow .

Now , understand , being the lovers of freedom and individual rights that we are , we 're not suggesting senior citizens should n't have sex .
We 're just suggesting it never be talked about or acknowledged openly in any way whatsoever because it horrifies us .
Now picture them porking .
Horrifies us like watching Satan kill Santa Claus , then burning down Disneyland while drinking the last beer ever .
But apparently that feeling is n't held by a small , but determined population of internet porn shoppers and the authors of this book who figured people who had most likely been having sex for seven decades now need a guide on how to do it .

On 29 May 2009 , the delegates at the national convention of the Canadian Labour Congress ( CLC ) , representing more than 3 million workers from every region of Canada and Quebec , voted overwhelmingly to demand that the government of Canada immediately end its participation in the illegal war in Afghanistan .
This CLC demand represents a significant consolidation of labour power .
Several national unions , notably the Canadian Union of Postal Workers ( CUPW ) and the Canadian Union of Public Employees ( CUPE ) , had already adopted policies to oppose Canada 's participation in the war in Afghanistan .
However , some powerful unions whose members work in the rapidly expanding Canadian military and development industries could profit from continuing the war .
The women and men of these unions made the difficult decision to stand in solidarity with the working people of Afghanistan rather than act on self - interest .
The Afghan war and the Canadian military
The ongoing war in Afghanistan continues to kill uncounted thousands of Afghan civilians and cause immeasurable suffering due to horrendous injuries , the displacement of people from their homes and livelihoods , home invasions , arbitrary arrests and torture , sexual abuse and the general humiliation of Afghans .
This is an illegal war that cannot be justified by a few extra jobs for Canadian workers .
Since the war in Afghanistan began , Canada has become the sixth largest military exporter in the world , according to data collected by the US Congressional Research Service .
Canada is now behind only the USA , Russia , the UK , Germany and China in export volume .
The US manufactures more than all other military manufacturers combined , so comparing Canada 's military industrial complex to the US mega - industry is ridiculous .
But , Canada trails China – number five on the list – by only a hundred million dollars worth of exports in an industry that brings billions of dollars into Canada .
No one knows exactly how many billions of dollars military exports bring into Canada though .
Why not ?
Because , for the past four years , the Canadian government , citing security concerns , has refused to release much of the data regarding the export of military products to the US – our biggest customer .
Canada 's own military spending has risen considerably .
Since the war began in 2001 , Canada rose from the position of 16th to 13th biggest military spender in the world , and from 7th to 6th within NATO , according to a Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives report .
Canada 's defence budget projects a 37 per cent increase in spending from 2001 to 2010 .
The Canadian Association of Defence and Security Industries ( CADSI ) represents more than 500 companies .
In an interview with a CBC journalist , CADSI president Tim Page claimed his industry represents about 70,000 jobs in over 177 federal ridings [ electorates / electoral constituencies ] .
This may not seem like a large number of workers , but it represents significant political power .
Many of these high - tech jobs are among the best in the country .
However , the workers who build the weapons and everything else needed for warfare , as well as the service workers who make the Canadian state function , recognise that it is the shareholders who profit most from the rising fortunes of the companies in Canada 's military industrial complex .
Corporations such as GM Canada , Bombardier , Bell Helicopter , SNC - Lavalin , CAE Electronics , Pratt & Whitney Canada , Canadian Marconi and Colt Canada are only a few of the Canadian - based military suppliers profiting from the war in Afghanistan .
Canadian development aid in Afghanistan
The Canadian development industry also profits from the war and occupation .
The 1 billion dollars Canada has ``pledged '' to spend on development in Afghanistan , from 2001 to 2011 , pales in comparison to the 7.2 billion dollars already spent on the military mission .
Nonetheless , a billion dollars is a significant sum .
However , most development spending returns to Canada as salaries and expenses .
Manufacturers as well as service providers such as construction contractors and airlines profit significantly from the development industry – while the little development spending that actually does reach Afghanistan benefits few Afghans .

When our research group toured five Afghan provinces in 2007 , we were appalled by the miserable conditions most Afghans must live in .
Even in the safest areas of the country , where there is no excuse for the occupying forces ' failure to reconstruct essential infrastructure , many Afghans do not have even the barest essentials of clean water and adequate sanitation .
In Kabul , where the international forces have occupied the city since 2001 , less than 29 per cent of the people have access to clean drinking water , according to reports by the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit .
Peter McKay , Canada 's minister of defence , frequently claims that more than 6 million Afghan children – one third of them girls – have been enrolled in school .
However , his claim is not substantiated by Afghan researchers .
Girls represent only 3 per cent of students , according to the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission .
The children of poor families cannot afford school ; they must work to survive .
The Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit claims this fact especially inhibits girls from going to school .
When we interviewed people in Afghanistan , their experiences of development sounded very much like what Michael Ignatieff had described in his book Empire Lite in 2003 .
Ignatieff stated : `` The rhetoric about helping Afghanistan stand on its own two feet does not square with the hard interest that each Western government has in financing , not the Afghans , but its own national relief organisations .
... These fly a nation 's flag over some road or school that a politician back home can take credit for .
... the international 's first priority is building their own capacity – increasing their budgets and giving themselves good jobs . ''
Since becoming a politician , Ignatieff no longer talks about these issues , but Afghans see this reality every day .
Commercial exploitation
Despite the fact there is no systemic development of the basic infrastructure necessary for human survival in Afghanistan , massive commercial developments proceed at a rapid pace .
The biggest development to date is the Aynak copper mine just a few kilometres from Kabul .
This rich mine site was auctioned , in late 2007 , to the Chinese metallurgical corporation MCC for a price of more than 3 billion US dollars .
The Aynak deposit is the first of more than 1400 state - owned mineral deposits in Afghanistan slated for privatisation in the near future .
A Soviet geological survey in the 1970s found – and US and British surveys since 2001 have confirmed – massive deposits of almost every kind of mineral wealth exist in Afghanistan , such as gold , iron , uranium and copper , as well as hydrocarbons , especially coal .
Afghanistan is also one of few locations on Earth where the rare element tantalum , also known as coltan , is found .
Tantalum is essential in the manufacture of cell phones and laptop computers .
The largest previously known source is in the Democratic Republic of Congo , where tantalum mining played a part in the most destructive war , in terms of human casualties , since WWII .
Canadian mining giants are competing with US , British , Russian and Chinese companies in a scramble for the rich mineral prizes found in Afghanistan .
Financial predictions for the Afghan mining industry are in the unfathomable hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars .
But , as an article by Antony Benham in the October 2007 issue of Nature notes , it is unlikely much of this wealth will benefit many Afghans .
Development of the transportation and energy infrastructure needed by the mining industry is rapidly proceeding , while ordinary Afghans suffer without the most basic necessities of life .
Some sceptics claim that even the electricity to be transported by a transmission network currently under construction funded by the Asian Development Bank is not likely destined for the millions of Afghans without electricity , but will instead be sucked up by electricity hungry ore - processing plants .
Whether it is here in Canada , in Latin America , in Africa , throughout Asia , as it is now in Afghanistan , the Aboriginal peoples who live on the land are perceived to stand in the way of what we in the so - called developed world call ``development ' ' .
The environmental devastation that can be caused by resource extraction is well known , but this is a fact known better by those people directly affected who rely on their land for their livelihood than by anyone else .
However , the disciplinary power of the modern state is being used to counter any protest , eliminate all resistance , and clear the land of Aboriginal Peoples wherever it is deemed necessary .
The new Afghan theocratic state
The destruction of the Taliban regime by US armed forces in 2001 effectively silenced opposition and effectively re-instituted a theocratic regime .
A theocratic state was first imposed on Afghans in 1992 when the US helped the mujaheddin gain power by financing their war with billions of dollars against the secular Soviet - backed government .
US President Jimmy Carter initially began providing military and other support for the mujaheddin Islamic revolutionaries on 3 July 1979 , which then drew the Soviet military into Afghanistan on 25 December 1979 .
In coming to power , the mujaheddin declared Afghanistan an Islamic republic .
The ouster of the mujaheddin by the Taliban in 1996 brought an even greater degree of social and political repression for Afghans , and intensified the theocratic features of the Afghanistan state , often through brutal means .
Secular Afghans , those of other faiths , and Muslims who believe in a separation of state and religion have been profoundly disenfranchised by the theocratic state that first gained support from the Western powers in the 1990s .
They have remained so by the new theocratic state re-established , under the puppet leadership of President Karzai , by a handful of Western leaders in the Bonn Agreement of 2001 .
The Bonn Agreement was instituted despite a UN Security Council recommendation issued several weeks earlier that urged that ``the new Afghan government should respect the human rights of all Afghan people , regardless of gender , ethnicity or religion ' ' .
The Bonn Agreement accomplished , among others , three objectives with profoundly adverse consequences for many Afghans .
First , it rewarded the mujaheddin warlords for their decades of services to the USA .
Second , it promised the mujaheddin impunity for the many horrendous war crimes they had committed since 1979 , which continue to this day during the US - led occupation .
Third , it re-instituted the theocratic state as a means of social control .
The US State Department reports : `` The government requires all citizens to profess a religious affiliation and assumes all Afghans to be Muslim .
According to Islamic law , conversion from Islam is punishable by death . ''
The US State Department also reports that socialism is illegal in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan , because socialists are atheists .
Afghan political opponents of many progressive stripes must remain underground fearing retribution from both the Taliban insurgents and the ruling mujaheddin regime .
In essence , the only substantive difference between the Taliban and mujaheddin regimes is that one is an intolerant authoritarian theocratic regime bent on resistance to the new world order and the other is an intolerant authoritarian theocratic regime willing and well prepared to profit from engagement with the new world order .
Now that the workers of Canada and Quebec have officially declared our solidarity with Afghan workers , it is time to begin building bridges to join our struggles against the new authoritarianism and theocracy in Afghanistan and Western and Canadian imperialism .

Four Senate Democrats called on EPA chief Stephen Johnson to resign Tuesday , alleging that he gave misleading testimony to Congress and repeatedly bowed to pressure from the White House to avoid regulating greenhouse gases .
California Sen. Barbara Boxer , who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , and three other Democrats on the panel – Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island , Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey – also announced they are urging Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate whether Johnson made false statements to Congress .
Mukasey ’s office said it was still reviewing the request late Tuesday .
The pressure on Johnson is part of an escalating battle between Democrats in Congress and the White House over climate change policy .
Democrats are seizing on new evidence that Johnson overrode the opinions of Environmental Protection Agency scientists and reversed two of his own decisions at the request of the White House .
EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar fired back at Boxer for what he called a political attack .
“ Administrator Johnson ’s record is one of aggressive , health protective environmental standards .
Sen .
Boxer ’s record is one of press conferences and political tirades , ” Shradar said .
Democrats insist that Johnson misled Congress when he testified before Boxer ’s committee Jan. 24 about his decision to reject California ’s effort to set the nation ’s toughest limits on emissions from vehicles .
The EPA chief testified that he listened to all sides before deciding that California had failed to make its case .
“ I made the decision .
It was my decision .
It was the right decision , ” Johnson said at the time .
But last week , a top Johnson aide contradicted his testimony .
Former EPA deputy associate administrator Jason Burnett , who resigned last month in frustration with the administration ’s climate - change stance , testified that Johnson had initially supported granting at least a partial waiver after concluding that California met the legal criteria .
But Burnett said Johnson changed his stance when the White House made clear that President Bush opposed California setting its own fuel economy standards .
“ The administrator knew the president ’s preference for a single ( national ) standard , ” Burnett said .
Klobuchar said the testimony showed that Johnson not only overruled his own staff but also misled the public about who really made the decision .
“ If we ca n’t trust the top EPA official to tell the truth to the American people , then he must go , ” she said .
The lawmakers also allege that Johnson yielded to White House influence in a recent EPA decision over whether climate change endangers human health .
The decision was critical because if the agency had made such a finding , it would have been required to start regulating greenhouse gases .
In December , EPA officials sent an e-mail to the White House stating that Johnson supported the EPA staff ’s view that global warming threatens human health .
“ In sum , the Administrator is proposing to find that elevated levels of [ greenhouse gas ] concentrations may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public welfare , ” the document read .
The White House refused to open the e-mail and later asked EPA officials to retract it .
When Johnson recently announced that EPA was starting a new rule - making process to determine whether climate change poses a health risk , he never mentioned this previous finding .
Boxer said she was frustrated that EPA officials have stonewalled congressional inquiries into those recent decisions .
Johnson refused to testify at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this week about EPA ’s dealings with Congress .
Last week , the White House released the e-mail with EPA ’s draft of the endangerment finding but would not allow senators to make copies .
Lawmakers were allowed to read it only while being watched by two White House lawyers .
Boxer said the final straw was an e-mail sent to EPA staffers last month that directed them not to speak to the press , congressional investigators or to EPA ’s own inspector general , and to forward the inquiries to their superiors .
Boxer said Johnson “ has become a secretive and dangerous ally of polluters , and we cannot stand by and allow more damage to be done . ”
But the White House is standing behind Johnson .
White House spokesman Trey Bohn said Johnson ’s critics are attacking him because they disagree with the administration ’s policies on energy and climate change .
“ In every sense , administrator Johnson has cooperated fully with Congress , and the facts bear that out , ” Bohn said .

The study was reported in the ( PLoS ) , a well - respected , peer - reviewed , online journal of medicine .
Lead has no function in the human body .
Unlike several other minerals that are necessary at low concentrations but poisonous at high ones , lead is always poisonous .
The PLoS study documents this fact quite clearly .
Despite many previous studies that showed strong connections between lead exposure and both crime and brain dysfunction , including ones on animals that were definitive , the naysayers pooh - poohed the data .
Statements like , " Well , humans are n't animals , so nothing has been proven , " or " Low levels of lead are not a problem , " have been common .
It has been assumed that blood levels of lead under 10 micrograms per deciliter ( mcg/dL ) were safe .
The United State 's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has set that figure as acceptable , in spite of the fact that it 's known not to have any meaning .
The figure was selected arbitrarily .
This study clearly documents the falacy of making such an assumption .
About 310,000 American children between ages one and five have lead exposures over 10 mcg / dL in spite of the banning of leaded fuel years ago .
Most exposure is from the paint in houses built before 1978 .
Because old paint can contain 50 % lead , even when painted over with safe coatings , it peels and can contaminate .
This is probably the source of 80 % of lead intoxication .
However , soils in cities are still found to be polluted from old auto exhaust , and new toys are found to be contaminated .
The average level of lead in 14,000 Americans who were tested in a study between 1988 and 1994 was 2.58 mcg/dcL of blood .
The children of this study had between 4 and 37 mcg /dcL of blood .
For every 5 microgram per deciliter increase in children 's bloodstream lead , there is a corresponding 50 % increase in violent crime when they become adults .
The study of 14,000 people was followed for 12 years .
The participants were divided into three groups , based solely on the amount of lead in their blood : : Less than 1.93 mcg/dL : Between 1.93 and 3.63 mcg/dL : Over 3.63 mcg/dLThis study documented that those in the High Lead Group had an 89 % increase in risk of heart attack over those in the Low Lead Group .
The risk of stroke was 2 - 1/2 times greater in the High Lead Group .
Keep this study in mind when reading about the results of the recent Cincinnati studies .
The implications are shocking .
Both reports in the PLoS resulted from a single study of people who were followed while in their mothers ' wombs until age 19 - 24 .
Women from poor , largely African - American , areas with known high concentrations of lead in the housing were enrolled during the early months of pregnancy .
Any woman who was addicted , had diabetes , or a neurological or psychiatric condition was not included .
If a woman refused to take part in the prenatal portion of the trial , they were also not included .
Any neonate born at less than 35 gestation weeks or under 1500 grams ( approximately 3.3 pounds ) was not included .
Serious medical or genetic problems , or an Apgar score less than 6 eliminated a subject from the trial .
Of 376 initial participants qualified and signed up at birth , 250 were followed through ages 19 - 24 .
All of these had blood tests through the first six years of life .
Measurements of lead levels were taken of the mothers ' blood and in the children either two or four times per year until they reached age 6 - 1 / 2 .
The participants were recruited from Cincinnati prenatal clinics .
376 started the study and 250 completed it .
Statistical methods were used to minimize or eliminate extraneous factors , such as maternal smoking and socioeconomic status .
The study that reported on crime obtained arrests records for all causes from official Hamilton County records .
The results are difficult to ignore , since the study did not focus on comparing the participants with statistics of the general public .
Instead , comparisons were made between study participants .
General arrest rates and violent crime rates were correlated with childhood blood lead levels .
A shocking 50 % increase in violent crimes occurred for each 5 mcg /dcL increase in blood lead concentration .
The study concluded , " In a prospective birth cohort , we found that prenatal and childhood blood lead concentrations were predictors of adult arrests . "
This is a strong statement for any peer - reviewed scientific study to make .
There are no qualifiers to indicate any doubt in the results .
Their choice of words for the association of blood lead levels with violent crime was almost as strong .
The study demonstrating shrinkage of brain size documents the unlikelihood that confounding -- confusion associated with other factors , such as environmental stresses or poor parenting -- undermines a link between behavior and lead levels .
It focused on effects in the brain with exposure to environmental lead .
MRIs were used to obtain brain images .
The results showed that the brain 's gray matter -- the part associated with intellect and reasoning ability -- was shrunk an average of 1.2 % .
The part of the brain most significantly affected was the anterior cingulate cortex .
This part of the brain is involved in a wide range of functions , both autonomic and mental / emotional .
Blood pressure and heart rate are affected , as well as empathy , emotion , and reasoning - knowledge storing abilities .
Did you remember how much greater the risks for stroke and heart disease were for the High Lead Group in the general population study reported earlier ?
Now consider that every single person in this study from Cincinnati had a significantly higher level of lead than almost all of the high - level participants of the general population study .
Think of the implications on the lives of children raised in such environments .
They are doomed to less successful lives and significantly poorer health and earlier death .
As these studies document , any antisocial behavior must be considered the result of factors entirely outside their control .
In all likelihood , there will still be claims that no causality link between lead and these results has been shown .
That 's true .
Nonetheless , the lengths to which the authors went to eliminate any other potential cause were great .
At this point , it would be obscene not to take these results seriously and act on them .
The burden of proof for no link of causality belongs on those who claim there is none .
This study shows also how dangerous it is to assume the best when definitive studies are n't yet done .
Blood levels of lead well under the accepted 10 mcg / dL clearly cause severe damage to brains .
The children of this study might have had an opportunity for a decent life if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had taken the responsible and ethical stand that proof of lead 's safety would be requiredany lead exposure would be accepted .
Basing regulations for acceptable levels of any known or suspected toxin on proof of toxicity does not support the welfare of citizens .
Finding exactly how lead shrinks brains , destroys a sense of empathy , and wrecks health is not the issue .
The issue is how we are going to resolve the problem and what will be done for the people whose lives have been so devastated .

Richard S. Fuld tried for months to persuade Wall Street that Lehman Brothers , the investment bank he runs , could weather the storm in the financial markets .
But by last Wednesday his time had run out : Confidence in Lehman seemed to be slipping away .
In the days that followed Mr. Fuld scrambled to secure a financial lifeline for his hard - pressed investment bank and avert the kind of panic that brought down Bear Stearns .
The result , announced Monday morning , was $ 6 billion in fresh capital from an array of blue - chip investors , enough to shore up Lehman , at least for now .
But the news also came with a stunning admission : Lehman Brothers , whose veteran executives pride themselves on their ability to manage risks , lost a staggering $ 2.8 billion in the second quarter , its first deficit since going public in 1994 .
The loss far exceeded even the most pessimistic forecasts and reflected a twin blow of soured assets and bad trades .
What is more , hedges that Lehman had put in place to cushion potential losses from mortgage investments went wrong , adding to the red ink , rather than minimizing it .
The news heightened fears that other banks might run into more trouble .

Dried licorice root may fight tooth decay , new research has found .
But if you 're not a fan , these foods can also help keep teeth , gums , and breath healthy , says Mark Wolff , D.D.S. , Ph.D. , of NYU College of Dentistry :
Yogurt .
The lactic acid may ward off periodontal disease , but skip the sugary varieties .
Sugar - free gum and hard candies .
These promote saliva flow and also help fight cavities .
Xylitol - sweetened ones work best .
Raw or firm vegetables .
Chewing celery and other crunchy veggies helps " scrub " your teeth .
Ones with vitamin C— broccoli ; red , green , and yellow peppers — may also protect against gum disease .

It all started with a tweet :
“ Making a list of superstitions / foolish consistencies / lightweight OCD behaviors e.g. I always put my RIGHT shoe on first .
You ? ”
This right shoe behavior started during ice hockey .
The team was bad … like 0 - 10 bad .
Last game of the season against the best team in the league who slaughtered us in a previous match - up .
As I sat in the locker room considering a perfect beat - down of a season , I decided to become zen about situation … deliberate .
Rather than stressing about the size of the beating , I considered the small parts of manageable reality sitting immediately in front of me .
“ In what order shall I put my gear on ?
What is practical ?
What feels right ?
You know , I like putting my right skate on first .
I ca n’t tell you why , but the order feels important .
Right skate , then left . ”
We killed them .
9 - 3 . Sure , they started by playing half their game because they were already in the playoffs , but after I scored that hat trick in the first period , they woke up .
We slapped them around for another two periods .
It was glorious .
I credit the skates .
No , I credit the skate application process .
It ’s that story that goes through my head each morning as I stare down .
I remember deciding to care about how I put things on my feet .
It ’s a silly superstitious quirk transformed into an unavoidable daily routine and that ’s why I twittered it .
I wanted to know who else was saddled with these foolish consistencies .
Steven Frank took the time to write me a lengthy mail on my tweet .
He mentioned , “ For a while I used to semi - believe that if I could tap out a certain rhythm on my desk while the modem was dialing , I ’d get through to the BBS instead of a busy signal .
Never actually worked in reality . ”
I did that , too .
Steven continued , “ Anxiety , OCD behaviors , and depression almost always come as a package deal .
I ’m sure that anyone who reports one has the others .
And for some reason , they always seem to affect a lot of folks in tech .
I ’m not sure which way ’round the causality is , though . ”
There ’s a risk with giving a clever name to neuro - behaviorial developmental disorders .
I wrote the original NADD ( “ Nerd Attention Deficiency Disorder ” ) article expecting the inevitable comment , “ You , sir , are making fun of people with legitimate disabilities .
Jerk . ”
Mostly those comments never arrived .
Readers understood the meaning of NADD was not to belittle those with a disability , but rather to see the clever ways we ’ve adapted our perceived deficiencies into distinct abilities .
It is with this thought that I present the following responses to my original tweet .
I find them informative , sometimes hilarious , but mostly comforting .
In talking with some of my recent college graduate friends about sex in college now - a - days , one girl mentioned to me that the participants had to sign a sexual consent legal form before actually having sex .
Excuse Me ?
In our discussions , a few of the gals mentioned that they had had drunk sex a few times that they could scarcely remember .
So , if the guy , presumably also drunk , does not get the girl to sign the sexual consent form , can he then be accused of rape ?
Or , better yet , could he accuse her of rape ?
The whole idea seems well - intentioned but the implementation of this idea seems rather impossible and could lead to many false accusations and the destruction of the reputations of many young college kids .
But , most importantly , it would ruin the sex 🙂

Other Notes and Links About the Sexual Consent Form :
1. ) Pros & Cons of The Sexual Consent Form
A lot of people search the Internet for the “ pros and cons for the age of sexual consent “ .
Who ’s asking this ?
Are there that many people who think that there are cons for the age of sexual consent ?
I wonder …are all of these men who want to be with women younger than 18 ?
Or , maybe , there are a bunch of closeted Debra LaFave ’s out there who want to have sex with young men ?
( Whew , she ’s hot .
Did you look at the pictures ?
I would allow her to corrupt me at say … 10,11,12,13,14,15,16 , and / or 17 .
I know people say this would have long term affects on a young boy .
I say , Absolutely , and they all would all be positive 🙂
2. ) A Copy of the Sexual Consent Form [ PDF Version ]
I searched for the actual sexual consent form because I wanted to see what it
said .
It was tough to find because when you search for “ sexual consent form ” , you ’ll find many comments on how silly the idea of the sexual consent form is .
It ’s good to see that people still have a sense of humor .
If you want to read it , here is a PDF copy of a sexual consent form .
I do n’t know if this is the official one used at universities but it looks to be official .
I had two thoughts about it : ( One ) There is a portion for you to add your own activities entitled :
Other consensual sexual conduct to be specified : Gee , any guesses what that could be ?
And ( 2 ) , either partner , gee who would this be ? , can yell code red and the other participant has to stop immediately .
Perhaps you can go find a wealthy billionaire , have them sign the form , and then right at the end , at that moment , yell “ Code Red ” just as they ’re about to release , and you ’ll have the evidence all over you of their violation 🙂
3. ) The Age of Sexual Consent in Your State
I always assumed that Sexual Age Consent in America is 18 .
But , you know what , it ’s not !
There ’s one state where the age of consent for females is just 14 .
Can you guess it ?
If you were thinking a Southern State , you were right .
It ’s South Carolina ( they ’ve since made the age 16 but Dusty , who works at Backwoods Fishing , says that ’s Hogwash ! ) .
Check out the legal age of sexual consent in your state .
One thing that you often hear people say about jQuery is that is has a neat plugin mechanism .
It ’s true there are a great many useful plugins available for jQuery and it makes them super - easy to write , but I want to let you in on a little secret :
j Query . fn = jQuery .
prototype ;
That is jQuery ’s plugin mechanism in its entirity .
Now my point here is not that jQuery somehow sucks ( far from it ) but that I suspect many folks could use JavaScript better if they understood how flexible it is .
In jQuery ’s case , the $ ( ) function returns an instance of the jQuery class , so if you add methods to jQuery .
prototype then you can use those methods to change elements in new and exciting ways .
Behold :
$ . fn . makeThemRed = function ( ) { this .
css ( { color : ' red ' } ) ; return this ; } ; $ ( ' p ' ) . makeThemRed ( ) ;
$.fn is just a shorter alias for jQuery .
prototype .
The really important thing here is that there is nothing special about the jQuery class : all objects ( including prototypes ) are extensible in JavaScript , and you can add and remove properties and methods from any object whenever you like .
Of course , the effect of changes you make to a given object are entirely up to you , the point is that you are allowed to make such changes .
One consequence of this is that you can modify the behaviour of existing methods in any library you happen to be using .
Take this snippet from Reiterate , which adds new behaviour to a stack of Enumerable methods in Prototype :
[ Enumerable , Array .
prototype , Hash .
prototype , ObjectRange .
prototype , Ajax .
Responders , Element .
ClassNames .
prototype ]. each ( function ( object ) { $w ( ' each all any collect detect findAll max \ min partition reject sortBy map find select \ filter every some ' ) . each ( function ( method ) { if ( ! object [ method ] ) return ; var wrapped = object [ method ] ; object [ method ] = function ( ) { var args = $ A ( arguments ) ; if ( args [ 0 ] ) args [ 0 ] = Function . from ( args [ 0 ] ) ; return wrapped .
apply ( this , args ) ; } ; } ) ; } ) ;
This loops over all objects that include Enumerable , and loops over the list of modified methods for each object .
For example , lets ’s expand it for the modification of Enumerable .
collect to make it a little clearer :
var wrapped = Enumerable .
collect ; Enumerable .
collect = function ( ) { var args = $ A ( arguments ) ; if ( args [ 0 ] ) args [ 0 ] = Function . from ( args [ 0 ] ) ; return wrapped .
apply ( this , args ) ; } ;
The best - looking animated film of all time is 20 years old this summer .
On July 16 , 1988 , Japanese fans lined up to buy tickets for the blockbuster anime of the decade , a movie called Akira
The+original+promo+poster+image,+featured+on+Pioneers+2001+DVD.
Metal + Hurlant , +first+published+in+1974,+was+an+inspiration+to+Otomo+and+comics+artists+around+the+world .
One+of+animes+most+revered+icons:+Kanedas+bike .
Okay , sure , the " best - looking " part is a reasonably debatable point .
Fans of Disney 's pre-war classics can make a pretty strong argument for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , which was produced back when animators worked cheap and were easy to exploit .
It 's also hard to draw a direct comparison between 2D animation and the new - school 3D CG we 've seen in productions by Pixar and Dreamworks .
At the very least , though , we 're talking one of the top three , top five animation accomplishments of all time , and as far as traditional 2D productions made in Japan , nothing comes within shouting distance .
Akira broke so much new ground that nobody 's been able to catch up since , not for two decades and probably not for even more .
Yet this movie will spend its 20th birthday out of print in America .
It 's not that hard to find on the secondary market , but it 's still a hell of a shame when one of the high - water marks of Japanese animation is suddenly gone from store shelves .
There 's only so much the fifth estate can do about that , though .
Hopefully , we 'll see Akira make a comeback on home video – a high - definition version on Blu-ray disc would be lovely , thanks – and in the meantime , here 's a little tribute on the anniversary of its arrival .
1982 was a heady year for science fiction .
Ridley Scott 's Blade Runner and John Carpenter 's The Thing opened on the same day , the 25th of June .
Tron followed less than a month later , delivering a second shot of Syd Mead 's futuristic design work .
William Gibson published some of his first cyberpunk short stories , which would lay the foundation for Neuromancer a couple of years later .
And at the very end of the year , on December 20 , a new serial appeared in Kodansha 's Young Magazine .
From a distance , the title spread looked like blood spatter on a concrete wall .
Up close , the image resolved into a bird 's - eye view of Tokyo .
This was the first chapter of Katsuhiro Otomo 's Akira , and it was definitely something new .
The style was rooted in the realistic , hard - boiled gekiga comics of the ' 70s , but there were touches of European comics in there as well , the fantasies of artists like Moebius and other contributors to the influential Metal Hurlant magazine .
There 's plenty of design influence from America as well -- it's hard to look at Akira and not see Syd Mead 's fingerprints here and there , from the dark skyline of Blade Runner and the light - cycles in Tron .
The early ' 80s were the heyday of punk rock – one of the subjects of Otomo 's earlier strip Sayonara Nippon – which showed in Akira 's tale of political turmoil and delinquents running wild in the streets .
In America these days , we mainly remember the conservative backlash of the Reagan revolution , but ' 81 and ' 82 were also the years of Solidarity in Poland , riots in England , civil war in Lebanon , and generally more than enough revolution to go around .
The Cold War was still very much on the boil , too – it was perfectly easy to believe that the bomb could drop on Tokyo and kick off World War III by the end of the decade .
Akira 's often pegged as an example of Gibson 's cyberpunk movement , and it does share a few of the genre 's most famous features .
It has the dystopian future , the crumbling urban sprawl , and the rebellious anti-heroes .
Behind all that , though , it 's built on ideas that have been popular throughout decades of science fiction .
It 's really a story about transcendence – about the next step in human evolution , and what happens afterward .
It 's also about how Kaneda has the coolest motorcycle ever crafted by human hands .
So it works on a couple of different levels .
Good money management is a mental exercise in self - regulation and focusing on the long - term goal , even when you 're sure you just can't go on another day without buying that Kindle or MacBook .
Even the most uber - organized and priority - minded people can stumble when it comes to money — how to save more of it , how to stop spending it , and how to keep doing both over and over again .
While every person 's financial needs are different , anyone can set up simple systems to help themselves stop buying what they do n't need and almost automatically save money they 'll need later .
Let 's take a look at 10 ways you can cut costs and do right by your money without much effort , after the jump .

Similar to the classic " envelope " method , but designed for modern conveniences .
Got your eye on a shiny new MacBook ?
Buy yourself
Apple store gift cards as you manage to put aside money , ensuring you do n't spend the money frivolously and that you 've really got the money to spend .
You 'll want to make sure your cards do n't expire before you hit the savings mark , but it 's a pretty solid way to ensure you honestly earn your big purchases .
But , as our commenters noted when we first posted this , a sub - account through your bank , or a rechargeable gift - style debit card , might be better options for earning interest or avoiding vendor lock - in .

Personal finance blogger and crusader against needless debt
Trent taped pictures of his son around his primary credit card to make him think before making a purchase , and it worked .
Create your own sleeve out of two card - sized pictures , and modify the motivation — whether it's a positive ( something you 're saving for ) or negative ( reminder of the debt you 're paying off ) — and you 'll likely curb some auto - pilot spending .

8 . Set up a waiting rule for flashy purchases .
Advertisement
Nearly everyone knows what next - day regret feels like — at least when it comes to big purchases .
To sift the real needs from the impulse buys , get into the habit of using a system like the Get Rich Slowly blog 's 30 - day rule , where you write down each thing you want to buy and you do n't look at it again till 30 days later , or the $ 100 rule , in which you enforce a one day wait for every $ 100 you plan on spending on some non-essential gear ( scaling that increment when necessary ) .
You would n't use these for homes , cars , or appliances , but they 'll prove that sometimes just living your life for awhile helps you remember how unnecessary most must - haves truly are to it ( Original 30 - day and $ 100 posts ) .
Control spending with the 30 - day rule The Get Rich Slowly blog recommends using the 30 - day rule to stop yourself from an impulse buy .

7. Round up purchases , bank the change .
Advertisement
Spare change jars have been a passive saving technique since change was first offered , but fewer and fewer transactions these days use real cash .
If you 're one of those responsible types who balances a checkbook , you can try writing every purchase to the next dollar to create an invisible buffer in your account .
More likely , though , you do your banking online and can't trick yourself that easily — that 's why programs like Bank of America 's Keep the Change , which put your round - up differences into a money market account , are a sneaky way to siphon off savings .

6 . Freeze your credit card for serious spending stoppage .

If you had to wait for a block of ice to melt every time you wanted to treat yourself to the next season of your favorite show on DVD , would you re-consider watching it online , or just waiting for reruns ?
That 's the idea .
As our sibling site Consumerist points out , you 'd ruin your credit card if you tried to defrost it in the microwave , so you really will have to sit alone with your second - thoughts .
Recommended for serious shopping addicts who still need a credit card around for vital purchases .
5 . Always bank your savings and discounts .
Advertisement
It feels like free money when you hit an unexpected sale , discover a little - known rebate , or simply use a valuable coupon .
Why not turn that free money into even more free money ?
As the Digerati Life blog points out , it 's money that 's easy to set aside , since you did n't expect to have it , and it does n't require any budget reviews .
It also protects that little boost from disappearing into another full - price purchase while you 're out shopping ( Original post ) .

4 . Use a high - interest online account to motivate yourself .
Advertisement
To paraphrase Gordon Gekko , greed , for lack of a better word , is a great motivator to get things done .
If you 're putting money away into a higher - interest , online - only savings account , find out where it tells you how much interest you 've earned for the year and keep it in front of your eyes .
Doing so is a great motivation to stash more cash in there — think of it as a kind of progress bar until your next financial Level Up .
3. Let Firefox find your deals for you .
Advertisement
If you 've got money to spend , you can stretch it pretty far by knowing ( or just stumbling across ) some great online deals .
Like most savings tools , however , you have to go out of your way to take the time and remember to grab those deals .
Luckily , the Firefox browser and a few extensions make it hard not to find coupons , rebates , and killer deals .
RetailMeNot automatically pops in to let you know when a site you 're at has freebies and discounts available , while PriceDrop adds buttons to Amazon.
com 's item pages to help you get notifications when prices go down .
If you 're more prone to random browsing for killer discounts , the Woot Watcher helps you get the jump on those ridiculous deals on random items at Woot !.
Make it hard for yourself to pay full price , and bank the savings however you choose .

As shown above , you can play all kinds of mental games with yourself to keep your worst impulses away from your money , but the real meta - hack is to have the right amount of money earned moved auto - magically into a savings account , or a " buffer " account for unexpected costs , or investments — anywhere but your walking - around stash .

July 21 , 2008  --
A fresh jalapeño pepper grown in Mexico and processed in Texas has tested positive for the strain of salmonella that has sickened more than 1,200 people in recent months , food safety and health officials said today .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 's associate commissioner for foods , David Acheson , said there has been a " significant break in the salmonella investigation , " stressing , however , that the probe is ongoing .
As a result of the finding , the FDA is asking people nationwide to avoid eating fresh jalapeño peppers , serrano peppers and foods made with fresh jalapeño peppers .
Pickled and preserved jalapeños are still safe to eat .
The pepper that tested positive was obtained at a produce distribution center called Agricola Zaragosa , in McAllen , Texas , officials said .
That distribution center has since recalled all peppers that passed through its plant .
All the other samples that have since been taken at that facility have tested negative for the outbreak , the FDA said .
And although the pepper in question was grown on a farm in Mexico , the FDA has yet to determine whether it was contaminated there or later along the supply chain .
" Contamination could have occurred anywhere from the farm all the way to the facility , " Acheson said .
Dr. Robert Tauxe , deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control 's division of foodborne , bacterial and mycotic diseases , said 1,251 people in 43 states and the District of Columbia have become sick from salmonella since April .
There have been 229 hospitalizations and two deaths as a result .
" This outbreak continues , " Tauxe said today .
" This is 14 more cases than had been reported as of last Friday . "
Indeed , the source of the salmonella outbreak has been a complex mystery in recent months , as officials first focused on tomatoes as the likely culprit .
But the FDA last week gave consumers the go - ahead to eat tomatoes again .
Officials cleared tomatoes because the farms that may have shipped them at the beginning of the outbreak in May are no longer harvesting them , and food safety officials also said they 've found no contamination along the tomato - distribution chain .
Food safety officials last week said there could have been cross-contamination between tomatoes and peppers at packing or washing stations before the foods made their way to restaurants and grocery stores .
" This has been one of the most complex outbreaks that I personally have ever been involved with , " Acheson said today .
Now that a pepper has tested positive for salmonella , the FDA said it is looking up and down the entire production chain that pepper would have passed through for more clues .
Acheson said that includes looking at records to find where peppers from that distribution center were sent .
" We are very actively pursuing and investigating several clusters of cases who all ate at the same restaurant or group of restaurants , " Tauxe said .
" We are also conducting extremely detailed interviews in the heartland of the outbreak , if you will , down in the Southwest . "
The Reid technique is the basis of the widely used " Criminal Interrogation and Confessions " manual we already mentioned .
It lays out nine steps or issues guiding interrogation .
Many of these steps overlap , and there is no such thing as a " typical " interrogation ; but the Reid technique provides a blueprint of how a successful interrogation might unfold .
Confrontation
The detective presents the facts of the case and informs the suspect of the evidence against him .
This evidence might be real , or it might be made up .
The detective typically states in a confident manner that the suspect is involved in the crime .
The suspect 's stress level starts increasing , and the interrogator may move around the room and invade the suspect 's personal space to increase the discomfort .
If the suspect starts fidgeting , licking his lips and or grooming himself ( running his hand through his hair , for instance ) , the detective takes these as indicators of deception and knows he's on the right track .
Theme development
The interrogator creates a story about why the suspect committed the crime .
Theme development is about looking through the eyes of the suspect to figure out why he did it , why he'd like to think he did it and what type of excuse might make him admit he did it .
Does the suspect use any particular mode of reasoning more often than others ?
For example , does he seem willing to blame the victim ?
The detective lays out a theme , a story , that the suspect can latch on to in order to either excuse or justify his part in the crime , and the detective then observes the suspect to see if he likes the theme .
Is he paying closer attention than before ?
Nodding his head ?
If so , the detective will continue to develop that theme ; if not , he 'll pick a new theme and start over .
Theme development is in the background throughout the interrogation .
When developing themes , the interrogator speaks in a soft , soothing voice to appear non-threatening and to lull the suspect into a false sense of security .
Stopping denials
Letting the suspect deny his guilt will increase his confidence , so the detective tries to interrupt all denials , sometimes telling the suspect it 'll be his turn to talk in a moment , but right now , he needs to listen .
From the start of the interrogation , the detective watches for denials and stops the suspect before he can voice them .
In addition to keeping the suspect 's confidence low , stopping denials also helps quiet the suspect so he does n't have a chance to ask for a lawyer .
If there are no denials during theme development , the detective takes this as a positive indicator of guilt .
If initial attempts at denial slow down or stop during theme development , the interrogator knows he has found a good theme and that the suspect is getting closer to confessing .
Overcoming objections
Once the interrogator has fully developed a theme that the suspect can relate to , the suspect may offer logic - based objections as opposed to simple denials , like " I could never rape somebody -- my sister was raped and I saw how much pain it caused .
I would never do that to someone . "
The detective handles these differently than he does denials , because these objections can give him information to turn around and use against the suspect .
The interrogator might say something like , " See , that 's good , you 're telling me you would never plan this , that it was out of your control .
You care about women like your sister -- it was just a one - time mistake , not a recurring thing . "
If the detective does his job right , an objection ends up looking more like an admission of guilt .
Getting the suspect 's attention
At this point , the suspect should be frustrated and unsure of himself .
He may be looking for someone to help him escape the situation .
The interrogator tries to capitalize on that insecurity by pretending to be the suspect 's ally .
He 'll try to appear even more sincere in his continued theme development , and he may get physically closer to the suspect to make it harder for the suspect to detach from the situation .
The interrogator may offer physical gestures of camaraderie and concern , such as touching the suspect 's shoulder or patting his back .
The suspect loses resolve
If the suspect 's body language indicates surrender -- his head in his hands , his elbows on his knees , his shoulders hunched -- the interrogator seizes the opportunity to start leading the suspect into confession .
He 'll start transitioning from theme development to motive alternatives ( see the next step ) that force the suspect to choose a reason why he committed the crime .
At this stage , the interrogator makes every effort to establish eye contact with the suspect to increase the suspect 's stress level and desire to escape .
If , at this point , the suspect cries , the detective takes this as a positive indicator of guilt .
Alternatives
The interrogator offers two contrasting motives for some aspect of the crime , sometimes beginning with a minor aspect so it 's less threatening to the suspect .
One alternative is socially acceptable ( " It was a crime of passion " ) , and the other is morally repugnant ( " You killed her for the money " ) .
The detective builds up the contrast between the two alternatives until the suspect gives an indicator of choosing one , like a nod of the head or increased signs of surrender .
Then , the detective speeds things up .
Bringing the suspect into the conversation
Once the suspect chooses an alternative , the confession has begun .
The interrogator encourages the suspect to talk about the crime and arranges for at least two people to witness the confession .
One may be the second detective in room , and another may be brought in for the purpose of forcing the suspect to confess to a new detective -- having to confess to a new person increases the suspect 's stress level and his desire to just sign a statement and get out of there .
Bringing a new person into the room also forces the suspect to reassert his socially acceptable reason for the crime , reinforcing the idea that the confession is a done deal .
The confession
The final stage of an interrogation is all about getting the confession admitted at trial .
The interrogator will have the suspect write out his confession or state it on videotape .
The suspect is usually willing to do anything at this point to escape the interrogation .
The suspect confirms that his confession is voluntary , not coerced , and signs the statement in front of witnesses .
When You 've Got Company The Just Cause Law Collective warns that if you 're arrested with friends , you 've got to keep a cool head .
Decide beforehand that no one 's going to say a word until everyone has a lawyer , and remind yourself that police will try to play on the natural paranoia that arises when people are separated .
The Collective offers a further warning regarding a group arrest :
When you have your strategy discussion , do n't do it in the back seat of a police car .
If the officers stuffed you all into one car and walked away , they 're recording you .
It should be noted here that in the United States , if at any point during the interrogation the suspect does somehow manage to ask for a lawyer or invoke his right to silence , the interrogation has to stop immediately .
That 's why it 's so important to interrupt the suspect 's attempts to speak in the initial stages -- if he invokes his rights , the interrogation is over .
The steps we 've laid out here represent some of the psychological techniques that detectives use to get confessions from suspects .
But a real interrogation does n't always follow the textbook .
Next , let 's take a look at an actual police interrogation that ended with an admissible confession .

Success has many fathers , the old saying has it , and the same goes for a well - turned maxim .
We 've noted a number of different originators for what Jed Hartman called the Law of Prescriptivist Retaliation : corrections of linguistic error are themselves inevitably prone to error .
Around 1999 this truism was hit upon by no less than three independent sources : Hartman , Erin McKean , and alt.usage.english contributor Skitt .
And 90 years before that , Ambrose Bierce expressed much the same sentiment .
Now it appears that the law has yet another eponymous author : the mythical Mr. Muphry .
" Muphry 's Law " came to my attention in the comments on Stephen J. Dubner 's " Freakonomics " blog on the New York Times website .
As I wrote in the post " Of pasties and pastries , " Dubner faulted an article in The Economist that referred to " Cornish pasties " for sale outside of Mexico City .
He thought pasties was an error for pastries , since he was unfamiliar with the British culinary term pasty ( instead construing pasties as the plural of the American term pastie , the stripper 's ornamentation ) .
Of the commenters who corrected Dubner 's correction , one wrote : " You ’ve just encountered Muphry 's Law ( no , not Murphy ’s ) . "
Dubner picked up on the comment in a subsequent post ( in which he describes receiving a Cornish pasty in the mail , sent from the wags at The Economist to spare him further confusion ) .
Muphry 's Law , it turns out , was so named by John Bangsund of the Victorian Society of Editors in Australia .
In a 1992 article in the Society of Editors Newsletter , Bangsund set out a four - part principle :
( a ) if you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading , there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written ; ( b ) if an author thanks you in a book for your editing or proofreading , there will be mistakes in the book ; ( c ) the stronger the sentiment expressed in ( a ) and ( b ) , the greater the fault ; ( d ) any book devoted to editing or style will be internally inconsistent .
Dubner 's goof might not be the best example of Muphry 's Law , however .
The canonical case of prescriptivist retaliation requires an actual error to exist in the first place , with one or more errors occurring in the correction to the original error .
As Jeremy Cherfas pointed out in a comment to my " pasties " post , " Dubner was pointing out an error that was not an error . "
So Dubner falls more into line with the examples discussed by Mark Liberman in his post , " Why are so many linguistic corrections incorrect ? "
Mark borrows the term " incorrection " from William Safire ( " a correction that is itself incorrect " ) , but Coby Lubliner has argued that " miscorrection " is a better term for this phenomenon ( which has come up so often in our posts on the Cupertino effect ) .
Note the last link there , for the Wikipedia page on the Cupertino effect .
As it happens , there 's also a brand - new Wikipedia page on Muphry 's Law , with a panoply of variations from Bierce onwards .
Both articles show the dissemination of Language Log scholarship beyond the friendly confines of LL Plaza .
Nice to have some online company for the eggcorns and the snowclones .

A South Korean fisherman who says he was kidnapped by North Korea more than three decades ago has escaped .
Yun Jong - su , 66 , is in South Korean custody in China waiting to return home , said Choi Sung - yong , head of an abductees ' association .
Mr Yun says he was captured along with 32 other crew members while fishing off South Korea 's eastern coast in 1975 .
Since then he has married and now says he fears for the safety of his wife and daughter in North Korea .
Mr Yun is said to have escaped from North Korea into China in May , taking refuge at the South Korean consulate in the Chinese city of Shenyang .
He is now awaiting passage back to South Korea , said Mr Choi .
But Mr
Yun fears his wife and daughter - who he had hoped would follow him - have been arrested since his escape , Mr Yun told the Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo in an interview .
' Overwhelmed with joy '
Mr Yun says he has worked in a farming machinery factory in Kaechon , a city in central North Korea , since his kidnapping .
Mr Yun 's brother , Ju-seung , told AP news agency : " I am overwhelmed with joy ... since I came to know that my younger brother is still alive . "
Some 480 civilian South Koreans - mainly fishermen - are thought to have been taken by the North .
In addition , more than 500 prisoners of war from the 1950 - 53 Korean War were never repatriated , according to the South Korean government .
The North denies holding any South Koreans against their will .

As John McCain moves to select a running mate , it seems–at least for the moment –that the star of potential veep nominee Bobby Jindal , the Louisiana governor , is rising .
This is good news for Democrats .
On one level , Jindal is impressive .
The son of Indian immigrants , he ’s only 37 years old , and he has already been elected a member of the U.S. House and a governor .
( Talk about a Junior Achiever ! )
Yet can McCain , who claims Obama is not sufficiently experienced to become president , say with a straight face that Jindal is prepared to take the helm ?
And Jindal ’s record in Louisiana–including his stint in charge of the state health department –has its spotty moments .
Then there ’s that exorcism .
Blogs and news outfits have already picked over a 1994 essay that Jindal , a convert to Catholicism , wrote for a Catholic magazine , describing an exorcism of a friend in which he was an observer / participant .
Not only did Jindal and his pals manage to drive the Satanic demon out of their friend ; the exercise , Jindal suggested , also cured her skin cancer .
The article was entitled , “ Physical Dimensions of Spiritual Warfare . ”
Americans tend to be quite religious .
Most tell pollsters they believe in heaven and hell ( and assume they are heading upward , not downward , once they expire ) .
Many tend to believe literally in the devil .
But how will an amateur exorcism –that violated Catholic law ( which allows only certified exorcists to perform the ritual in very limited circumstances ) –play with , say , swing voters ?
No doubt , Jindal will have to discuss the episode .
With Oprah perhaps ?
That would indeed be Must See TV .
Here ’s one excerpt of his article that an interviewer might want to ask about :
While Alice and Louise held Susan , her sister continued holding the Bible to her face .
Almost taunting the evil spirit that had almost beaten us minutes before , the students dared Susan to read biblical passages .
She choked on certain passages and could not finish the sentence “ Jesus is Lord . ”
Over and over , she repeated “ Jesus is L..L..LL , ” often ending in profanities .
In between her futile attempts , Susan pleaded with us to continue trying and often smiled between the grimaces that accompanied her readings of Scripture .
Just as suddenly as she went into the trance , Susan suddenly reappeared and claimed “ Jesus is Lord . ”
With an almost comical smile , Susan then looked up as if awakening from a deep sleep and asked , “ Has something happened ? ”
She did not remember any of the past few hours and was startled to find her friends breaking out in cheers and laughter , overwhelmed by sudden joy and relief .
As a vice presidential candidate , Jindal would be under great pressure–and ought to be–to make other participants in the event available for interview .
In the article , he used fake names .
But he insisted every single detail was true .
Given that such an event must have had a profound impact on him–he came face to face with a real demon ! – this possible president - in - waiting would be obligated to prove that he got the story right , that he was not exaggerating .
( Remember how the press and the GOPers went after Al Gore ’s claims in 2000 with a vengeance ? )
And the media , of course , would be on the hunt to find “ Susan ” to get her side of the tale .
( Enquiring minds might want to know if her skin cancer is still gone . )
Is Jindal prepared to disclose more about this exorcism ?
Is the McCain campaign prepared to see more disclosed ?
The event is a legitimate target for voter interest and media scrutiny .
After all , Representative Dennis Kucinich had to explain his UFO sighting .
And Jindal should not be allowed to hide behind the cloaks of faith and personal privacy .
Barack Obama had no choice but to explain his relationship to a particular minister .
He did n’t duck the issue by claiming it was a private relationship based on faith .
So if Jindal is anointed by McCain , the exorcism will be fair game .
America may or may not be ready for a national political debate about exorcism and Satanic demons .
By picking Jindal as a running mate , McCain would give the country a chance to find out .
Controversial Billboard Sparks Outrage in Florida
In a controversial billboard , a Fla. man asks the public not to vote Democrat .
July 16 , 2008  --
A controversial billboard bearing a photo of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and a warning not to vote for Democrats has sparked outrage in Orlando , Fla .
Next to a photo of the Twin Towers burning , the billboard reads " Please Don't Vote for a Democrat . "
Beneath the message is the name of a Web site that markets $ 5 CDs of a song , " Please Don't Vote for a Democrat , " by Mike Meehan of St. Cloud .
" It should be taken down , " William Carter , who lives near one of the three billboards , told ABCNews.com .
He said he believes that although it is entirely within Meehan 's rights to express such an opinion , recalling a devastating time in our nation 's history for personal gain " is just wrong . "
But Meehan said he is only selling the CDs to cover the cost of getting his message out .
" I 'm holding the entire Democratic Party responsible for the attacks on 9/11 , " said Meehan , who wrote , sang , produced and recorded the song .
He said people should not vote for Democrats because they are too focused on solving the problems in the economy when they should be focused on the war on terrorism .
The billboards went up Monday , and though he originally declined an interview with ABCNews.com because he said he wanted to wait until the billboard buzz was " hot in the pan after a few more weeks of exposure , " he ultimately agreed .
" Democrats are relaxed on fighting the war on terrorism , " he said .
" But it 's just as important as the economy .
The economy and terrorism go together . "
Terrorists had warned they would destroy the American economy financially , and we can see their success in the high prices of oil , Meehan said .
The song 's lyrics echo these claims as he attempts to persuade voters that " No we can't afford to have another attack / and that 's why we can't vote for a Democrat . "
Although Meehan does not endorse any particular candidates , he said he hopes that his song will be played at Republican Party conventions and rallies in future " local , state and national elections . "
That is unlikely , however , because as was first reported by ABC affiliate WFTV in Orlando , both parties have criticized the billboards .
A call from ABCNews.com to the Orange County Republican Executive Committee was not immediately returned , although the party told WFTV the billboards were " inappropriate . "
Bill Robinson , chairman of the Democratic Party of Orange County , Fla. , called the billboards " despicable , ignorant and juvenile . "
He said Meehan " is not a patriot , he is a profiteer " trying to exploit the national tragedy for personal gain .
Meehan said he knows people will find his ads offensive , but he said , " It 's more offensive that our nation is forgetting about the attacks . "
Media only mentions the devastation in Iraq without really letting people know exactly what 's going on , he said .
But according to Meehan , the photograph and his song accomplish this task by " reminding people that terrorists are behind a lot of destruction . "
He said the three billboards around Orlando have gotten a positive response because " people are happy that we are remembering these people that died . "
He hopes to recoup some of the money spent on the billboards and recording through sales of the CD , but he said he also intends to send some proceeds to the families of victims of 9/11 .
Three years after the president of Harvard , Lawrence H. Summers , got into trouble for questioning women ’s “ intrinsic aptitude ” for science and engineering  and 16 years after the talking Barbie doll proclaimed that “ math class is tough ”  a study paid for by the National Science Foundation has found that girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests .
Although boys in high school performed better than girls in math 20 years ago , the researchers found , that is no longer the case .
The reason , they said , is simple : Girls used to take fewer advanced math courses than boys , but now they are taking just as many .
“ Now that enrollment in advanced math courses is equalized , we do n’t see gender differences in test performance , ” said Marcia C. Linn of the University of California , Berkeley , a co-author of the study .
“ But people are surprised by these findings , which suggests to me that the stereotypes are still there . ”
The findings , reported in the July 25 issue of Science magazine , are based on math scores from seven million students in 10 states , tested in accordance with the federal No Child Left Behind Act .
BETHESDA , Maryland ( Reuters ) - Researchers working on an artificial pancreas believe they are just a few years away from a nearly carefree way for people with diabetes to monitor blood and inject insulin as needed .
They believe they can link two current technologies -- continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps -- into a seamless package .
Such a mechanical pancreas could greatly reduce the need for fingersticks and injections of insulin that diabetics must now endure several times a day , researchers told a meeting this week at the National Institutes of Health .
“ I think we are on the brink of a first - generation artificial pancreas , ” said Dr. Roman Hovorka of Britain ’s University of Cambridge , who is testing some experimental devices with components by Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic , the No. 1 maker of insulin pumps and continuous monitors .
Hovorka ’s team has been testing devices in patients with type - 1 diabetes , an autoimmune disease caused when the body mistakenly destroys the insulin - making cells in the pancreas .
A continuous glucose sensor is implanted under the skin , and transmits blood sugar readings to a monitor .
A computer calculates the right dose of insulin , which is delivered by an insulin pump -- something many patients already wear .
His team is ready to send some patients home with the device , but has to work out the logistics of keeping a nurse full - time in each volunteer ’s home , just in case .
U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulators are working closely with the researchers to ensure they design studies in a way that can lead to quick review , said Dr. Aaron Kowalski of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation , which funds many of the artificial pancreas study teams .
SCRUPULOUS MONITORING
For people with type - 1 diabetes , scrupulous care is needed to avoid swings in blood sugar levels .
If levels go too low , the patient can pass out and die .
When blood sugar goes too high , it damages capillaries and eventually organs .
Patients whose sugar levels regularly creep up suffer gradual and usually symptomless damage until they go blind , or lose kidney function , suffer heart damage or perhaps lose a limb .
“ If we could prevent one person from dying due to hypoglycemia , that would be a triumph , ” Kowalski said .
Such a system would be especially helpful for children with type - 1 diabetes .
“ Parents are waking up every single night , often multiple times , to test their children ’s blood sugar , ” Kowalski said .
“ And often it is high or low .
Overnight control might be the easiest part of the closed loop .
We think we can do this now . ”
Dr. Bruce Buckingham , of California ’s Stanford University and Packard Children ’s Hospital , agreed the easiest test of an artificial pancreas might be at night , when people are not eating , drinking or moving about , and thus their bodies are not making changing demands for insulin .
“ You can go step by step , ” Buckingham said .
The computer could be held in a device the size of an iPod , the researchers agree .
“ For a fully , completely automated waterproof , all - environment system -- that may be more than six years , ” Buckingham said .
While a traditional insulin pump has several feet of tubing , Insulet Corp has a device that sticks to the skin , with a tiny tube inserted in the upper arm or stomach .
Medtronic has wireless technology to transmit glucose readings , another key component connecting the bloodsugar monitor and the insulin pump .
People can now wear both continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps , but they do not communicate with one another and so patients must manually read the sugar levels and operate the pump .
The insulin pump also must be able to quickly shut off if blood sugar falls too low , the experts agree .
About 24 million Americans have diabetes , with Type 1 accounting for 5 percent to 10 percent of diagnosed cases .
Insulet estimates 23 percent of Type 1 patients use pumps and values the market at $ 4.3 billion if all did .
But the experts say there is likely a market for artificial pancreas systems among people with the most severe cases of type 2 diabetes , who must also take insulin .
India produces some of the brightest minds in technology , science and medicine yet has not demonstrated any truly large scale and breakthrough innovations in those fields .
The giant India corporations of Reliance , Tata ( NYSE : TTM ) , Wipro ( NYSE : WIT ) , and Infosys ( NYSE : INFY ) have huge revenues but produce very little innovative intellectual property [ IIP ] .
Yet , India has critical “ Country Development ” issues that can only be addressed through the immediate and creative application of technology , which in turn requires massive technology innovations in a variety of fields .
Fields requiring immediate and large scale innovation run the gamut from clean energy ( energy independence ) , housing the burgeoning middle class , providing affordable housing for the vast pool of have - nots , elementary , primary and secondary education , health - care , national infrastructure ( water , power , transportation ) and finally , equality of opportunity .
Solutions developed by India will be uniquely Indian , but potentially applicable to the huge swath of global population mired in poverty and living limited lives , with little or no hope .
India can lead the way because it now knows how to develop global solutions that work on a very large scale , especially those that are technology intensive ( witness India ’s response to Y2K ) .
Interestingly , India still is a chaotic , third world country , so it understands the need to adapt First World solutions to the chaotic environment of the Third World .
India just needs to put in place the culture , ecosystem and infrastructure needed to release the latent potential of its huge entrepreneurial pool of business people .
In turn , India will not only create valuable companies that make shareholders wealthy , but could also pave the way for a more just and economically stable life for other third world countries .
So first , we will explore why India is not successful innovating on a large scale .
Subsequently , we will examine two areas of technological innovation India should own and control in order to sustain its growth and accelerate its contribution to the evolution of an economically and environmentally sustainable planet .
Let us address the myth that I have heard repeatedly by pundits in the media or those with a Western centric view .
That myth or some variation thereof is that Asian ’s lack the culture or mindset for true technological innovation .
For the purpose of this document , I do not plan to debate the myth head on as there are many examples of Asian innovation .
However , I do want to illustrate why an “ Innovation Ecosystem ” is the principal catalyst for fostering rapid innovation and the translation of these innovations into large scale , successful businesses .
In fact , the data suggests the ecosystem is the primary reason for the success of innovation or lack thereof .
For example , Jas Dillon was born in India and came to the United States at the age of 19 to study Electrical Engineering , and subsequently completed a graduate program in business at the University of Southern California .
After heading up telecommunications strategy at KPMG , he founded a truly innovative company called BlueLine Online ( now CTScape.com ) , in the heart of Silicon Valley , CA .
In fact , BlueLine Online Inc. was pioneering large scale Software as a Solution ( SaaS ) as it went live in October 1996 .
It was also the first internet based infrastructure and construction project management solution online .
It was real innovation in the industry because previous to Blue Line Online the industry was passing architectural and complex engineering documents around via fax or email or worse , Fed -ex or DHL .
If asked today , Jas will tell you that it would have been impossible to create Blue Line Online in India because of the lack of an environment that led to innovation , what I call an “ organized innovation ecosystem ” .
The biggest advantage Western entrepreneurs have over Asian , and specifically Indian entrepreneurs , are that their innovation support systems are mature and systematized .
By that I mean if an entrepreneur has a “ killer app ” and wants to make it a reality , they have access to the resources , support , funding and mentorship to create a solution , build a company around it , structure the appropriate corporate governance , line up the relevant strategic partners and take their product and / or service to market .
Fragments of this ecosystem exist in India , but compared to the US , India ’s innovation infrastructure lacks the organized components to create a Google , Apple , FaceBook , Microsoft , GE , Microsoft , or even the next generation of MySpace , YouTube or Twitter .
To highlight the innovation gap , let ’s examine a major indicator of inventiveness – the number of patent applications filed .
In 2005 ( see Table 1 ) , there were only 14,500 patent applications recorded in India , however , by the end of 2007 that number had reached 35,000 patent filings .
Yet over 60 % of those were filed by foreigners !
In contrast there were 417,508 patent applications in the US in 2005 , and a further 456,154 patent applications in 2007 .
Interestingly , further diligence revealed that one out of ten US patents in 2006 had an owner or co-owner with an Indian name helping to prove that Indians are exceptionally innovative , given the opportunity in an ecosystem that supports risk taking and innovation .
Table 1 : 2005 Patent Statistics by Country [ pdf file ]
Clearly something is amiss .
While there are many reasons for the disparity in the quantity of patent applications filed in the two countries , clearly this is at least one significant indicator of the innovation difference between the two countries .
So what are the reasons for the lack of India innovation today ?
The missing ingredients required to jump - start India ’s innovation ecosystem are ;
Access to intellectual and relational capital .
There are plenty of brilliant people in India with world - changing ideas .
However , they have no way to act on these ideas because they are all Lone Rangers , with limited or no access to business and mentoring networks , required to take ideas from concept to companies .
In other words , I have a great idea but I ca n’t assemble the necessary people with the required skill sets to help me execute it .
In fact , talent that existed in - country moved outside of India to more innovative ground in order to realize their visions .
Fortunately , this trend is reversing as Non-Resident Indians ( NRI ’s ) are moving back to India .
A well developed Angel and Venture Capital industry does not exist in India .
Sure , there are the global players with India outposts , but for the most part they are only investing in profitable companies with a well established track record .
India ’s Angel and Venture Capital industry today looks more like Private Equity in the United States .
An active segment of the Press focused on promoting early stage ventures and building Entrepreneurs into Business Celebrities .
In the United States there are publications and news channels ( print , radio , TV , and online ) that specifically target almost every conceivable industry segment , the emerging Stars in that segment , as well as the established movers and shakers in the target segment .
Additionally , there are clearly defined process and businesses that work actively to network entrepreneurs into the media and are vested in their success .
In contrast , the business press in India is limited and solely focused on promoting the majors .
An active “ emerging business media segment ” could do wonders in elevating entrepreneurship to a higher level and be instrumental in catalyzing the maturation of evolution of the India innovation ecosystems .
The key message this media segment would send to the younger Indian generation is that it ’s OK to take risks , it ’s desirable to dream big , it fine to fail and try again until you succeed – in other words , using the motto of the British Air Service ( the very first Special Forces Group in the world ) -- “ He Who Dares Wins . ” A Comprehensive Understanding of the Indian Consumer and the lack of formal Government support to promote Entrepreneurship and Innovation .
There is a significant ( if not complete ) lack of understanding of consumer trends inside India .
The challenge in India is that there are almost 3 different civilizations ( and their associated populations , cultures , and needs ) coexisting simultaneously in India today .
There is the India of the ultra-rich , ultra-mobile and super educated ( they are the Indians who impress the World at Davos ) ; there is the India that works in call centers to serve the West , and then there is the India that lives on $ 2 / day .
There are massive opportunities within each of these segments but actual market data is lacking .
This is where a public / private partnership would be the most interesting .
Western Market Research companies and the Indian Government could work hand - in - hand to create a national blueprint and schedule that would accelerate India ’s transition .
This blueprint would also serve as a guidepost for areas of entrepreneurship and innovation .
Furthermore , the Indian Government could select specific regions of the Country where they would create Small Business Investment Corporations ( SBIC’s ) – the entities that jump started the US Venture Industry .
The SBIC ’s would be chartered to promote innovation , entrepreneurship and investment in specific , critical national areas , primarily by promoting the growth of small , aggressive and agile technology companies that are targeting the blueprint .
Establishing Compelling Reasons to Innovate : Unfortunately , most Indian companies are not in a hyper - competitive domestic market thus reducing the pressure on them to Innovate or Die .
Opening up all the maximum of highest priority sectors of the Indian economy to global competition will force these incumbent players to start innovating aggressively in a variety of ways – products , services , business models , organizational structures , operational execution etc .
Internationally , Indian companies are competing and winning using a low pricing model and not with new innovative ideas .
As India continues to open its market to foreign competition , the pressure to innovate will increase , and this will only be “ good ” for accelerating the development of the Indian Innovation Ecosystem .
We are already witnessing this in the real estate industry as demand for higher quality buildings is increasing due to foreign developer competition .
Innovation Unleashed --- Key Mission and First Idea
To unleash the power of innovation , to establish an agile , rapidly evolving Innovation Ecosystem , and to accelerate India ’s innovation engine from nascent to unstoppable India needs to establish an Innovation Platform .
This platform would be a synthesis of public / private partnerships , the key Indian institutes of higher learning , and Indian diaspora spread across the planet in positions of power and influence .
This innovation platform would have one mission – “ to unleash the creativity and dynamism of the average Indian to solve pressing public sector and private sector challenges , while simultaneously creating valuable , globally competitive private enterprises as the vehicles to deliver and profit from these solutions . ”
One guaranteed way to ignite the development of this innovation platform would be for the Indian Government to create an I - Prize Innovation Foundation ( IPIF ) , funded with $ 1 Billion US that would offer outright , unrestricted cash prizes to individuals , institutions , and / or companies providing solutions to critical , time sensitive problems required to accelerate India ’s continued growth .
The I - Prize would target specific domain areas e.g. energy , transportation , communications , education , ethics , health care , rural development , job creation etc .
The prize would be open to Indians , Indian Companies or global companies willing to operate in India .
The IPIF would start at the federal level but would rapidly establish offshoots at the state level , similar ( but different ) to the US SBIC program .
The IPIF could be complemented with additional low interest business loans , tax incentives , or subsidies to encourage large scale commercialization of winning solutions .
At the very least the IPIF will provide a tangible reward for solving a particular problem , with protection to the Innovators in order to allow them to succeed in commercializing their innovations .
This could potentially jump start the creation and formalization the innovation ecosystem , and start attracting a constant flow of people into the entrepreneurial world as they would be able to see a more defined path to see profits , recognition , and career advancement .
Imagine a gifted inventor receiving a 40 crores ( US $ 10 million ) reward for inventing a solar powered mobile phone or even a smaller 1 crore ( US $ 250,000 ) prize for inventing a very safe , zero emission , 3 - 4 passenger vehicle .
The I Prizes would invigorate inventors in waiting and provide them a clear path to become wealthy and widely recognized while helping to solve challenges critical to India ’s continued growth .
The possibilities are endless .
Fundamental Innovations Required for Sustaining and Accelerating Growth
Amongst all the opportunities in India , I can identify six areas where the Indian Government urgently needs quantum leaps in capability in order to insure stability and long term economic growth .
The Indian Government or leading Indian companies should establish IPRIZES or other incentives for fundamental innovations in each of these areas and unleash the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of Indians .
Specific innovation areas are :
Clean , Renewable and Reliable Energy Sources and a National Energy Grid that insures a continuous , expanding , and uninterrupted supply of energy to meet India ’s soaring energy requirements .
This should be the highest priority as without clean , secure and plentiful power India will never be able to pull the majority of its population into the 21st century .
The Indian Government needs to immediately engage it ’s huge pool of intellectual talent in the experimentation , development and trials of multiple forms of renewable energy , with the objective of finding one that is clean and eliminates the reliance on fossil fuels .
Think it ca n’t be done , just look at Iceland – the first truly ( almost 100 % ) hydrogen and thermal energy economy , where public / private partnerships are starting to produce amazing results .
Communications , Transportation and Logistics :
Once you have established a reliable energy grid you need to insure real - time fault tolerant communications , insure the ability to physically ( and reliably ) connect the far reaches of the vast Indian sub - continent country via a working road , rail and air transportation system and associated transportation hubs , and insure the development / implementation of a logistics management system that insures the smooth flow of people , goods and service from any point to any point within the India and to points outside .
As an example the innovation in communications requires a platform that is ubiquitous , high bandwidth , relatively cheap , and impervious to the vicious Indian weather patterns .
This logically leads us to an ultra high speed wireless network created by the government in partnership with mobile operators .
At the end of 2007 , India had 233 million mobile phone subscribers , an incredible 56 % increase year over year .
If your neighborhood experienced 56 % growth last year and the government did n’t improve the infrastructure to allow new roads , retail establishments , and businesses you ’d probably vote them out of office .
However , if the government in cooperation with Indian mobile companies produced an ultra high speed cellular network , innovative Indian entrepreneurs would create entirely new forms of mobile video on demand , wireless education programs , gaming , mobile commerce , and location based applications that can immediately be leveraged by 20 % of India ’s population .
This market alone is larger than the US mobile network .
Unfortunately ( to date ) it is not evident that there is an Indian mobile industry group pushing for a subsidized high speed mobile phone information highway that allows new innovative mobile businesses to be built on top of this infrastructure ?
As an analogy South Korea implemented a high speed broadband wireless telecommunications network as a foundation to build a “ knowledge - based society ” in the 1990’s .
Since then there have been numerous businesses built on top of the network that never would have existed without the foundation .
South Koreans ’ became innovative because there was a subsidized high speed wireless network to build and profit on .
Think it ca n’t be monetized successfully ?
There are already free mobile solutions subsidized by advertising that are working in the UK .
National or local businesses , merchants and retailers could subsidize mobile phone use while giving India ’s poor the opportunity to participate in the India growth story .
Better , you now allow the poor to create innovative mobile business opportunities that target the poor - a group that is largely being ignored today .
What will power this phenomenon is not just the subsidy , but the ability to innovate and improve in ways that generate profits , knowledge , or an improved brand or company .
Elementary , Primary and Secondary Education : Long term national security , economic opportunity , and economic prosperity requires the development of a world class education system with a dedicated teacher core , focused on providing India ’s masses with strong grounding in education fundamentals .
It also requires the development of a national network of physical education infrastructure , standardized curriculum , and measurement systems .
Getting primary education right is critical for jump starting economic advancement --- the AESAN countries have done an incredible job here , thus changing the lives of entire populations for the better .
India should create an IPRIZE here and solicit input from the huge pool of talented Indian educators , professionals and private enterprises as to what it would take to create a world - class , fair and equitable education system .
The Government could play the role of insuring or subsidizing physical infrastructure and educational standards while leaving the actual teaching to the private sector .
Affordable Housing :
As I stated in my previous article on the global credit crisis , India is in a short - term real estate cyclical downturn in some areas ( mainly Tier I cities ) .
Nevertheless , there is clearly a need for low cost , high quality housing that is resistant to any real estate downturn now or in the next decade .
I recognize there are some current attempts to address this market but it ’s a small pebble in a large ocean of opportunity .
India needs a set of innovative technology housing solutions combined with a government subsidized platform of tax incentives , innovative financing , low cost land , and guaranteed utility ( gas , electric , water , access roads , etc. ) infrastructure .
In principal , a high density Special Residential Zone [ SRZ ] with clear rules and goals for all participants .
Once that platform is guaranteed by the local or national government , innovative developers will create low cost housing solutions because they will be assured of a reasonable profit .
Iqbal Jumabhoy , who by the way was born in India and now lives in Singapore , is constantly pushing our team to develop green technology solutions to incorporate into our commercial buildings .
Iqbal is a firm believer in developing innovative solutions to complex problems and is resolute in his quest to develop a better India .
Due to Iqbal ’s guidance and a market need , we ’ve managed to budget in innovative green technology solutions without affecting the cost of construction .
If real estate developers were able to see a reasonable profit by developing low cost housing on top of a government subsidized platform , I can assure you the innovations in this area would render even Steve Jobs speechless .
Of course the quality of construction will need to be monitored along with some necessary training , but the opportunity in this area for real estate developers is too rewarding weighed against any inconvenience of maintaining quality and attending training courses .
Why India Needs to Innovate
India needs to quickly develop its innovation ecosystem in order to maintain growth projections .
Threats to India ’s outsourcing business are on the horizon .
New emerging lower labor cost countries show signs of appearing and may cut into India ’s lucrative outsourcing business .
Combined with a weakening dollar and Indian salary inflation , the cost savings to Western countries grows less every day .
Fortunately , the use of English in India is allowing India to maintain its outsourcing lead and growth , but eventually this advantage will no longer be enough to sustain India ’s outsourcing lead .
We know that many Indians living outside of India are extremely innovative and like Jas Dhillon have developed innovative solutions because the US and Europe provide an innovative ecosystem .
We also know that some US companies like Lockheed Martin are utilizing young Indian innovators to create new products .
These foreign sponsored programs have shown early success and help prove that if an innovative platform opportunity exists , Indians rise to the challenge .
In the end , India ca n’t keep competing on low cost labor alone and needs to develop a new innovation strategy .
Innovation capability must be slowly ingrained into the DNA of the society while the government provides a level playing field to promote innovation .
India can start small , build a few platforms with well defined goals and rules , and then let Indian creativity burst into producing the next mobile banking application , energy neutral housing , or solar powered mobile phone .
In my next article I ’ll discuss how India ’s social graph can be leveraged to create new products and services faster .
I believe as NRI ’s return to India , they will demand and implement an ecosystem that encourages innovation .
Yet , India must give them more reasons to return .
Do you know of any innovative India companies ?

Those who predict the imminent death of TV might have to wait awhile .
There 's still a vast swath of land – commonly known as " Middle America " – where broadcast television works just fine , thanks .
New research suggests the people most likely to have an " Internet - connected digital living room " are relatively well - off families on the coasts , with household incomes of between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000 .
It 's a fancy demographic , for sure , and it excludes much of the nation .
" These upper middle class households would ideally have children and be located in a metropolitan area on the East or West Coast , " according to Multimedia Intelligence , a Scottsdale , Ariz . - based market research firm .
The research group surveyed 25,000 people in both English - and Spanish - speaking households , and they found , contrary to popular belief , it was n't the young , fabulous and tech - savvy who were most likely to digitally network their entertainment centers .
" Older households , those with a head of household age of 60 to 69 , are among the fastest growing segments adopting data home networking .
The number of US households in this category saw a compound annual growth rate of 29 percent between 2004 and 2007 , " according to Multimedia Intelligence .
Of course , Middle Americans are still free to turn to the web for their TV fix , but PCs and other portable devices are mostly unsatisfying for anything longer than 30 minutes .
So , until most Americans have fully networked their living rooms , it 's hard to imagine that broadcast television will evaporate or die any time soon .
We may be in the minority , though :
In recent months , a number of industry watchers – includingTiVo CEO Tom Rogers and internet entrepreneur Marc Andreessen – have predicted a tragic , newspaper - like fall for network television ( or old media ) .
The problem is four - fold :
The internet is cannibalizing TV audiences ; pirated cable TV shows are readily available online ; increasing numbers of people fast forward through the commercials now ( thanks to digital TV ) ; and finally , and this may be debatable , but critics say the programming just sucks .

Imagine if today , scientists discovered a drug that could save 13 per cent of all the babies who currently die .
Now imagine that drug also made your baby cleverer – and dramatically slashed her chances of developing heart disease , diabetes , leukaemia , asthma or obesity as an adult .
Oh : and imagine it was free .
The " drug " exists .
It is called breast milk .
Yet in the developed world , we often stigmatise women who give it to their babies as " creepy " .
In the developing world , we allow corporations to tug babies from their mother 's nipple , and put them on to powders that bring more profit – and more death .
I come at this from a strange perspective .
My mother breastfed me until I was nearly three ; she only stopped the day I wrote her a note saying I expected to be breastfed that afternoon .
Today , whenever I have a success , she clutches her breasts and exclaims : " It 's thanks to these ! "
Whenever my bottle - fed brother and sister have a failing in life , she howls : " Think what you could have been if I 'd given you the tit . "
( Whenever she gets a bit too self - congratulatory , I remind her she also smoked 40 cigarettes a day .
" Ach , " she says , " it 's stressful having a little bastard suckin ' at you all the time . " )

It 's the best thing you can do for your baby – without it I 'd be even fatter and more disease - ridden .
It 's good for you too , significantly reducing a mother 's risk of osteoporosis and cancer of the ovary .
Yet my mum was made to feel like a flasher .
She was glared at in public places , and asked to leave restaurants , parks and even buses .
Unsurprisingly , Britain today has the worst record on breastfeeding in the developed world , after Belgium .
Some 24 per cent of our babies never taste breast milk at all – and by six weeks , a majority have shifted entirely to formula .
Why ?
Why do we hobble our babies , and our country ?
Let 's rule out some of the more glib explanations .
The number of women who physically can't breastfeed with the right support is negligibly small : the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) puts it at 1 per cent .
Nor is it because women prefer the " liberation " of the bottle .
A Department of Health study found that 90 per cent of mothers who stopped feeding at six weeks said they wanted to carry on , while 40 per cent of those who stopped at six months felt the same .
The most primal reason belongs to an old , old story : women are conditioned to find their own bodies disgusting , except when they can be used to entice men .
A get - your - tits - out - for - the - lads culture does n't want you to get your tits out for your baby : they 're for titillation , not nurture .
This week , one of the Government 's best ministers – Harriet Harman – has succeeded in peeling this back , by including the legal right to breastfeed your baby in public into the new Equalities Bill .
But the biggest reason most women give for reluctantly pushing their baby on to the bottle is their need to return to work .
How do we change that ?
For clues , look at the country where breastfeeding rates are still 90 per cent at six months : Norway .
They give mothers a year off with 80 per cent pay , and give state employees breastfeeding breaks when they do come back .
Yes , this costs businesses some money up front – but it saves a fortune further down the line , because you have a cleverer workforce that pays more tax and puts less pressure on the health service .
If British babies were breastfed at Norwegian rates for just three months , the NHS would save £ 50 m annually in the treatment of one disease alone – gastroenteritis .
That leaves another dark explanation for the fall - off : the role of unchecked corporate power .
There is no profit to be made from a mother 's milk , so at the turn of the last century corporations tried to find a way to divert babies from nestling at their mother 's breast to Nestlé-ing at the corporate teat .
They invented " baby formula " and marketed it as the classier , cleaner alternative .
Cow & Gate powder was sold with a crown on the tin , bragging the Windsor children used it .
( Look how that turned out . )
Gradually , in the democratic world , the corporations were restrained from making the most blatantly bogus claims about breast milk – but they keep slipping the leash .
In Britain , they are banned from marketing baby formula to those younger than six months old .
But instead they market " follow - up formulas " for older kids with exactly the same logo , covered with claims that it is " closer than ever to breast milk " .
This has produced a situation of startling public ignorance , where a third of mums think baby formula is " as good " or even " better " than breast milk .
The poorest women know least and shift to formula first – adding another milky layer of inequality to our island .
This dodgy marketing needs to be banned today .
But this breast - con swells to a 52 DD scandal in the developing world .
I recently visited Bangladesh , where mothers are routinely told to abandon their healthy breast milk and spend great swaths of their income on formula .
I think of all the dead and dying babies I saw , and wonder how many could have been saved by a substance that was there , free , all along .
WHO calculates that 1.3 million babies die every year because they are not breastfed .
That 's a World Trade Centre - full a day .
Nestlé are still the most notorious offenders , controlling a near - majority of the world market .
In Botswana , Nestlé has distributed a pamphlet claiming if you give your baby its " acidified " formula , " diarrhoea and its side effects are counteracted " .
In reality , babies who use this rather than breast milk are more likely to contract diarrhoea – and die .
Public health campaigns can hardly fight back : the corporation 's annual marketing budget is bigger than the entire annual budget of the world 's 28 poorest countries .
Nestlé says they consistently promote breastfeeding as the first , best option – but in 1999 , a British Advertising Standards Authority studied the evidence and ruled they had to remove from their advertising the claim they sold their formula " ethically and responsibly " .
It is only tight , binding international regulation – here , and abroad – that will tame corporations from milking the poorest with misinformation .

And yet , for all the evidence , it still seems like an implausible story .
Can a powder mix of misogyny and unregulated corporate power really induce women against their will to harm their own children ?
It does , baby , every day .
These are still shockingly powerful forces .
Now suck on that – or fight back .

Many miles have been traveled since Fiji .
We spent a few weeks in the states visiting family and friends in the Bay Area and Tucson and getting used to being back " home " .
Now , we 're in the transition of moving across country and settling down in New York .
First step is figuring out the best way to move our stuff .
I 've gotten rid of a lot of my worldly possessions over the years but was stunned to find out how much stuff I still have and can't part with .
So we went with an option that is halfway between professional movers and a Uhaul truck .
This mini shipping container , a " ReloCube " , was delivered and it was the perfect size for the amount of stuff that we have to move .
We do the loading and they pick it up , put it on a truck , drive it cross country and deliver it to the new address where we unload it .
It 's the perfect solution for us as Michael ponders what to do with my bike .
It all fit with room to spare but unfortunately there was not enough room for my 14 foot sea kayak which will have to stay in Tucson .
We 're riding the rails for our trip to NY and turning the journey into a little vacation .
We have a nice sleeper car since we 're spending nearly 74 hours total on the train .
One of the first stops was El Paso and our sleeper car is the one right next to the sign .
The depot was a nice historic building right next to the border of Mexico .
Thirty - six hours later , we got off the train in New Orleans to spend a few days playing tourists and to ring in the New Year .
Jackson Square had the usual assortment of artists , musicians and tarot card / palm readers .
Silver is very in .
There are almost as many silver painted people here as there are Alabama and Utah fans here for the Sugar Bowl .

Mr. Obama has sought in recent weeks to deal pre-emptively with issues that shadowed him in the primary and on which Mr. McCain has already challenged him .
At a speech to Jewish leaders in Washington , he markedly toughened his statements about how he would deal with Iran after coming under attack for his pledge to meet with its leader ; he now almost always wears an American flag pin on his lapel after Republicans sought to raise questions about his patriotism by pointing to the absence of one .
While the lengthy , contentious Democratic primary fight against Mrs. Clinton exposed vulnerabilities in Mr. Obama that the Republicans will no doubt seek to exploit , it also allowed him to build a nearly nationwide network of volunteers and professional organizers .
While early assertions by presidential campaigns that they intend to expand the playing field are often little more than feints intended to force opponents to spend time and money defending states that they should have locked up , Mr. Obama ’s fund - raising success gives his campaign more flexibility than most to play in more places .
Mr. Obama ’s aides said some states where they intend to campaign  like Georgia , Missouri , Montana and North Carolina  might ultimately be too red to turn blue .
But the result of making an effort there could force Mr. McCain to spend money or send him to campaign in what should be safe ground , rather than using those resources in states like Ohio .
Mr. Obama ’s campaign manager , David Plouffe , said that the primary contest had left the campaign with strong get - out - the - vote operations in Republican states that were small enough that better - than - usual turnout could make a difference in the general election .
Among those he pointed to was Alaska , which last voted for a Democrat in 1964 .
“ Do we have to win any of those to get to 270 ? ” Mr. Plouffe said , referring to the number of electoral votes needed to win the election .
“ No .
Do we have reason to think we can be competitive there ?
Yes .
Do we have organizations in those states to be competitive ?
Yes .
This is where the primary was really helpful to us now . ”
Image Senator Barack Obama , with Representative Rahm Emanuel , made an unscheduled stop Friday at a Chicago 2016 Olympics rally .

Mr. Plouffe also pointed to Oregon and Washington , states that have traditionally been competitive and where Mr. Obama defeated Mrs. Clinton , as places the campaign could have significant advantages .
The Federal Marriage Amendment is back — with Vitter ’s and Craig ’s support
Just this week , a group of Republican senators re-introduced the Federal Marriage Amendment to the Constitution , which , as we know , would ban gay marriage .
And once again , the language is pretty straightforward :
Section 1 . This article may be cited as the ` Marriage Protection Amendment ’ .
Section 2 . Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman .
Neither this Constitution , nor the constitution of any State , shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman .’.
This is n’t especially surprising .
Republicans are looking at the political landscape , and they ’re feeling awfully discouraged .
The polls look bad , the base looks depressed , and fundraising looks iffy .
Rallying the far - right troops with an anti-gay amendment to the Constitution — even though it has no chance at even getting so much as a hearing — might be helpful to the conservative movement .
But the funny part is looking over the list of the 10 original sponsors .
Most of the names are predictable — Brownback and Inhofe , for example — but there are two others whose names stand out : Sens. David Vitter ( R - La. ) and Larry Craig ( R - Idaho ) .
Yes , two of the principal sponsors of a constitutional amendment to “ protect ” marriage include one far - right Republican who hired prostitutes and another far - right Republican who was arrested for soliciting gay sex an airport men ’s room .
As my friend Kyle put it , these two are “ not exactly the poster boys of the family values crowd or particularly upstanding examples of the supposed sanctity of the ‘ union of a man and a woman . ” ‘
Digg it !
Management guru Peter Drucker noted that companies attracting the best knowledge workers will " secure the single biggest factor for competitive advantage . "
We and other forward - looking companies put a lot of effort into hiring such people .
What are we looking for ?
At the highest level , we are looking for non-routine problem - solving skills .
We expect applicants to be able to solve routine problems as a matter of course .
After all , that 's what most education is concerned with .
But the non-routine problems offer the opportunity to create competitive advantage , and solving those problems requires creative thought and tenacity .
Here 's a real - life example , a challenge a team of our engineers once faced : designing a spell - checker for the Google search engine .
The routine solution would be to run queries through a dictionary .
The non-routine , creative solution is to use the query corrections and refinements that other users have made in the past to offer spelling suggestions for new queries .
This approach enables us to correct all the words that are n't in the dictionary , helping many more users in the process .
How do we find these non-routine savants ?
There are many factors , of course , but we primarily look for ...
... analytical reasoning .
Google is a data - driven , analytic company .
When an issue arises or a decision needs to be made , we start with data .
That means we can talk about what we know , instead of what we think we know .
... communication skills .
Marshalling and understanding the available evidence is n't useful unless you can effectively communicate your conclusions .
... a willingness to experiment .
Non-routine problems call for non-routine solutions and there is no formula for success .
A well - designed experiment calls for a range of treatments , explicit control groups , and careful post - treatment analysis .
Sometimes an experiment kills off a pet theory , so you need a willingness to accept the evidence even if you do n't like it .
... team players .
Virtually every project at Google is run by a small team .
People need to work well together and perform up to the team 's expectations .
... passion and leadership .
This could be professional or in other life experiences : learning languages or saving forests , for example .
The main thing , to paraphrase Mr. Drucker , is to be motivated by a sense of importance about what you do .
These characteristics are not just important in our business , but in every business , as well as in government , philanthropy , and academia .
The challenge for the up - and - coming generation is how to acquire them .
It 's easy to educate for the routine , and hard to educate for the novel .
Keep in mind that many required skills will change : developers today code in something called Python , but when I was in school C was all the rage .
The need for reasoning , though , remains constant , so we believe in taking the most challenging courses in core disciplines : math , sciences , humanities .
And then keep on challenging yourself , because learning does n't end with graduation .
In fact , in the real world , while the answers to the odd - numbered problems are not in the back of the textbook , the tests are all open book , and your success is inexorably determined by the lessons you glean from the free market .
Learning , it turns out , is a lifelong major .

Interesting discussion

Usability is an inexact science , but I ’m pretty sure there is at least one golden rule that is non-negotiable , and that ’s this :
Never , ever , insult your users .
Unless your web site revolves around insults , and every error message consists of a purposefully engineered insult for humorous reasons , treating your users with disdain or disrespect is a huge no -no .
Earlier today I decided to sign up for reddit , the popular social bookmarking service .
My experience has turned me right off the service .
Here ’s my rant :
1. The CAPTCHA
First , I clicked Submit Link , and was presented with an option to register .
I ’m personally not a huge fan of CAPTCHAs , for many reasons ( there are alternatives , but there ’s no panacea ) , but I do empathise with why people put them in place .
Unlike someone who has poor eyesight , I can usually read the letters , and it ’s usually only once that I need to type them in , so we ’ll let that slide for now .
And at least the letters in reddit ’s CAPTCHA are relatively easy to decipher compared with others that I ’ve seen in use … right ?
Wrong .
2. The Insult
Here ’s what I was presented with after clicking the Create Account button :
Apparently those letters were n’t as easy to decipher as I thought !
Here ’s the clincher though — not only was my attempt at passing the CAPTCHA unsuccessful , but I was insulted for my trouble !
3 . The Déjà vu
Once I ’d managed to endure a second CAPTCHA and finally registered , I thought that would be the end of it .
But no !
I was immediately presented with another CAPTCHA that I needed to pass in order to actually submit a link .
After having already been insulted , this made me really grumpy .
Proving that I ’m a human is annoying and somewhat degrading , so getting me to jump through that hoop a second time is downright rude .
But , like I said , at least the letters displayed in the CAPTCHA were reasonable easy to decipher , right ?
( Ahem ! )
At this stage my only thought is “ If I ’m going to be asked to do this every time I submit a link , I ’m going to be turned off the service pretty quickly … especially if I ’m going to be insulted some more every time I get it wrong . ”
4 . The false accusation
Hooray , so I passed the CAPTCHA .
But wait —
I ’ve been presented with another hurdle !
This infuriated me .
Too fast ?
What does that mean ?
This was the first link I ’d ever submitted .
Was I meant to type more slowly or something ?
I ’m assuming this is a bug , and should only be presented if a user tries to submit too many links in a given period ( which I did n’t ) .
But that aside , even if this had been my second link , why should I be prevented from submitting something within a certain period if I ’ve already proven I ’m human ?
Thoroughly peeved , I went off to lunch and left the submission page in my browser , to tackle when I got back .
If I could be bothered .
5. More Insults
Back from lunch , and I ’ve tried again — only to receive more insults for my trouble ( note the CAPTCHA image changed after it rejected my attempt , hence the discrepancy below ) .
Argh !
Apparently I still ca n’t read ( cos you know , it ’s clearly my fault … honestly , can anyone tell me what I ’m missing with these damn CAPTCHAs ? ) .
At this point , I decided to pack up and leave .
I ’d experienced enough friction ( and been insulted and falsely accused too many times ) to decide that reddit was not worth my trouble .
Am I being too harsh ?
Is it reasonable to pick on one site when no doubt there are plenty of usability issues that need addressing with our own site ?
( although we certainly do n’t insult any of our customers ! )
Should I have approached reddit privately first before posting in a public forum about it ?
Maybe .
I figured they ’re big enough that they can probably take it .
To be honest , though , I ’m more interested in hearing your horror stories with signup processes and CAPTCHAs … does it get any worse ?
It would be hard for Florida to surpass its disastrous performance in the 2000 election , but give the Sunshine State credit for trying .
Its latest assault on democracy : a law threatening volunteer groups with crippling fines if they make small mistakes in registering voters .
The law seems clearly aimed at keeping new voters  especially minorities and the poor  off the rolls .
And it is working .
The League of Women Voters , which has registered Florida voters since 1939 , has called off its registration drive this year .
Florida is not the only state trying to stop eligible people from voting .
Georgia passed a law in 2005 that made voters pay for their voter ID cards  a modern poll tax .
The fee was eventually removed , but the law could still block as many as 300,000 registered voters without the right ID from casting ballots .
In 2004 , Ohio ordered counties to throw out voter registration forms that were not on thick enough paper .
It is chilling to think that state legislators and election officials would intentionally try to make it harder for Americans to vote , but they always have  with poll taxes , literacy tests and gerrymandering .
There was a time when the Supreme Court regularly struck these restrictions down .
In 1966 , it held Virginia ’s $ 1.50 poll tax unconstitutional .
In 1972 , it ruled that Tennessee ’s one - year residency requirement for voting violated the Constitution .
Now the Supreme Court has switched sides .
This week , it upheld a harsh Indiana voter ID law that could disenfranchise many poor , elderly and student voters .
The ruling will make it even easier for other states to block voters ’ access to the ballot box .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf is experiencing further disintegration that is threatening the collapse of the ice bridge connecting the shelf to Charcot Island .
Since the connection to the island in the image centre helps to stabilise the ice shelf , it is likely the break - up of the bridge will put the remainder of the ice shelf at risk .
This animation , comprised of images acquired by Envisat ’s Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar ( ASAR ) between 30 May and 9 July 2008 , shows the break - up event which began on the east ( right ) rather than the on west ( left ) like the previous event that occurred last month .
By 8 July , a fracture that could open the ice bridge was visible .
According to the image acquired on 7 July 2008 , Dr Matthias Braun from the Center for Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces at Bonn University estimates the area lost on the Wilkins Ice Shelf during this break - up event is about 1350 km² with a rough estimate of 500 to 700 km² in addition being lost if the bridge to Charcot Island collapses .
This break - up is puzzling to scientists because it has occurred in the Southern Hemispheric winter and does not have characteristics similar to two earlier events that occurred in 2008 , which were comparable to the break - up of the Larsen - A and - B ice shelves .
" The scale of rifting in the newly - removed areas seems larger , and the pieces are moving out as large bergs and not toppled , finely - divided ice melange , " said Ted Scambos from the National Snow and Ice Data Center who uses ASAR images to track the area .
" The persistently low sea ice cover in the area and data from some interesting sources , electronic seal hats [ caps worn by seals that provide temperature , depth and position data ] seems to suggest that warm water beneath the halocline may be reaching the underside of the Wilkins Ice Shelf and thinning it rapidly - and perhaps reaching the surface , or at least mixing with surface waters . "
Prof. David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) said : " Wilkins Ice Shelf is the most recent in a long , and growing , list of ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula that are responding to the rapid warming that has occurred in this area over the last fifty years .

" Current events are showing that we were being too conservative , when we made the prediction in the early 1990s that Wilkins Ice Shelf would be lost within thirty years - the truth is it is going more quickly than we guessed . "
The Wilkins Ice Shelf , a broad plate of floating ice south of South America on the Antarctic Peninsula that is connected to Charcot and Latady Islands , had been stable for most of the last century before it began retreating in the 1990s .
By studying ESA ERS SAR satellite images since the 1990s , Braun and his colleague Dr Angelika Humbert from the Institute of Geophysics , Münster University , have found the Wilkins Ice Shelf has break - up events with loss of large areas rather than underlying ordinary , continuous calving .
For instance , in February 2008 an area of about 400 km² broke off from the Wilkins Ice Shelf , narrowing the ice bridge that connects it to Charcot and Latady Islands down to a 6 km strip .
From 30 to 31 May 2008 it experienced further break - up with an area of about 160 km² breaking off , reducing the ice bridge to just 2.7 km .
Braun and Humbert are monitoring the ice sheet daily via Envisat acquisitions as part of their contribution to the International Polar Year ( IPY ) 2007 - 2008 , a large worldwide science programme focused on the Arctic and Antarctic .

Satellite data are essential for observing polar regions .
Envisat ’s ASAR instrument is able to produce high - quality images , even through clouds and darkness .
Therefore , it is particularly suited to acquire images over Antarctica during the local winter period where hours of daylight are limited and cloud cover is quite frequent .
" ESA provides daily ASAR images that are easily accessible to scientists .
It is particularly rewarding for us to see that the Envisat data are essential for scientists to quickly and easily observe these ice - shelf phenomena – a luxury that was not available to the scientific community a few years ago , " ESA Envisat Mission Manager Henri Laur said .
" ESA is committed to continue monitoring the polar areas with Envisat and in the future with the GMES Sentinel - 1 satellite . "
In an effort to ensure as much SAR data as possible is made available to scientists and polar region projects during IPY , ESA is coordinating with other space agencies worldwide , such as Japan ’s JAXA , the Canadian Space Agency and the German and Italian space agencies , to acquire additional SAR data over these areas with their own satellites .
As part of an interview with The Onion A.V. Club website last June , Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk agreed to answer a few fan questions , including one from someone named MollyPocket , who wondered if true underground movements were still possible , or was " the Internet making everything too readily available to everyone ? "
Palahniuk 's answer , in short , was yes and no .
" There will always be an underground , " he replied , and predicted " a backlash of veiled , hidden societies " in response to the overload of information provided by reality television and confessional memoirs .
The underground , and especially the subcultures that inhabit it , have been much debated and examined since British academic Dick Hebdige published Subculture : The Meaning of Style ( 1979 ) , a groundbreaking examination of the symbols and rituals of the punk subculture in London .
Almost a decade after Subculture , in an essay reflecting on youth culture , Hebdige wrote : " Subculture forms up in the space between surveillance and the evasion of surveillance , it translates the fact of being under scrutiny into the pleasure of being watched .
It is a hiding in the light . "
Palahniuk 's answer suggests that while the technological infrastructure of how culture is distributed has changed dramatically in the past 15 years , the psychology of subculture remains stable .
But what if the pleasure of being watched has so thoroughly overwhelmed the evasive component of subculture as to make it non-existent ?
What if the problem with contemporary subcultures is n't only Google and YouTube and blogs and MySpace , but the participants themselves ?
To better understand the relationship between technology and the underground , let 's visit the blog Dead Things on Sticks .
It is there that Toronto - based television writer Denis McGrath provides a useful reminder of how the cultural fringe operated in the 1980s .
" To a one , those high school teachers did n't understand this `humour , ' this irony that we all were sucking up from Letterman like air , " he writes .
" We were like ravenous zombies scouring the world for things to make us laugh ...
No Internet , no 176 cable channels devoted to our tiny slice of interest ; no marketers catering directly to us .
It was Letterman or teen ski-and - sex movies .
That 's it . "
While it is difficult to argue for physical restrictions on cultural distribution , there is something to be said for the pre-DVD , pre-MP3 , pre-binary era of culture .
As McGill 's Erin MacLeod writes in a 2004 article for the online journal FlowTV , " My somewhat fuzzy full season of The Ben Stiller Show was a prized possession that became worthless on 11 December 2003 , the date that the complete 1992 - 93 season was released on DVD for the low price of $ 26.99 . "
MacLeod is not so much upset about the improved quality the DVD offered , but the loss of community it represents :
" The community that is created as a result of love for a TV program –especially a short - lived one – is disrupted by this instantaneous availability . "
Physical restrictions on cultural access in the pre-digital era not only created fan communities by necessity , but also influenced the politics of the end product .
Punk , for example , was forced to create a parallel system of marketing and distribution , a series of nodes , be it mail order or alternate venues in order to be seen and heard .
While few yearn for a return to the age of VHS samizdat , something is lost in the otherwise superior delivery of culture provided by file - sharing networks and Netflix .
However , if all YouTube and the ubiquitous file - sharing application BitTorrent do is make it easier to see old TV shows and movies , this article would end here .
But this same technology is also altering the output of the current underground .
IN MARCH 2004 , New York Times Magazine columnist Rob Walker described how a non-mainstream sensibility , combined with a file - sharing infrastructure , has led to the " mass underground . "
Using DJ Danger Mouse as an example , Walker argued that the Grey Album – the wonderful , illegal " mash - up " of Jay - Z's The Black Album and The Beatles ' so - called " white album " – was easily accessible to anyone with Internet access and a bit of computer savvy , yet it still hovered below the mainstream radar .
The mass underground is filled with thousands of poorly kept secrets , a new cultural category that includes lonelygirl15 , that OK
Go video with the treadmills , and any number of legally free - for - the - taking words and music , such as Cory Doctorow 's novel Someone Comes to Town , Someone Leaves Town and Nine Inch Nails ' new album The Slip .
These cultural expressions can be downloaded once , or a million times , at no additional cost to anyone .
( As if to underscore the importance of this new cultural arena , New York 's Parsons New School for Design has announced a course on being " Internet Famous . " )
The mass underground sounds like a good idea , and suggests a kind of cultural meritocracy , where the best video or free song wins .
But the mass underground distorts the equilibrium suggested by Hebdige 's hiding in the light .
Because built into the technology and logic of the mass underground is the possibility of blowing up huge .
As the title of an October 2006 New Yorker article about YouTube fame suggests , " It Should Happen to You . "
And it happened to Andrew Struthers , a Victoria - based filmmaker and journalist .
In the summer of 2006 , he went into his backyard with a Super - 8 camera and created Spiders on Drugs , a funny and very short little film that cost $ 300 to make .
It did well in film festivals , where , as he writes in a 2007 article for B.C. Web mag The Tyee , " it was seen by tens of people . "
But Struthers wanted to reach a larger audience , so in January 2007 , he decided to post it to YouTube .
In less than a week , the spider flick received more than a million views , but not before Struthers had to shut down a rival YouTuber who had illegally claimed the spider video as his own .
The success of the film was vindication for Struthers , who had the idea seven years ago but never convinced anyone to provide him with funding .
YouTube gave his film the audience it deserved .
Cue happy ending .
Except that the act of observing alters the thing being observed , along the lines of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle .
The " Total Plays " and " Views " counters on MySpace and YouTube are not neutral odometers , which helps to explain why Struthers ' article reads like a frenzied day trader riding a volatile stock to success .
" Six days in , the hit count was up to 750,0000 and I had over a thousand emails .
I was shovelling them out like snow . "
A FEW PARAGRAPHS later : " It 's 3 p.m. on Tuesday , one week since I had the idea .
I 've just hit the million mark , and there are 55 pages of comments . "
We 're excited for spider guy , of course , but ultimately his YouTube rollercoaster is reduced to a numbers game .
Spiders on Drugs was an offline piece of underground humour that exploded , unexpectedly , online .
But what about Struthers ' next short film ?
For participants in the mass underground , the possibility of becoming a sensation can eventually be hardwired into the act of creation itself .
That is , the cultural output of the mass underground internalizes the logic of Amazon.com sales rankings , or the most - emailed articles list from newspaper websites .
In the mass underground , evading surveillance is neither possible nor desirable .
Once subcultural expression is converted into binary format , the thinking goes , not only can everyone have access to it , but everyone should .
It would be wrong , however , to simply blame the technologies for eroding subcultural incubation .
Ego and the desire for fame and fortune are hardly recent inventions .
For Andrew Wernick , a professor at Trent University , the problem is that our desire for attention and fame is leeching into the creative groundwater .
As he writes in his 1991 book Promotional Culture : " When a piece of music , or a newspaper article , or even an academically written book about promotional culture , is fashioned with an eye to how it will promote itself – and , indeed , how it will promote its author and distributor , together with all the other producers these named agencies may be identified with – such goods are affected by this circumstance in every detail of their production . "
Thus , Terryworld , the 2004 coffee - table collection of work by cutting - edge fashion photographer Terry Richardson , includes a significant number of images of Richardson himself , posing with his models , because taking photographs of other people is passé in the world of promotional culture .
A May 2007 Wall Street Journal article about expectant parents who are selecting baby names based on Googleability shows the extent of the promotional culture mentality .
As reporter Kevin J. Delaney writes , " Many people aspire for themselves – or their offspring – to command prominent placement in the top few links on search engines or social networking sites ' member lookup functions . "
We imprint our desires onto technology as much as technology attempts to reshape our mental circuit boards .
At the same time , Web 2.0 allows delusions of grandeur to float ever higher , and naturalizes the logic of promotional culture .
Or , to put it another way , Google can't force you to name your baby Featherblanket Smith .
But the prominence and importance we place on Google search rankings means that if you do name your child Featherblanket , people might not think it 's a bad idea .
The exception to the rule is graffiti artist and provocateur Banksy .
His entire artistic practice is built around remaining anonymous , about managing to spray - paint works of art onto the sides of buildings without being caught .
Of course , we reward his ability to avoid surveillance by paying thousands of dollars for his work , which is collected by celebrities such as Christina Aguilera and Angelina Jolie .
His art is both a commentary on surveillance and a record of the process of avoiding it .
But Banksy is not hiding in the light ( like Kurt Cobain did , when he appeared on the cover of the April 1992 issue of Rolling Stone wearing sunglasses and a T - shirt that said " Corporate magazines still suck " ) so much as hiding in plain sight , ( which is what Jason Bourne does in The Bourne Supremacy when he eludes capture by arranging a meeting in Alexanderplatz , a large public square in Berlin ) .
Hiding in plain sight is also the idea behind TrackMeNot , a Firefox plug - in that automatically creates fake , random search strings for Google .
The resulting info - garble is meant to scramble attempts at surveillance and data - profiling attempts .
Specialized barcodes called Quick Response codes , meanwhile , are being used by marketers and subcultures alike to scramble information .
These large barcodes , which can be " read " by cellphones with the right software , are another way of deflecting a bit of the light that shines on the underground .
Which means Palahniuk is wrong .
The next subculture or underground movement will not be discovered behind the door of a secret handshake speakeasy somewhere in East Berlin , but in the center of Alexanderplatz ; hiding in plain sight , everywhere and nowhere , simultaneously .
Note : Portions of this article appeared in a different form in Broken Pencil .
There 's a certain class of ways to get free money or free stuff simply by paying attention , keeping track , and being careful .
I do n't do these things .
It 's not because they do n't work ; it 's not even because the risk - adjusted earnings do n't pay for the time spent .
It 's because time -- and especially time spent paying attention -- is very precious .
The clearest example of the sort of thing I 'm taking about is getting a cash advance from a new credit card with a zero- percent teaser rate .
Slap that money in your high - interest savings account , pay off the loan when it 's due , and you can pocket the interest .
Borrow $ 100,000 and you could pick up close to $ 2000 of free money in six months .
The thing that makes these schemes tempting is that they seem so easy .
After all , you already pay your other bills on - time .
For paying one more bill on time for six months you get paid $ 2000 ?
What 's not to like ?
Well , one thing not to like is that there 's a dozen ways to screw up .
Accidentally use the card for an ordinary purchase , and suddenly the interest rate is no longer zero .
Make a payment late and suddenly the rate jumps up high enough that you owe more for one month than you were earning in six .
In some cases , making the final payment late can allow them to retroactively change the zero percent teaser rate to their regular rate , and suddenly instead of coming out $ 2000 ahead , you find yourself $ 10,000 behind .
So , I do n't do that sort of thing .
I 'm organized enough to be successful at them , but I know from experience that things go awry .
If you 're 99 % successful at paying your bills on time , but you 've got a dozen bills that need to be paid every month , you can expect an average of 1.4 late payments per year .
The list of things that can lead to such a mistake is endless -- busy at work , busy at home , illness , injury , family emergency -- and that 's not counting the possibility that someone else might screw up in a way that costs you money .
Even if you automate your bill paying , things can go wrong .
Maybe your bank merges with another bank and you have to move all your automated bill - paying to the new bank 's system .
If you make a mistake with your power bill , it 's no big deal -- just fix it .
If you make a mistake with the $ 100,000 zero -rate card it could cost you a lot .
Maybe your bank makes a mistake and bounces one of your checks .
They 'll admit that it's a mistake and refund the bounced - check fee , but good luck on convincing them that they need to reimburse you for several month 's interest on $ 100,000 .
The strict way to analyze this is to do a probability - weighted payoff analysis .
If 99 % of the time you make $ 2,000 and 1 % of the time you lose $ 10,000 , then your expected return would be $ 1880 .
( .99 times $ 2000 minus .01 times $ 10,000 ) .
Now calculate that as an hourly wage .
If you spend , let 's say , one hour setting the whole thing up and then ten minutes a month making sure everything 's on track , then over six months you 've spent a total of two hours , giving you an equivalent wage of $ 940 an hour .
Woo hoo !
Not many people get paid that much .
Even so , I never do this .
The reason -- the real , fundamental reason -- is that it would take my attention .
I 'd end up spending way more than than ten minutes a month with this on my mind .
I 'd be lucky to keep it down to ten minutes a day -- at which point my hourly wage drops down to about $ 60 , which although nothing to sneeze at , is a wage I can probably match by doing work that 's a lot more rewarding -- work that helps other people or that produces something of value or that furthers my career or that teaches me a new skill .
Because of that , I avoid all schemes of this sort .
I do n't take " free " magazine subscriptions or " free " credit monitoring services that you have to remember to cancel after a month or else pay for a full year .
If I want a copy of a magazine , I 'll pay a few dollars and buy one ( or , if I just want to look at it , I 'll go to the library and look at their copy ) .
My time and attention are very precious to me .
If I 'm going to spend them , it 's going to be on something that earns more than just money .
Whenever I can possibly manage it , it 's going to be on something that 's really worth doing .
Tomashova won gold at the 2003 and 2005 world championships Seven Russian athletes have been provisionally suspended for doping offences , the International Association of Athletics Federations has announced .
Five of the seven - Yelena Soboleva , Tatyana Tomashova , Yulia Fomenko , Darya Pishchalnikova and Gulfiya Khanafeyeva - were bound for the Beijing Olympics .
The other two athletes are Svetlana Cherkasova and Olga Yegorova .
Romania have dropped Elena Antoci and Cristina Vasiloiu from their Olympic team because of suspicion of doping .
The pair are both 1500 m runners and they follow in the footsteps of fellow 1500 m competitor Liliana Popescu , who was dropped from the country 's Olympic team under similar circumstances earlier this month .
Russian Yegorova was booed on her way to claiming the 5,000 m title at the World Championships in Edmonton in 2001 .
She had tested positive for EPO but had been reinstated in the event on a technicality concerning the drugs test .
Before the heats for the women 's 5,000 m Paula Radcliffe and Great Britain team - mate Hayley Tullett held up a sign in the stands reading " EPO cheats out " .
These rule violations were established following the deliberate storage of samples by the IAAF and re-analysis using comparative DNA techniques
IAAF statement Soboleva - the reigning 1500 m world indoor champion - is the world leader over 800 m and 1500 m this year , while Tomashova was world champion in 2003 and 2005 and claimed silver at the Athens Olympics four years ago .
Fomenko finished second behind Soboleva over 1500 m at the world indoor championships in Valencia earlier this year .
The two field - eventers are also of pedigree , with Pishchalnikova the reigning European discus champion and hammer thrower Khanafeyeva a former world record holder .
The seven have been charged under IAAF rules for a " fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process " , according to a statement from the world governing body .
The statement continued : " These rule violations were established following the deliberate storage of samples by the IAAF and re-analysis using comparative DNA techniques . "
The IAAF added the suspensions were " the result of a specific investigation which was instigated and carried out by the IAAF for more than a year " .
And the statement concluded : " The IAAF will make no further comment until a final decision has been taken by the ARAF ( All Russia Athletics Federation ) , which now takes over the responsibility to adjudicate these cases . "
The athletes have up to 14 days to request a hearing with the national member federation .
If a hearing is requested , it must be held within a period of two months .
The Beijing Olympics athletics schedule is set to get under way on Friday , 15 August .

What could possibly go wrong ?
If you read through the material on this website then it seems to me that you will have plenty of clues .
I want one thing to go right in November .
And that is the reality of clean , transparent , accurate and honest elections !!

" GOP Losing Its Grip On Multiple House Seats "
As if it matters !
The entire congress could be comprised of people who claim to be a Dem and the White House occupants could be pro-war / pro-corporate Barack " Hope / Change " Obama ( with Queen Hillary and Bill at his side ) who also claims to be a Dem , and little / nothing would change from the status quo , other than possibly some " window dressing " stuff for show .

LOL .
Dream on !
Why would any thinking person ( versus a wishful - thinking partisan person ) think that a 2008 " election " ( if there is one ) would be any different than the last two STOLEN ( 2000 and 2004 ) presidential " elections ? "
I 've read some comments saying " you must vote Democratic . "
Yeah , if you want the status quo that 's what you will do and I say that based on the Dems " enabling job " and ass-eating of Bush since 2000 to this day .
If one wants positive progressive CHANGE , one will vote for either : Nader / Gonzalez ( independents ) or Cynthia McKinney ( Green )
But I know most people wo n't have the courage or intelligence to vote for someone other than a politician with a D ( or R ) behind their name because that 's how most people have been programmed from , in many cases , childhood .
And it 's very difficult to deprogram that without professional help .
That partisan programming in people is really no different than the programming of religious beliefs .

Erma ,
If you recall in 2000 , Nader said that he was willing to endure a Bush presidency for a few years if it meant that people would then dart for the political left afterwards .
Well , now that 's happening , and you 're complaining that they 're not running far enough to the left ?!
Besides , I could never vote for a man who was willing to put up with a Bush 43 presidency as part of some political gamble .
To me , that 's as bad as HRC voting for Bush 's war as part of a political calculation to make herself a viable presidential candidate in ' 08 .
Both Nader & Hillary forgot that the idea of an opposition party is to OPPOSE Bush 's policies , not endorse them .
History will not be kind to either Clinton or Nader for that .

You know , I think Nader was poison in 2000 because of the meme about there being no difference between * and Gore .
There was , and is , a cosmos of difference between them .
I do n't care what excuse he has for it , that may have been the single most damaging thing in Fiasco 2000 .
I can't tell you how many average Joes I heard repeating that outrageous bit of fallacious reasoning .
And , if we were not all so conditioned to parrot outrageous bits of fallacious reasoning from the establishment , I do n't think many of us could disagree that Cynthia McKinney is the single best candidate we have in 2008 .
She has the experience , the dedication to truth and the Constitution , and definitely the guts and heart to be Commander in Chief .
I was whining that I 'd like her for president a couple years ago .
It makes me crazy that we 're never going to get my kind of president .
Not in my lifetime , anyway .

The bottom line is who do people want to be President , Obama or McCain ?
I can buy into Brad 's argument that it is a good idea to vote one 's conscience in lopsided states so that third parties can get their funding .
In 2000 I voted for Nader because Gore had Massachusetts for sure .
There are a lot of things that go into stealing these elections .
It does appear that the closer the vote , the harder it is to rig them .
So why would anyone vote against Obama in close states ?
In the purple states a vote for McKinney will be a vote for McCain .
There is a big influx of noise on the internet .
People actually expect to be taken seriously when they say do n't vote at all .
There is the influx of people saying that Dems and Reps are all part of the same cesspool .
That is bull .
Check out Larry Johnson 's spook website no quarters if you can stomach it .
It is not even readable .
You have people working for Democrats for McCain .
You have people spreading all kind of crap on Obama .
One last note .
Kos Zuniga has admitted that he pays people to post .
He calls it a fellowship program .
It would be nice to find out every name that gets a paycheck from Kos. Mark Lindeman ?
DHinMI ?
What about Anonymous Army ?
Was he getting paid by Kos or perhaps Diebold ?
The internet is rigged .

There are some people who continue to put out the lie and disinformation that when a person votes for Cynthia McKinney or Ralph Nader that they are not voting for McKinney or Nader ( LOL ) , but rather they are voting for McCain .
Bull shit .
Some people will try anything to attempt to fool others .
If I vote for Ms McKinney , she is the candidate I 'm voting for .
Period .
I 'm NOT voting for McCain and never would .
Period .
And some people can keep putting that lie out there all they want and call it a " fact " but that does n't make it so .
It is simply Dem partisan pabulum which mainly the Dem koolaid drinking suckers like to spew .
And I 'm sick of hearing it .
Every so - called " election " we hear this same shit from the Dem koolaid drinkers , the pathetic gullible naive suckers that they are ( remember they were jumping up and down and celebrating the night of the 2006 " election " because these suckers thought that things were going to change just because the Dems were now in the majority .
They expected the Dems in congress to do a 180 overnight and stop enabling the Bush regime .
Ha !... It 's only gotten WORSE with every passing day since .
These were also the same damn fools who said the Traitor of the House Pelosi was not serious when she said " impeachment is off the table " well before the " election . "
I told the Dem koolaid drinkers that she was absolutely serious .
They began calling me every name one can think of .
And using that twisted " thinking " , one could say that a vote for Obama ( who supported Liebermann ) is a vote for McCain .
Because both candidates will continue the status quo .
Source : Barack Obama : " I am absolutely certain Connecticut is going to have the good sense to send Joe Lieberman back to the U.S. Senate so he can continue to serve on our behalf . "
http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/29228
When election are stolen they are made to look very close ( examples : 2000 and 2004 presidential " elections " ) whether they were actually very close or not in reality .
One should vote for the candidates of their choice and not out of some herd / sheep fear mentality ( ex. the " a vote for McKinney is a vote for McCain " nonsense ) .
I have no intention whatsoever of voting for Obama or McCain .
If there is an " election " I will either vote for : Gonzales / Nader ( that 's how I think of it since I prefer Matt Gonzales to Ralph ) or Cynthia McKinney .
And when I vote for either , they are the candidates I 'm voting for .
Because I want positive progressive change .
I do n't want the status quo ( Obama / McCain ) .
A couple of months ago I read an article where Gore was speaking about the 2000 " election " and the reason he gave for his " loss " ( even though he did n't lose ) had nothing to do with Nader .
He did n't even mention Nader as the reason .
Unfortunately , at the moment I forget the reason he gave , but I just found it interesting .
Because ever since , the Dem koolaid drinkers have been trotting out Nader as the reason .
Instead , they should be taking ownership and responsibility for their own party 's failures and the pathetic campaign that Gore ran .
But they refuse to do that .
Gore and the Supremes were to blame for his " losing . "

You referring to me ?
Anyone who goes on the internet and tries to get people to vote for McKinney , Nader , or any other person who has no chance to win when the state is a toss up is flat out wrong .
This forum is no different from any other and is getting worked on by either paid agents or their useful idiots .
Such people , even when you show them the errors of their ways , they 'll come back with nothing but ad hominems .
Maybe someone should find the thread from a few years ago when Erma lied about her age .
I used to stick up for people like this , but sometimes I am too trusting and get burned .
OBAMA WAS AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR .
GO AHEAD AND VOTE FOR MCKINNEY IN A CLOSE STATE .
IF YOU DO , THAT'S A VOTE FOR MCCAIN .

It does appear that the closer the vote , the harder it is to rig them .
Sorry , my first post above should have read the closer the vote , the easier it seems to rig them .
Sorry for any inconvenience .

If there were only two choices , Obama and McCain , who does the good person select ?
Obviously Obama .
But not according to Larry Spooky Johnson or any of these other people telling us not to vote , or the others who keep astroturfing that democrats and republicans are the same .
In close states , there are only two choices , McCain or Obama .
Anyone saying otherwise is either disinfo or badly misinformed .

Someone wrote this stuff : " OBAMA WAS AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR . "
Initially , he claimed to be against the attack on Iraq , but at the time Barack " Hope / Change " Obama was n't even in the Senate to vote one way or the other on it .
And you conveniently omitted that he has continued to vote " yes " for the funding of the occupation which is the same as being for war and for the occupation .
Because the funding continues the war / occupation which he initially claimed to oppose .
Someone wrote this stuff : " Anyone who goes on the internet and tries to get people to vote for McKinney , Nader , or any other person who has no chance to win when the state is a toss up is flat out wrong . "
LOL .
I 'm not trying to get anyone to do anything .
That 's just your partisan " spin " of what I wrote .
I do n't care who or what people vote for .
I have my preference and I 've already stated it .
It just astounds me that after all this time and one " election " cycle after the other , most people still do n't get it that one cannot stay in the same voting rut ( presumably of this " lesser of two evils " bullshit ) voting for pro-war and pro-corporate Establishment Republicrat politicians .
And then they expect change !
LOL .
I mean , how thick / dense are some people who insist that people must vote for the Establishment candidates regardless .
And then they wonder why nothing changes .
DUH .
But I 'm not the one on here trying to programme / order / tell / dictate to people which candidate they must vote for , or else .
How silly .
One must vote their conscience .
That 's what I intend to do .
( And writing a sentence in all caps holds no more credibility than a sentence written in lower case ) .

Obama has consistently been against the Iraq war .
He is not against the action in Afghanistan .
He has been consistent on both .
I find Nader the most self - centered of candidates , I were it simply McCain and Nader , I would have to find a third party to vote for .
If you are conservative and do n't like McCain , vote for Barr .

" Obama has consistently been against the Iraq war . "
If he were consistently against the Iraq war / occupation he would not have consistently voted for the funding .
And he 's made comments about Pakistan and Iran : Democrats and Iran : Look Who Supports Bush 's Next War
http://www.antiwar.com/frank/?articleid=4521
" Recently , the Democratic Party 's rising " progressive " star Barack Obama said he would favor " surgical " missile strikes against Iran . "
" Obama went on to argue that military strikes on Pakistan should not be ruled out if " violent Islamic extremists " were to " take over . " "

The 2006 election surprised the Rs because the negatives kept rising in the last month .
The preprogrammed ' spread ' for voting machines turned out too small !
I 've always voted but not every time for a major candidate .

This argument that voting for a 3rd party candidate is voting for McCain is ridiculous , I agree .
But , I voted for Nader in 2000 and it was a mistake .
The Democratic Party is much more progressive as a whole than it used to be .
You need to look at the big picture and the importance of doing absolutely anything to keep as many Republicans out of congress , and out of the presidency as possible .
Another conservative SC judge is a disaster , and McCain will gladly appoint one .
Obama is n't perfect , but you MUST realize either he or McCain will be the next president , and the purged voter rolls are already in McCain 's favor .

Joshua , I do n't know how on Earth you figure that " The Democratic Party is much more progressive as a whole than it used to be " ( that 's laughable ) when they 've done all they possibly could have for the illegitimate Bush regime since 2000 to this day .
Just look up their damn voting records .
Both parties are corporate , pro-war parties and get paid by the same people .
You can continue to live in Denial and keep falling for these corporatist candidates and then wonder why nothing changes .
If the Dem and Repug presidential candidates were credible candidates and worth voting for in the first place , you would n't have to worry or concern yourself with " third parties . "
Because the candidates would stand on their own , which Obama and McCain do not do because of their voting records ( voting " yes " for war appropriations bills is being pro-war ) .
It 's just that there is a lot of us who have stopped drinking the corporate Dem koolaid and we have stopped buying into the charade of " lesser of two evils " bullshit and " best of the worst " nonsense , which the sheep swallow .
The rest of you can remain in those ruts and then later scratch your head while wondering why the status quo continues .
Stop blaming the real progressives for voting for the truly progressives candidates and go back to drinking your corporate koolaid .
As for judges and justices , I would remind you that the Dems gave us Alito and Roberts by their " yes " votes .
Neither Alito or Roberts would be on the bench today if it were not for the Dems .
The Dems had threatened to filibuster but never even tried and by the way a filibuster can go on forever .
To me , it 's a given that McCain is going to get in ( that is , assuming Bush / Cheney leave ... and I 'll believe that when I see it ) because the Dems helped to spread these corrupt electronic voting machines through the nation .
And the " election " ( if there is one ) will be called " close " and the networks will declare the " election " for McCain .
Then Obama --- in John Kerry style --- will rush to the microphone to concede and say that the nation must unite because president [ sic ]
McCain and that we must come together and have a healing .
And Obama will promise to reach across the aisle ( like he 's been doing ever since he 's been in the Senate ) .
And you tell me there 's a difference between the two right - wings of this one - party system .
Ha !

Hell , I 've been writing about this shit since 2000 when it started .
I was one of only a few people out in the streets protesting the 2000 stolen " election " and those few of us who protested were told to " Get Over It ! "
Yes , that ’s true .

To this day I refuse to call this lying , war criminal Fraud in the White House " president " [ sic ] .
I have never , ever called him that and never will .
I cringe whenever I read or hear the " p " word connected with his name because he is illegitimate ..
The same for Cheney .
But most everybody else ( except Brad , to my knowledge ) has caved in on that , including people who initially called Bush " His Fraudulency . "
Yes , that 's the sign of a " Repug operative " all right .
Someone who refuses to refer to GWB and Cheney with the “ p ” and “ vp ” words .
And I lambaste them every time I have the opportunity .
Yes , that ’s the sign of a “ Repug operative ” all right .
Sigh .

And myself and other progressive have heard that silly " you are a Repug operative " propaganda from those koolaid drinkers in Denial for years .
I have to say I have n’t heard it that much likely .
So maybe it ’s dying out except for a few stragglers who are still using it .
I just toss it off because it is really desperate gutter tactics by those who refuse to see the reality .
It reminds me of the Michael Savage rabid regressives who are still to this day throwing out the red-baiting and “ commie ” comments and the pinko stuff .
I ’m still called all that by those rabid regressive haters .
To me the “ Repug operative ” drivel is really no different than that outdated stuff .
It seems that anyone who disagrees with some people is somehow a " Repug operative . "

And there 's absolutely nothing I can do about that if that 's what they think .
That 's their problem .

Hmmmmmmmm ...
I was giving more thought to this " Repug Operative " nonsense after I posted earlier .
Is n't it interesting ( actually hypocritical ) that the person who referred to me as a " Repug Operative " has made these statements :
When Teddy Kennedy is one of the few who had the moral fiber to vote against the illegal war , after all the bullshit triangulation that has happened , after these Democratic sell - outs mostly do squat to make it a better world , I can't see how anyone can argue the Demopcratic Party is more progressive than it used to be .
Harry Reid ?
Diane Feinstein ?
She is an asshole whose husband has ties to the Death Industry .
I guess it 's all right when that person says it , but not when I say it .
Because I have said all of that since 2000 .
I can't stand war - profiteer Dianne Feinstein .
And the Dems have enabled GWB / Cheney / Rove et al every step of the way with their " yes " votes , their complicity and their silence and by taking " impeachment off the table " despite illegal spying , torture , USAPATRIOT Act , 2 illegal wars / occupations .
None of it matters to the Dems despite their purely symbolic words of " opposition " on occasion for merely theatre and show before the TV cameras to try and fool their gullible supporters .
( The Dems know that most of their supporters will vote for them regardless of how they act / vote because their supporters --- just like Repug supporters --- are programmed to do so and because the politician has a D behind their name .
That 's the only requirement . )
Then the Dems turn around and once again enable Bush / Cheney / Rove .
It seems to me that the Dems in congress have been and are the " Repug Operatives , " if anyone is , since the Dems are in power " and some people are too thick to see that the Dems have been and are the " Repug Operatives " ( to use that term thrown at me ) .
I 'm not in power .
Yes , I 've said all that the quoted person above wrote .
How , then , is that person any different than what they called me a " Repug Operative " because that person I quoted above says the same things I have about the useless politicians .
I just take it a little bit farther , where the other person refuses to do .
The people who use this " Repug Operative " propaganda on other people remind me of fundamentalist " christians " that I 've dealt with in the past .
They want no or little criticism of their church , their beliefs or their minister .
And anyone who does speak a word of criticism is " doing the work of the devil " ( rather than possibly trying to improve the church ?... rather than stay with the status quo ! ) .
Then carry that over to politics and the equivalent would be a " Repug Operative . "
Interesting the duplicity of some people .

That ’s certainly my impression after a couple of months ’ experience with the device feeding the buzz , the Amazon Kindle .
Basically , the Kindle ’s lightness and reflective display mean that it offers a reading experience almost comparable to that of reading a traditional book .
This leaves the user free to appreciate the convenience factor : the Kindle can store the text of many books , and when you order a new book , it ’s literally in your hands within a couple of minutes .
It ’s a good enough package that my guess is that digital readers will soon become common , perhaps even the usual way we read books .
How will this affect the publishing business ?
Right now , publishers make as much from a Kindle download as they do from the sale of a physical book .
But the experience of the music industry suggests that this wo n’t last : once digital downloads of books become standard , it will be hard for publishers to keep charging traditional prices .
Indeed , if e-books become the norm , the publishing industry as we know it may wither away .
Books may end up serving mainly as promotional material for authors ’ other activities , such as live readings with paid admission .
Well , if it was good enough for Charles Dickens , I guess it ’s good enough for me .
Now , the strategy of giving intellectual property away so that people will buy your paraphernalia wo n’t work equally well for everything .
To take the obvious , painful example : news organizations , very much including this one , have spent years trying to turn large online readership into an adequately paying proposition , with limited success .
But they ’ll have to find a way .
Bit by bit , everything that can be digitized will be digitized , making intellectual property ever easier to copy and ever harder to sell for more than a nominal price .
And we ’ll have to find business and economic models that take this reality into account .
It wo n’t all happen immediately .
But in the long run , we are all the Grateful Dead .
Drop ' middle - class ' academic subjects says schools adviser
Children should no longer be taught traditional subjects at school because they are ' middle class '
Children should no longer be taught traditional subjects at school because they are " middle - class " creations , a Government adviser will claim today .
Professor John
White , who contributed to a controversial shake - up of the secondary curriculum , believes lessons should instead cover a series of personal skills .
Pupils would no longer study history , geography and science but learn skills such as energy - saving and civic responsibility through projects and themes .
He will outline his theories at a conference today staged by London 's Institute of Education - to which he is affiliated - to mark the 20th anniversary of the national curriculum .
Last night , critics attacked his ideas as " deeply corrosive " and condemned the Government for allowing him to advise on a new curriculum .
Professor
White will claim ministers are already " moving in the right direction " towards realising his vision of replacing subjects with a series of personal aims for pupils .
But he says they must go further because traditional subjects were invented by the middle classes and are " mere stepping stones to wealth " .
The professor believes the origins of our subject - based education system can be traced back to 19th century middle - class values .
While public schools focused largely on the classics , and elementary schools for the working class concentrated on the three Rs , middle - class schools taught a range of academic subjects .
These included English , maths , history , geography , science and Latin or a modern language .
They " fed into the idea of academic learning as the mark of a well - heeled middle - class " , he said last night .
The Tories then attempted to impose these middle - class values by introducing a traditional subject - based curriculum in 1988 .
But this " alienated many youngsters , especially from disadvantaged backgrounds " , he claimed .
The professor , who specialises in philosophy of education , was a member of a committee set up to advise Government curriculum authors on changes to secondary schooling for 11 to 14 - year - olds .
The reforms caused a row when they were unveiled last year for sidelining large swathes of subject content in favour of lessons on issues such as climate change and managing debt .
Professor
White wants ministers to encourage schools to shift away from single - subject teaching to " theme or project - based learning " .
Pupils would still cover some content but would be encouraged to meet a series of personal aims .
The curriculum already states some of these but is " hampered " by the continued primacy of subjects .
The aims include fostering a model pupil who " values personal relationships , is a responsible and caring citizen , is entrepreneurial , able to manage risk and committed to sustainable development " .
Critics claim theme - based work is distracting and can lead to gaps in pupils ' knowledge .
Tory schools spokesman Nick Gibb said Professor
White 's view was " deeply corrosive " .
He added : " In the world we are living in , we need people who are better educated , not more poorly educated , more knowledgeable about the world , not less so .
" This anti-knowledge , anti-subject ideology is deeply damaging to our education system .
It is this sort of thinking that has led to the promotion of discredited reading methods , the erosion of three separate sciences and the decline of mathematics skills .
" I just find it astonishing that someone with his extreme views has been allowed to advise the Government on education policy . "
RIYADH , Saudi Arabia ( CNN ) -- Saudi Arabia Friday rebuffed President Bush 's request to immediately pump more oil to lower record prices , saying it does not see enough demand to increase production .
The Saudis said they would increase production if customers demanded it , Steven Hadley , Bush 's national security adviser , said .
Ali al - Naimi , the Saudi oil minister , on Friday said the country had increased its production by 300,000 barrels a day on May 10 in response to customer requests .
Al - Naimi said the increased production would bring Saudi Arabia 's daily production to 9.45 million barrels per day by June .
Bush is spending much of the day in closed - door meetings with King Abdullah , the Saudi ruler .
Friday 's visit was Bush 's second trip to the kingdom this year , coming as oil prices reached a new record high Friday of more than $ 127 a barrel .
When he traveled to Riyadh in January , his request for the Saudis to pump more oil was also rejected .
' SIU : Out of Gas '
What if a hurricane hits ?
Could gas skyrocket to $ 10 a gallon ?
CNN investigates .
Sat & Sun , 8 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Oil prices were just below $ 100 a barrel in January , and Americans were paying an average of $ 3.06 for a gallon of gasoline .
They were paying $ 3.78 on Friday , following more than week of record highs every day .
" Clearly , the price of gas is too high for Americans , and it 's causing a hardship for many families of low income .
But it also is not allowing our economy to grow as strong as it could , " spokeswoman Dana Perino said en route to Saudi Arabia .
" One of the best ways to have lower prices is if there was a better calibration between the laws of supply and demand .
We have little -- not enough supply , and too high demand .
Trying to get more supply out there is good for everyone , " she said .
But Saudi Arabia -- and many economists -- say the high prices are a result of market speculation , the weak dollar , and demand from the developing world rather than a shortage of supply .
" We will raise production when the market justifies it .
This is our policy , " al - Naimi said during Bush 's first visit in January .
" Our interest is to hopefully keep supply matching demand with minimum volatility in the international oil market , " he added .
Saudi Arabia maintains spare production capacity of about 2 million barrels per day use when there is " an unexpected need , " al - Naimi said in January .
Bush will also discuss oil industry security and peaceful nuclear cooperation with the Saudis .
The trip , part of a Middle East tour that began in Israel and will continue to Egypt , marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Washington and Riyadh .

Todd Stein & Steven McIntyre The Texas Hedge Report April 23 , 2008
Courtesy of www.texashedge.com
The big question that has puzzled the investment community over the last few years has been �inflation , deflation , or both ? �
Those who make the case for inflation would point to the amount of fiat money printed over the last decade by central banks all across the world .
They would also cite the ever - increasing appetite for �stuff� ( i.e. commodities ) among countries such as China & India .
Deflationists would argue that the huge credit bubble that has been building must eventually end in some sort of deflationary bust .
They would say that even in an easy - money environment , governments cannot push banks to lend forever and eventually a credit crunch would ensue .
Finally , those who make the �both� argument would triangulate and say that the price of �stuff� would inflate while the prices of paper securities ( stocks , bonds & perhaps mortgages ) would deflate .
It certainly looks like the �inflation� and perhaps the �both� arguments have been the most accurate so far .
But what about the predictions of the deflationists ?
We can remember people like Bob Prechter calling for a gold top around $ 300 or $ 400 / oz a few years ago .
We can also recall some DOW 3,000 forecasts from these deflationists during the last bear market .
While it is easy to label these folks as gloom and doomers , their predictions of a debt - induced collapse in many global assets may not be so far fetched .
Over these last few years , the U.S. economy has experienced what we would call �controlled� inflation .
We would say that inflation has ranged somewhere between 5 % and 10 % depending on one�s consumption of fuel , medical care and collegiate education .
Why this has not sparked outrage among the citizenry is twofold .
First , bogus government CPI numbers as well as politicians & journalists blaming oil companies have helped distract the public .
Second , some of this inflation has found its way ( until recently ) into stock & housing prices , which the American investor class seems to applaud .
As long as your house and 401 ( k ) go up in value , a little inflation here and there is acceptable .
Unfortunately , the fate of the American investor class will not be determined by American politicians or companies .
Asia �s insatiable appetite for natural resources has been a recurring theme in the financial media over the last few years .
Since most commodities are traded in dollars , Asian consumers have had to deal with the same commodity price inflation that their American counterparts have .
This will continue to be the case until Asian governments revalue their currencies versus the U.S. Dollar .
Until now , this hasn�t really happened because the Asian governments ( especially China ) know that if their currencies appreciate versus the U.S. Dollar , then demand for their exports will soften .
Softer demand from the Wal - Marts of this world means that Chinese factories may not operate at full capacity which could trigger Chinese unemployment .
This would be a major no - no because Chinese leaders understand that a little inflation ( the current situation ) is preferable to millions of unemployed young males .
Governments tend to have trouble surviving in high unemployment environments .
So , if a little domestic inflation ( and political pressure from G - 7 treasury secretaries and finance ministers ) won�t push Asian central banks to revalue , what will ?
Our guess is that the answer lies in the food riots that are starting to spread across the globe .
While a little commodity inflation is more politically tolerable than unemployment , food price protests & riots are another matter .
After all , it was commodity hyperinflation ( not deflationary stagnation ) that served as the catalyst for the downfall of Weimar Germany and many Latin American governments last century .
If the riots continue to spread , especially into some of the more developed countries , then we think it is only a matter of time until the Chinese , Japanese , European , and even American central bankers climb aboard the inflation - fighting train .
A hawkish Fed may be difficult to fathom , but if gas price increases start to bankrupt the entire transportation sector and we see truckers striking like they do in France , the political winds will shift .
For a preview of what this political environment may look like , we suggest that readers dig up Jimmy Carter�s speeches on YouTube or the Carter library web site .
Inflation is here and it is likely to continue for some time .
But investors must watch for signs of the political winds shifting .
The question to keep in mind over the coming months is whether it is more politically feasible to have severe inflation or severe deflation .
We still believe rampant inflation and U.S. Dollar debasement is the most likely outcome in the short term .
But , if riots and upheaval continue to spread , all out deflation may be the only antidote .

For just over 15 years I ’ve played the guitar on and off , I ’m not very good , I ’m certainly never going to be anywhere near as good as Joe Satriani or Steve Vai , I just do n’t have the talent , but I do enjoy it .
It ’s also very frustrating though , as guitars vary and you need to find one that your comfortable with , which as yet I have n’t .
Why ?
Because it ’s near impossible to find ANY left handed guitars let alone the perfect left handed guitar .
A couple of weeks ago I took my wife to a music shop to buy her an electronic piano .
While she was choosing I took my son for a wander around the shop to keep him amused .
While doing so we had a look at everything else they had in stock and hidden away at the back of the shop I found a lone , dusty left handed electro acoustic guitar and there were a couple of cheap left handed electrics in amongst 50 + right handed guitars .
Why ?
Around 10 % of the population is left handed yet guitar shops never stock that many and far too many guitar manufacturers do n’t make ANY of their guitars in left handed models .
The ones that do generally only offer a very limited choice of models and those only come with a limited choice of colours ( black ) .
When I asked several manufacturers and shops they told me there was NO demand , well that ’s clearly not true , as I ’ve got money to spend on them and I know there are others as including quite a number of famous guitarists ; Jimi Hendrix , Paul McCartney , Kurt Cobain , Tony Iommi , Bob Geldof and Iggy Pop to name just a few .
Personally I think there appears to be no demand , because us lefties can’t find anything to buy .
So there ’s probably a good business opportunity here for a specialist left handed guitar manufacturer and a specialist left handed guitar shop .
Neither actually have to do lefties exclusively , but if you specialise at least part of the business targeting lefties I ’m sure there ’s a chance to do well out of this niche .
Please note that I ’m aware that a quick Google will show several left handed guitar shops but in reality they carry a limited range and tend to focus on the cheap “ beginner models ” .
The ideal perhaps is for this to be part of a bigger business specialising in products for left handed people .
After all according to the book Right - Hand , Left - Hand by Chris manus of University College London :
Left - handed people as a group have historically produced an above - average quota of high achievers .
So we ’re an under - severed 10 % of the population who might well have a higher than average level of disposable income .
Are you a leftie ?
If So what ’s your experience of finding left handed products ?

Articulated hand of the predatory dinosaur Megaraptor namunhuaiquii .
Australia 's links to South America have just gotten a bit closer , but not due to economic forces , rather fossil forces .
University of Queensland palaeontologist
Dr Steve Salisbury was part of an international team of palaeontologists from the US , Argentina and Australia that discovered a fossil that had previously only been found in South America .
Dr Salisbury , from UQ's School of Integrative Biology , said an upper arm bone found at Dinosaur Cove in southern Victoria , shares a suite of unique features with a medium - sized predatory dinosaur from Argentina called megaraptor .
He said it was the first time a dinosaur with unquestionable affinities to animals from other Southern Hemisphere continents had been recognised in Australia .
“ Throughout much of the Age of Dinosaurs , Australia formed part of the southern super - continent of Gondwana , ” Dr Salisbury said .
“ As a result , there has long been an expectation that our dinosaur fauna would show similarities to similarly aged faunas from adjoining Gondwanan landmasses , in particular Antarctica , New Zealand and South America .
“ Of the Australian dinosaurs that have been recognised so far , the consensus has been that some are relics of groups that went extinct much earlier in other parts of the world , while others have been seen as early representatives of groups that are more typical of the Northern Hemisphere .
“ Partly as a result , it has been proposed that Australia was somehow isolated from the rest of Gondwana , either through geographic or climatic barriers . ”
Dr Federico Angolin , from the Argentinean Museum of Natural Sciences , said when the six palaeontologists on the research team independently recognised the close similarity between the Dinosaur Cove fossil and the remains of megaraptor from Argentina , they knew they had an important discovery on their hands .
“ Megaraptor is a unusual type medium - sized theropod , best known for its enormous clawed hands , ” Dr Federico Angolin said .
“ The proportionately large hand means that megaraptor has a very distinctive forearm , which is how we were able to identify the Australian fossil . ”
Project leader Nate Smith , from The Field Museum in Chicago , said fossils of Megaraptor have previously only been found in central and southern Patagonia , in rocks at least 15 million years younger than those in southern Victoria .
He said it was first thought to be a member of Dromaeosauridae , the group of predatory dinosaurs that includes the velociraptor , but the Australian material has helped show megaraptor actually belongs to the same group of dinosaurs as Africa 's “ crocodile mimic ” dinosaur suchomimus and the sail - backed spinosaurus – the Spinosauroidea .
“ The recognition of Megaraptor in Victoria provides the first definitive evidence for interchange between the dinosaur faunas of South America and Australia during the Cretaceous , ” Mr Smith said .
“ Our results are consistent with several geological models for rifting between the southern continents during the time that these dinosaurs existed .
“ This discovery indicates that we might need to rethink the longstanding claims of the Northern Hemisphere affinities for many Australian dinosaurs , and of geographic and / or climatic isolation of Australian dinosaur faunas . ”
The results of the study are published online through the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London .

This week the first cattle born to a cloned cow in Britain will be sold .
Opponents say this is a leap into the unknown but scientists claim it holds the key to solving food shortages
The first cattle born to a cloned cow in Britain will this week be sold at public auction .
The sale - at a cattle market outside Bristol - marks the opening of a new chapter in food technology in this country , say scientists .
They expect that Dundee Paradise , whose mother was the clone of a prize - winning Holstein cow , and her brother , Dundee Paratrooper , will be bought by breeders in the first step towards the creation of new generations of cattle in Britain .
The move has been hailed by many breeders who believe that cloned cattle offer the only effective prospect of continuing to provide top-quality meat at a time when the world faces shortages in supplies of key foodstuffs .
Only the creation and use of genetically manipulated plants and animals can prevent this , it is argued .
' These animals will not be sold for meat , ' said Simon Best , chairman of the BioIndustry Association .
' They will cost far too much for that .
Instead they will be bought by other breeders to create offspring that will go on to help to improve Britain 's livestock . '
Scientists now predict that beef burgers from clone - farmed cattle will soon be approved in the United States and that Europe will eventually give the go - ahead for the sale of cloned meat as well .
This prospect causes alarm among green groups , however , and the sale of Dundee Paradise and Dundee Paratrooper - whose mother was Vandyk - K Integ Paradise 2 , a clone created from cells taken from the ear of a Holstein , a milking cow , in the US - may become the focus of protests by groups opposed to the creation of what they call ' Frankenstein ' foods .
They say the manipulation of animals in the laboratory could trigger unforeseen , potentially harmful changes to beef and other meats .
This charge is vigorously rejected by scientists , however , and by bodies such as the Food Standards Agency and the European Food Safety Authority .
More to the point , cloned meat will become increasingly important , say scientists , as Britain strives to make its farms more environmentally friendly by reducing its use of nitrates and other harmful chemicals as well as its output of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases .
In the case , of Dundee Paradise and Dundee Paratrooper , this has been done by creating a clone of a top milk - producing Holstein .
Such animals mean that more milk can be generated on a farm without increasing use of fertilisers and fodder .
' Normally it takes generations to introduce new improved traits into cattle - by carefully cross- breeding different cows and bulls , ' added Best .
' However , by creating a clone of an ideal animal , in this case one that is a top milk - producer , you have done it in a single generation .
Thus you can make improvements to livestock , and to the nation 's beef and milk , far more quickly than by using traditional breeding techniques . '
The only concern for UK scientists is the fact that the technology used to create the cattle was invented in Britain - by the team , led by Ian Wilmut and Keith Campbell , responsible for the cloning of Dolly the Sheep .
But now virtually all commercial cloning work of livestock is done in the US , and farmers and breeders in Britain , as with Dundee Paradise and Dundee Paratrooper , have to buy from companies on the other side of the Atlantic .
In addition , news of the sale of the cattle - which are owned by Smiddiehill Holsteins , based at Albrighton , Shropshire - comes as ministers and their advisers are warning that significant food shortages could arise in Britain unless urgent moves are taken to ensure that the country adopts a sensible , balanced food policy .
A national debate on the issue is urgently needed , they say .
The problem is that consumers expect cheap and plentiful meat , fruit , vegetables and groceries , yet their production causes harmful greenhouse gases and is unsustainable because of the UK 's limited availability of land , oil and water , said Tim Lang , of the government 's sustainable development commission ( SDC ) .
' We 've had an orgy of choice unparalleled in human history in the past 50 years , but many analysts agree that , unless there is fundamental change , food supply chains could even collapse , ' said Lang , who is also professor of food policy at City University , London .
Suggested ways for transforming the attitudes of consumers and the food industry include rationing by putting up prices and encouraging supermarkets to stock a smaller range of identical products .
But encouraging the public to behave differently is a complex process , added Lang .
More than 30 per cent of people claim to care about companies ' environmental and social records , for example , but only 3 per cent reflect these beliefs in their purchases .
' We are missing the point if we put all the onus of choice onto consumers , ' said Lang .
' Choice is part of the problem , not the solution .
Do you load responsibility on every consumer or do you constrain their choice ?
We can't ask consumers to spend 24 hours thinking about which of an aisle - full of nearly identical products to buy when so many are inappropriate - too high in carbon , for example . '
Instead , said Lang , policies need to be introduced that shape the choices consumers make .
' We all like to think we choose our diets but choice is already structured by history , price and policy . '
Production , distribution and consumption of food in Britain is responsible for around a fifth of total UK greenhouse gas emissions .
The Stern report in 2006 said agriculture alone globally accounts for 31 per cent of emissions .
' The UK situation is being stressed not just by water and oil shortages but also land availability , labour skills and affordability , ' said Lang , who is calling for a national debate about future policies to engage the public and how to transform consumption .
' We have to involve the public in this process of change .
' So far , expert debate is about the existence of problems and not enough is about involving the public , ' said Lang , who will discuss the issue in early March in a speech at City University titled Food Security :
Are we sleep - walking into a crisis ?
' There are those who believe we can use hi-tech solutions to get out of the problem and others just believe markets will resolve it .
But the key will be public acceptance .
The paradox is that Britain was never better fed than during the Second World War , when rationing was in place .
This was because the public saw its purpose ; it did n't like it , but it accepted necessity .
In a future crisis , rationing will be designed for sustainability , not just health and equity . '
Lang 's call is supported by the Sustainable Consumption Roundtable - a joint initiative between the SDC and the National Consumer Council ( NCC ) , which explores ways that the government can help create a shift to more sustainable lifestyles and is funded by the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform .
' There is not enough evidence to suggest that consumers on their own are able to change mainstream product markets , ' said Ed Mayo , chair of the Roundtable and chief executive of the NCC .
" ' Choice editing " for quality and sustainability by regulators , retailers and manufacturers has been the critical driver towards more sustainable consumption .
Early announcement of legislation to set minimum standards can also drive a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation and further choice editing , ' he added .

CINCINNATI  Barack Obama pressed his call Monday for African Americans to take more personal responsibility for their children and within their communities in a speech to the NAACP that directly confronted the complaints of Jesse Jackson about Obama 's approach to problems affecting blacks .
Obama , the first African American to clinch a major party 's presidential nomination , could not have chosen a more deliberate forum for his remarks than the 99th convention of the nation 's largest civil rights organization .
" We got to demand more responsibility from Washington … and we got to demand more responsibility from Wall Street , but you know what ? " said Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee .
" We also have to demand more from ourselves . …
" Now , I know there 's some who 've been saying I 've been too tough , talking about responsibility , " he went on .
" At the NAACP , I 'm here to report I 'm never going to stop talking about it . "
He told the crowd that " no matter how much money we invest in our communities , or how many 10 - point plans we propose or how many government programs we launch — none of it will make a difference , at least not enough of a difference , if we do n't seize more responsibility in our own lives . "
ON POLITICS BLOG : Barack Obama refuses to stop talking about responsibility
His remarks about responsibility , which came toward the end of his speech , were greeted by growing applause and cheers .
By the end , the crowd was on its feet when he held out the prospect of returning next year to address the group 's 100th convention as president .
Obama has addressed larger audiences during this year 's campaign and other audiences that were enthusiastic , but he may have never addressed a group to whom his presidential candidacy had deeper meaning than the NAACP .
Three thousand delegates filled the hall at the downtown Duke Energy Convention Center with room for another 1,400 in an overflow room .
" This is history in the making , " said Annie Burton , 49 , of Texas City , Texas , wearing an Obama T - shirt and Obama beret .
" This is once in a lifetime . "
Still , there was some concern expressed in the hall before the speech began about whether Obama 's attempts to appeal to white voters had diluted his commitment to issues of particular importance to black people .
That was a point Jackson , the civil rights activist who ran for the presidency in 1984 and 1988 , was making last week in comments he did n't realize were being picked up by an open mike .
He complained that Obama was " talking down to black people " at a Chicago church in a Father 's Day stump speech that made similar points .
Jackson apologized for using crude language in his critique , but the substantive point was one that political scientist Ron Walters says he has heard expressed on black - radio call - in shows and elsewhere .
" It is a very important subterranean discussion that 's going on about the extent to which Barack has to deal with the white community , because that 's where most of the votes are , and on the other hand he has to deal with the black community because that 's part of his base , " says Walters , a professor at the University of Maryland who was an adviser to Jackson 's campaigns and who appears at the convention Wednesday .
Many black voters want to hear more about social programs and institutional change to deal with problems in housing , health care and education , he said .
" There is a back - and - forth , fine - line dance that he 's got going on here . "
Estelle Holmes , 60 , an NAACP delegate from Hitchcock , Texas , is an Obama fan who said she also agrees with Jackson .
She noted that Obama grew up in circumstances unfamiliar to most black Americans — born in Hawaii to a white woman and a black Kenyan .
" But I think he feels the pain of African Americans , " she adds .
And she said she is certain that Obama 's wife , Michelle , who grew up in Chicago , does .
In his speech , Obama paid homage to the NAACP and pioneers of the civil rights movement , including Julian Bond , who introduced him to the Cincinnati crowd .
" I know that Thurgood Marshall did not argue Brown v. Board of Education so that some of us could stop doing our jobs as parents .
That was n't the deal , " Obama said .
" And I know that nine little children did not walk through a schoolhouse door in Little Rock so that we could stand by and let our children drop out of school and turn to gangs for the support they are not getting elsewhere . "
Obama , who was raised by a single mother , promised to invest in a laundry list of social programs before talking about the roles of parents .
" It starts with teaching our daughters to never allow images on television to tell them what they are worth , " he said , " and teaching our sons to treat women with respect , and to realize that responsibility does not end at conception ; that what makes them men is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one .

White House hopeful Barack Obama has said a strong transatlantic relationship is needed to deal with a wide range of world issues .
Mr Obama said co-operation with the UK was crucial over climate change , terrorism and the economy , after talks with UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
He said his conversation with Mr Brown in Downing Street had been " terrific " .
The Democratic presidential candidate later met Conservative leader David Cameron at the Houses of Parliament .
Mr Obama and Mr Brown talked for two hours and then took a stroll in the sunshine around Horse Guards Parade before the Illinois senator spoke to reporters .
Heavy price Speaking outside Downing Street , Mr Obama , who is on the final part of the European leg of his tour , also thanked the British people for their support in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Downing Street talks covered a wide range of issues " I know that the troops here in Great Britain have borne a heavy price for wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan and I think the American people are grateful for all the help that has been provided , " he said .
" The prime minister 's emphasis - like mine - is on how we can strengthen the trans - Atlantic relationship to solve problems that can't be solved by any single country individually , " he added .
Mr Obama spoke of a " deep and abiding affection for the British people in America and a fascination with all things British " .
He also referred to a shared history and the role of the " English tradition " in shaping the US constitution .
" We 've been through two world wars together , " he said .
" We speak a common language .
We share a belief in rule of law and due process . "
Photo opportunity Earlier , Mr Obama had a breakfast meeting in London with former Prime Minister Tony Blair , who is now the international Middle East envoy .
Mr Obama and Mr Cameron spent almost an hour talking in the Tory leader 's Commons office .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague and shadow chancellor George Osborne also attended part of the meeting .
Mr Cameron and Mr Obama compared recent visits to Afghanistan The Tory leader highlighted some of Parliament 's features as they posed outside for photographs before the talks .
A Conservative party spokeswoman said their conversation had focused on Afghanistan - including a comparison of their recent personal visits to the country - Iraq , Iran and the economy .
Mr Obama has already visited Germany , where he gave a keynote foreign policy speech in Berlin , and France where he met President Nicolas Sarkozy .
After flying into London on Friday , Mr Obama was greeted by the American ambassador and his wife , Robert and Maria Tuttle , before being taken to a city centre hotel .
In contrast to the public reception he received in Berlin and Paris , Mr Obama 's London visit was kept deliberately low key .
Opinion polls
In Paris , Mr Obama said Iran should not wait for the next US president to be elected before resolving its dispute with the West .
The reason that I thought this trip was important is that I am convinced that many issues that we face at home are not going to be solved as effectively unless we have strong partners abroad

He said Tehran should promptly accept an international call to freeze its " illicit nuclear programme " .
Iran insists its nuclear campaign is peaceful .
Mr Obama 's tour has also taken in the Middle East where he visited Jordan , Israel and the Palestinian territories .
The senator left London in the afternoon on a chartered plane to fly back to the US where he faces Republican rival John McCain in November 's presidential election .
The latest opinion polls in the US show Mr Obama leads Mr McCain by between one and six percentage points with some polls showing the race tightening in key states .
Mr Obama said he was unsure what political impact his overseas trip would have among US voters concerned about fuel prices and their mortgages .
He told reporters in London : " I would n't even be surprised that in some polls you saw a little bit of a dip as a consequence .
We 've been out of the country for a week . "
He added : " The reason that I thought this trip was important is that I am convinced that many issues that we face at home are not going to be solved as effectively unless we have strong partners abroad . "

What are these ?
Four years ago , though , authorities successfully prosecuted several officials and members of Local 14 and their colleagues at a sister union , Local 15 , during two major cases that focused on organized crime figures and led to nearly four dozen guilty pleas .
The men admitted crimes including allowing favored construction contractors to flout work rules and bestowing lucrative no - show jobs on accommodating union officials and workers .
Among those who pleaded guilty and cooperated was Mr. Coriasco , one of several witnesses who questioned the qualifications of some union members .
Another union official , testifying at the same trial , balked at the other witness ’s assertion that many union members were unable to run cranes .
In his experience in the five years ending in 2003 , he testified , only two or three Local 14 crane operators were unable to operate the cranes when they reported to job sites .
In some instances , he noted , these men had received crane licenses , but really spent their days operating other types of heavy equipment .
The safety of crane operations did not figure in that case , and no one has suggested that operator error played a role in either recent accident .
Still , lapses in the licensing process have been a matter of concern , though typically they have been seen in certifying applicants for some crane licenses , ones that are less advanced than the license required to operate tower cranes .
City records show that more than half a dozen members of Locals 14 and 15 who pleaded guilty to the federal charges still hold such lesser crane licenses .
Tony Sclafani , a Buildings Department spokesman , said that a felony conviction , even one related to the construction industry , does not automatically disqualify an applicant .
Those men were able to renew their licenses at least once since their felony convictions .
Among them is Lawrence Persico , the son of Carmine Persico , the Colombo crime family boss .
The younger Mr. Persico , who pleaded guilty in 2004 to collecting more than $ 750,000 in no -show jobs , is now out of prison and still holds a Class A crane license .
How and when so many people with questionable backgrounds secured crane licenses remains unclear .
One F.B.I. report from 2003 suggests that union members were able to obtain the city licensing test and answers , although the report does not say when .
This Year ’s Business Model : Restaurants Without Food
You may have read earlier stories on this blog about a pay - what - you - wish bakery in Canada , a pay - what - you - wish coffee shop in Washington state , and pay - what - you - wish granola at a Miami supermarket .
Here ’s another pay - what - you - wish eating story , but in this case , you have to bring your own food .
That ’s right .
On King Island in Tasmania , Australia , there ’s an old boathouse that ’s been converted into a rustic harborside restaurant where patrons cook their own meals .
They leave behind money for the use of the building in an “ honesty duck ” — i.e. , a box decorated with a toy duck .
“ People really , really love the concept of trust and that ’s to me half the reason why we ’re running it , because I respond to that , ” the proprietor Caroline Kininmonth told Eleanor Hall of The World Today .
“ It ’s a very childlike feeling . ”
There is nothing in the article about average payments .
The real estate business being what it is versus the food business being what it is , and considering how much people love to cook , I would n’t be surprised if a restaurant without food is a lot more profitable than one with food .
I recall that Cosmo Kramer once had a plan for a make - it - yourself pizzeria .
Can anyone out there tell us about a setup similar to this Australian one in the U.S. ?

We know quite a bit about the Obama campaign ’s intention to “ stretch ” the map and compete in “ red ” states that a )
Dems would be expected to skip ; and b ) the McCain campaign does n’t want to have to fight for .
But Ben Smith went a little deeper and considers what this might mean for Dems further down on the ballot .
Barack Obama will focus his resources largely in 14 states George W. Bush won in 2004 , his chief field operative said Tuesday , hoping to score upsets in places like Virginia , Indiana , and Georgia .
But winning the White House wo n’t be his only goal , deputy campaign manager Hildebrand told Politico :
In an unusual move , Obama ’s campaign will also devote some resources to states it ’s unlikely to win , with the goal of influencing specific local contests in places like Texas and Wyoming .
“ Texas is a great example where we might not be able to win the state , but we want to pay a lot of attention to it , ” Hildebrand said .
“ It ’s one of the most important redistricting opportunities in the country . ”
That ’s a good point .
You may recall Tom DeLay ’s painful re-redistricting scheme , the result of which was five new Republican seats in the U.S. House .
After the 2010 census , it ’ll be time to draw those lines again , and if the Obama campaign can help strengthen the party at the state level , the efforts will pay dividends in the long run .
It ’s not just Texas .
Ben also noted a competitive House race in Wyoming , where Gary Trauner is running for the state ’s lone U.S. House seat .
He was narrowly defeated two years ago , but hopes the rematch will turn out better .
Is Obama going to win Wyoming ?
Almost certainly not , but when he invests campaign resources in the state anyway , he not only raises eyebrows at McCain HQ , he also gives candidates like Trauner a better shot at victory .
“ If we can register more Democrats , if we can increase the Democratic performance and turnout , maybe we can pick up a congressional seat , ” Hildebrand said .
Last weekend I went home to absolute madness .
Expecting a quiet afternoon in rural Maryland , I walked through the front door and proceeded to the back porch where a Chinese man and an Indian man dressed head to toe in fishing clothes and floppy hats , were laughing hysterically .
My dog was squared off in an epic battle with a renegade crab that had escaped from a pot on the ledge , and in the background two young children squealed and screamed as they jumped in and out of the pool .
I sat down next to my dad on the porch , and he turned to me and said , “ Welcome home . ”
It used to be such a quiet place .
This summer , my father rented out three spare rooms to help pay the mortgage and escalating college tuition .
By the end of the month , the house was full .
There ’s Song , the Chinese man with an NBA addiction and a taste for liquor in plastic bottles ; Vanki , the soft - spoken Indian man who cooks some of the best food I ’ve ever tasted ; and Matt , the laid - back graphic designer from Pittsburgh , a guitar player with whom I ’ve planned a long - awaited jam session .
My mother calls it the “ frat house , ” and I guess that ’s fairly accurate .
They ’re a wild bunch , throwing occasional parties and blaring music from the bedrooms , but most evenings , their time is spent sitting on the back porch or in the living room , talking long into the night .
These are the times when I really get to know them .
I ’m tutored in their specific heritages , and also , I learn a little bit about how American culture is viewed from a foreign eye .
Song and Vanki wear t- shirts of rock bands to which they ’ve never listened , and football jerseys for teams they do n’t follow .
They listen to the songs from the Top 100 pop charts .
They make trips to the Chesapeake Bay , Atlantic City , and even the baseball games that my father umpires .
They go for fun , but also to experience traditional aspects of the American way of life .
Fishing , gambling and baseball .
That ’s about as American as it gets .
Even when they describe their home countries , you can sense a faint American twist .
Song has the uncanny ability to pinpoint any spot in China with its relative proportional location in the United States , which is the only reason I know that Beijing is in relatively the same area of China that Massachusetts is to the United States .
However , despite this Americanization of culture , Song and Vanki ’s emulations are not a disguise or an attempt to “ fit in ” by any means .
They are not Clark Kents , merely wearing an American mask .
From sitting down and talking with them , I ’ve seen both strong and subtle elements of their own home nation traditions .
First , there ’s the food .
There ’s a wok in the kitchen , bags of rice everywhere , and strange things I ca n’t identify in the fridge .
The two of them are amazing cooks , and the smorgasbord of Indian and Chinese cuisine is a nice change from my normal diet of Subway foot - longs and cheeseburgers , but it ’s also an example of a part of their culture that they ’ve hung on to .
They shop at the international food stores in town , and they ’ll eat steak and burgers if my dad cooks them , but for the most part , their taste is international .
But in the end , that ’s just food .
Where I see their cultural ideals really poke through , especially with Song , is during those late - night discussions on the back porch .
It ’s like an episode of The O’Reilly Factor .
In one corner , Song and Vanki , two young , liberal , eco-friendly men , versus my dad , a die - hard conservative whose television - watching is pretty much limited to Fox News .
The discussion will start with a casual reference , pick up speed , and quickly accelerate into a full - on debate that stretches past midnight .
One discussion particularly demonstrated the influence of Song ’s Chinese heritage .
It was subtle , but once I noticed it , it was hard to ignore .
They were discussing the war and whether or not the loss of human lives could be justified for a conflict that they had both determined to be economically - based .
What was strange about this was that the ideologies of Song and my father seemed to have switched during this talk .
My conservative dad was delivering an anti-war argument and Song was doing the opposite .
Song said , though I do n’t remember the exact phrasing , “ If your country is at war , you should be proud , whether you agree with their reasons or not .
You should be willing to die in battle for the honor of your country . ”
This blew me away .
It demonstrated a total inverse of the post - Vietnam anti-war , government - mistrusting sentiment that has become a part of the American mindset since the 1960s .
This belief encompasses ideals that are passed down through generation : ideals of honor , virtue , pride in one ’s nation .
Those are beliefs that once they ’re ingrained into one ’s mindset , will stick with a person no matter where he travels or ends up living .
The cultural gap put the debate in a stalemate , and it fizzled off and died without resolution as most arguments tend to do .
I went inside for the night around 1:00 a.m. with no new opinions on Iraq , but I went to bed with a very clear image of what one ’s home means for an individual .
Where you go and what you do after childhood can change a lot about who you are , almost everything at times .
But some elements never die , and those are worth hanging on to .
Home for me is a melting pot , and despite what America has become in the years since its inception 232 years ago , at least that ’s close to its origins .
Funny how the most legendary tracks are never hits .
Not singles played on the radio , but album cuts that seep into the consciousness , never mentioned by the hoi polloi , but celebrated by the cognoscenti .
Like Leonard Cohen ’s " Everybody Knows " .
What does everybody know ?
Everybody knows radio sucks .
Everybody knows MTV plays no videos .
Everybody knows mainstream hip - hop is about money .
Everybody knows Mariah Carey is a twit .
Everybody knows Gene Simmons is a breadhead .
Everybody knows " American Idol " is about the drama , not the music .
But the mainstream media never admits the above .
It keeps slinging the shit the big entertainment companies create .
They ’re in cahoots .
It ’s a closed system .
And it ca n’t be changed , because there ’s too much money involved , and longstanding relationships .
Everybody knows TicketMaster fees are excessive .
Everybody knows CDs are overpriced .
Everybody knows most of the music on an iPod is stolen .
Everybody knows Led Zeppelin is better than any act breaking today .
But the pundits just accuse those into classic rock as being old farts .
Like the music of today ’s players is just as good as those of the Beatles ’ .
Hell , it ’s not as good as that of the Dave Clark Five .
Not even Herman ’s Hermits .
Everybody knows that when acts gets sponsors they do it for the money .
Same deal with advertisements .
But they wince when classic acts do this .
Because they do n’t want their illusions shattered , do n’t want the acts ’ credibility undermined .
How come if everybody knows all of this , you ca n’t read it , you ca n’t hear it ?
How come we must be subjected to the asexual Ryan Seacrest who the mainstream says is the reincarnation of Dick Clark , who we never believed in anyway ?
The younger generation knows the truth .
You might think you ’re pulling one over on them , jamming empty calories down their throats , but they know you and your products are full of shit .
I thought the Iraq war would generate quality new music .
But it turns out the war is a movie playing in art cinemas on the edge of town , you can ignore it without a problem .
If you do n’t want to go , you do n’t have to .
But you ca n’t ignore the financial wreck this country has become .
You ca n’t ignore the fact that our President is incompetent .
You ca n’t ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton says what ’s expedient , not what ’s in her heart .
And you ca n’t ignore that Barack Obama is different .
He ’s speaking truth .
And the youth are rallying around him .
These youth are sick of the lies .
Sick of the baby boomers who believe they ’re entitled .
And with their tool , the Internet , with modern technology , they ’re spreading the word .
That they ’re mad as hell and they ’re not going to take it anymore !
Is Barack Obama going to become President ?
Is he even going to win the Democratic nomination ?
Will he be proven to be closer to those inside the Beltway than our dream ?
All interesting questions , but what we do know is those under thirty are sick of what ’s been happening in our country and are poised to take up the reins .
How can we not believe in Madonna ?
A fifty year old with so much plastic surgery she does n’t even look like herself anymore ?
How can we not believe in the " New York Times " and the pollsters , who get it wrong time and again ?
How can we not believe in the talking heads , spewing from their perspective , completely unaware of the heartbeat of this country .
Hillary thought the heartbeat was patriotic warmongers .
She had to be tough on defense .
But it turns out having seen New Orleans underwater and an endless conflagration in Iraq people are questioning our leadership .
They want to push the older generation out of the way .
And not only in politics , but music .
It started with Napster .
The public felt justified , because everybody knows there ’s only one good single on an album .
Everybody knows that you can eat all you want for a low price with the mobile and cable companies , but the music business finds this to be anathema .
Once upon a time , the music industry was populated by idealists .
But now , anyone who leaves money on the table is a chump .
You ’ve got to support your lifestyle .
And the acts are complicit in the shenanigans .
You wonder why no one wants the product in the same quantity ?
The inane banter .
The ridiculous records .
Everybody knows that music is just grease to get laid to .
To be discarded when the new evanescent track appears .
Greatest hits of the twenty first century ?
Everything ’s disposable !
It ’s too late .
You ca n’t have one foot in the past and one in the present .
You ’ve got to abandon your old ways .
You ’ve got to play by the customers ’ rules .
Does n’t matter if Wal - Mart wants cheaper CDs , those under thirty do n’t want discs .
Elvis Costello knows this , how come no one else in the industry does ?
But really , it ’s not about this generation adjusting .
That ’s laughable , just like their wearing of the kids ’ clothes and hairstyles .
Fifty the new forty ?
Tell that to your brain .
Really , it ’s about acknowledging that there ’s a new consensus .
And it ’s not being made by the oldsters .
And by oldsters , I mean you , the baby boomer , who thought he was going to rule forever .
This business is being taken over by those under thirty as you read this .
People who do n’t have Mercedes - Benzes , never mind private jets .
Who are willing to ride in vans and sleep four to a room .
Who put the music first .
And this music is n’t made for radio .
And not for corporations .
But for the audience .
Exciting times .
If you ’re willing to realize that everything you believe is wrong .
Everybody knows that you ’re in trouble
Everybody knows what you ’ve been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach at Malibu
And everybody knows it ’s coming apart
Take one last look at this sacred heart
Before it blows
And everybody knows

Bernanke Cries " It 's all China 's Fault ! "
He 's at it again .
Bernanke , that is .
Thursday the Fed chief delivered a rambling 45 minute speech at the International Monetary Conference in Barcelona , Spain laying out all the reasons why the Federal Reserve is NOT responsible for the present crisis in the financial markets .
Here 's what he said :
" In the financial sphere , the three longer - term developments I have identified are linked by the fact that a substantial increase in the net supply of saving in emerging market economies contributed to both the U.S. housing boom and the broader credit boom .
The sources of this increase in net saving included rapid growth in high - saving East Asian countries and , outside of China , reduced investment rates in that region ; large buildups in foreign exchange reserves in a number of emerging markets ; and the enormous increases in the revenues received by exporters of oil and other commodities .
The pressure of these net savings flows led to lower long - term real interest rates around the world , stimulated asset prices ( including house prices ) , and pushed current accounts toward deficit in the industrial countries -- notably the United States -- that received these flows . "
" In the financial sphere , the three longer - term developments I have identified are linked by the fact that a substantial increase in the net supply of saving in emerging market economies contributed to both the U.S. housing boom and the broader credit boom .

The pressure of these net savings flows led to lower long - term real interest rates around the world , stimulated asset prices ( including house prices ) , and pushed current accounts toward deficit in the industrial countries -- notably the United States -- that received these flows . "
" There is a high likelihood that the massive increase in the price of oil that we are currently observing is the manifestation of a severe misallocation of resources — a large increase in nonproductive activities .
It is these activities that have laid the foundation for the oil - market bubble , which has become manifest in the explosive increase in the price of oil .
The root of the problem here is the Fed 's very loose monetary policy between January 2001 and June 2004 .
( The federal funds rate was lowered from 6 % to 1 % . ) "
" These net savings flows led to lower long - term real interest rates around the world , stimulated asset prices ( including house prices ) , and pushed current accounts toward deficit in the industrial countries -- notably the United States -- that received these flows . "
" And , in preparation for the new Basel II capital regulations , supervisors required more - demanding standards for the measurement and management of risk . "
" The housing and credit booms were driven to some extent by global savings flows , but they also reflected domestic factors , such as weaknesses in risk management and lax standards in subprime lending .
Higher commodity prices are for the most part a global phenomenon , but U.S. dependence on oil imports makes this country quite vulnerable on that score . "
" I am committed to promoting policies that enhance the underlying competitiveness of the U.S. economy and ensure that the dollar remains the world 's reserve currency .
The dollar has been the world 's reserve currency since World War II and there is a good reason for that .
The U.S. has the largest , most open economy in the world , and our capital markets are the deepest and most liquid .
The long - term health and strong underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy will shine through and be reflected in currency values .
Paulson is a certifiable nutcase
" If America were to lose its reserve currency status because of a continued loss of confidence in the dollar , the cost in terms of jobs and growth would be significant .
The real economic benefit conveyed by the right to print the accepted global currency is called seignorage , which results in part from the lower capital cost we derive from foreigners ' willingness to hold dollar cash .
This country has taken for granted the benefits of our global seignorage for many years , and it is one of the reasons the U.S. has maintained a higher growth rate than the world 's other mature economies . "
( " The Dollar and the Market Mess "
Economist Nouriel Roubini summed it up like this : Economist Nouriel Roubini summed it up like this :
" A contracting economy , falling employment , the worst US housing recession since the Great Depression , collapsing home values , millions of households underwater with an incentive to walk away , a shopped out and saving - less and debt - burdened US consumer buffeted by falling home prices , falling HEW , falling stock prices , rising debt servicing ratios , oil at $ 130 a barrel and gasoline at $ 4 a gallon , collapsing consumer confidence and falling employment are taking the toll on the economy , on financial markets , on banks , on the shadow financial system and on money markets and credit markets .
We were in the eye of the storm rather than past the storm ; and the recent events and developments suggest that the worst is ahead of us , for the economy , for equity markets , for credit markets and for money markets . "
That 's right ; doomsday , dead ahead .
Whew .
That 's a pretty long - winded way of saying the Chinese are to blame for everything that 's gone wrong in the markets for the last 10 months .
But is it true ?
Ask yourself this , dear reader ; do " savings " cause massive equity bubbles or are bubbles the result of low interest rates and rotten monetary policy ?
It is universally agreed that Greenspan created the housing bubble by dropping rates below the rate of inflation for 31 months following the dot.com bust .
This sparked a multi-trillion dollar speculative frenzy in real estate .
Artificially low interest rates distort the market ; bubbles appear .
" Savings " had nothing to do with it ; Bernanke is just trying to dodge responsibility by blaming the Chinese .
It 's the old " dog ate my homework " routine .
The Fed is also responsible for the surge in oil prices .
As Frank Shostak points out in his recent article " The Oil Price Bubble " :
As far as Bernanke 's contention that the " unprecedented growth in developing and emerging market economies ( China , again ) ... made the Fed 's job of managing inflation easier " ; that 's true .
But whose interests did that serve ?
Certainly not the American people who 've seen their factories closed and jobs outsourced by a handful of wealthy US industrialists who gutted their country for a pocketful of silver .
Globalization is just the public relations mask that conceals the avarice of its main proponents ; upper - class parasites .
That 's who Bernanke speaks for not the American people .
Besides , the Fed knew from the very beginning that the Chinese were manipulating their currency so they could offload their cheap manufactured goods onto the American market and crush US industry in the process .
What 's wrong with that ?
That 's what America used to do when we had leaders who operated in the national interest rather than serving a global corporate oligarchy and their madcap scheme for a New World Order .
It 's called capitalism ; and America used to be pretty good at it .
The Fed never cared that the game was being rigged .
Why would Bernanke care ?
After all , China and Japan were reinvesting their massive trade surplus ' in US Treasuries and equities which kept interest rates artificially low while providing Wall Street with a steady flow of cheap capital .
It was a " win-win " situation for the investment moguls and their buddies at the hedge funds .
They were busy getting rich while the nation was being handed over to foreign creditors lock , stock and barrel .
Neither Greenspan or Bernanke ever made a peep of protest while the looting continued for more than a decade .
Bernanke does n't even deny this .
In his speech he says : Correct .
The $ 800 billion current account deficit was recycled into US Treasuries and securities creating phony prosperity which the Fed knew was " unsustainable " , but they refused to fulfill their regulatory role .
Instead , Greenspan and his Fed - brothers rubber - stamped every hare - brain scheme that Wall Street cooked up including the myriad complex derivatives contracts which ballooned from less than $ 1 trillion in 2000 to over $ 580 trillion today ; a monstorous bubble which is large enough to send the entire global economy into a decades - long tailspin .
Did anyone at the Fed speak up ?
No way .
Bernanke 's speech : More lies .
Basel II allowed the banking giants to estimate their asset values according to their own internal models , in other words , by picking a number out of a hat .
It 's a joke .
After Glass Steagall was repealed , the whole system was turned over to the crooks in pinstripe suits who quickly ran it into the ground .
Booyah Reagan !
Hurray for Milton Friedman !
Bernanke again : " Risk management ?
Lax lending standards " ?!?
What risk management ; what lending standards ?
Does he mean lending hundreds of billions of dollars to mortgage applicants with no job , no collateral , no down payment and bad credit ?
Those standards ?
The whole scam was engineered by the investment banks who thought they could peddle mortgage - backed slop to gullible investors without any risk to themselves .
They never expected that Bear Stearns hedge funds would blow up ( in July 2007 ) and leave them holding hundreds of billions in toxic " subprime " bonds .
As far as escalating commodities prices , that all started with the Fed , too .
Zhou Xiaochuan , governor of the People 's Bank of China , clarified this point earlier this week when he accused the Fed triggering inflation around the world by " reducing interest rates " and forcing commodities to rise sharply .
( Yes , China does understand the game the Fed is playing ) Bernanke pretends that he does n't grasp why oil prices are rising even though he 's pegged the Fed Funds rate below the rate of inflation .
What 's the mystery ?
When the dollar is traded below its " after inflation " value ; how can oil do anything except go up ?
This is n't rocket science .
But the Fed does n't give a hoot about inflation anyway .
That 's just another myth .
The Wall Street Journal summed it up like this on Tuesday : " Inflation can't get entrenched without rising wages , which wo n't happen in a weak labor market . "
That 's what this is really all about ; making sure the working stiff never gets another farthing for his labor .
That 's why the consumer price index ( CPI ) is the most " class oriented " of all the economic gages .
It purposely factors out food , energy , housing ( except rental value ) so that the only time the inflation alarm blinks red is when salaries go up ; then all hell breaks loose !
It does n't make a bit of difference to the Fed what working people are paying at the grocery store or the gas pump ; just as long as they NEVER get a raise .
The Fed also cares about " Capital flight " which is accelerating because of the Central Bank 's mismanagement of the financial markets .
Confidence in US markets is at its nadir and private investors are headed for the exits .
That puts more strain on the battered dollar , which is likely to lose its position as the world 's " reserve currency " .
That 's why Henry Paulson was in the Middle East on Monday pleading with the oil producing countries not to break their peg with the dollar .
If the dollar is delinked from petroleum ; the Empire wither overnight ; the war will end , the troops will come home , and the United States will have to pay its bills like everyone else .
Is there a downside ?
Paulson said , .
The underlying US economy may be strong but the financial system is built on pure quicksand and is sinking fast .
The only thing keeping the dollar afloat is the secret maneuvering of the G - 7 and the loyalty of a few venal Arab sheiks who would rather see their people face 14 per cent inflation then cut the umbilical cord to Uncle Sam .
Earlier this year , author Bill Wilby explained the benefits of being the world 's " reserve currency " : , Bill Wilby , Wall Street Journal ) Wilby 's right , foreign investors and central banks would have no reason to keep their treasure - trove of $ 6 trillion in USD and dollar - backed assets if oil is no longer denominated in greenbacks .
That means a flood of dollars would reenter the US causing an inflationary spiral that would make Wiemar , Germany look like a breezy day on the strand .
Thanks to the Fed 's ham - fisted monetary policies , a Force - 5 economic hurricane is presently looming right offshore and there 's nothing Bernanke or Paulson can do to stop it from touching down .
If Bernanke cuts rates ; commodities ( and oil ) will skyrocket and foreign investors will ditch the dollar .
If he raises rates , banks will fail and the housing crash will accelerate .
There are no good options .

Common Excuses Used To Comment Code and What To Do About
Them of unexecutable text in a program .
I thought the idea was downright ludicrous .
But as I 've made an effort towards reaching this nirvana called " self - documenting code , " I 've noticed it 's far more than a pipe dream .
The first thing you have to do is throw out this notion of gratuitously commenting for the sake of commenting that they teach you in school .
There 's no reason every line needs to be commented with some text that simply reiterates what the line does .
After that , we can examine some seemingly rational excuses people often use to comment their code :
The code is not readable without comments .
Or , when someone ( possibly myself ) revisits the code , the comments will make it clear as to what the code does .
The code makes it clear what the code does .
In almost all cases , you can choose better variable names and keep all code in a method at the same level of abstraction to make is easy to read without comments .

We want to keep track of who changed what and when it was changed .
Version control does this quite well ( along with a ton of other benefits ) , and it only takes a few minutes to set up .
Besides , does this ever work ?
( And how would you know ? )
. Version control does this quite well ( along with ton other benefits ) , and it only takes few minutes to set up .
Besides , does this ever work ?

I wanted to keep a commented - out section of code there in case I need it again .
Again , version control systems will keep the code in a prior revision for you - just go back and find it if you ever need it again .
Unless you 're commenting out the code temporarily to verify some behavior ( or debug ) , I do n't buy into this either .
If it stays commented out , just remove it .

The code too complex to understand without comments .
I used to think this case was a lot more common than it really is .
But truthfully , it is extremely rare .
Your code is probably just bad , and hard to understand .
Re -write it so that 's no longer the case .

Markers to easily find sections of code .
I 'll admit that sometimes I still do this .
But I 'm not proud of it .
What 's keeping us from making our files , classes , and functions more cohesive ( and thus , likely to be smaller ) ?
IDEs normally provide easy navigation to classes and methods , so there 's really no need to scan for comments to identify an area you want to work in .
Just keep the logical sections of your code small and cohesive , and you wo n't need these clutterful comments .

Natural language is easier to read than code .
But it 's not as precise .
Besides , you 're a programmer , you ought not have trouble reading programs .
If you do , it 's likely you have n't made it simple enough , and what you really think is that the code is too complex to understand without comments .
There are only four situations I can think of at the moment where I need to comment code :
In the styles of Javadoc , RubyDoc , et cetera for documenting APIs others will use .
In the off chance it really is that complex : For example , on a bioinformatics DNA search function that took 5 weeks to formulate and write out .
That 's how rare it is to have something complex enough to warrant comments .
TODOs , which should be the exception , not the rule Explaining why the most obvious code was n't written .
( Design decisions )
In what other ways can you reduce clutter comments in your code ?
Or , if you prefer , feel free to tell me how I 'm wrong .
I often am , and I have a feeling this is one of those situations .
What are some other reasons you comment your code ?

Comments Leave a comment
Back in the mid 1990's when I worked in the Avionics Defence industry , we used to have to design our code in Pseudo - code comment form .
This would then be reviewed ( sometimes many times ) in meetings before turning it into real ADA / CORAL 66 code .
The comments were always left in .
But this was a long time ago :-)

I only did it because it was company / Government / Military standard .
Naval Sonar , F - 16 and F - 22 Helmet and Head Up Displays and Eurofighter Flight control work required it .
I 'm in the UK but a lot of the work was for the U.S.A - I was a grunt , a drone software engineer just doing what they were told .
It was actually intensely dull :-)

Hi Sam .
I found the article quite interesting and enlightening .
Thanks .
But I have another excuse to write comments .
Wonder if you could address it .
Well a lot of time we code something based on some logic and some circumstances ( or use - cases i.e. the same set of code address various problems ) , however later I find that some person ( not particularly bright ) has considered only one use - case and in order to modify some new enhancements in that particular use case gone ahead and modified the code such that the other use - cases have gone amiss .
e.g . I have a method -
object appendtypeforstring ( object ob ) {
if ( ob is string )
ob += " is string " ;
return ob ;
}
When some juniors are optimizing this function , they might see some execution of this method with string args and assume this is called only with string arguments and hence might remove the if ( obj is string ) to optimize .
Hence here i would recommend adding the comment {// append string if ob is string , otherwise return the object as is ... or something like that} .
The point ( or excuse ) i am trying to make is that there are times when I feel that some one of not so high intellect might mess up my code and I feel that a comment is required .
I would appreciate it if you could express your views on this and throw some light on the problem .
Thanks .

and adding the that many times I come across code that I feel .... why is it there ??
its not required ??
but I go crazy trying to find out if we can remove it or not ...
e.g-Suppose later someone divides the above function into 2 overloaded functions
object appendtypeforstring ( string ob ) {
if ( ob is string ) // { 1}
ob += " is string " ;
return ob ;
}
and
object appendtypeforstring ( object ob ) {
if ( ob is string )
ob += " is string " ;
return ob ;
}
the obviously line marked by { 1} becomes redundant and should be removed , but he does not remove it .
In this case it is simple but in some complicated cases , some code we feel is redundant might be serving some " higher purpose " and I go crazy trying to figure it out ( honestly we usually prefer leaving it as it is than risking a system crash somewhere else ) .
but a comment stating its purpose would let us clean up the code better .
Hence I think that comments should be used a bit graciously .
Not go overboard , but use it graciously for someone in the future who is not as smart as us :) .
Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong .
Thanks .
P.S. - I apologize if you feel that my concern is stupid and that I have wasted your time .

For instance , if you have made this as a small change instead of as a small part of a larger feature , you might find the reason why in the commit message ( assuming you 're using version control ) .
If I have a question about why something was done , I 'll often first look there to see if they left a comment as to why , or to see what else was changed to understand it .
Also , in this case , I think it could be more clear from the function name that you want it to behave this way .
It 's pretty clear already , but what if you named it " appendTypeIfString " instead of " appendTypeForString " ?
Or , you might make it more clear by using an else , so it looks obvious that there is a case for strings and for objects that are n't strings .
For your second case regarding the overloading , I typically will just remove any code that is obviously not executed ( or if executed , will always result in the same result ) , but I could see how a junior might not do that .
In this case , I think having automated tests to cover the behavior is very useful .
Then you do n't need to fear it so much .
In the end , I think if fear of changing code is the motivation for using comments , there are better ways to alleviate that fear .
In the case you presented , it 's very easy to reason about the code so maybe with a comment you can easily tell if it 's telling the truth or not ( but if you can , that 's one less reason for the comment ) .
On the other hand , if you feel the need to comment some code because it's hard to understand , then I do n't find the comment that helpful ( because I can't easily tell if what it says matches what the code really does ) and would much rather have easier to understand code .
If the code is doing something or doing it in some manner that people might question " wtf was going on here " you probably ought to leave a comment as to why .
For example , suppose your project is using an ORM , but the query it generates is very slow .
So you write the SQL by hand , and I 'd leave a comment saying " we broke from using the ORM here because the query was much too slow .
we got X improvement by switching to hand - written SQL " or something like that .
Hope that helps .
PS : Feel free to ask a follow up !

Thanks for the new insight .
Yes the version control would be a good place to leave explanations .
You would check it , but would Everyone :) ?
but I guess we could have it in the code of conduct / good practices and include it in induction / training so that everyone would .
Yes , of course the code snippets used were only for demonstration purposes and in reality we have a bit tougher logic :) but I agree that the code could be more " self documented " .
Would keep it in mind in future .
Automated Test Cases !!!
I wish ... but we do n't have that luxury ( dearth of time ) ... but maybe some day ...
Well ... I appreciate you taking time to reply .
I still feel that since different people view things differently and have different logic / strengths , hence clarifying things would be better but ...
Let me ponder on the above , put it into practice and see if my perception changes .
Again , appreciate your time .
Thanks :)

I sometimes put a comment to explain what objects and / or functions i needed in an import / include of certain files if it would usually seem strange to do so , like including iostream solely for debug info with some console I/O i.e
#include < iostream > /* using std::cout */
so people ( Myself ) can decide whether or not to remove a library easier .

Plus , in a compiled language , I 'd feel comfortable removing that since it would n't compile without it , and all places that used it would become immediately obvious .
Now in an interpreted language , you wo n't get that , so maybe there 's more of a benefit there .
( Although if you have solid test coverage , I 'd not fear removing it . )

That seemed like a good idea to me at first , but what if someone adds to the code using something extra from iostream but does n't update the comment ?

Version control , documentation , more subroutines and the like are excuses for not to comment the code properly .

There was no such a thing as a good variable name in Fortran 77 , which I used until some years ago .

In scientific simulation , sometimes you are a collaborator or you have a boss , and you work with someone else 's code , so that you can't restructure the whole code as you want .
They do n't let you do so because they are affraid of no longer understanding the code after you change it .
Or that you simply add a lot of bugs to a working code .
And doing so in parallel would require too many extra-hours that you really do n't want to spend in programming .
So what 's left ?
Commenting the most complicated parts of the code while hoping that this will help you understand it .
Or sending the link of this page to your boss ...

If it proves impractical because of political pressure , it 's fine to fall short of the goal .
Of course , if you just prefer to do things differently than what I suggested in the article , that is fine too !

There 's one important reason that people do n't mention very often ... " comprehension time " .
I work on a fairly large team of developers on a large code base written in C and ASM .
In all but the most obvious cases , it is generally faster to read a comment at the top of a subroutine than it is to read a bunch of code to figure out what is being done .
For example , I might be reading through some code - maybe trying to figure out what might have caused a bug , and I 'll come across something like this :
if ( some_sub ( ) ) {
...
If the subroutine name is not glaringly obvious , I have to go read the code , and if there is no comment at the top of the subroutine , trace through the implementation of some_sub , looking at all the possible return paths and return values to see what they are , and what they mean .
This can take 10 seconds , or 10 minutes and sometimes much more - particularly if that routine calls other equally ambiguous subroutines .
And I may not even care about any of this - I just want to know what it means when some_sub returns true or false , so I can trace through the high - level logic of the main code .
So for me the primary measure of code readability is this : " How fast can a programmer of some given skill level grok the code " .
And anything we can do , as programmers , to accelerate the comprehension of our code , is worth the effort .
So my primary reason for adding comments is to speed up comprehension of the code .

In general , if we can't take the time to make the code obvious , I 'm skeptical of us making the comments much better , including having the discipline to keep them up to date .
The code does what it does .
The comment may help you understand it , but it can be out of sync with the code .

All code should read well , and have meaningful class , function and variable names to the purpose and reason for existing .
However no comments , make meaningless flow , a lazy / unpolished finish and is a snobs belief .

I previously discussed the up - and - down cycle of college enrollment in computer science and related fields .
More accurately put , there have been two large peaks in computer science enrollment : one in the mid- to late 1980s ( which happens to be when I was teaching CS at Brigham Young University ) and another right around the turn of the 21st century .
Here ’s the CRA chart I included in that previous post ( click on the chart to see a larger version ) :
Back in 1985 - 87 , while I was teaching at BYU , I mentioned to my friend Wayne Holder — one the finest software engineers I ’ve ever known — that students at BYU could no longer simply declare their major to be Computer Science ; instead , they had to take certain prerequisites , apply to the CS department , and be accepted .
Wayne thought that was too complicated .
He suggested that the prospective candidate be put into a room with ( a ) a bowlful of money and ( b ) some really nifty hardware and software .
The candidate could then choose either to grab a handful of money and leave or to hang out and play with the computer gear ; those who chose the latter would be admitted to the program .
I think Wayne was dead on , and this article in Computerworld ( hat tip to Slashdot ) tends to support that , though the survey quoted in from the United Kingdom rather than the United States :
Responses from nearly 2,000 undergraduates across the UK showed that most students think the IT sector has a bright future with good prospects for highly paid jobs .
But over 60 % of non-computing students do not wish to enter the sector because they think it will be boring .
I ’ve written before that talent is a key factor in IT personnel issues , and only a small portion of the general population appears to be talented in IT .
People who have little or no aptitude for IT are likely to find it boring at best and confusing at worst .
However , that natural aversion to IT has been overcome at least twice in the last 30 years .
The first time was in the mid-1980s and was largely a response to the explosive growth of the personal computer industry , led by Apple , IBM and Microsoft , but including many , many firms making both hardware and software .
I wrote for BYTE Magazine back then , and individual issues of BYTE ran anywhere from 300 to nearly 600 pages , due to the sheer volume of ads .
My observation as a CS instructor at BYU was that many of our students had come into the program thinking they were going become rich and / or famous , like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates .
They viewed computer science the same way my fellow undergrads a decade earlier had looked at law or med school .
Hence the tremendous run-up in CS enrollment , not just at BYU but all across the United States .
Then came the First Tech Crash , which hit around 1988 — helped along , if not outright triggered by the stock market crash in October 1987 — and lasted into 1991 or so .
Large numbers of hardware and software companies went out of business , and the personal computer market pretty much narrowed down to IBM and a small number of IBM PC clone manufacturers , with Apple treading water ( at best ) .
The chart above shows how CS enrollment mirrored that crash .
By the early 1990s , the joke in the IT industry was : “ Do you know what the status symbol of the 90s is ?
A job . ”
CS enrollment nationwide was pretty flat from 1991 to 1997 , and down at a level that you ’d have to go back to 1981 to match .
Most likely , people going into computer science at that time were — like me , all the way back in 1974 — going into it because we liked the field , not because we thought we ’d be rich .
By 1998 , however , the “ dot - com boom ” had become visible enough to start driving CS enrollment up again .
There was an enormous demand for software engineers , with a lot of venture capital to back it up — news articles reported programmers being recruited out of high school , and CS graduates were getting large salaries and signing bonuses .
Beyond that was the vision of the “ nerd lottery ” ( to use Bruce Henderson ’s phrase ) : dot - com startups would go public , and many of the startup ’s employees ( right down to receptionists ) would walk away multi-millionaires .
Mainstream corporations tried to get in on the dot com boom as well , starting various e-commerce and internet intiatives .
In just about this same time period , the Year 2000 ( Y2 K ) problem got everyone ’s attention , and even those organizations , both commercial and governmental , that kept the dot - com craziness at arm ’s length found themselves having to do exhaustive testing and remediation of their IT systems from top to bottom .
Business and government in the United States would end up spending $ 110 billion on Y2 K remediation , all in just a few years .
As the chart shows , CS enrollement skyrocketed again , nearly tripling from 1997 to 2003 , largely due to the combination of these two factors .
Unfortunately for those students , Y2 K remediation largely finished up almost at the same time the Second Tech Crash ( or “ Dot Com Crash ” ) started , namely March 2000 .
The NASDAQ stock index peaked at its all - time high value of 5048.62 on March 10 , 2000 , a 100 % increase over what it had been just a year earlier .
( Stop and think about that : what if the Dow Jones Industrial Average were to hit 24,000 a year from now ? )
It was a classic bubble , and now it was popping , or at least deflating ; the NASDAQ index currently trades at less than half that value .
( Note that the DJIA is up roughly 20 % — and was up over 30 % earlier this year — from its value on that same date eight years ago . )
This tech crash was far more brutal than the first one .
The IT employment marketplace was flooded with massive numbers of IT engineers who were no longer needed , one way or the other , and even talented IT engineers had a hard time getting visibility over the sheer number of warm bodies out there .
But it took a while for that feedback to get back into the colleges and universities ; enrollment continued to climb until about 2003 but appears to have been slumping since then ( see the chart above ) and could actually drop back nearly to where it was when I graduated with my own CS degree some 30 years ago .
In other words , the real issue is n’t why CS enrollment is declining ; the question is why did it ever climb so high in the first place ?
And it ’s pretty clear that it tracks the two major bubbles of the past 30 years : the personal computer boom in the mid-1980s and the dot - com / Y2 K boom of the late 1990s .
After each bubble deflates , CS enrollment sinks back to its “ natural ” level , based on the distribution of IT - related talent and inclination in the general population .
The problem , however — as I first noted over 12 years ago — is that this “ natural ” level is n’t enough to supply sufficient IT talent for successful IT develompment and deployment in all the businesses , vendors , government agencies and other organizations that need it .
In my opinion , there is no shortage of IT engineers — particularly not after the vast numbers drawn into the industry due to Y2 K and the dot - com boom — there ’s just a shortage of talented ones .
This is why you get conflicting claims and statistics about “ personnel shortages ” in the IT industry ( cf. here vs. here , as well as the battle over raising the limit on H - 1B visas and the offshoring debate ) .
The various attempts to “ boost ” CS enrollment at colleges and universities will have only a small effect on that talent shortage ; for the most part , it will likely bring additional people into the IT industry who lack the talent or inclination to do well there .
In other words , it wo n’t solve our IT problems at all .

How a daily cup of green tea can give you a healthy heart in minutes
Green tea worked rapidly to open up heart arteries in the study
A cup of green tea a day could help keep your heart healthy , a study shows .
The drink was found to widen the artery which runs from the shoulder to the elbow by 4 per cent within 30 minutes - reducing the risk of blood clots .
This is a good indicator of improved blood flow around the body , says a report in the European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation .
It is the first time green tea has been shown to have a short - term beneficial effect on the large arteries .
Dr Nikolaos Alexopoulos and colleagues at the 1st Cardiology Department , Athens Medical School , used ultrasound scanning to measure the performance of the brachial artery - which runs from the shoulder to the elbow , and is a good indicator of blood flow around the body .
A team of healthy volunteers were given green tea , caffeine or hot water to drink on three separate occasions .
Measurements of the brachial artery were taken at three stages after they drank their beverage .
The researchers found the artery expanded by four per cent 30 minutes after volunteers drank green tea .
Caffeine or hot water had no effect .
Dilation of the artery shows better functioning of the endothelium , the layer of cells lining blood arteries that stops clots forming .
Previous research suggests black tea improves short and long - term endothelial performance , but this is the first time green tea has been shown to have a short - term beneficial effect on the large arteries .
Another study has already shown that green tea reverses endothelial dysfunction in smokers .
Green tea is traditionally consumed in China and Japan and differs from black tea in that it is not fermented before drying .
This fermentation process appears to reduce the content of flavonoids - beneficial antioxidants - by up to 90 per cent , which is why green tea is believed to offer different health benefits to black tea .
Researcher Dr Charalambos Vlachopoulos said ' These findings have important clinical implications .
Tea consumption has been associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in several studies .
' Green tea is consumed less in the Western world than black tea , but it could be more beneficial because of the way it seems to improve endothelial function .
' Recent studies have also shown potent anticarcinogenic effects of green tea , attributed to its antioxidant properties . '
Other research shows drinking green tea lowers ' bad ' cholesterol and blood pressure , and reduces harmful liver enzymes .
Drinking green tea could help stave off cancer , with a study showing just four cups of green tea a day reverses cell damage in heavy smokers that might lead to the development of tumours .
Lynne Garton a member of the industry - backed Tea Advisory Panel and a nutritionist , said ' This exciting piece of research takes us one step further in understanding the role of flavonoids in heart health .
' While the focus of the study was the action of green tea on endothelial function , black
tea , as enjoyed by the majority of the UK population , has shown similar results .
' This is not surprising as although the types of flavonoids in green tea and black tea may differ , it is thought that the amounts present in a cup are similar .
' Evidence is now suggesting that drinking around 3 to 4 cups of tea a day ( with or without milk ) may help reduce the risk of developing heart disease and studies such as these are important in helping us understand the possible mechanisms of action .
' As part of an overall , healthy balanced diet , this research highlights yet another good reason to drink tea . '
We all know the McCain campaign is becoming increasingly desperate with their scurrilous and baseless attacks on Senator Obama .
When you think about it , there really is no other option for them since they 're on the wrong side of literally every single issue .
But if you 're going to smear your opponent , you should probably aim to help your cause rather than hurt it .
McCain latest ad , called " Troops , " attacks Obama as some kind of troop - hater because he did n't bother to visit with wounded soldiers during his trip overseas .
The only problem ?
The ad contains footage of Obama meeting with the troops during his overseas visit .
You can't make this stuff up .
ABC Blog :
Sen .
Barack Obama 's landing at Chicago 's Midway airport this evening was greeted with the news that rival Sen.
John McCain launched a new TV ad attacking Obama for that canceled visit to see wounded troops in Germany .
McCain 's ad asserts that Obama " made time to go to the gym , but cancelled a visit with wounded troops .
Seems the Pentagon would n't allow him to bring cameras . "
The McCain campaign provides no evidence for the assertion that being told he could n't bring media had anything to do with the trip 's cancellation .
Oddly , when discussing Obama 's trip to the gym , the ad uses footage of Obama playing basketball with US troops in Kuwait over the weekend .
I thought those Bush / Cheney guys McCain hired -- remember , the same ones who viciously smeared him during the 2000 campaign -- were supposed to be good at this stuff ?
Here 's the ad .
Check out the video clip in the upper right - hand corner between :13 and : 21 .
You 'll clearly see footage of Obama in Kuwait bouncing a baskteball with hundreds of soldiers cheering him on .
Did I mention he drained that three - pointer , too ?
Keep 'em coming , Team McCain .
UPDATE : Jake Tapper adds this little nugget to his post .
In case there was any doubt left that Senator Obama wanted to " use the troops as a photo - op , " this should put that to rest :
Obama campaign spokeswoman Linda Douglass says , " We told military officials explicitly that Senator Obama had absolutely no intention of bringing any members of the media or photographers in with him to visit the wounded warriors .
In all of our communications with the military , we stressed that this was to be a private visit by Senator Obama . "
Somehow I do n't think this will stop the wingnuts from foaming at the mouth , though .
How sad .

Sharon
I do n’t think there are a lot of people who , except in their most facetious tones , refer to me as anything along the lines of “ Little Sharon - Sunshine . ”
And yet I actually consider myself a strong optimist , and by the standards of the peak oil movement , I certainly am .
I believe that a way of life is very much on its way out , that the transition will be painful – more painful than it had to be , but that ’s just the reality of the world .
I think we are currently in a deep and horrible disaster , being visited on the world ’s poorest and the tentacles are gradually crawling up the anchor to take down the rest of the ship .
But I also think that there is a good deal of reason for hope – we have vast capacities , vast resources and vast imagination .
Peak oil and climate change could , if we work really hard at it , be pretty much the end of the world .
But there ’s no reason to believe that we will , in fact , work quite that hard – we ’re lazy and the odds are good that the edifice that allows us to destroy ourselves may preceed most of our lives to the grave .
That thought alone gives me hope .
And because I am an optimist , because I take joy in being a ray of light , I generally dissent from the final prognostications of the Olduvai Hypothesis , while agreeing that we are on the downswing of a certain kind of industrial civilization .
I differ from Richard Duncan in several respects , while giving him credit for articulating the danger of peak oil long before most of us had ever heard of it .
I differ most of all on his conclusion , rearticulated here in this article by James Leigh , that it is necessarily the case that ,
“ The permanent blackout of electricity is crippling .
Without oil to continue to fire up our industrial society we will be without : public electricity , transport , industry ’s processed products ( food , clothing , packaging , and machinery ) , communication and computer services .
A little bit of brainstorming shows that the society and its systems would come eventually to a standstill .
A totally paralyzing set of circumstances with hunger and deprivation on an unprecedented worldwide scale . ”
I do n’t honestly know whether , as the Olduvai Hypothesis postulates , after 2012 we ’ll experience widespread , permanent blackouts .
I suppose it is possible , and for the purposes of this article , we ’ll assume that that ’s the case that electricity could be the marker point for our collapse .
As Duncan argues in this paper , electricity is more defining than transport :
“ As we have emphasized , Industrial Civilization is beholden to electricity .
Namely : In 1999 , electricity supplied 42 % ( and counting ) of the world ’s end - use energy versus 39 % for oil ( the leading fossil fuel ) .
Yet the small difference of 3 % obscures the real magnitude of the problem because it omits the quality of the different forms of end - use energy .
With apologies to George Orwell and the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics — “ All joules ( J ) of energy are equal .
But some joules are more equal than others . ”
Thus , if you just want to heat your coffee , then 1 J of oil energy works just as well as 1 J of electrical energy .
However , if you want to power up your computer , then 1 J of electricity is worth 3 J of oil .
Therefore , the ratio of the importance of electricity versus oil to Industrial Civilization is not 42:39 , but more like 99:1 .
Similar ratios apply to electricity versus gas and electricity versus coal . ”
My own intuition ( and I ’ve given it fairly little thought so that ’s all it is ) is that Duncan is right about the weighted importance of electricity to our present model of society , but wrong in his extrapolation of the long term consequences of short term adaptation to living without electricity .
And I think because Duncan was prescient in peak oil circles , his conclusion ( which comes down to “ we ’re all doomed ” has had disproportionate weight in the debate – in fact , there are a number of peak oil writers who have spent a lot of time arguing that “ we ’re all doomed ” is the majority opinion in the peak oil world , and spend a great deal of time debunking this perspective – and inadvertantly giving Duncan ’s conclusions far more emphasis than they actually merit among a range of far more nuanced and complex range of thought .
Part of the problem is Duncan ’s timeline for industrial civilization .
He imagines that it began in 1930 – but , of course , the beginnings of industrial society existed in the US for at least 100 years before that , and of course , in Britain for quite some time before that .
I lived for a few years in a building converted to apartments from the old Lowell Massachusetts textile Mills , and I can attest that the structures , and the city of Lowell in the 19th century were indeed industrial .
It is true that a majority of people did n’t live in “ industrial society ” in the US until the 1930s – but of course , Duncan is speaking of the world as a whole , and a slight majority of people in the world only began living in industrial society last year – that ’s when the urban population worldwide finally exceeded the rural one .
Industrial society long preceeds electricity – even if we imagine that we will rapidly run out of the capacity to produce electricity , we have to recognize that Industrialization itself did not depend on electric power .
On the other hand , nor would I be the first to argue that life without industrialization sucked – parts of it undoubtedly did – I ’m very fond of cloth making machines , for example , and have no particular desire to spin every thread my family wears .
On the other hand I could , given the urgent necessity of doing so , and I could teach others .
I could even make a primitive ( not as nice as mine ) spinning wheel ( a huge jump in speed over the drop spindle , which I can make with three sticks ) out of an old bicycle rim .
And if low tech little old me , who flunked birdhouse building in woodshop , could do that , how long before the spinning jenny and the massive industrial looms of the 19th century get recreated by some bright chick who likes to tinker ?
There ’s a tendency , I think , when talk about going to a lower energy society to imagine that we then become a lower - knowledge people , that we rapidly lose the germ theory of disease , the ability to do algebra and the capacity to build bicycles – and maybe that ’s true – John Michael Greer has argued that a long term collapse may drop our knowledge base back further than we think .
But at a minimum , returning to illiteracy is going to take a couple of generations of huddling in our caves banging rocks together so we can forget all that other stuff , like how to build an efficient stove and an arch or two .
We ’re going to have to work at it .
But let us assume that Duncan is , in fact , correct – that we ’re going to fall off an energy cliff .
That we are facing a world without electricity – I ’m not sure I think it likely , but I ’m willing to accept the hypothesis .
Does that lead immediately to Duncan ’s envisioned conclusion ?
Leigh plainly thinks that the results would be catastrophic , from the construction of the below sentence :
“ Pause for a moment – just imagine the catastrophic consequences of no electricity : no phones or computers , no industry which is electricity based , no dairy products or processed foods , no refrigeration , no water as the water pumps wo n’t work , no cars or transport because the petrol pumps wo n’t work , no schools or universities , no banks which ca n’t electronically process transactions , no employment , no income – dwindling stocks of everything as society collapses to unprecedented levels of chaos and deprivation . ”
It is certainly the case that if we go in a single step from air conditioning and cold beer today to total blackout tomorrow , the transition will be extremely difficult , and the period of reorganization and the scaling up of other technologies will be stressful .
It is , however , unlikely to happen overnight .
But let ’s take a look at these assumptions .
Would , in fact , we be thrown , as Duncan has argued , back to the Stone Age ?
Let ’s see …no phones or computers .
Check !
That means communication would have to rely on …mail ?
Wow , that ’s just horrible , because after all , we ’ve had phones for thousands of years , and there ’s no evidence at all that we can live without them …oh , wait , maybe there is .
No computers – well , that means no math , right , because we did n’t invent calculus until…oh wait .
No industry which is electricity based – well , that means we ’re back to banging rocks together , because we never built or produced anything before electricity , right ?
No dairy products ?
You mean cows run on electricity ?
Woah , you learn something new every day .
Or perhaps he means no fridges , which means … we ’d have to eat cheese .
Dear G - d … not that !!!
No processed food .
Well this one is true – I ca n’t think of a single means to produce a Hostess Sno - ball without fossil fuels .
Do not ask for whom the bell tolls … it tolls for thee and they Sno - balls .
No refrigeration …yup , that means we ’re going to have to cook differently and eat differently .
Of course , billions of people do that now because they do n’t have refrigerators , but who ’d want to be them ?
No water – now that will be a tough nut to crack , unless , say we have any time between now and 2012 to deal with it …after all , it is n’t like water falls from the sky or something .
No cars or transport .
That ’s right , before cars , everyone just sat on their asses where they were born until they were up to their knees in their own feces .
No schools or universities .
Yup , no one had literacy before electricity – those ancient Greeks , they were writing in 1935 .
That ’s why we call them ancient , right ?
No banks which can electronically proces transactions – true , and I ’m sure that means there will be no currency , since money and markets were invented in 1985 by the folks who brought us the TSR - 80 , right ?
No employment – of course , there ’ll be nothing to do but sit around drooling and waiting for death .
And no income – did n’t you know Henry Ford invented work ?
Now I ’m being sarcastic here , and it would be an easy accusation to say I ’m minimizing the difficulties of making a transition from an industrial society to a less industrial one , and that ’s fair – sarcasm is never the most nuanced of genres .
But this stuff really toasts my buns , because it is so damned ignorant .
I ’m reminded of an essay by Chuck Trapkus in _ The Plain Reader_ , he tells the story of doing an demonstration of spinning , and a woman telling her children “ This is how they used to make clothes , long , long ago . ”
Trapkus responds with ,
“ She ’s right , of course , ” I ’m thinking .
“ But this is how I make clothes .
Today . ”
He goes on to add :
“ But lest we in our ignorance make the same assumptions the woman made while watching me spin , let ’s be clear on one thing :
Not everyone makes bread in an electric breadmaker .
Not everyone has access to a phone .
Not everyone has a refrigerator , a car , a toaster , a chainsaw .
Billions of humans right now , sharing this same Mother Earth , get by with far fewer electric / atomic / petroleum - powered gadgets and appliances that we United States citizens .
They may not all grind their own flour or weave their own cloth , but then , millions of them do .
So when w ask how they ever did anything then , we should ask how they still do it now , and acknowledge our profound collective ignorance in so many basic matters of human sustenance ”
Let us not bullshit ourselves – if we had to suddenly , rapidly transition to no fossil energies at all ( very , very unlikely for most of us ) , it would suck and be destructive .
But it would not send us back to Olduvai Gorge .
Many people would probably die in an overnight transition ( also wildly unlikely ) but most people probably would n’t .
Some people would curl up , unable to bear this world they lived in , but the rest would get to work reorganizing into something else , bringing back and recreating older technologies , using human and animal power , changing their work , building new economies and markets .
And not only could we survive , but we might not think that our lives were suddenly without meaning – electricity is not the defining characteristic of our beings , merely of our economy .
And economies are remade all the time .
The part of this that I find most troubling is the offensive notion that living without all the above - listed goodies makes life completely untenable .
Because that implies that the lives of our great - grandparents , and the billions of lives that do n’t have electricity are an unmitigated hell , a place we would n’t even be willing to visit , that all that is “ civilized ” about our lives began in 19 - freakin ’ - 30 .
If our past , and the lives of the world ’s ordinary poor are utter doom , we are doomed .
But what if they are n’t ?
Let us acknowledge a vast and difficult transition , and a great deal of potential and probably real trouble and misery a’coming .
But let us not start with the assumption that “ modern industrial civilization ” is equivalent to “ civilization ” itself .
And let us not seperate ourselves from everything that came before us and everyone now who lacks what we have as though some barrier keeps us from reaching out to them .
Can we kill ourselves off in the coming decades ?
Sure , I never wish to underestimate the stupidity of our collective humanity .
Is that a likely and inevitable consequence of even sudden , extreme depletion and shortage – no .
Only if we choose the worst possible forms of mismanagement ( and grant you , there ’s some good bit of evidence for this ) , only if we race headlong towards doom in a concerted effort can we create the consequences that Duncan and Leigh imagine are the simple results of the loss of electricty and other energies .
Electricity is a goodie , a sugar coating .
It makes a few lives possible – lives that would be lost in a world without it , and that is at tragedy .
But mostly , it makes lives easy and convenient , and grows the economy – and that ’s pretty much it .
It is not our life or our blood .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures ended a dramatic week of trading virtually unchanged on Friday , with prices slumping more than $ 9 in the first two sessions and then soaring to a new record above $ 147 a barrel on geopolitical concerns before closing the week about 0.1 % lower .
Futures sank as low as $ 136 on Tuesday amid a rising dollar but leaped right back on speculation that Israel may be nearer to launching an attack on Iran and on worries that supplies in Nigeria and Brazil may be disrupted .
Crude for August delivery closed up $ 3.43 , or 2.4 % , at $ 145.08 on Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
It hit an all - time record of $ 147.27 a barrel in electronic trading in early morning trading .
Prices have jumped $ 9.03 a barrel over the last two consecutive sessions , almost offsetting a loss of $ 9.25 in the first two days of the week .
" Most of the current upward pressure is about Iran , " said James Williams , an economist at energy research firm WTRG Economics .
" Until the rhetoric on both sides [ Iran and Israel ] is toned down , this will be a major driver in oil price movements . "
A rising dollar and concerns that a slowing economy could cut into oil demand pummeled oil prices earlier this week .
In a monthly report released on Tuesday , the Energy Information Administration projected that U.S. petroleum consumption will shrink by 400,000 barrels a day in 2008 , nearly 40 % more than EIA 's June projection of a decline of 290,000 barrels .
The change was " based on prospects for a weak economy and record high crude oil and product prices extending into 2009 , " the EIA said in the report .
The dollar weakened on Friday , The dollar index DXY , +0.04 % , a gauge for tracking the greenback against a basket of other currencies , fell 0.7 % to 71.91 .
See Currencies .
Dollar weakness typically boosts dollar - denominated commodities , such as crude oil and gold , as it makes them less expensive to buyers holding other currencies .
Rounding out Friday 's action in Nymex dealings , August reformulated gasoline rose 5.23 cents , or 1.5 % , to $ 3.56 a gallon and August heating oil added 3.92 cents , or 1 % , to $ 4.08 a gallon .
Natural gas for August delivery , however , reversed earlier gains and fell 40 cents , or 3.3 % , to $ 11.90 per million British thermal units .
Crude 's surge led a broad gain across most commodities Friday .
The Reuters / Jefferies CRB Index CRB , - 1.01 % , a benchmark barometer gauging the prices of major commodities , rose 0.5 % to 461.27 .
In the Nymex metals pits , gold futures rallied 2 % .

Rising tensions
Iran has said it test - fired a number of missiles in recent days , including a missile that 's capable of reaching Israel .
Such reports , though questioned by some U.S. military officials , have resonated in Israel .
The Jerusalem Post , citing remarks by Iraqi defense ministry sources , reported that Israeli warplanes have practiced in Iraqi air space , adding to speculation about a potential strike on Iranian targets .
" Everything that we were worried about going into the [ July 4 ] holiday weekend has reemerged , " said Phil Flynn , vice president at futures brokerage Alaron Trading in Chicago .
" The rhetoric from Iran is heating up .
They 're shooting off the missiles , and [ there is ] a lot of provocative statements on both sides . "
In addition to the mounting tensions over Iran , analysts said the oil market is weighing the possibility of more violence in Nigeria after the militant Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , known as MEND , said it will end its two - week cease - fire on Saturday .
" The geopolitical mix relative to oil is precarious , at best , and with the weekend looming no one wants much of an exposure , particularly with potential MEND activity tomorrow , " wrote Michael Fitzpatrick , an analyst at MF Global , in a research note .
Iran holds the world 's second - largest proved oil reserves and is the fourth - biggest producer .
Nigeria ranks fifth among exporters of oil to the U.S. , the world 's biggest oil consumer .
Strike looms in Brazil
Also contributing to the action in oil prices were reports that oil workers at Petrobras PBR , - 2.91 % , the Brazilian state - run oil giant , may go out on strike .
The union representing workers at Petrobras platforms in the Campos Basin planned a five - day strike , a union official said Thursday , according to a Dow Jones Newswires report .
Workers plan to begin the walkout on Monday , the report said .
The strike would halt production at 42 drilling and production platforms in the Campos Basin , off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo states , Dow Jones reported .
Tiny parasitic worms that cause chronic illness in millions of sub-Saharan Africans may increase their chances of contracting HIV , according to a new report .
This study comes just a week after another set of researchers announced a different theory regarding a factor that could increase Africans ' susceptibility to the HIV virus , hypothesizing that a genetic variant found in people of African descent raises the risk of HIV infection .
In the latest study , researchers infected monkeys with the worms that cause schistosomiasis , and then injected them with a form of the HIV virus .
They found that much lower amounts of the virus were necessary to give AIDS to the monkeys that had the parasitic worms , as compared to parasite - free monkeys .
The phenomen on ... needs to be verified in humans .
But with primates a generally reliable model of AIDS pathology , it could help explain why sub-Saharan Africa , where 160 million people are infected with schistosomiasis , has 10 % of the world 's population and 62 % of its AIDS cases [ Wired News ] .
Schistosomiasis , seen primarily in developing countries , is caused by tiny flatworms that live in snail - infested freshwater like rivers and lakes .
When people wade , swim or bathe in contaminated water , worms bore through the skin and travel in the blood , causing anemia , diarrhea , internal bleeding , organ damage and death .
[ Evan Secor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control ] said the parasitic worm infection may undercut the immune system 's ability to fight off HIV infection and may make it easier for HIV to get into white blood cells [ Reuters ] .
The study , which was published in the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases , might also explain why HIV is spread more easily via heterosexual sex in Africa than in other parts of the world .
This could be because the urinary form of schistosomiasis , which affects up to 50 per cent of women in parts of Africa , damages the lining of the vagina , the first defence against HIV [ New Scientist ] .

Poll : Public fed up with Bush , Congress Associated Press
Published : Wednesday July 16 , 2008
Print This Email This Just 16 % see US on right track WASHINGTON - A soured public has given President Bush and Congress record low approval ratings in the latest Associated Press - Ipsos poll , underscoring the toll taken by fretful economic woes and long - lasting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The survey , released Tuesday , also set a new AP - Ipsos floor for the number of people saying the country is heading in the right direction .
Just 16 percent said the country is moving the right way , a virtual tie with the 17 percent who said so last month .
In addition , 28 percent said they approve of the job Bush is doing , tying his low in the AP - Ipsos survey set last April .
Congress fared even worse : A new AP - Ipsos low of 18 percent said they were happy with Congress ' work , down a steep 5 percentage points from last month .
Underscoring the breadth of the gloom , dissatisfaction with the country 's direction stretched across party and ideological lines .
Only three in 10 Republicans and fewer than one in 10 Democrats and independents said the country is heading the right way .
Only one in five conservatives and even fewer moderates and liberals said they are happy with things .
Just 63 percent of Republicans and 46 percent of conservatives approved of Bush 's handling of his job , strikingly low numbers .
About one in five Republicans and conservatives voiced strong approval for the president , while one in 10 Republicans and three in 10 conservatives said they strongly disapproved .
Four percent of Democrats and 12 percent of independents gave Bush positive grades  the lowest he 's ever gotten from those groups in the AP - Ipsos survey .
The numbers were similarly low for liberals and moderates .
With soaring fuel prices , ailing financial and housing markets and rising inflation , Bush got his lowest grade for handling the economy .
Just 24 percent approved of how he 's dealing with it , tying last month 's AP - Ipsos low on that issue .
Only half of Republicans gave Bush good grades on the economy , as did hardly any Democrats or independents .
Disapproval was nearly evenly distributed across all levels of income  only a quarter of those from households earning at least $ 100,000 a year were satisfied with his work on the economy , with similar readings coming from those making less .
About three in 10 voiced approval for how he 's handling Iraq , domestic issues and foreign affairs .
All are near or tied with previous lows in the survey .
Approval of the Democratic - led Congress was dismal  about one in five Democrats and Republicans expressed satisfaction .
In interviews , many Democrats have expressed dissatisfaction that Congress is not doing enough , while many Republicans are unhappy with its Democratic leadership .
The AP - Ipsos poll began in December 2003 .
The record low presidential approval in the Gallup Poll came in 1952 , when President Truman hit 22 percent .
Since Gallup began asking about approval of Congress in 1974 , the all - time low has been 18 percent , reached several times , most recently in May .
The AP - Ipsos poll was conducted from July 10 - 14 and involved telephone interviews with 1,000 adults .
It had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .
The margin of sampling error for subgroups was larger .

This is a video clip where a reporter asks President Bush what advice he will give for the American people when the gas price hits $ 4 per gallon .
He gives a brilliant response .
A reporter asked Bush on March about the rising gasoline prices and asked him what advice he will give to the average American when the gas price hits $ 4 per gallon .
Bush asks the reporter instead with a question : “ Are you trying to predict the gasoline price ? ”
The reporter replied that is what the oil industry was predicting in spring .
Bush replies : " That is interesting , I have n’t heard that . ”
Even if he did n’t hear about the gas price , at least he could have given a sensible answer to the public how to cope with rising pump prices .
The American public is still waiting in the sidelines for his response .
Because of high gas prices , a number of people are lining up for free food at food banks .
The demand at food banks in the U.S. has increased by 15 to 20 per cent over last year and food banks are unable to cope up with this demand , according to Jon Stewart from the The gas prices have hit $ 4 per gallon in most of the country as reported here by Can Tran .
While the prices have been rising for sometime , there is practically no response from the Bush government .

Another set of photos freshly from streets of ex-USSR countries .
Via Breitbart TV , this clip from the XM radio show of “ shock jocks ” Opie and Anthony is truly sickening .
Please be warned — it ’s got extremely offensive and vulgar language and is definitely not worksafe .
One of their guests , a man called Homeless Charlie , says , “ I ’ll tell you what — what ’s that George Bush bitch , um , Rice … ?
Condoleezza Rice ? …
I ’d love to fuck that bitch dead , man , ” at which point the rest of the studio erupts into laughter .
Homeless Charlie says again , “ I ’ll fuck that bitch to death , ” to which Opie / Anthony reply , “ I just imagine the horror in Condoleezza Rice ’s face — ” [ uproarious laughter and interjection “ When she realizes what ’s going on ! ” ] “ — as you ’re just like holding her down and fucking her . ”
More uproarious laughter , prompting Homeless Charlie to continue : “ Punch her all in the fucking face — shut up , bitch ! ” Says Opie / Anthony : “ That ’s exactly what I meant ! ” [ raucous laughter ]
Continues Homeless Charlie : “ And George Bush wife ?
I ’ll fuck that bitch to death ! ” Opie / Anthony ( pretending to be Homeless Charlie ) : “ Hey woman !
Hey woman !
I ’ll show you a real man !
Why do n’t you come by my box ?
— I ’ll show you a real man ! ” [ laughter ]
And then , just so this spectacular conversation does n’t die a premature death , one of the hosts prompts Homeless Charlie to keep going , with : “ Hey — what about , uh , what about the Queen ?
Current events — the Queen just finally went back to her dumb castle or whatever . ”
Homeless Charlie exclaims : “ Fuck that bitch ! …
Fuck the Queen .
She lost .
You lost , bitch .
Why you coming over here , you horse - faced looking bitch ? [ whinny ] ” [ laughter ]
What a bunch of wacky crack - ups these guys are .
Honestly , I ’m not sure I can accurately convey how deeply upsetting this clip is .
It pisses me off to no fucking end — I can feel the anger twisting in my gut and curling its tendrils around my ribs like its own seething entity — but it also frightens me .
The first time I listened to it , goosebumps raised across my flesh and the hairs stood up on the back of my neck .
The hatred of women is palpable ; the urge to dominate and destroy .
Fuck that bitch to death .
And then we come to the Queen , who , as she is a “ horse - faced looking bitch , ” is tellingly not threatened with rape — because , you see , being fucked to death and punched in the face by a piece of shit called Homeless Charlie is a compliment .
Rape is only something that happens to attractive women .
Is n’t that just fucking hilarious ?
Naturally , I ’ll be called a humorless feminist .
Fine .
If not laughing at a bunch of men sitting around talking about fucking women to death makes me a humorless feminist , then I wear the badge proudly — because I ’m not just a humorless feminist ; I ’m a bitch who was nearly fucked to death .
Is n’t that just fucking hilarious ?
I ’m a bitch who tore out her fingernails by the roots in the carpet trying to crawl away from someone who nearly fucked me to death .
I ’m a bitch whose face was smashed against a stone fireplace because I fought back , leaving me groggy and bleeding from one end — and with a permanently chipped tooth as a souvenir — while I got torn apart at the other .
I ’m a bitch who was left lying in a pool of her own blood , which I later cleaned up so my parents would n’t find out , because I was 16 years old and scared and ashamed and grew up in a culture that tells bitches who nearly get fucked to death that it ’s their fault .
Is n’t that just fucking hilarious ?
You know what it feels like to be nearly fucked to death ?
It feels like your insides are being ripped out of your body .
It feels humiliating .
It feels like the intangible thing that makes one a person is being irreparably broken .
By the end of it , you feel as though death would be relief from the pain and the shame and utter , wretched brokenness of self you feel .
And , being lucky enough to be only nearly fucked to death , you get to live with that for the rest of your life , and , perhaps , on your thirty - third birthday , you might realize that this is the year when you ’ll have lived longer with those scars across your skin and your soul than you lived without them .
Is n’t that just fucking hilarious ?
Maybe Opie and Anthony would like to hear how hilarious they are .
The Electric Comet : The Elephant in NASA 's Living Room ?
by Michael Goodspeed June 29 , 2011
For thousands of years , the appearance of a comet in the terrestrial skies has provoked deep anxiety and even collective hysteria in humans the world over .
The reasons for this response are not entirely clear .
Working with historical testimony , David Talbott and his colleagues have concluded that comet fears originated in a global experience of catastrophe and terror .
Behind all of the regional traditions and stories is the memory of the " Great Comet , " the mother of all comets .
The memory traces to the origins of world mythology , according to Talbott , and is particularly vivid in the story of a cosmic serpent or dragon threatening to destroy the world .
The most common ancient ideas attached to a comet were the death of kings , the fall of kingdoms , cosmic upheaval , and the end of the world .
It is well worth asking why this collective anxiety can be provoked with the first appearance of a mere wisp of gas in the heavens .
The question is especially appropriate today because of the approach of the Comet Elenin , which is predicted to pass within about 0.233 AU of the Earth in October of this year .
Speculations about Elenin range from a theoretical NASA coverup of an " extinction level event , " to theories that the comet is actually the ever - elusive planet " Nibiru " of author Zecharia Sitchin 's lore .
( For a thoughtful meditation on the credibility of some of these theories , see the Subversify.com piece , " Is Google Censoring Nibiru ? " ) .
It should be noted here that the leading proponent of the electric universe , Wal Thornhill , has refrained from predicting specific behaviors of Elenin due to the number of unknowns .
These unknowns ( discussed below ) include the Sun 's activity , and the constituent material of the comet itself .
One can understand the frustration NASA likely feels when witnessing the carnival of theories surrounding space science news stories today .
However , NASA must surely bear some of the responsibility for the evident mistrust and even anger so often expressed toward the agency .
On the issue of comets NASA has never acknowledged the failures of the standard theory .
We are still told that comets are " dirty snowballs " that formed billions of years ago in a theoretical " Oort cloud . "
The idea makes no sense and has been repeatedly falsified by the observed behaviors of comets .
Silence on such matters is not helpful .
When the institutions of science choose a path of denial on controversial matters , rightly or wrongly it can only fuel perceptions of secrecy and suppression .
The unpredictable behavior of comets continually contradicts the tenets of traditional comet theory - to the point that some experts now wonder if a theory even exists .
“ It 's a mystery to me how comets work at all , ” said Donald Brownlee , principle investigator of NASA 's Stardust Mission .
One need only review the extraordinary spectacle provided by Comet Holmes 17P to see how deep the crisis in cometology reaches .
In October of 2007 , Holmes suddenly and unexpectedly brightened by a factor of a million .
In less then 24 hours , it grew from a small 17th magnitude comet to a magnitude of 2.5 , so large it was easily visible to the naked eye on Earth .
Holmes ' coma continued expanding until by mid-November of '07 it had become the largest object in the solar system , vastly larger than the Sun .
The coma 's diameter had grown from 28 thousand kilometers to 7 million km .
At the time of Holmes ' extraordinary display , the comet was actually moving away from the Sun , and therefore cooling .
Among the common sense questions posed by the enigma : how does such a gravitationally minuscule body hold in place a uniform , spherical coma 7 million kilometers in diameter ?
If Holmes ' flare - up was the result of a collapse or explosion ( as some scientists speculated ) why was the ejected material not asymmetrical ( as one would anticipate from an explosion ) ?
Why did the claimed explosion not produce a variety of fragmentary sizes instead of the extremely fine dust that was actually observed ?
What explosive event could have caused the comet to luminate for MONTHS , rather than the SECONDS typical of an explosion 's luminescence ?
Why did the comet 's gaseous , dusty , spherical cloud persist for months , rather than dispersing quickly away from the comet ?
Unfortunately , the science media and the astronomical community had barely anything to say about Comet Holmes .
This seems nearly unbelievable , considering the enormous interest the comet generated on the Internet .
As Thunderbolts contributor Scott Wall explained in his 2008 article , " Comet Holmes - a Media Non-event " :
You might think that this remarkable behaviour would be big news , particularly among astronomers .
A prominent Astronomy magazine recently published their top ten news stories of 2007 .
Surprisingly , this spectacular comet was not named as the top story .
It did n't even finish in the top ten .
In fact , the entire magazine completely ignored the comet .
There was not even an editorial comment .
Additionally , there was little if any newspaper or TV coverage ....
One might think that the bizarre and unpredictable behavior of comets would inspire a fundamental reconsideration of comet theory .
But comet science as a whole continues in a state of drift , never asking the questions that could change the picture entirely .
For years , however , the questions have been asked by proponents of the Electric Universe , who contend that comets are charged objects moving through the electric field of the Sun .
In recent years only the electric comet model has anticipated the major surprises in comet science , a fact anyone can confirm for himself .
It is only reasonable , therefore , to ask if an electrical explanation might help us to understand the explosive behavior of Comet Holmes .
The electric comet theory sees comets as leftovers of relatively recent catastrophic events in the solar system ( see below ) .
Comets have elliptical orbits for good reason , and the most dramatic comet displays will typically involve highly elliptical orbits .
During its time in the outer reaches of the solar system , the comet will acquire a negative charge with respect to the Sun .
Then , as it approaches the inner limits of its orbit , accelerating through the electric field of the Sun , it will begin to discharge to the plasma surrounding it , producing the familiar bright coma and tail .
Comet jets are electric discharges to the nucleus - the jets electrically machine the comet surface in a process similar to the industrial process known as spark discharge machining .
The electric view of comets can explain most if not all of the so - called mysteries that have long plagued cometologists , including : unexpectedly high temperatures and X - ray emissions from cometary comas ( something never anticipated by mainstream theorists ) ; the sharply carved relief of comets -- the exact opposite of what astronomers expected under the dirty snowball model ; comets breaking apart or exploding considerable distances from the sun ; explosive cometary jets that occur too far from the sun to be plausibly explained as eruptions of subsurface gas and water from solar heating ; ejection of larger particles and even " gravel , " something never imagined under the standard comet model ( which supposes that nuclei accrete from primordial clouds of ice , gas , and dust ) ; a short supply or complete absence of water and other volatiles on comets ' nuclei ; and the unexplained ability of a relatively minuscule comet nucleus to hold in place a highly spherical coma , up to millions of miles in diameter , against the force of the solar wind ( a phenomenon graphically displayed by Comet Holmes ) .
When asked to interpret Holmes ' " flare - up , " Wal Thornhill suggested in a private email : Outbursts from comets at great distances from the Sun seem to be correlated with a sudden change in the solar ' wind ' plasma environment due to a solar storm .
The point about sudden comet outbursts is that we are dealing with a sudden , discontinuous process of plasma discharge - a switch from dark current mode to normal glow mode .
It is a complex surface phenomenon that cannot be predicted .
The best we can do is to say that the passage of a sudden change in the solar wind is the most likely time to see a flareup .
And in fact , the sun had been electrically active in the days before Holmes ' so - called " explosion " .
Investigator Michael Mozina noticed that there was a large spike in the density of the solar wind on October 22 at 19:45 , two days prior to the flare - up ( See this movie or this graph ) .
This could have switched the comet into what Thornhill describes as normal glow mode , allowing the plasma coma to become visible .
Obviously , an electric comet will require more than a minor theoretical adjustment in the space sciences .
In fact , any honest consideration of the electric comet must open the door to a vast reassessment of astronomical theory .
The electric comet means an electric Sun - the Sun is powered by electric currents .
Then the great enigmas of the Sun - especially the " mysterious " acceleration of the solar wind - would find an answer that so far have remained off the grid of solar physics .
This reassessment would n't stop with the Sun , since the Sun is just one of billions of stars .
A reconsideration of comets would lead to a sweeping revolution in the space sciences , changing our picture of space altogether .
Sadly , NASA did not capitalize on a golden opportunity to definitively test the electric comet hypothesis in 2005 , when scientists fired an 800 - pound copper projectile into comet Tempel 1 as part of the Deep Impact mission .
However , the electrical view of comets was clearly not on the table for NASA 's consideration .
If it had been , a very simple test could have proven that we live in an electric solar system with an electrified Sun .
A Langmuir probe or simple current metering system attached to a corona discharge point could have registered the discontinuities in the plasma discharge ( dark current to glow to arc ) between the impact probe and the surrounding plasma as the probe closed on the comet nucleus .
Given what was learned in the mission , we have reason to believe the test would have been favorable to the electric comet .
In fact , Wal Thornhill expressly predicted the most " surprising " of these findings in advance of the mission .
In 2001 , shortly after the announcement of Deep Impact , Thornhill wrote : Given the erroneous standard model of comets it is an interesting exercise to imagine what surprises are in store for astronomers if the plan is successful .
The electrical model suggests the likelihood of an electrical discharge between the comet nucleus and the copper projectile , particularly if the comet is actively flaring at the time .
The projectile will approach too quickly for a slow electrical discharge to occur .
So the energetic effects of the encounter should exceed that of a simple physical impact , in the same way that was seen with comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 at Jupiter .
Twenty - four hours before the impact event , in collaboration with the Thunderbolts .
info group , Thornhill predicted that an electrical " flash " might precede the impact and explosion , and that the explosion would be far more energetic than NASA anticipated .
And this is precisely what happened on July 4 , 2005 , much to the astonishment of NASA and astronomers around the world .
Other successful Thornhill predictions included : a lack of increase in water production in the cometary coma ( indicating a lack of subsurface water anticipated by astronomers ) ;
an unexpected lack of ice on the comet nucleus , or water in the immediate ejecta from impact ;
a sculpted comet surface with sharply defined craters , valleys , mesas , and ridges ( the precise opposite of what one expects of a " dirty snowball " ) ;
a rearrangement of the comet 's jets due to charge re-distribution .
In Internet discussions on the predictive successes of the electric universe , some anti-EU activists have asserted that the Deep Impact ( and many other successful EU ) predictions can be dismissed because they have not been quantitative to the mathematicians ' satisfaction .
In other words , a successful prediction does not count as evidence if the prediction does not give a numerical value .
This meaningless response would not be accepted by any self - respecting scientist .
The primary goal in any science must be to first get the concepts established to coherently fit all available observation .
If the concepts are correct , mathematics become a useful tool in completing the picture at a higher level of precision .
But mathematical precision in and of itself is useless in the absence of simple and direct explanatory power .
Note also that Alfvén 's plasma cosmology is an excellent theory when measured by its successful predictions .
Despite this , “ .. the continuing resistance to Alfvén 's work is based on a widely held opinion that his predictions are not derived from a plausible physical theory ( i.e. , a theory that conforms to the dominant paradigm ) .
If a theory is not acceptable , it does not gain credit by making successful predictions .
This would imply that the role of prediction as a means of evaluating scientific theories has been exaggerated . ” - Stephen G. Brush , Alfvén 's Programme in Solar System Physics , IEEE Transactions On Plasma Science , Vol. 20 , No. 6 , December 1992 , p. 577 .
In the electric universe , an essential contribution comes from experimental work in the laboratory , work that is foundational in establishing a frame of reference logically prior to any mathematical experiments .
Due to the scalability of electrical events , patterns that can only be created by electric discharge in the laboratory become extremely significant when these patterns are observed on objects in space .
Of this principle , numerous examples can be given .
The formation of comets and asteroids is an excellent case in point , due to the unique but repeated forms of these bodies , often exhibiting a double - lobed peanut shape .
Electric universe advocates have long contended that comets and asteroids were excavated from the surface of planets and moons in a prior epoch of planetary instability and electrical discharge activity .
The evidence suggests that these bodies were fused by electric arcs acting on surfaces .
The best example of this process is likely the planet Mars , since it is now known that material was removed from the crust ( from the surface down ) from the Martian northern hemisphere .
Additionally , planetary scientists now suggest that the asteroid - like Martian moon Phobos was formed out of material violently removed from the surface by cosmic events not well - understood .
In the documentary The Lightning Scarred Planet Mars , David Talbott presents a strong evidential case that Phobos was fused by electrical discharge acting on the surface of Mars .
This interpretation of comet and asteroid formation is supported by the experimental work of plasma physicist C J Ransom at Vemasat Laboratories .
Ransom subjected a bed of hematite to an electric arc , creating a number of fused spheres alongside occasional double - lobed configurations .
The latter were remarkably similar to the incongruous shapes of numerous comets and asteroids .
For a side - by - side comparison , note the shape below on the left and similarity to the comet Hartley , shown on the right :
Left : Specimen produced in the laboratory of CJ Ransom .
Right : Comet Hartley .

In light of this extraordinary comparison , the anti-EU activists 's relentless demands for mathematical quantification grow more absurd .
Institutionalized astronomy , with its massive advantages in the forms of billions of dollars of funding , biased educational and peer - review systems and the uncritical support of science media , has failed to resolve the " mysteries " of comets .
In contrast , a few plasma experimentalists working with virtual pocket change have delivered findings that can and should revolutionize comet science .
In many scientific controversies today - from global warming to Genetically Modified Organisms to the safety of nuclear power - the public 's trust in officialdom grows evermore tenuous .
A failure by NASA to honestly and thoroughly reassess comet theory may have unforeseen , long - term consequences for the agency 's credibility and the public trust .
Such a reassessment must not ignore the contributions of plasma physicists and electrical engineers , no matter how far - reaching or uncomfortable the ramifications may be for conventional theorists .
In this regard , perhaps the world 's leading astronomers would be wise to heed the words of the Professor Randy Pausch who once quipped , “ When there 's an elephant in the room introduce him . ”

· Anxiety over success in enriching uranium · US forced to deny Bush has plan to attack Tehran
Almost every country in the Middle East has announced nuclear energy plans in the space of less than a year , in response to Iran 's dramatic progress towards atomic power , it was reported yesterday .
Iran 's pursuit of uranium enrichment in defiance of UN security council resolutions has increased tensions with the US .
Yesterday , Israel army radio reported that a senior US administration official told the Israeli government during last week 's presidential visit that George Bush and Dick Cheney still intended to mount military action against Iran .
The White House dismissed the report , saying it remained committed to diplomacy and economic pressure to force Iranian compliance .
Iran 's success in enriching uranium , which Tehran insists is purely for peaceful energy generation , has caused anxiety in Israel , which has an undeclared nuclear arsenal , and across the Arab world .
Between February 2006 and January 2007 , twelve Arab states and Turkey declared their interest in developing nuclear energy .
A report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) said the resurgence of interest brought with it the risk of a " proliferation cascade " of nuclear arms across the region .
The IISS report , Nuclear Programmes in the Middle East -
In the Shadow of Iran , said the proliferation threat is " real but not imminent " .
There are still financial and technical obstacles to building nuclear reactors , and not necessarily a direct link between building civilian reactors and making bombs .
However , the motivation was in almost all cases driven by strategic goals rather than energy requirements , the report concluded .
" So far , none of the new nuclear aspirants in the region has been known to talk even privately about seeking nuclear weapons , at least for now , " it said .
" What they want is the human and technical infrastructure associated with nuclear - energy programmes in order to provide a counterbalance to Iran , both laying the ground for a possible future security hedge , and bestowing national prestige in the context of historic rivalries . "
The extent of nuclear ambitions varies .
The United Arab Emirates and Libya have signed nuclear cooperation agreements with France .
Bahrain concluded a similar understanding with the US .
Turkey , Morocco , and Egypt plan to have power plants within the next decade .
Last September Yemen announced a $ 15 bn deal for an American company to build five reactors , but cancelled it when an anti-corruption taskforce examined the deal .
Tunisia is conducting a feasibility study , while Algeria , Jordan and Syria have declared intentions to pursue nuclear energy .
Last September , Israeli bombers destroyed a building in Syria which Washington subsequently claimed was a nuclear reactor nearing completion with North Korean aid .
Syria denied this .
“ To have your cake and eat it too ” is a popular figure of speech meaning to try to have two incompatible things .
Of course , comedian George Carlin pointed out that the phrase does n’t make complete sense : “ When people say , ‘ Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too , ’ what good is a cake you ca n’t eat ?
What should I eat , someone else ’s cake instead ? ”
Indeed , the more proper ( and original , but less popular ) expression is “ You ca n’t eat your cake and have it too . ”
This is currently the case as Iraq and the United States try to negotiate an agreement about keeping U.S. forces in Iraq after the end of this year ( when the UN mandate for U.S. troops expires ) .
According to a declaration of principles signed by President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki last November , the United States is committed to a “ long - term relationship ” with Iraq that includes “ security assurances and commitments . ”
But as with most things , the devil is in the details .
In this case , the details include how many U.S. troops will remain in Iraq and for how long .
( Prior to invading Iraq , the president declared , “ We will remain in Iraq as long as necessary , and not a day more . ”
And in June 2005 , he proclaimed , “ As the Iraqis stand up , we will stand down . ”
Three years later , there are over 150,000 U.S. soldiers still in Iraq and we have yet to stand down . )
Given the current state of Iraqi forces , it is clear that the Maliki government is utterly dependent on the United States to provide some semblance of security in Iraq .
But the very presence of U.S. forces also undermines the sovereignty of Iraq and at least creates the perception that the government is being propped up by an outside power .
In an effort to eat their cake and have it too , the Iraqis want U.S. troops confined to their barracks as part of the post -2008 status of forces agreement ( SOFA ) between the two countries .
Yet , if the Iraqis are unable to enforce security on their own , keeping U.S. troops in their barracks will do them little good .
Whether the United States will continue to be able to eat its cake and have it too is also an issue of any future SOFA between Iraq and the United States .
The Iraqis want private security companies to be subject to Iraqi law .
Currently , these companies enjoy immunity , which triggered outrage when security personnel from Blackwater , the largest private security company in Iraq , were involved in a firefight that killed 17 civilians in Baghdad last September .
The larger problem , however , is that any SOFA means continued U.S. military occupation  which has been consistently opposed by the Iraqi people .
Indeed , a February poll showed that 73 percent of Iraqis ( 77 percent of Shi’ites and 95 percent of Sunnis ) oppose the presence of foreign troops in their country .
And last month , thousands of followers of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr took to the streets to protest the proposed Iraqi- American agreement  chanting “ No , no to America .
No , no to the occupation . ”
Sadr ’s main Shi’ite rival  Adbul Aziz al - Hakim , who heads the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq  also opposes such a plan .
And Iraq ’s most influential Shi’ite cleric , Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , has also expressed concern about the prospect of a continued U.S. military presence in Iraq .
Of course , President Bush does n’t see any problem with U.S. forces staying in Iraq .
Delivering the commencement address at the United States Air Force Academy , he said ,
“ After World War II , we helped Germany and Japan build free societies and strong economies .
These efforts took time and patience , and as a result , Germany and Japan grew in freedom and prosperity .
Germany and Japan , once mortal enemies , are now allies of the United States .
And people across the world reaped the benefits from that alliance .
Today , we must do the same in Afghanistan and Iraq .
By helping these young democracies grow in freedom and prosperity , we ’ll lay the foundation of peace for generations to come . ”
Comparing Hussein to Hitler to justify invading Iraq was inappropriate , and so is comparing Iraq to postwar Germany and Japan to justify staying in Iraq .
At the end of World War II , enemies formally surrendered , hostilities ended , basic security existed , and the local populations essentially accepted occupation  conditions that do not exist in Iraq .
Ultimately , both the U.S. and Iraqi governments must acknowledge that they cannot eat their cake and have it too .
Even if a SOFA can be reached , the U.S. troop presence is detrimental to both countries ’ interests .
Iraq cannot be a sovereign government as long as foreign troops occupy the country ; they are and will continue to be a reason for Iraqis to distrust and reject their own government .
And they are and will continue to be a reason for Iraqis  and Muslims around the world  to harbor ill will and fuel hatred toward the United States , which will only help terrorist recruiting efforts .
Removing U.S. troops will not solve all the problems that ail Iraq , nor will it mend U.S. relations with the Muslim world .
But the reality is that our presence in Iraq is part of the problem and not part of the solution .

A man who was found with his head severed by a chainsaw was fighting to stay in a block of 70 flats in Hampshire cleared for redevelopment .
David Phyall , 50 , was the last tenant at the Atlantic Housing Ltd housing association flats in Eastleigh .
His body was found by police on 5 July , who said his death was not suspicious .
Post - mortem tests showed he died of a " complete transection of the neck " .
An inquest was opened and adjourned at Winchester Coroner 's Court on Friday .
There 's nothing suspicious about the death
Spokesman for coroner
A spokesman for the coroner said : " As far as we know nobody else was involved .
" There 's nothing suspicious about the death .
It was in his flat on Bodmin Road .
" The place is all due to be redeveloped .
He was the last resident left there .
He lived there alone . "
A Hampshire Constabulary spokeswoman confirmed his death was not suspicious .
" We were called to the address on Bodmin Road on 5 July at approximately 4.20 pm to a non-suspicious death , " she said .

[ This is the text of a talk presented at the Marxism Summer School conducted by the Australian Democratic Socialist Perspective in January 2005 .
The pope referred to is the then - reigning Pope John - Paul II .
The current Pope Benedict XVI is mentioned , being Cardinal Ratzinger at the time this talk was presented .
See the appendices for more on Ratzinger and his background . ]
I have an acquaintance who is a staunch supporter of the Liberal Party and a fundamentalist Christian , she occasionally gives me a lift to the railway station in the morning , which I appreciate .
I did n’t know her religious bent until one morning she started regaling me with her opinion of Marxism , which was entirely based on the one sentence written by Marx that she knew : “ Religion is the opium of the people . ”
I do n’t think she could even give a coherent explanation of the sentence , let alone an understanding of its context .
She just knew that it was godless communism and that was enough for her .
I was a prisoner in her car , of course , and in the position of not wanting to enter into a polemic with a genuinely kind - hearted neighbour in whose debt I was .
So , I listened in wonder to the worldview of fundamentalism , or this particular strand of it .
Man ’s heart is evil , I was told .
Only turning to Christ and accepting Jesus into one ’s heart can cure the evil .
No amount of reading the Bible can help because it ’s only when Jesus is in your heart that the scriptures become illuminated and true understanding appears .
And Jesus must literally enter one ’s heart I was told emphatically , which , with my Catholic upbringing , immediately conjured visions of tiny Jesus statuettes bobbing around in my ventricles .
Everything was centred on the heart ; the mind was untrustworthy .
There certainly was the inference that Jesus had lived so that we could safely switch off our minds .
All of this was connected with the constantly reiterated word “ saved ” and congealed together with a welter of lotto numbers that related to chapters and verses in the Bible .
What started this avalanche of rapid - fire religiosity ?
I ’d mentioned blandly that I was preparing a talk on Liberation Theology and that it would be delivered to the Marxism Summer School .
And so , that morning ’s trip to the station became a research experience : the two political extremes of Christian politics , liberationist collectivist and neoliberal individualist sitting in one vehicle .
All it would have taken was one bolt of lightening and we could have settled the question of which trend God really supports ( note well , comrades : I am still here ! ) .
She spoke so fast and furiously that I did n’t have the opportunity to ask her if she thought that religion is “ the heart of a heartless world ” or “ the spirit of an unspiritual situation ” .
I ’m sure that she would have agreed with those sentiments and , of course they are the very words immediately before those that she quoted from Marx .
The point being , of course , that Marx , even though an atheist , was protesting against the same lack of spirit in the world , the same heartlessness that religion struggles with .
But he was counterposing his materialism as the better response than religion to that heartlessness .
Commonalities against bourgeois cynicism
I would argue that a sincere Christian would have more in common with Karl Marx than , say , with Napoleon Bonaparte .
Hear what Napoleon , the great representative of the bourgeoisie had to say on religion and oppression :
As far as I am concerned , I do not see in religion the mystery of incarnation , but the mystery of the social order : it refers the idea of equality back to the heavens , thereby preventing the rich from being massacred by the poor .
Religion is a sort of vaccine which , satisfying our love of the marvelous , protects us from charlatans and witch doctors ; priests are far more valuable that Kant and all the dreamers of Germany .
How could order exist in a state without religion ?
Society cannot exist without inequality of fortunes and inequality of fortunes cannot exist without religion .
When a man is dying of hunger alongside another one living in lavishness , he cannot accept this difference unless there is an authority to tell him : ‘ God willed it thus , there must be poor and rich in the world , but later and forever after , things shall be shared .
If ever the heartlessness of a heartless world was articulated that statement is it .
It is savage , cynical and pitilessly godless .
It is the voice of capitalism and it is the antithesis of Marxism and , I say , in common with all liberation theologians , it is the antithesis of what Jesus was on about .
Another way of putting this is communicated in this exchange that the Brazilian liberation theologian Frei Betto recalled in his memoir .
It is a conversation the Dominican priest had with his torturer when the military captured him in the 1960s :
- How can a Christian collaborate with a communist ?
- For me , men are not divided into believers and atheists , but between oppressors and oppressed , between those who want to keep this unjust society and those who want to struggle for justice .
- Have you forgotten that Marx considered religion to be the opium of the people ?
- It is the bourgeoisie which has turned religion into an opium of the people by preaching a God , lord of the heavens only , while taking possession of the earth for itself .
So , an argument that I am raising here is that Marxists and at least some sections of Christians have a great deal more in common than some Christians have with each other .
The Christian trends that I will look at are Liberation Theology and its opponents .
Its enemies are the Vatican , Protestant fundamentalism and Pentecostalism , which I say are reflections of neo-liberalism and more specifically US foreign policy .
Within Australia the largest trend within Christianity is simply middle - class mediocrity .
The vast majority of churchgoers do n’t think about these high - falutin ’ arguments .
Their faith reflects a comfortable lifestyle that involves a modicum of charitable good works to salve the conscience .
Some will give lip service to social justice but few will take it on as a vocation .
Liberationist gospel reading : theory and practice
In speaking of Liberation Theology I will follow the line of Michael Lowy in referring to Liberationist Christianity , that is : the broad social trend that incorporates the theologians .
The theologians like Leonardo Boff and Gustavo Gutierrez synthesised the movement ’s experience into texts .
But the theologians themselves are not ivory tower intellectuals , they are right there in the slums living the life and doing the work of the movement .
The movement is that of the masses of the poor in combination with nuns , priests and students working together .
Catechists , or spiritual leaders , come from within the communities , not from the priests or other religious .
Liberationist Christianity identifies the main task of Christians as combating structural sin , that is : the unjust structures of society .
Christian compassion expresses itself in solidarity with the struggling masses .
In many contexts Liberationist Christians have made far more significant contributions to revolutionary movements than Marxists .
I want to illustrate some of the historical threads of these developments in Christianity before trying to draw out contemporary considerations .
But before I begin those explorations I need to refer once more to Frei Betto .
In an article on Christianity and Marxism he once wrote :
When we speak of Christianity , we must – before considering its historical manifestations – start from its Biblical foundations .
So , I want to start with something that was once heard as a shatteringly radical statement :
The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
In the first century Roman - occupied Middle East that opening sentence of Mark ’s gospel was indeed a shatteringly radical statement .
For a start , every person hearing it knew how Jesus of Nazareth had died because his name was widely known .
He had been crucified .
Crucifixion was strictly reserved for one category of prisoner : rebels .
And just to set the social context of crucifixion , there is a historical account of a crucifixion around the time of Jesus where the victim ’s aged mother cried visibly nearby .
She was immediately crucified herself for the crime of expressing sympathy for a rebel .
The Romans were n’t mucking around with crucifixion .
It was the ultimate terror and having a crucified revolutionary spoken of in the way Mark ’s narrative does would have been astonishing at the time .
All the gospels should be read in this light .
They are like modern thriller novels in which , from the beginning , you know the hero ’s sticky end but the story takes you through the background so that you understand why the protagonist died .
The gospels and their audience
Each of the gospels was a product of a different community of believers and each gives a different theological slant on the story , reflecting the different outlooks of these communities as Christianity evolved over time .
The theology is communicated through the stories that they selected to tell and in the embellishments that they added .
The people depicted in them represent archetypes that were easily recognisable at the time and the events are metaphors for social struggle .
In the same way , you recognised social archetypes and aspects of social discourse in the story that I began this talk with .
That discussion in the car really happened , but how do you know that I did n’t embellish it to sharpen the point or make myself appear better ?
Does it really matter ?
The story is a metaphorical account of a genuine clash of ideologies in Australia today .
The gospel stories are exactly the same .
There was a historical starting point but by the time they came to be written generations later sharpening the point with embellishments was more important than getting the facts straight .
And in every one Jesus beats his opponents , even when they kill him .
If you ca n’t picture Jesus just think that he looked somewhat like Yassar Arafat and talked something like Malcolm X .
The gospels were written to inspire their audience of poverty stricken farmers , urban proletarians and slaves in their resistance .
If you ca n’t picture what those people looked like , just think of the Aboriginal people who fought the police in Redfern after T.J. Hickey ’s murder in February 2004 .
[ A young Aboriginal boy killed by cops . ]
The stories were constructed for them to identify with .
For example , when the angels announce the birth of the messiah to the shepherds in the fields , the imagery communicates a total reversal in power relations , as they were then known .
The shepherds represent the anawim , which is a Hebrew word meaning those who are bent over in their oppression , crushed physically and spiritually by their burdens .
Through the Greek translation that word has come down to us as “ the poor ” or , even more weakly , as “ the poor in spirit ” , which is akin to saying that someone dying of cancer is feeling slightly under the weather .
It would be closer to the original meaning of anawim to say “ the poorest of the poor ” or “ the wretched of the earth ” .
The photo on the front cover of the Resistance edition of Lenin ’s Imperialism , the Highest Stage of Capitalism conveys the meaning on the word anawim .
That Haitan man dragging that impossibly huge barrow through the dirt , he represents the anawim , les miserables .
Those of you who have seen
The Motorcycle Diaries remember that it was these people who Che Guevara met on his travels .
Listening to them converted him from a middle - class kid to the revolutionary that he became .
And it is precisely for them and for no one but them that the heavenly choir sings and announces liberation .
Liberationist method
What I am presenting here is a glimpse of the method of Liberation Theology , which is to listen , reflect and act .
The method involves creating a space where the oppressed can speak of their lives , then reflect upon it in light of Biblical stories and then take appropriate action .
The oppressed move from being the objects to being the subjects of their own history .
Hear how Ernesto Cardenal , the famous revolutionary Nicaraguan priest applied this method .
Cardenal condemned those who read into the gospel writer Matthew ’s line “ How happy are the poor in spirit ” the meaning that it referred to “ good ” rich people .
“ It ’s as if Jesus had said ‘ Happy are the rich ’ ” , says Cardenal .
But for Cardenal an accurate modern rendering would be “ Happy are the people of the Third World ” as they await their liberation .
Cardenal explains that in Hebrew literature what is called “ parallelism ” is often used .
That is : the same point is reinforced by being made twice using a slight variation in words .
In Jesus ’ famous beatitudes there are multiple parallelisms to ram home the importance of the message .
Cardenal says :
All the happy ones are the same people with different names .
And all the rewards are the same with different names .
The happy ones are : the poor , the gentle , those who mourn , those who hunger and thirst for what is right , the merciful , those who are pure in heart , the peacemakers , those who are persecuted for the cause of right .
And they are happy because : theirs is the kingdom of heaven ; they shall have the earth for their heritage ; they shall be comforted ; they shall be satisfied ; they shall have mercy shown them ; they shall see God ; they shall be called [ children ] of God ….
The gospel writer Luke has similar beatitudes but he follows them with curses on the rich .
Cardenal says : “ The rich are cursed because they have had their happiness , because they are satisfied , because they laugh now , because everyone worldly speaks well of them .
They are not condemned because they are bad rich but because they are rich . ” [ Emphasis added ] .
In Australia you ’d have to look hard to find a Christian who would speak as powerfully about injustice as the Jesus of those gospels .
But who stands on the street corners every week campaigning on behalf of the anawim ?
Who curses the rich and powerful ?
Who demands liberation for the oppressed ?
Comrades it ’s you , you are the inheritors of that Jesus tradition .
Not the Christian tradition , but never mind , Jesus was n’t a Christian either .
The Jesus movement was a class struggle movement and the writings express it .
A revolutionary Jesus
So , back to Mark : the poor and suffering people who heard that opening line of Mark ’s story knew that they were hearing about a revolutionary .
The whole book explains why Jesus was a revolutionary .
That opening line makes another couple of shattering statements .
Firstly , it appropriates the word “ gospel ” .
The word “ gospel ” literally means good news .
But people of the time did n’t use it in the sense of : “ Hey , here ’s some gospel , you ’ve won the lotto . ”
When the Roman emperor won military victories official orators went out to the towns of the empire , called people together and read to them news reports entitled “ gospel ” .
That was the only use of the term until the Christians revolutionised it .
You should hear the term “ gospel ” in a similar way to that in which people in the early 1970s heard the way in which homosexuals appropriated and used the word “ gay ” , it was a shock to the system .
Except that people who shocked the power of the Roman Empire ran the risk of literally being fed to lions .
And after taking over the use of the word “ gospel ” the sentence identifies Jesus as the Messiah , which confronted the power of the Jewish religious authorities .
And then the sentence names him as the Son of God , which was the title used by the Roman Emperor .
Not all versions of Mark ’s gospel contain that phrase about Jesus being the Son of God .
Maybe some of the congregations stuck it in just as another way of offending the authorities , because confronting the authorities was what they were doing .
Certainly that single sentence establishes that this document was meant to be as radical a rejection of the established order as could be mustered within the mindset of the period .
Every strand of authority is disestablished and all of their claims are appropriated , and the rest of the book makes clear that they are appropriated in the name of the poorest of the poor , the anawim .
The development of classes -- metaphor and inspiration
What are we to make of these stories of angels and walking on water and such ?
It is easy to mock such nonsense , and many atheists do n’t progress past that level of analysis .
The Bible stories , both Old and New Testaments , are a rich repository of the history of human social development .
Marxists who disregard them are the poorer for it .
In fact , such Marxists are disinheriting themselves .
These stories , these revolutionary struggles are part of the heritage of which Marxism is the fruit .
In this regard I think that it ’s a tragedy that the great Marxist anthropological writer Evelyn Reed never succeeded in her life ’s ambition to write an analysis of Old Testament stories along the lines of the concluding chapter of Woman ’s Evolution , where she looks at the Greek play Medea .
Had she done so she would have provided a roadmap for Marxists to read and appreciate the Bible .
It is easy for modern readers to mock and satirise the extraordinary biblical stories such as Jesus walking on water or the fierce prophet Elijah ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot .
Understanding stops dead at the metaphors , unfortunately .
Yet what do we gain from Reed ’s evaluation of Medea ?
Medea moved from a matriarchal clan society to Corinth to be with her husband , the trader / pirate Jason .
Medea represents all women at the cusp of the evolution of society from the egalitarian matriarchal clan to patriarchal class society .
How did women feel about that change ?
Did they go gently into that good night ?
Medea raged !
She did a bit more than express some upset wounded feelings .
Not for her putting up with insulting jibes about PMT !
She attacked patriarchy at the roots : she murdered her own sons so that Jason could n’t pass on the wealth that he had stolen and waved the blood in his face .
And at the end she flies off in a fiery chariot driven by a god .
She was a spitfire hellcat and every metaphor propels the narrative .
Every woman feeling aggrieved under our sexist society should read Medea and listen to Maria Callas singing the role in Verde ’s operatic version of it .
You can feel the heat of the anger through the centuries and you can hear it fill Callas and transport her to heights of artistic grandeur .
Callas herself was terribly mistreated by a capitalist pirate called Aristotle Onassis .
In her performance she is inspired to express all women ’s righteous anger .
The Bible stories are precisely the same .
They tell the story of how humanity felt and acted through all the traumatic developments of the evolution of early class society .
How did people feel and act about it ?
They felt angry and they spoke it and through the Jesus movement they took revolutionary action and we can be inspired by their stories .
Jesus and revolutionary violence
It is unclear from the gospels what Jesus ’ exact teaching was on revolutionary violence .
But listed among his followers is Simon the Zealot .
The Zealots were the Hamas of their day , they specialised in suicide assassinations of Roman officials .
They were the most extreme of the Hebrew revolutionaries .
The other Apostles are just identified as fishermen or whatever , only Simon ’s political affiliation is named .
He is n’t identified as an “ ex - Zealot ” or as a Zealot who has chosen to become a pacifist .
His identification is explicit in order to spell out that the Jesus movement included armed revolutionaries .
So , what became of this revolutionary religious group that survived Jesus ’ assassination ?
Certainly we know that it grew quickly and that many different churches arose because so many different gospels were written .
Interestingly , there are no archaeological relics existing from the first 160 years of Christianity .
That is because the early Christians operated as a Jewish sect within the synagogues .
The earliest relics of Christian communities do n’t feature images of Jesus on the cross .
They feature images of fishing boats and fish .
They also feature depictions of Noah ’s ark .
The story of Noah would appeal to a small , beleaguered community .
But often , where a picture of Noah could be expected there is a depiction of a woman shown in the posture of prophesying .
Later , when pictures of Jesus did appear , he was shown as a soft - faced , clean - shaven young man tending sheep .
The earliest known picture of Jesus on the cross is actually a piece of anti-Christian graffiti scratched onto the wall of a Roman boarding school .
Above words saying “ Anthony prays to his god ” , it shows a young man praying to a crucified figure -- except that the figure has the head of an ass !
Early Christianity ’s primitive communism and its overthrow
But while the early Christians did n’t leave much archaeological evidence they showed up on the historical record .
They scandalised Roman society with their refusal to worship the official gods and for sharing among themselves .
The Greek philosopher Aristides wrote to the Emperor Hadrian , saying :
They love one another .
They never fail to help widows ; they save orphans from those who would hurt them .
If they have something , they give it freely to the man who has nothing ; if they see a stranger , they take him home , and are happy , as though he were a real brother .
They do n’t consider themselves brothers in the usual sense , but brothers through the Spirit , in God .
By the second century the Christians were feeding 20,000 of the poor in Rome .
This plebeian , primitively communistic movement was repeatedly subjected to the fiercest repression and gained respect for withstanding it .
But in the fourth century the Emperor Constantine decided to use the church for his own ends , to unify the Roman empire .
He offered the Christian bishops a deal that they found irresistible .
From being repressed by the Roman police , they could command them .
He would give them a cut of the power of the empire but first they had to calm the squabbles between the various Christian churches .
Constantine got the bishops to attend a conference at Nicene , in one of his villas .
He walled them into the villa until they came out with the basis of Christianity that he approved of .
Included in his list of demands was an authorised list of Christian documents that all churches would recognise .
This list is now called the New Testament .

Money and power was the bishops ’ reward .
Quickly violence came to be a part of how bishops got elected into important sees .
And suddenly images of Jesus dressed in the purple robes of the emperor appeared , reigning triumphant in heaven .
Images of Jesus writhing on the cross appeared to remind the plebs of their lot on earth .
The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead said of all this :
When the Western World accepted Christianity , Caesar conquered ; and the received text of Western theology was edited by his lawyers .
The brief Galilean vision of humility flickered throughout the ages , uncertainly .
The deep idolatry of the fashioning of God in the image of the Egyptian , Persian and Roman imperial rulers was retained .
The church gave unto God the attributes which belonged exclusively to Caesar .
The most important institutional effect of the adoption of Christianity , according to Perry Anderson , was the social promotion of a large number of what he calls “ service Christians ” , who opportunistically adopted the new faith .
Moreover , Anderson says :
[ T ]he establishment of Christianity as the official Church of the Empire was henceforward to add a huge clerical bureaucracy -- where none had previously existed – to the already ominous weight of the secular Roman state .
So , the adoption of Christianity by Rome actually contributed to the crisis of the empire as much as anything else .
Christianity adapts to feudalism
As Roman slavery died its long , drawn - out death and feudalism began its rise , the church positioned itself as the social force that floated slightly above the aristocratic power structure , authorising kings and benefiting from their largesse .
Just as Hinduism in India created an ideological justification for the caste system so Christianity justified the solid chains that tied the peasants to their place in society .
In this structure everyone was allocated a role : peasants at the bottom , aristocrats above ( protecting the peasants and supported by them ) and tradespeople in the towns in their guilds .
The church was the intellectual repository , the advisory service and the moral guardian of it all .
It was very comfortable with the role and hopelessly corrupt .
Of course , the whole construction was predicated not on stability but stasis , change was dangerous .
Once the economy began to expand through trade and the rise of capitalism contradictions arose that eventually exploded everything into air .
Yet it is precisely this static society that the Vatican still aspires to recreate in the world .
The ideology is called “ integralism ” : the state will rule the people and the Church will rule the state .
All people will be in their place .
Marxists like to pride themselves on their long view of history , so does the Vatican .
Integralism sees all of the world ’s problems as starting with the Renaissance and passing through the Enlightenment , the Reformation and the various bourgeois revolutions -- all leading up to satanic communism .
All this degeneration into sin is caused by humanity ’s failure to abide by the Mother Church .
The Catholic hierarchy has accommodated itself to capitalism and sees communism as a greater threat but it really pines for the good old days of feudalism .
Vatican statements attacking the excesses of capitalism should be read in this light .
To put it mildly their criticisms are not progressive .
An example is Sydney Archbishop George Pell ’s speech in November 2004 where he criticised secular democracy and called for “ democratic personalism ” .
Pell said democratic personalism “ … means nothing more than democracy founded on the transcendent dignity of the human person ” .
That ’s great , we ’re all for human dignity .
But in the best of all possible worlds a la George Pell who would control the definition of “ transcendent ” ?
Well , it means bringing into being what he calls “ … a whole new form of democracy . ”
Who would be included in this new form of democracy ?
Pell does n’t say but there ’s a hint of whom he thinks should n’t be included :
[ T ]he small but growing conversion of native Westerners within Western societies to Islam carries the suggestion that Islam may provide in the 21st century the attraction that communism provided in the 20th , both for those who are alienated or embittered on the one hand , and for those who seek order or justice on the other .
George Pell may aspire to live in the middle ages but , in fact , as feudalism segued into high feudalism and the absolutist state , contradictory currents arose within Catholicism that Pell would not have liked .
For instance : in the 1400s the bishops held two conferences in Constance and Basel where they tried to break from the power of the papacy .
The papacy manoeuvred against the bishops through alliances with the absolutist rulers in the evolving secular power structure .
The kings helped the papacy in its battles with the bishops but the papacy paid a price : it lost control over the appointment of bishops in those realms .
However , through the expansion of European colonialism the Church massively expanded its range .
These cosy concordats , as they were called , were the forerunners of the 20th century accommodations with Mussolini and Hitler .
The Vatican saw the arrangements with fascism as just a continuation of its normal operating strategies .
This authoritarian tradition culminated in the Vatican Council of 1869 , which declared the infallibility of the Pope .
Twentieth century Catholicism : forward to the past vs popular trends
The Catholic Church marched into the 20th century , the epoch of imperialist wars and revolutions , with its eyes firmly fixed on the past and aristocratic thugs at its helm who saw themselves as being at war with modernity and especially with its worst expression : communism .
Within France various countervailing trends arose , which led to Catholic socialist groups that joined the Popular Front government in the 1930s , operated in the anti-Nazi Resistance and developed labour federations .
After World War II a worker - priest movement sprang up where priests got jobs in factories .
Pretty quickly these priests radicalised in the face of the conditions in the factories and mines .
They became union leaders and activists and quickly the church hierarchy tried to pull them out of the factories .
These French influences had an effect in Brazil , which had the biggest Catholic population in the world .
As early as 1960 leaders of the Brazilian Catholic Student Movement wrote :
We have to say , without ambiguity or hesitation , that capitalism , historically realised , deserves only the calm condemnation of Christian consciousness .
Is it necessary to justify this ?
It will be enough to recall here some of the alienations of human nature characteristic of the concrete capitalist situation : reduction of human labour to the condition of a commodity ; dictatorship of private property , not subordinated to the demands of the common good ; abuses of economic power ; unbridled competition on one side , and monopolistic practices of all kinds on the other ; central motivation as the pursuit of profit .
The humanity of the worker cannot remain , in Brazilian society , submissive to the tyranny of money and of cruel competition , in short to the mechanism of capitalism .
When Pope John XXIII announced his intention to convoke the Second Vatican Council a mere three months after assuming the papacy in 1958 the church bureaucracy , known as the Curia , was stunned .
John XXIII was elderly and was elected as a transitional figurehead between papacies and was n’t expected to make waves .
But make waves Vatican II did .
For a start John XXIII liked the ideas that the bishops had come up with at those conferences in Constance and Basel in the fifteenth century .
He wanted less authoritarianism , he wanted the Catholic mass to be presented in the vernacular language , not Latin , and he wanted the Church to break out of what he called “ holy isolation ” and engage with the contemporary world .
Vatican II shook the Catholic Church like nothing before or since .
Nuns and priests all over world went out of their cloisters and into the real world to work directly with the poor .
In Latin America the church began an education program on social issues that was designed to stop students being won to Marxism .
It was called the Cursillo de Capacitacion Social .
It was meant to channel youth towards the Christian Democratic Party .
But as one student put it : “ There are two kinds of professors at this university : the Marxists and those who simply do n’t give a damn . ”
The students applied the radical education methods of Paulo Friere in what are called “ base communities ” .
Friere ’s method is to teach people literacy not through obscure textbooks but by assisting people to write about their own lives .
This conscientises people ( makes people aware ) of their social situation and then , through discussion and reflection upon Biblical texts , they develop the courage to begin shifting to being the agents of their own liberation .
So , this heady mixture of French radicalism filtered through Brazil , Vatican II , the example of the Cuban Revolution and the interaction of nuns , priests , students and the impoverished masses exploded into the continent - wide Liberationist Christian trend .
An American priest who was in Guatemala in this period , Blase Bonpane says :
By 1965 thousands of the best educated citizens of Nicaragua , El Salvador and Guatemala were being slaughtered in a vast institutional drive for political unconsciousness .
It was in this atmosphere that the Cursillos de Capacitacion Social were operating in Central America where ( except for Costa Rica ) anything and anybody to the left of the Christian Democratic Party was under attack physically .
By 1966 the Central American students had moved so far as to write :
We cannot Christianise capitalism with paternalistic patches .
We will lose many of our privileges for the greater general betterment .
There will be opposition , and armed resistance will be called for if necessary .
That blunt statement ranks alongside Malcolm X ’s famous saying as the most clear - cut explanation of the role of a revolutionary .
Thousands of these students and thousands of the peasants with whom they worked went into the various armed fronts in Central America and eventually formed the backbone of the FSLN in government , the FMLN , many other guerrilla fronts worker and peasant unions .
In Brazil the Movement of Landless Workers , the metalworkers unions and the Workers Party came out of this ferment .
Marxist responses
In 1971 , Fidel Castro said of these developments :
We have now arrived at a point not simply of coexistence between religion and revolution but for the best possible relationship .
A Christian who understands Christ ’s words in their essence simply cannot be on the side of the exploiters , on the side of those who promote injustice , hunger and misery .
I always admired and deeply appreciated those Little Sisters who went to work with lepers at various institutions because they signified an enlightenment , a capacity for sacrifice for others .
Persons doing this dangerous , selfless work are practicing ideal communist conduct .
In recent times within the very bosom of Christian movements , there have arisen revolutionary currents , progressive currents which are escalating into revolutionary positions and there are a great number of priests and religious who hold a firm position in favour of the process of liberation of Latin America .
It ’s worth mentioning here that while this truly amazing ideological transformation was taking place , which was plain to Fidel ’s eyes , the revolutionary current of which we were a part at the time , the Trotskyists , did n’t notice it at all .
In fact , when you recall that the two great contributions that the Trotskyist movement made to the Nicaraguan Revolution were Fausto Amador and the Simon Bolivar Brigade you start to recognise the need for humility among Marxists .
Michael Lowy , in The War of Gods , which was published in English in 1996 , says :
In fact , something new has happened on the Latin American religious scene during the last few decades , the importance of which is world historical .
A significant sector of the Church – both believers and clergy – in Latin America has changed its position in the field of social struggle , going over with its material and spiritual resources to the side of the poor and their fight for a new society .
Can Marxism help us to explain this unexpected event ?
Lowy ’s book is easily the most perceptive and useful Marxist account of Liberation Theology and when he describes these developments as world historical he knows the gravity of what he is saying .
The answer to his question ( “ Can Marxism help us to explain this unexpected event ? ” ) is in this straightforward statement from Commandante Luis Carrion of the FSLN in 1985 :
I see no obstacle which should prevent Christians , without renouncing their faith , from making their own all the Marxist conceptual tools which are required for a scientific understanding of the social processes and a revolutionary orientation in political practice .
In other words , a Christian can be at once a Christian and a perfectly consistent Marxist ...
In this sense , our experience can teach many lessons .
Many Christians have been and are active in the Sandinista Front and some of them are priests .
And I am not speaking here only of rank - and - file militants : some of them are members of the Sandinista Assembly and hold high political responsibilities …
I think that certain Marxist vanguards have had a tendency to perceive progressive and revolutionary Christian sectors as an opponent force competing for a fraction of the political following of these parties .
I think this a mistake .
Avoiding that mistake is one of the great achievements of the FSLN .
We have linked up with the grass roots structures of the Church , not to pull people out of them , but to integrate them into the Sandinista Front as a stage in its political development , without this meaning in any way that we oppose their participation in Christian institutions .
On the contrary , we leave people in these structures so that their higher commitment will be transformed into political action in this environment .
We never told them that in joining the FSLN they had to face the dilemma of the Christian faith or their activity in the Front .
If we had posed things in that way , we would have remained a tiny group of activists .
At this point I ’d like to make a simple observation : Liberationist Christians have no difficulty in synthesising Marxism with their Christianity but First World Marxists , when confronted with Christian faith , often seem blankly uncomprehending .
Liberationist understanding of capitalism and the `paupertariat ’
So , from the 1960s through to the 1990s Liberationist Christianity was a mass phenomenon across the Latin American continent with offshoots popping up in other places .
One of the places it popped up in was St Vincent ’s Catholic Church in Redfern [ an inner-city suburb of Sydney ] , which was the most advanced grouping of Liberation Theology practitioners in Australia .
From within that community arose the Aboriginal Medical Service , the Aboriginal Legal Service and innumerable campaigns in defence of Indigenous people ’s rights .
Archbishop
Pell has been working very hard to destroy that community in recent times .
The theology was not imposed from outside the reality of the oppressed people but grew from their experiences and reflections .
This theology is vastly removed from the reversed world - consciousness that Marx famously criticised .
Liberationist Christianity directly criticises the “ vale of woe ” that Marx referred to and it refuses to be the “ halo around suffering ” , which Marx said was the role of religion in his Contribution to the Critique of Hegel ’s Philosophy of Law in 1844 .
I want to quote from Blase Bonpane ’s book called Guerrillas of Peace , which is about the Central American revolution .
He starts with quoting the words of Mary the Mother of Jesus , from Luke ’s gospel :
He has shown the power of his arm , he has routed the proud of heart .
He has pulled down princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly .
The hungry he has filled with good things , the rich sent away empty .
Then Blase writes :
Taking the words direct from the Mother of Jesus , we can conclude that God has a bias for the poor and that he does show might in his arm …
So the mighty are being pulled down from their thrones and the lowly exalted .
This is surely the work of God .
The lowly are exalted by becoming the subject of society instead of the object .
The fetishisation of labour , that is , the consideration of people as “ cheap labour ” , labour as a commodity , is surely the sin identified here .
The creative power of God is reflected in workers .
To oppress workers is to oppress the power of God .
We see here in these words of the Mother of Jesus the identification of oppression as the sin and liberation as the virtue .
Applying this to modern economic theory , this relates to the surplus value of labour .
This theory explains how workers manufacture much more wealth than they earn in salary each day .
The difference between the wealth created by an individual worker and what is taken home as salary is precisely what is stolen from the worker , taken away by the owners of the means of production .
The poor people of Latin America , stuck in the grip of the so - called “ informal economy ” are situated somewhere along the edge of the proletariat and the lumpen proletariat .
Modern production techniques , using community networking have tendrils extending right through the slums .
Using outsourcing and Quality Assurance techniques Wal - Mart in Latin America and Coles Myer and Bunnings in South East Asia and China suck the life directly out these people .
Salvadoran Liberationists coined the term “ paupertariat ” to describe their situation .
In Brazil , the majority of the bishops were won to supporting this liberationist movement and in Central America it linked directly to the revolution ; in other countries things were not so clear - cut .
And it was n’t just a Catholic movement ; it was ecumenical .
This was based on the view that orthodoxy – that is : believing the right thing – is less important than orthopraxis – doing the right thing .
For liberationists orthodoxy can only follow orthopraxis .
You can immediately see the connection with Marx ’s 11th Thesis on Feuerbach : “ The philosophers have only interpreted the world , in various ways ; the point , however , is to change it . ”
So , while the Trotskyists missed the boat and the Stalinised official communist parties were too mired in their class collaborationist , developmentalist line to link up with the Liberationist Christian phenomenon , who was paying attention ?
Reagan and Pope : united front from Hell
Well , US President Ronald Reagan was paying attention .
In 1980 the gang that organised Reagan for the presidency met in Santa Fe for a conference .
Their conference statement said in part :
US foreign policy should begin to confront Liberation Theology ( and not just react to it after the fact ) …
In Latin America , the role of the Church is vital to the concept of political freedom .
Unfortunately Marxist - Leninist forces have used the Church as a political weapon against private ownership and the capitalism system of production , infiltrating the religious community with ideas that are more communist than Christian .
Reagan , as president , quickly moved to form a united front with Pope John Paul II against Liberation Theology .
The Pope fought the theology while Reagan murdered the Liberationists .
Cardinal Ratzinger , the Prefect of the Holy Office for the Doctrine of the Faith , provided the intellectual weapons .
While admitting that Liberation Theology possesses what he called “ almost flawless logic ” it did n’t make it any less of a threat .
“ Indeed , ” he said , “ an error is all the more dangerous , the greater the grain of truth it contains . ”
However , Ratzinger said : “ The defence of orthodoxy [ is ] really the defence of the poor , saving them pain and illusions which contain no realistic prospect even of material gain . ”
Do you hear something faintly Napoleonic in that statement ?
Ratzinger tried to discipline the Brazilian bishops unsuccessfully and the Peruvians as well .
He compelled the theologian Leonardo Boff to remain silent for a year but could n’t turn back the tide .
So , the papacy simply started replacing progressive bishops with reactionaries as the opportunity arose .
They have stacked out the Brazilian church with Opus Dei bishops and did the same in El Salvador and other places .
Opus Dei is an ultra- right wing Catholic secret society that practices such weirdnesses as self - flagellation .
But the Pope found them a useful ally in his task of turning back the clock on Vatican II .
The Americans , through various front groups , started flooding Central and Latin America with fundamentalist , happy - clappy church missionaries at the same time as waging the contra war against Nicaragua and the death - squad war in El Salvador .
In Guatemala , in particular , where the insane , born - again Christian General Rios Montt was president , the army treated all Catholic peasants as enemies .
For instance : in the region of El Quiche the army found a Bible hidden under the dirt floor of a hut in a village .
That was taken as proof that the family contained a liberationist people ’s catechist .
In response they burned children alive ; they bayoneted pregnant women and murdered whole families .
All in all they destroyed at least 440 villages in similar fashion .
As a way of surviving , the peasants learned very quickly to convert to the new American churches , which recruited with their fists full of dollars .
But how can the Vatican tolerate this violent Protestant intrusion into its domain ?
Essentially , through extreme cynicism .
The Vatican , mired in it ’s ideology of integralism , believes that , when the danger of Liberation Theology and the popular church have passed , the masses will tire of their new enthusiasms and return to the Mother Church .
Reactionary Christian politics in Australia : consumerism at prayer
And speaking of cynicism we should mention the rise of Family First and other reactionary trends in Australia .
In Sydney , the Liberal Party has a flourishing relationship with a massive fundamentalist church called Hillsong .
Since becoming prime minister , John Howard has made it a priority to channel government welfare money through religious charities like the Salvation Army and Mission Australia .
Those groups have in turn adapted to mainstream neoliberal economics .
The Salvos , Mission Australia , Anglicare and the other big charities still publish great research on poverty in Australia but when you get up close to them you discover that their solutions are all about boot - strap capitalism .
The homeless can build themselves up by selling The Big Issue on the streets ; the impoverished can use micro-loans to establish their own businesses .
It ’s the Amway model of petty bourgeois self - advancement .
Family First , a product of the Assemblies of God , seemed to pop up like a mushroom in the 2004 elections .
But , we should remember , not just through the patronage of the Liberals but also through cutting a preference deal with the ALP .
It is n’t just the Liberals who keep their eyes on US political trends .
What these fundamentalists will amount to in Australia over time we ca n’t say .
There is a deep strain of hostility towards “ God botherers ” in Australian culture .
But these God botherers have arisen on the back of the mass consumerist credit card debt that is fuelling the economy .
There is a widespread need for people to literally close their eyes and pray because there is a huge wave of immiserisation hanging over them and they know it .
A simple spike in interest rates will shatter many people ’s lives .
So , what do the fundamentalists give people ?
They teach people how to dress nicely , live the Amway lifestyle and consume without guilt .
They also give profound emotional experiences .
The references to Jesus entering you heart indicate an intense distrust of feelings and the emotional life .
Obviously , deep insecurities and fears need to get stabilised by the simple faith .
A short history of fundamentalism
Fundamentalism is a very recent development in Christianity .
The term itself was first coined in a series of 12 cheap , paperback books of Bible commentary that were published in the US between 1910 and 1915 , which were entitled The Fundamentals .
The five fundamentals they propounded are :
what is called “ Bible inerrancy ” ( that is : nothing written in the Bible is wrong ) ;
the divinity of Jesus ;
the Virgin Birth ;
that Jesus died to redeem humanity ; and ,
the Second Coming , meaning the physical return of Jesus to initiate a one thousand year rule on Earth .
Fundamentalists are associated with creationism and they are certain that only they are the true Christians , all others are heretics .
In the US there are many different fundamentalist groups , not all of which have been drawn into the Christian rightist political current .
Within the Christian rightist political constituency , however there is an interesting demographic uniformity :
97 % are white ,
72 % are in the 35 - to 65 - year - old age bracket ,
70 % have university education or better ,
53 % are either professionals or business managers and
18 % are small business owners .
These are not the ignorant southern Baptist crackers that Malcolm X used to joke about .
They are sophisticated people whose wealth relies on the so - called “ new economy ” of IT , outsourcing and consultancy .
They know how to build political clout .
Fifty per cent earn between $ 50,000 and $ 150,000 and 15 % earn over $ 150,000 .
They are not the haute bourgeoisie , the big bourgeoisie ; the ruling class believes in no God but profit .
The political fundamentalists are the upper levels of those with petty bourgeois consciousness .
They have bought the American dream of hard work and achievement .
Where others might merely “ consume , be silent and die ” , that great summation of bourgeois culture , they consume , pray and die .
It will be interesting to see how these aspects of US culture succeed in getting welded onto Australian society .
The fundamentalists and their Christian rightist offshoots are growing well in the artificial economic stability of John Howard with its contrived low - interest rates and subsidised housing boom .
But will these churches survive an economic shock ?
Will they survive an upsurge of trade union militancy that teaches people where power really lies ?
Was it the fundamentalists who forced James Hardie to cough up the compensation money for asbestos victims or the unions ?
When push comes to shove where will people look for their interests to be protected ?
Liberationist Christianity today
So where do things stand today with Liberationist Christianity ?
With the defeat of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua and the ending of the Salvadoran insurgency , coupled with the combination of Vatican repression and US intervention , the liberationist trend has been put onto the back foot in some areas .
But during the 1990s there were two clear examples of liberationist upsurge in Haiti and Chiapas .
In 1990 a radical priest Jean - Bertrand Aristide was swept to power in an unprecedented wave of popular radicalisation .
He won 67 % of the vote while the US - backed candidate got 14 % .
President George Bush senior immediately organised a military coup and Aristide was overthrown in 1991 and went into exile .
The military and Tonton Macoutes death squads targeted Liberationist activists for torture and assassination .
After three years the US was forced to allow Aristide to return but the Clinton administration used the soft - cop approach and influenced the Haitians to implement IMF policies , which undermined the masses ’ radicalism .
Of course , President George Bush Jr. is n’t interested in soft - cop methods .
He simply sent in the marines , kidnapped Aristide and deposited him in central Africa .
But the issue in Haiti is n’t yet settled .
If ever there was a place where people have nothing to lose but their chains , it is Haiti .
The masses have not been cowed and the great tradition of Toussaint L’Ouverture may yet come back to haunt the USA .
In Chiapas , the bishop , Samuel Ruiz , is a liberationist who worked patiently from 1975 to create a network of 7800 indigenous catechists and 2600 base communities .
How many Marxist movements could boast of a cadre force like that ?
He supported the indigenous people in their conflicts with the rich cattle ranchers and he also gave shelter to many Guatemalan refugees fleeing the Rios Montt holocaust .
This all surfaced in the Zapatista rebellion of January 1994 .
Michael Lowy says of this :
From the available data , it appears obvious that neither Monsignor Ruiz nor his Jesuit and religious agents were ‘ promoters ’ of the uprising .
As in El Salvador , consciousness - raising and the impulsion for self - organisation created a new political - religious culture among a significant part of the indigenous population .
In a second stage , revolutionary cadres , probably of Marxist background , built on this new social and political consciousness and helped to organise several thousand Indians , with the support of their communities , into an armed force .
The ideology of the EZLN is not religious and draws its main symbolic references from Mayan culture .
It is true , however , that the patient work in education and empowerment of the indigenous communities by Monsignor Ruiz and his catechists created a favourable environment for the rise of the Zapatista movement .
What future for Liberationist Christianity ?
But what of the future ?
It is impossible to predict but there are some strange and disturbing trends emerging in the new world that was formed in 2004 .
You may not have noticed but something epoch - making happened during 2004 .
According to the United Nations , at some point in 2004 the balance shifted within the majority of the world ’s population .
Now the majority live in cities for the first time in human history and in the Third World the majority of those living in cities live in slums .
The United Nations report says :
[ I ] nstead of being a focus of growth and prosperity , the cities have become a dumping ground for a surplus population working in unskilled , unprotected and low - wage informal service industries and trades .
Mike Davis , writing in the March 2004 New Left Review says that this urbanisation “ … has been radically decoupled from industrialisation , even from development per se . ”
We now live in what Davis calls The Planet of Slums .
Liberationist Christianity might call it Anawim World .
What role does Marxism have in Anawim World ?
Well , according to Mike Davis : “ … for the moment at least , Marx has yielded the historical stage to Mohammed and the Holy Ghost . ”
In the global mega-slum , Islam , Pentecostal Christianity and in India the cult of Shiva , occupy the social space once occupied by socialism in the early 20th century industrial slums of Europe and America .
As an Islamist leader explained to Le Monde Diplomatique : “ … confronted with the neglect of the state , and faced with the brutality of daily life , people discover , thanks to us , solidarity , self - help , fraternity .
They understand that Islam is humanism . ”
In Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa Pentecostalist Christianity is the counterpart of Islam .
Nobody can accurately count the number of Pentecostalists in the world .
It ’s somewhere around 533 million people .
At least 10 % of Latin America is Pentecostal protestant and the Catholic Church is hitting back with its own version of speaking in tongues .
While it is not true that Protestant Pentecostalism is exported to the Third World as a part of a dark US State Department conspiracy it certainly converges with US foreign policy .
As William Murray put it : “ You can make a strong case for saying the American way is synonymous with Christianity . ”
Murray is an evangelical fundamentalist who raised money to fund the Contra death squads that ravaged Nicaragua and the helicopters that Rios Montt used in his Guatemalan holocaust .
The basic creed of Pentecostalism is that the world is corrupt and unreformable .
Where orthodox Catholicism teaches passivity through worship of the saints , the Pentecostals transfer all that to the all - powerful Jesus .
The Pentecostalist sects organise self - help networks for poor women in the slums , offer faith healing as paramedicine , encourage recovery from alcoholism and addiction and try to keep children from descending down into the abyss of life as street waifs .
As with the Catholics who worked in base communities in the ‘ 60s there has been a certain level of radicalisation among some Pentecostalists , especially in Brazil , but not to the same extent as with the upsurge of Liberationist Christianity .
Despite all these developments , Michael Lowy states that : “ … as a cultural movement and as a body of committed thinkers , Liberation Theology is alive and well . ”
None of the major thinkers have recanted , he says , though some have mellowed their language .
He emphasises the terrible blow that the electoral defeat of the Sandinistas was , given the inspirational role that Nicaragua played for progressive Christians .
But what of Latin America today , where Hugo Chavez is reawakening the giant ?
Liberation Theology was an outgrowth of a revolution within the Catholic Church and the example of the Cuban Revolution .
A new model of revolution , the Bolivarian model could spark a new growth in Liberation Theology .
The Bolivarian Circles are essentially base communities where the Venezuelan constitution is the basic reading .
As for the Catholic Church , Pope John Paul is engaged in an orgy of mystification in order to undo Vatican II .
He has canonised more saints than any previous Pope .
He wants every nation to have its own saint in order to rebuild the old Catholic faith of rosary beads and incense .
He has also stacked out the College of Cardinals with right - wing appointees .
He wants to make sure that whoever succeeds him wo n’t deviate from his obscurantist path .
Can Marxism learn ?
So , where does that leave Marxists ?
Well , for a start we should learn from the lessons of the past and learn to read the signs of the times , to borrow a phrase from Vatican II .
Never let us be blind to developments within the masses as we were to the rise of Liberation Theology .
My friend who gives me a lift believes that by accepting Jesus into your heart the truth is magically illuminated .
Never let it be said that we think that by holding Marx in our hearts that reality will be magically illuminated .
Let me quote to you again from Blase Bonpane , the American now ex-priest who toiled alongside the Guatemalan revolutionaries :
Personally , my understanding of liberation has a biblical orientation …
I do not believe that liberation is understood through the New Testament exclusively …
Some have learned liberation through atheistic humanism and as such have formed the basis for an international vanguard of liberation .
Because of my background as a priest and Christian missionary , I think that for some the New Testament will be the road to personal and collective liberation .
It is not a matter of getting one ’s head on straight first and then getting into the struggle .
It is a matter of getting into the struggle and thereby getting one ’s head finally straightened out .
Liberation Theology assimilated Marxism into itself without difficulty .
It is not impossible for Marxists to understand Liberation Theology in a similar manner .

Ratzinger : the Rottweiler as Pope
April 27 , 2005
By Barry Healy
The election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI spells the end of the hope that the Catholic Church may become more liberal .
Catholic progressives look back longingly on the era initiated by the 1965 Vatican II Council , when the church finally opened itself to the world ; Ratzinger rejects Vatican II as “ scandalous optimism ” , propagating “ misleading ” , “ disastrous ” and “ catastrophic ” ideas .
Ratzinger is on record as believing that Vatican II was a mistake because the Church entered into a dialogue with society rather than holding itself apart from “ a progressive process of decadence ” .
In interviews , he has fumed about the laity that no longer allowed priests to run their lives , women ignoring their most important functions as virgins and mothers and the widespread failure to believe in the devil .
It was not always like this ; there was a time when Ratzinger embraced a more sensitive Christianity .
But like some of the US neo -conservatives he went through a mid-life conversion from progressive to arch - conservative .
The son of a Bavarian police officer , Ratzinger grew up under the Nazis and as a teenager was conscripted into the army of the Third Reich .
He later said that his Catholicism protected him against the influence of fascism .
After the war he entered a seminary so as to contribute to the “ Christian rebirth ” of Germany .
A brilliant intellectual , he quickly rose through the ranks to become theological advisor to Cologne ’s Cardinal Frings at the age of 35 .
Frings famously received a standing ovation at Vatican II by declaring that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ( the modern name for the Inquisition ) in its methods and behaviour “ do not conform to the modern era and are a source of scandal in the world ” .
Ratzinger , as Pope John Paul II ’s enforcer , reinvigorated the Congregation and used it to destroy not only the individual careers of theologians but also entire churches , as occurred in Holland .
It is part of the irony of Ratzinger that one of the theologians he oppressed , the Brazilian liberationist Leonardo Boff , was one of his students during Ratzinger ’s liberal period .
In the 1960s , Ratzinger wrote glowingly of “ the prophetic protest against the self - righteousness of the institution , a self - righteousness which substitutes ritual for morality and the ceremonial for conversion … .
God , throughout history , has not been on the side of the institution but on that of the suffering and persecuted . ”
His political turnaround came when rebellious students threw German universities into turmoil during the 1960s youth radicalisation .
He has said that it was the “ psycho - terror ” inflicted on him by the students at the University of Tubingen that altered his opinion of Marxism ( students had boycotted his classes and mocked his ideas ) .
A crucial turning point in Ratzinger ’s career occurred in 1977 , when he met Poland ’s Karol Wojtyla , the future John Paul II .
They shared common feelings about Marxism and the need to restore order to the church after the “ excesses ” of Vatican II .
Upon becoming pope , John Paul appointed Ratzinger prefect of the Congregation where he won the nickname “ the Pope ’s Rottweiler ” .
Although it no longer uses torture , the Congregation is feared within Catholicism .
Over the centuries it has been tainted with excesses and scandal .
As prefect , Ratzinger showed no mercy while exhibiting two unusual characteristics .
One was his enormous intellectual capacity .
The other was his willingness to give background briefings to the press .
A significant feature of Ratzinger ’s world outlook , as revealed in these interviews , is his preoccupation with European culture , to the exclusion of all others .
Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Ratzinger played a soft cop / hard cop game within the Church .
John Paul built his media image while using Ratzinger to deflect criticism of himself .
As an Italian theologian commented to a journalist of the US National Catholic Reporter : “ If Ratzinger did n’t exist , the pope would find someone just like him . ”
A legacy of John Paul II ’s , which Benedict is expected to build upon , has been the growing power of bizarre semi-secret organisations like Opus Dei and the Neocatechumenal Way within the Church .
Catholic laity can look forward to more intrusions from these weird cults into parish life .
Liberal Catholics , in their millions , pine for the days of hope opened by Vatican II .
But they need to remember that it was the mass radicalisation sparked by the anti-Vietnam War movement that enabled them to drive back the stodgy cardinals .
If they want to repel this new reactionary wave , progressive Catholics should throw their energies into building another such radicalisation .

Benedict : from Rottweiler to dog whistler
By Barry Healy
Pope Benedict XVI , when known as Cardinal Ratzinger , was notorious as “ the Pope ’s Rottweiler ” , the theological enforcer who silenced progressives .
On September 12 , 2006 , he began a new role -- “ dog whistler ” for Islamophobia .
Dog whistle politics uses coded inflammatory references embedded in careful language for deniability .
The labyrinthine nature of Vatican statements lends itself perfectly to such layers of meaning .
Benedict gave a presentation on “ faith and reason ” at Germany ’s University of Regensburg , drawing on a 1391 dialogue between the obscure Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Paleologus and a Persian Muslim .
Manuel considered that Mohammed brought “ only evil ” to the world and , by extension , Islam is “ inhuman ” .
Benedict said that Islam is not “ bound up with ... rationality ” , while Christianity is .
Within days , Middle Eastern Christian churches began going up in flames , and demonstrations erupted across the Muslim world .
Criticism came not only from groups hostile to the West , but also from secular Muslim officials who are normally friendly with Western governments and the Vatican .
On September 17 , Benedict clarified his statement .
Avoiding an outright apology , he said the Byzantine quote did n’t express his own opinions and that he was “ deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address ... which were considered offensive to the sensibility of Muslims ” .
Three days later , Benedict said he had wanted to spark a “ self - critical dialogue both among religions and between modern reason and Christian faith ” .
George Bush , Tony Blair and John Howard are working hard to fan Islamophobia to justify their “ war on terror ” .
They are also trying to drive a wedge into the Muslim community between so - called “ mainstream ” and “ reactionary ” Islam .
Benedict , who is considered one of the great intellectuals of the Catholic Church , said he accidentally blundered into quoting a Christian emperor ticking off an Iranian about Islam ’s deficiencies .
In fact , Benedict ’s hostility to Islam goes back a long way .
In 1997 , in an interview in the Jesuit - published book Salt of the Earth , he said that Islam is organised in a way “ that is opposed to our modern ideas about society ” .
“ One has to have a clear understanding that it is not simply a denomination that can be included in the free realm of a pluralistic society ” , he said .
In September 2005 , at an annual meeting with former students , Benedict told them that Islam can adapt to democracy only if the Koran is radically reinterpreted .
The Vatican denied the report , which a student had leaked to the media , and the informant withdrew his claims .
After that , Australia ’s Cardinal George Pell , well known for his Vatican loyalty , began his attack on Islam , putting the line from which Benedict had officially distanced himself .
In February , Pell launched a ferocious broadside against Islam .
The Koran is riddled with “ invocations to violence ” , he said , in a speech to US Catholic business people .
Pell said he saw the light about the inner workings of Islam after the 9/11 terror attacks .
“ Considered strictly on its own terms , Islam is not a tolerant religion and its capacity for far - reaching renovation is severely limited ” , he claimed .
After Benedict ’s September 17 clarification ,
Pell again became the stalking horse , saying on September 18 that the violent reaction to the Pope ’s words proved the validity of the insult that the Pope said he did n’t intend !
This soft cop , hard cop behaviour has sordid roots within the Catholic Church .
Pope John Paul II , Benedict ’s mentor , cooperated with the Reagan administration ’s slaughter of Liberation Theology Catholics in central America .
John Paul II slammed the theologians , while Reagan armed the death squads trying to bring down the Sandinista Nicaraguan government in the 1980s .
Benedict XVI is now providing shifty theological cover for Bush ’s imperial crusade in the Middle East .
