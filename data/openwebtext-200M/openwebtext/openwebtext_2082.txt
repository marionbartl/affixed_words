South African men might enjoy buying extra large condoms
" A large number of South African men are bigger and complain about condoms being uncomfortable and too small , " said Durex manager Stuart Roberts .
Aids activists say the new condom could encourage men to practise safe sex in South Africa , where some 6 m are HIV positive - more than any other country .
Some South Africans are reluctant to use condoms , says activist Thandi Xolo .
Mr Xolo , from the National Association of People Living With HIV / Aids ( Napwa ) , said both men and women fear being labelled as promiscuous if they are seen with condoms .
" This could help condoms become cool , " he said .
" Men will buy them to boost their ego . "
Even more importantly , it will remove the excuse made by some men for not using condoms - that they are too small .
However , Mr Xolo said he was not sure how many of the millions of condoms sold each year in South Africa were being properly used .

My .
Maschke , today on the world - wide web you deliberately and with malice of forethought published a primer  detailing a method you believe can be employed to successfully defeat the Defense Departments Preliminary Credibility Assessment Screening Device ( PCASS ) .
You published this information knowing full well ( and even proud of the fact ) that Al Qaeda and others out to murder American soldiers and innocent civilians access your public service website on a regular basis in order to glean whatever information they can on American intelligence sources and methods .
You have in the past defended such actions ( specifically in your attacks on polygraph ) by making a number of statements including the following :
1. Truthful applicants for positions in U.S. government and law enforcement have been wrongfully  branded as liars and therefore did not get jobs they otherwise deserved . 
2. Citizens under suspicion of engaging in criminal acts have been subjected to this unfairly intrusive pseudo - science 
3 . Poor , misunderstood sex offenders have had their privacy  violated .
4 . The government is making a mistake by putting their trust in polygraph testing  ( quotes are yours , not mine . )
I add that you have said many times on this site , that the purpose of your efforts is to help truthful citizens ensure that they pass the polygraph test and that if a few bad people happen upon your site and use your methods to attempt to defeat the polygraph . well , no big deal .
Well allow me to explain what you succeeded in actually doing here today .
You see , if you had read the MSNBC article and associated OFFICAL DoD documents carefully , you would have seen that the PCASS device is ONLY authorized for use on NON - U.S. CITIZENS and is being specifically fielded to a combat zone in a time of WAR to ASSIST in ferreting out terrorists , insurgents , and other murderers of U.S. troops and innocent civilians .
The government , while admitting the device is not perfect , believes ( rightly or wrongly ) that it is at least better then gut feeling , which is ALL our soldiers have now when dealing in these very dangerous matters .
So what did the brave , ex-patriot George Maschke do ?
He immediately published on the internet a list on instructions ( which he believes ) can be used to defeat this technology .
But wait .
I find myself confused .
You see , George Maschke did not provide this information to some young FBI applicant .
You see , the FBI does not test its applicants with PCASS .
This information is nt being provided to some poor misunderstood sex offender in Cleveland , Ohio .
He too will never be tested with PCASS .
My .
Maschke , please explain to me how providing this information assists truthful American citizens ensure that they pass the PCASS test ?
Americans will never be tested with this device .
Oh , I am sure you could argue that maybe one day they will be , but that is NOT the purpose at this juncture .
Please dont try to say that you just provided this information to terrorists because maybe one day , an American might  be tested .
That would be weak , even for you .
So why did you provide this information ?
You did not assist a single innocent victim by what you have done today .
So in the end , who were you attempting to help  by compromising the safety of our soldiers in this way ?
Oh , I am sure you will say that you were simply exposing the weaknesses of another pseudo - science .
Hmmm , you exposed this pseudo - science by publishing a way to defeat it ( you believe ) .
Hmm .
Isnt that sort of like publishing a way to easily shoot down an American military helicopter , because you dont agree with the use of military helicopters ?
What you actually did Mr. Maschke ( quite stupidly ) was provide aid and comfort to the enemy during a time of war . 
That , Mr. Maschke is a rock solid definition of  TREASON  .
You see , based on what you did today , you can no longer rationalize the outrageous behavior you have exhibited for YEARS on this website .
You have finally allowed the bitterness of your true colors to bleed through .
The truth is , you dont care about anything other than your ongoing narcissistic hissy fit against the system that dared deny you what you continue to believe was your right to federal employment .
In doing so you openly , intentionally , and with GREAT MALICE provided information you in fact HOPE will be used to circumvent American Intelligence sources and methods .
My.
Maschke , there is no other purpose for this technology .
You KNEW that .
Finally , Mr. Maschke , I leave you with a simple question .
If you had been one of those Iranian government officials you so like to hang out and drink tea with , and lets say you disagreed with an intelligence method they employed .
So you published a procedure on the internet you were sure could defeat that method , what EXACTLY would your fellow Iranians do to you ??????
Hmmm ????
So , in the end Mr. Maschke , you are officially , and undoubtedly a traitor , guilty of high treason against your countrymen and potentially responsible for the deaths of innocent people .

Video games such as Second Life give users the freedom to create characters in the digital domain that look and seem more human than ever before but while they can have your hair or your hazel eyes , it 's still just a pretty face .
A group of researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is working to change that .
They are engineering characters with the capacity to have beliefs and to reason about the beliefs of others .
The characters will be able to predict and manipulate the behavior of even human players , with whom they interact in the real world , according to the team .
At a recent conference on artificial intelligence , the researchers unveiled the “ embodiment ” of their success to date : “ Eddie , ” a 4 - year - old child in Second Life who can reason about his own beliefs to draw conclusions in a manner that matches human children his age .
“ Current avatars in massively multiplayer online worlds — such as Second Life — are directly tethered to a user ’s keystrokes and only give the illusion of mentality , ” said Selmer Bringsjord , head of Rensselaer ’s Cognitive Science Department and leader of the research project .
“ Truly convincing autonomous synthetic characters must possess memories ; believe things , want things , remember things . ”
Such characters can only be engineered by coupling logic - based artificial intelligence and computational cognitive modeling techniques with the processing power of a supercomputer , according to Bringsjord .
The principles and techniques that humans deploy in order to understand , predict , and manipulate the behavior of other humans is collectively referred to as a “ theory of mind . ”
Bringsjord ’s research group is now starting to engineer part of that theory , which would allow artificial agents to understand , predict , and manipulate the behavior of other agents , in order to be genuine stand - ins for human beings or autonomous intellects in their own right .
The logico - mathematical theory will include rigorous , declarative definitions of all of the concepts central to a theory of the mind , including lying , betrayal , and even evil , according to Bringsjord .
To test “ Eddie ’s ” reasoning powers , the group created a demo in Second Life that subjected their theory to a false - belief test .
In a typical real - life version of this test , a child witnesses a series of events in which Person A places an object ( such as a teddy bear ) in a certain location ( such as a cabinet ) .
Person
A then leaves the room , and during his absence Person B moves the object to a new location ( such as the refrigerator ) .
The child is then asked to predict where Person A will look for the object when he gets back .
The right answer , of course , is the cabinet , but children age 4 and under will generally say the refrigerator because they have n’t yet formed a theory of the mind of others .
The researchers recreated the same situation in Second Life , using an automated theorem prover coupled with procedures for converting conversational English in Second Life into formal logic , the native language of the prover .
When the code is executed , the software simulates keystrokes in Second Life .
This enables control of “ Eddie , ” who demonstrates an incorrect prediction of where Person A will look for the teddy bear — a response consistent with that of a 4 - year old child .
But , in an instant , Eddie ’s mind can be improved , and if the test is run again , he makes the correct prediction .
“ Our aim is not to construct a computational theory that explains and predicts actual human behavior , but rather to build artificial agents made more interesting and useful by their ability to ascribe mental states to other agents , reason about such states , and have — as avatars — states that are correlates to those experienced by humans , ” Bringsjord said .
“ Applications include entertainment and gaming , but also education and homeland defense . ”
This research is supported by IBM and other outside sponsors , and the team hopes to engineer a version of the Star Trek holodeck — a virtual reality system used onboard the starships that allowed users to interact with the projected holograms of other individuals .
Such a system could allow cognitively robust synthetic characters to interact directly with human beings , according to Bringsjord .
The proposed research would require the use of two of Rensselaer ’s state - of - the - art research facilities — the Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations ( CCNI ) and the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center ( EMPAC ) .
The most powerful university - based supercomputing system in the world , the CCNI is made up of massively parallel Blue Gene supercomputers , POWER - based Linux clusters , and AMD Opteron processor - based clusters , providing more than 100 teraflops of computing power .
EMPAC , opening in October 2008 , features unparalleled capabilities in visualization , audification , immersive environments , sensor applications , communication technology , and physical modeling .
Bringsjord is leading this project , with participation from Rensselaer doctoral students Andrew Shilliday , Joshua Taylor , and Micah Clark , as well as undergraduate researchers Ed Charpentier and Alexander Bringsjord .
The team ’s initial research was recently presented at the Artificial General Intelligence conference held at the University of Memphis ( http://www.agi-08.org).

In every case , the last thing staff reportedly remember is the thief leaning over and saying : " Look into my eyes " , before finding the till empty .
In the latest incident captured on CCTV , he targeted a bank at Ancona in northern Italy , then calmly walked out .
A female bank clerk reportedly handed over nearly 800 euros ( £ 630 ) .
The cashier who was shown the video footage has no memory of the incident , according to Italian media , and only realised what had happened when she saw the money missing .
CCTV from the bank showed her apparently being hypnotised by the man , according to the reports .
Italian police believe the suspect could be of Indian or North African extraction .

As Europe wrestles with its relatively new status as an immigrant continent , an unlikely leader is emerging : Ireland .
Historically known for its high emigration rates , the island nation has exploded with newcomers from 150 different countries in the past decade – and taken some innovative steps to help its new residents settle in .
In the past ten years , Ireland has experienced a greater rise in the percentage of immigrants than Britain experienced over the past half century .
In 1999 , fewer than 6,000 work permits were granted to non-Irish migrant workers ; last year , 48,000 were handed out .
According to the 2006 census , which has been gradually released over the summer , 420,000 foreign nationals , or about 10 percent of the population , now live here .
In some primary schools in Dublin , some 50 percent of the children are from nonnational backgrounds .
In some districts , the number of immigrants has risen by 120 percent since 2002 .
A combination of low and highly skilled workers , the newcomers have fueled the Celtic Tiger economic boom – as well as social upheaval .
But while Ireland has struggled with racism and other tensions , it 's experienced nothing like the Paris riots of 2005 or the homegrown - terrorist attacks that rocked London in 2006 and Madrid in 2004 .
Some newcomers credit the proactive stance of the government , which has allowed noncitizens to participate in local politics and join the police force .
" By allowing immigrants to participate in society , Ireland has accepted the first generation of immigrants , " says Rotimi Adebari , a Nigerian who in June became Ireland 's first immigrant mayor .
" I think my election is a model that can be showcased throughout the world .
What Ireland has done is very unique . "
Bryan Fanning , editor of Immigration and Social Change in the Republic of Ireland , also applauds the efforts of Ireland , which allows nonnationals to vote in local elections .
" That is unusual and a very positive initiative , " says Dr. Fanning .
" It is unhealthy to have large proportion of your population outside citizenship .
Two problems arise .
First of all , they are not stakeholders in a positive way in society , and second , if they are voiceless , then they are powerless .
It would be easy for pressures of marginalization to build up . "
Mr. Adebari , who sought asylum after fleeing Nigeria with his wife and two children seven years ago , agrees .
" Nonnational workers pay taxes , so the fact that they can have a say on how those taxes are spent locally – on roads , schools , or services – makes them feel more integrated with their community . "
But many immigrants do n't feel welcome , let alone integrated .
A 2006 report from the Irish - based Economic and Social Research Institute found that 35 percent of immigrants were insulted , threatened , or harassed in public because of their ethnic or national origin , a figure that climbed to 53 percent for black Africans .
It found , however , that the incidence of racism in Ireland was lower than other European countries .
In recent general elections , there were three candidates representing the Immigration Control Platform , but they received just 1,329 votes .
There are no far - right political parties in Ireland , like the British National Party or Jean - Marie Le Pen 's National Front in France .
Attempts to politicize the issue have been largely unsupported .
One reason for this is historical .
Many Irish emigrants were themselves the victims of racism – many British boardinghouses had signs that read " No blacks , no Irish , no dogs " – and these experiences have helped temper local attitudes to the new arrivals .
But also , the most common nationality of immigrants between 1995 and 2000 was n't Polish or Chinese or Nigerian .
It was Irish , returning migrants who are reversing the flow of emigration ( in the US , nearly 35 million people claim Irish ancestry ) .
Still , the Irish government has been proactive .
" One of the recommendations from the World Conference on Racism , held in South African in 2001 , was for governments to design national action plans , " says Kensika Monshengwo , training and resource officer with the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism .
" The Irish government was quick to put in place a National Action Plan Against Racism that is used by the police , education institutions , and service organizations . "
Ireland 's Employment Equality
Act outlaws discrimination on nine specific grounds .
" You do n't find that in many other countries .
Even the European Union directive only has six grounds , " say Mr. Monshengwo .
As part of its response to the National Action Plan Against Racism , the Irish police force , An Garda Síochána , changed its entry requirements to allow nonnationals to apply for positions .
Speaking recently , Brian Lenihan said that the Garda " must be broadly representative of the community it serves , and the changes in Irish society are starting to be reflected in the intake of Garda recruits . "
At present , it has trainees from China , Poland , Canada , Romania , and Denmark .
" I do n't know of any other country where nonnationals can be a member of the police force , " says Monshengwo .
" It is a major step that is mindful of the future , when the force will be policing a diverse community . "
But problems have arisen .
In July , a member of the Sikh community completed his exams and training for the Garda Reserve , but was told he could not wear a turban on duty .
Wearing a turban is obligatory for Sikh men , and police forces in the US , Canada , Malaysia , and Britain allow it .
" On one hand they are being pioneers in opening the door for non-nationals , " says Harpeet Singh of the Irish Sikh Council , " and on the other hand they refuse to follow the example of other police forces in including Sikhs . "
This present impasse mirrors a broader debate .
Does Ireland follow the multicultural model of countries like Britain , where common public values do n't necessarily trump individual cultural practices , or the assimilation model of France , say , where the dominant national culture prevails ?
Ireland recently appointed a minister of state for integration policy , but a clear position has yet to emerge .
" [ M]any NGOs ... are concerned about the separation between developing an integration policy and our immigration policy , " says Denise Charlton , chief executive of the Immigrant Council of Ireland .
" We must ensure that our immigration policy does not create barriers to integration .
The forthcoming Immigration , Residence , and Protection Bill should clearly define migrants ' rights to family life , permanent residence , protection against discrimination , access to services and ... information . "
The bill will come before the Irish parliament convenes this fall .
Irish policy has been slow to evolve , but many say it 's off to a good start .
" Remember that diversity and multiculturalism is only 10 years old in Ireland , " says Adebari .
" By allowing immigrants to participate in society , Ireland has accepted the first generation of immigrants . "

RIVERDALE , California ( Reuters ) - Imagine a vat of liquid cow manure covering the area of five football fields and 33 feet deep .
Meet California 's most alternative new energy .
On a dairy farm in the Golden State 's agricultural heartland , utility PG&E Corp began on Tuesday producing natural gas derived from manure , in what it hopes will be a new way to power homes with renewable , if not entirely clean , energy .
The Vintage Dairy Biogas Project , the brainchild of life - long dairyman David Albers , aims to provide the natural gas needed to power 1,200 homes a day , Albers said at the facility 's inauguration ceremony .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
" When most people see a pile of manure , they see a pile of manure .
We saw it as an opportunity for farmers , for utilities , and for California , " Albers said .
In addition to being a partner in the 5,000 - head Vintage Dairy , Albers is also president of BioEnergy Solutions , the company that funded and built the facility which cost millions of dollars .
PG&E is simply a customer and the companies declined to give details of project finances .
As cow manure decomposes , it produces methane , a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide .
Scientists say controlling methane emissions from animals such as cows would be a major step in addressing climate change .
Enter the Vintage Dairy project .
As luck would have it , methane can be captured and treated to produce renewable gas , and California regulators have directed PG&E and other utilities to make renewable energy at least 20 percent of their electricity supplies by 2010 .
PG&E expects to reach 14 percent this year , thanks in small part at least to its partnership with BioEnergy Solutions .
To tap the renewable gas from cow manure , the Vintage Dairy farm first flushes manure into a large , octagonal pit , where it becomes about 99 percent water .
It is then pumped into a covered lagoon , first passing through a screen that filters out large solids that eventually become the cows ' bedding .
The covered lagoon , or " digester , " is the size of nearly five football fields and about 33 feet deep .
It is lined with plastic to protect the ground water and the cover , made of high density polyethylene , is held down at the edges by concrete .
The digester 's cover was sunken into the lagoon on Tuesday , but officials said it would be taut and raised in a few days as the gas collects underneath it .
Weights on top of the digester channel the gas to the small facility where it is " scrubbed " of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide .
The end product is " close to 99 percent pure methane " according to BioEnergy Chief Operating Officer Thomas Hintz .
Once it is treated , the gas is injected into PG&E 's pipeline , where it will be shipped to a power plant in Northern California .
According to Albers , PG&E and California state officials , biogas is a major opportunity for dairy farmers to make extra revenue while helping the environment .
" There are a lot of lagoons like this in California that do n't have lining in them , " said James Boyd , commissioner and vice chair of the California Energy Commission .
" There is a business case to be made for this ... climate change has really provided the incentive to do this . "
Both BioEnergy Solutions and PG&E are actively courting dairy farmers , whose cow manure is now simply being used as fertilizer , allowing the methane to be released into the air as a greenhouse gas .
" With nearly 2 million dairy cows in California , the potential is great , " said Roy Kuga , vice president of energy supply for San Fransisco - based PG&E .
The company has a partnership with another company , Microgy , which is currently setting up biogas projects at three California dairies .
In practice , however , not every dairy could participate in such a project because some are not located close enough to the necessary gas transmission lines , PG&E officials said .
Still , for now there are plenty of dairies to get on board .
A second dairy in Fresno county has already agreed to join the Vintage Dairy project and Albers estimated gas from the two dairies combined could power 2,500 homes a day .
The Vintage Dairy facility could accommodate gas from up to two or three more dairies , depending on the size , officials said .

Last week a court ruled that Israel 's largest ISPs should block access to HttpShare , a BitTorrent and http hyperlink site .
Thanks to what the owners call " IFPI advertising " , the site is now so busy they 've had to upgrade their hardware .
Torrent Freak caught up with them as they cracked open the champagne .
Haifa District Court Judge , Gideo Ginat : “ I order the respondents , that is Israeli internet service providers , to systematically block access to the illicit site , HttpShare , so that surfers cannot enter this site and utilize it in in order to impede upon the claimants ’ copyrights . ”
In response , the site owners state : “ According to Dutch law , sites providing external links allowing surfers to download movie , music , games and program are perfectly legal .
Sites cannot store these illicit files on their internet servers , and that is precisely what we do not do .
The site merely provides links to file sharing sites that host BitTorrent files or http downloads . ”
This fact does n’t seem to have influenced the judge when he ordered the blocking of the site .
Unfortunately for the IFPI , this block has achieved nothing other than boosting the popularity of the site – dozens of news outlets wrote about the block and the result so far is that visitors are now up to 70,000 a day .
HTTPShare even had to get new hardware to cope with the demand – “ Big Thanks to IFPI Advertising ” says a note on the site .
TorrentFreak caught up with admin ‘ Andre ’ to hear more :
TF : Please tell us a little about the history leading directly to the creation of HTTPShare .
HTTP : Before HTTPSHARE there was a warez site back in 2003 called ELICOMP .
CO.IL .
The site ’s owner was Eli Amar .
Eli had to join the army and could not continue running the site , however he met me and I agreed to fund the site and keep it running .
The site indexed HTTP links on all sorts of servers , then we grew in size and developed a crawler which job was to track fast speed . torrent files .
The crawler was added to the the site which made it even more popular .
We created the VIP zone in which users get fast and direct links ( min. 500 KB / s ) to cover the servers and the programmers cost .
TF : When did your legal problems with the IFPI begin ?
HTTP : About 9 months ago , Eli got a package with IFPI prosecution documents , including a court order to shut down the site .
Eli did n’t know what to do so he mailed the files to me and I canceled the domain and opened a new one – HTTPSHARE .
COM .
Then 150 K of emails were sent to previous members telling them about the new site and it was n’t long before search engines like Google and Yahoo picked us up .
TF : Obviously changing the domain name and owner did n’t persuade the IFPI to leave you alone , so what happened next ?
HTTP : The IFPI kept sending sending emails demanding us to shutdown the site .
I never did so because the site is legal , we do not upload illegal stuff to our server [ do not host any infringing media ] , and what we are doing is not against the law of the country in which we are hosted [ Netherlands ] .
TF : How did the ISP block come about ?
HTTP : After the IFPI understood that they are dealing with a new owner they asked the Israeli court to order the ISPs to block the “ www.httpshare.com” domain .
We all know that the legal system in Israel is corrupted and driven by money and power of the share holders .
How can you accept such a ruling from a judge whose son was suspended from his job as a lawyer because of counterfeiting documents and money blackmail ?
TF : Why do you think you became an IFPI target ?
HTTP : We were a target of the IFPI and similar organizations even at the time of Elicomp .
I think we were targeted because of the huge amount of bandwidth my site used while providing Direct external links .
At that time the ISPs blocked us , but were then forced to unblock as a result of complaints from their subscribers .
TF : What actions have you taken to try to counter the block ?
HTTP : For now we changed the IP of the server and released a program ( browser ) for the members that uses a server with 10 IP ranges so that it will be a lot more difficult to block it .
Since we introduced the browser , the number of visitors has doubled .
Also , thanks to the huge amount of publicity we got from the IFPI and sites like yours , we have added an English language forum to the site and translated the names of the forums to make the site easy to use .
TF : Thanks for taking the time to speak with us .
Suing individual users does n’t work , bullying site owners does n’t appear to be effective and ISP bans simply create more traffic and popularity for the target site .
All this on top of reduced funding for chasing copyright infringers .
So where next for the IFPI ?
One of the problems plaguing classical communication is associated with what is known as the Byzantine agreement .
In this problem , messages between three different parties are subject to faulty information .
Quantum communication , though , has held the promise of solving this dilemma .
But until now , it has been difficult to do so , even using entangled states .
However , an international group of scientists may have found a solution .
The results of their experiment are published in Physical Review Letters : “ Experimental Demonstration of a Quantum Protocol for Byzantine Agreement and Liar Detection . ”
“ Instead of only three photons , ” Harald Weinfurter tells PhysOrg.com , “ our protocol uses four photons in a specially prepared state . ”
Weinfurter is associated with the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Physics in Garching , Germany , and with the Ludwig Maximilians University in München .
Weinfurter worked with Sascha Gaertner , a colleague at Max Planck and Ludwig Maximilians , who did a great deal of the experimental work .
Also included in the effort were Mohamed Bourennane at Stockholm University , Christian Kurtsiefer at the National University of Singapore and Adán Cabello at the University of Seville in Spain , who “ came up with most of the idea , ” Weinfurter says .
“ Our protocol allows us to find the liar between three partners sending messages , ” Weinfurter continues .
“ It offers a verifying process that two receiving computers will cross check with each other .
It is a way of solving this Byzantine agreement problem . ”
The problem , explains Weinfurter , comes from a story Lamport , et al. described in 1982 , creating a situation that might have taken place in 1453 when Constantinople was besieged .
Generals were sending messages back and forth , trying to coordinate an attack on the city .
Some , for their own reasons , attempted to use false information to sabotage the others .
In quantum mechanics , the problem of three - party communication also includes faulty information as messages are passed and forth .
It can be difficult – almost impossible until now – to detect the faulty information and its source in a three - party quantum communication setup .
This is because the required qutrits , threefold valued quantum systems , are quite difficult to generate and handle .
Experimentally , it is much easier to create qubit ( two - party ) entangled states .
Weinfurter and peers succeeded in overcoming the qutrit difficulties by setting up a system that creates four - qubit entangled states .
“ We use a pulsed laser , and even though you usually only get two photons , there is a reasonable possibility for four photons , ” he says .
“ Once these are detected , they can be entangled .
The state comes out of the source , more or less . ”
Weinfurter says that this protocol is not actually for secure communication , only .
“ It ’s really for verification , ” he explains , “ so you can detect the liar . ”
The special state of the entangled photons is used to distribute the key used in the verification process .
Unfortunately , Weinfurter admits , the setup is difficult to use in a computer . “ For use in data replication , more developments are still required . ”
The important thing , he insists , is that this experiment shows , for the first time experimentally , a way to defeat the Byzantine agreement problem .
“ For a practical quantum computing application it ’s not there , ” Weinfurter says .
“ But with new methods to create photons , we could get there soon . ”

Award goes to maths that tames wild shapes and houses the infinite .
Masters of symmetry : John Griggs Thompson and Jacque Tits .
University of Florida and Jean- François Dars/ CNRS
Images
The Abel Prize , generally considered the ‘ Nobel ’ of mathematics , has been won this year by two mathematicians whose work has helped to classify the building blocks of symmetry .
John Griggs Thompson of the University of Florida , Gainsville , and Jacques Tits of the Collège de France in Paris , France , have been given the prize , worth 6 million Norwegian kroner ( US $ 1.2 million ) , for their work on group theory , which describes how the symmetry properties of objects fall into distinct classes or groups .
Group theory is one of the most practically useful branches of pure mathematics , being used in scientific fields ranging from fundamental theories of particle physics to the spectroscopic analysis of molecules .
The symmetries of objects can be described using fundamental ‘ symmetry operations ’ : manipulations that leave the object looking unchanged .
This is true of squares and cubes , for example , if they are rotated by a quarter of a full turn , or if they are reflected in various mirror planes that cut the shapes in half .
The full set of such symmetry operations for an object constitutes a ' group ' .
There is only a limited number of such groups , and they therefore supply a way of putting all shapes ( or algebraic equations ) into a small number of basic symmetry classes — a kind of ' Periodic Table ' of symmetry .
Prime symmetries
Thompson showed that certain symmetry operations can be broken down into more basic , indivisible operations , rather like the way molecules can be decomposed into their elemental atoms .
These elemental operations are related to prime numbers .
For example , a symmetry rotation of a 15 - sided polygon is equivalent to the rotations of a 5 - sided polygon and an equilateral triangle , both inscribed inside the original polygon .
“ Tits ' work is about trying reduce wild to tame behaviour . ”
Graham Niblo
In 1963 Thompson and Walter Feit ( who died in 2004 ) proved that the breaking down of symmetries into those of prime - number - sided shapes is always possible for objects with an odd number of symmetries ( such as a 15 - sided polygon ) but not possible for even - numbered ones ( such as a 16 - sided polygon ) .
Their Odd Order Theorem proof filled 255 journal pages and occupied an entire volume of the Pacific Journal of Mathematics — several other journals rejected the paper because it was too long .
This work showed how to tell whether or not a group was reducible to more fundamental groups , and it led to the recognition that so - called finite groups , which have a finite number of symmetry elements , can be classed into families , leading to the periodic table of such groups .
These are enumerated in a dense book called the Atlas of Finite Groups .
Housing the infinite
“ The Monster can only be fully seen in 196,883 dimensions . ”
Tits has studied the symmetry properties of so - called linear groups , in which the symmetry operations can be infinite in number .
There are , for example , an infinite number of rotations of a circle that will leave it looking unchanged .
Although a circle seems a simple shape , the infinite symmetries of such shapes are hard to get a hold on .
" Tits ' work is about trying to tame the infinite space of these objects , to reduce wild to tame behaviour , " says Graham Niblo , a group theorist at the University of Southampton in the UK .
Tits ' work showed how these groups can be described and analysed in geometric terms , making their properties easier to visualize .
He coined the term ' buildings ' to describe the geometric structures that arise as a result , and showed that they can be further broken down into so - called ' apartments ' and ' chambers ' .

Together the work of Thompson and Tits has led to a better understanding of a strange class of symmetrical objects called sporadic groups , which do n’t fit into the periodic table of symmetries .
" They seem to come from nowhere , " says Niblo .
The most bizarre of these , and the largest , is an object called the Monster , which can only be fully seen in 196,883 dimensions and has 8 x 1053 symmetry elements .
Thompson devised a formula for predicting how many symmetry operations a sporadic group may have , and Tits has studied some of them : one ( the Tits group ) is named after him .
The Abel Prize , established in 2002 , is administered by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in Oslo .
It is named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel , who himself made profound contributions to the foundations of group theory during his short life .
Born in 1802 , he died aged just 26 .
Plans for an Abel memorial prize were mooted on the first centenary of his birth , but came to nothing .
They were revived on the second centenary , and the first Abel prize was awarded in 2003 .
Healthy levels of vitamin D may help to slow the ageing process and protect against age - related diseases , a team of British scientists has found .
The claim follows a study of more than 2,000 women which found that those with the lowest vitamin D levels showed the greatest signs of biological ageing .
Scientists at King 's College London who conducted the study said large - scale trials were needed to confirm the discovery , but if proved correct the finding could have a dramatic impact on healthcare .
In summer much of the vitamin D we need is created by a reaction in the skin powered by sunlight .
In the darker winter months vitamin D comes largely from food such as cod liver oil and mackerel .
The team , led by Brent Richards , an endocrinologist , recorded vitamin D levels in 2,160 women aged 18 - 79 .
The scientists then took white blood cells and examined them for genetic signs of ageing .
Among the most reliable measures of a person's age are telomeres , the lengths of genetic material that cap the free ends of DNA in a cell .
With age , the telomeres shorten and the DNA becomes more unstable until eventually the cell dies .
For the experiment the women were organised into three groups according to their vitamin D levels .
The study found that those with the highest vitamin levels had significantly longer telomeres - equivalent to five years of normal ageing - than those showing the lowest vitamin D scores .
Dr Richards , whose study was published yesterday in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , said : " These results are exciting because they demonstrate for the first time that people who have higher levels of vitamin D may age more slowly than people with lower levels of vitamin D .
This could help explain how vitamin D has a protective effect on many ageing - related diseases , such as heart disease and cancer .
What 's interesting is that there 's a huge body of evidence that shows sunshine ages your skin - but it also increases your vitamin D levels .
So , like many times in medicine , we find there 's a trade - off . "
Tim Spector , a co-author of the paper , added : " Although it might sound absurd , it 's possible that the same sunshine which may increase our risk of skin cancer may also have a healthy effect on the ageing process in general . "
Health guidelines on vitamin D recommend a daily intake of between 200 and 600 international units ( IU ) , with the higher level required by the over - 70s .
An 85g tin of tuna contains roughly 200 IU of vitamin D. Maximum healthy levels of vitamin D range from 1,000 IU for young children to 2,000 IU for adults .
Too much leads to toxicity , which can cause nausea , weakness and kidney damage .
Previous studies have suggested that vitamin D may help moderate the immune system and so aid the treatment of immune - related disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and type one diabetes .
The most famous journalist you may never have heard of is Sami al - Hajj , an Al Jazeera cameraman who is on a hunger strike to protest abuse during more than six years in a Kafkaesque prison system .
Mr. Hajj ’s fortitude has turned him into a household name in the Arab world , and his story is sowing anger at the authorities holding him without trial .
That ’s us .
Mr. Hajj is one of our forgotten prisoners in Guantánamo Bay .
If the Bush administration appointed an Under Secretary of State for Antagonizing the Islamic World , with advice from a Blue Ribbon Commission for Sullying America ’s Image , it could n’t have done a more systematic job of discrediting our reputation around the globe .
Instead of using American political capital to push for peace in the Middle East or Darfur , it is using it to force - feed Mr. Hajj .
President Bush is now moving forward with plans to try six Guantánamo prisoners before a military tribunal , rather than hold a regular trial .
That will call new attention to abuses in Guantánamo and sow more anti-Americanism around the world .
Henry Mintzberg , a professor of management at McGill University who studies organizations , said a visionary leader is crucial at the beginning .
But , he said , “ what these people do is , they are determined and focused , ” he said , keeping the vision pure , “ not mixing it up . ”
It is natural that over time a visionary leader ’s role is diminished and that is good thing , he said , quoting Bertolt Brecht , “ unhappy is the land that has no heroes  no , unhappy is the land that needs heroes . ”
Despite some of the attacks on Mr. Wales , he is still largely a hero within the Wikipedia community  walking through the annual conventions with assistants in tow , greeting the most enthusiastic Wikipedia contributors from across the globe , receiving invitations to the World Economic Forum in Davos , attending George Soros ’s birthday party .
Ms. Gardner said there will always be a need for what Mr. Wales provides .
“ People want to reach out to someone , and they know his name  it could be a famous person , a celebrity , or not  if they have a problem with their entry they will contact him . ”
Image Rachel Marsden , a New York columnist and former Fox News commentator who dated Jimmy Wales , tried to auction a T - shirt , among other items , that he left in her apartment .
It was in this capacity that Ms. Marsden , a columnist and a former commentator on Fox News , said she had reached out to Mr. Wales , after her article page was being vandalized .
She wrote via e-mail that “ Jimmy volunteered to make changes to my Wikipedia page after we became involved personally and romantically .
Before that , he really could n’t have cared less . ”
Mr. Wales wrote on his user page that he would not interfere before meeting Ms. Marsden , and summed up , “ My involvement in cases like this is completely routine , and I am proud of it . ”
However , the incident did pry open his personal life to Silicon Valley gossip sites ( he said that he had been separated from his wife when he met Ms. Marsden ) and has created the embarrassing spectacle of having his old laundry put up for auction on eBay .
At the same time , a former foundation employee , Danny Wool , has created a blog where he has been detailing what he says were Mr. Wales ’s abuses of expense reimbursements , twisting Mr. Wales down - home nickname “ Jimbo ” to “ Jimbeau . ”
As humans we have a difficult time comprehending large numbers , and vast collections of people perhaps in particular .
There is something simply surreal about a pilgrimage that attracts more people than the population of Texas or a festival that draws thirty thousand revelers deep into one of the harshest deserts on Earth .
The following three events are vastly different in terms of geography , history and purpose but are all impressive in their own way and right as these images show .
Pictured above , the Maha Kumbh Mela is a Hindu pilgrimage that occurs just over once pre decade .
The images show the amazing standing - room - only situation that results as a total of 70 million people converge on the Ganges to wash away their sins in the river .
It is perhaps unsurprising that there have been problems with this gathering in the past , such as a mass stampede some years back following money being thrown into the crowd .
Still , the entire event is remarkably peaceful and well - organized considering its enormous scale .
What began as a small gathering on a San Fransisco beach a few decades ago has since become the infamous Burning Man Festival – the single largest art festival and temporary city in the world .
Remarkably well organized in its geometry , tens of thousands of citizens / residents / visitors take their places in a three - quarters circle all centered on the central Burning Man figure .
Though there has been much controversy regarding the festival in recent years is is still growing and evolving and attempting to grapple larger social and political issues .
The amazing video above shows the entire 2007 Festival in a ten - minute time - lapse session .
Imagine the world ’s largest choreographed dance – now imagine that it is completely unscripted and on a snowy mountainside .
It sounds rather terrifying , does n’t it ?
The Engadin Ski Marathon in St. Mortiz was a 30 mile race taking , for many , hours to complete .
It is hard to imagine how one would even begin to jockey for position in such an immense crowd or even stay one one ’s feet .
Also see Wikipedia for some more of the largest gatherings in history .

In case living in New York was n't already expensive enough , state lawmakers passed the " Amazon Tax " bill this week , which will require online retailers to collect sales taxes on purchases shipped to the state , even when they do n't have physical operations there .

New York - based retailers have argued for years that the Amazon loophole gives out - of - state online shopping centers an unfair advantage .
Technically , consumers are supposed to report purchases they make online on their tax returns , but virtually nobody does it and enforcement is impossible .
The bill still needs a signature from Governor David Paterson to officially become law , but he 's widely expected to OK it .
The state government expects the new requirement to generate about $ 50 million in revenue this fiscal year .

Guns Save Lives
It 's all too predictable .
A day after a gunman killed six people and wounded 18 others at Northern Illinois University , The New York Times criticized the U.S. Interior Department for preparing to rethink its ban on guns in national parks .
The editorial board wants " the 51 senators who like the thought of guns in the parks -- and everywhere else , it seems -- to realize that the innocence of Americans is better protected by carefully controlling guns than it is by arming everyone to the teeth . "
As usual , the Times editors seem unaware of how silly their argument is .
To them , the choice is between " carefully controlling guns " and " arming everyone to the teeth . "
But no one favors " arming everyone to the teeth " ( whatever that means ) .
Instead , gun advocates favor freedom , choice and self - responsibility .
If someone wishes to be prepared to defend himself , he should be free to do so .
No one has the right to deprive others of the means of effective self - defense , like a handgun .
As for the first option , " carefully controlling guns , " how many shootings at schools or malls will it take before we understand that people who intend to kill are not deterred by gun laws ?
Last I checked , murder is against the law everywhere .
No one intent on murder will be stopped by the prospect of committing a lesser crime like illegal possession of a firearm .
The intellectuals and politicians who make pious declarations about controlling guns should explain how their gunless utopia is to be realized .
While they search for -- excuse me -- their magic bullet , innocent people are dying defenseless .
That 's because laws that make it difficult or impossible to carry a concealed handgun do deter one group of people : law - abiding citizens who might have used a gun to stop crime .
Gun laws are laws against self - defense .
Criminals have the initiative .
They choose the time , place and manner of their crimes , and they tend to make choices that maximize their own , not their victims ' , success .
So criminals do n't attack people they know are armed , and anyone thinking of committing mass murder is likely to be attracted to a gun- free zone , such as schools and malls .
Government may promise to protect us from criminals , but it cannot deliver on that promise .
This was neatly summed up in book title a few years ago : " Dial 911 and Die . "
If you are the target of a crime , only one other person besides the criminal is sure to be on the scene : you .
There is no good substitute for self - responsibility .
How , then , does it make sense to create mandatory gun- free zones , which in reality are free - crime zones ?
The usual suspects keep calling for more gun control laws .
But this idea that gun control is crime control is just a myth .
The National Academy of Sciences reviewed dozens of studies and could not find a single gun regulation that clearly led to reduced violent crime or murder .
When Washington , D.C. , passed its tough handgun ban years ago , gun violence rose .
The press ignores the fact that often guns save lives .
It 's what happened in 2002 at the Appalachian School of Law .
Hearing shots , two students went to their cars , got their guns and restrained the shooter until police arrested him .
Likewise , law professor Glenn Reynolds writes , " Pearl , Miss. , school shooter Luke Woodham was stopped when the school 's vice principal took a .45 from his truck and ran to the scene .
In ( last ) February 's Utah mall shooting , it was an off - duty police officer who happened to be on the scene and carrying a gun " .
It 's impossible to know exactly how often guns stop criminals .
Would - be victims do n't usually report crimes that do n't happen .
But people use guns in self - defense every day .
The Cato Institute 's Tom Palmer says just showing his gun to muggers once saved his life .
" It equalizes unequals , " Palmer told " 20/20 " .
" If someone gets into your house , which would you rather have , a handgun or a telephone ?
You can call the police if you want , and they 'll get there , and they 'll take a picture of your dead body .
But they can't get there in time to save your life .
The first line of defense is you . "
Studio looks for animation runners , animators for " still secret " project
The animation studio Gainax ( Evangelion , The Wings of Honneamise , Gunbuster , Nadia - Secret of Blue Water , FLCL ) revealed in a February 4 recruitment ad that it is ramping up on a new project .
The ad gives no further indication about the project 's contents or timing , except for the recruitment 's February 29 deadline .
The actual job listings for new animation runners and animators state that the jobs will be for " Gonyogonyo ( Mada Himitsu ) " [ " Mumble - mumble ( It 's still secret ) " ] .
The listings also mention Tengen Toppa Gurren - Lagann , but do not necessarily indicate that a Gurren Lagann follow - up series is in the works .
Gainax has not created a major new project since 2007's Gurren Lagann and one short in NHK's Ani-Kuri 15 project .
Although the current Evangelion movie remake credits Gainax with creating the original franchise , the studio is not involved in the movies ' actual animation production ; Hideaki Anno's new studio , Khara , is overseeing the day - to - day production of the movies .
Thank you to Xenofan 29A for the news tip .
Update : Like several other Japanese animation studios , Gainax welcomes non-Japanese job applicants .
However the company requires applicants to have enough Japanese fluency to carry everyday conversations , in order to maintain communications during production .
[ The Japanese role - playing game is a surprisingly important genre for developers to study - both in terms of gameplay and storytelling , and Gamasutra presents an ' Essential 20 ' explaining and chronicling the top JRPGs of all - time . ]
The gap between Western and Japanese RPGs is so huge that they sometimes do n't even seem like they belong in the same genre .
Western RPGs usually concentrate on open - ended gameplay , with a " go anywhere , do anything " mentality .
Japanese RPGs concentrate on narrative and battle systems , being more eager to tell a story than let the gamer play a role .
However , Japanese RPGs did n't just appear out of nowhere -- as their roots lie heavily in early American computer RPGs of the 80s .
Two of the most popular games back in the day were Ultima and Wizardry .
Although all had followings amongst hardcore Japanese gamers , they were a little bit too uninviting for your average console owners , whose ages skewed a bit younger .
Yuji Horii , a developer at Enix , decided to take on an interesting experiment .
By combing the overhead exploration aspects of Ultima ( the third and fourth games , specifically ) and the first person , menu - based battle system of Wizardry , a new game was born : Dragon Quest .
Released for the Nintendo Famicom in 1986 , the game became a phenomenon , and went on to inspire dozens of clones .
Most of these are best left forgotten , but it did inspire two more notable franchises : Square 's Final Fantasy and Sega 's Phantasy Star .
Meanwhile , in America , it was n't until 1989 that Nintendo translated the game for English speaking audiences , redubbing it Dragon Warrior .
Despite the huge amount of effort put into the localization , the subpar graphics and stodgy interface failed to win over many gamers .
Throughout the rest of the 8 and 16 - bit eras , RPGs in America -- and especially Europe -- were relative rarities .
While Square continued to translate most of its better games for America , most publishers had left the market , with only sporadic releases from the likes of Capcom , Sega , Working Designs , and a handful of others .
It was n't until Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation , with its flashy full motion cutscenes , that Japanese RPGs truly obtained worldwide popularity .
Since then , a vast majority of JRPGs have been translated into English , whether they 're contemporary releases , remakes of old titles or even fan - translated ROMs for play on emulators .
As of 2008 , the Japanese RPG has become a subject of scorn for many Western critics , deriding it for its conventions -- slow , menu based combat , random battles , overreliance on narrative -- and for its failure to evolve .
In spite of this , there are still many fans of the genre , who continue to enjoy them for their interesting plots , characters , and battle systems .
This is a list of twenty of the best JRPGs of all time -- well , an attempt , anyway .
Each of these has been selected for excelling in some significant way , whether it 's through compelling narrative devices or intriguing gameplay mechanics .
To avoid redundancies , only the best installment of a franchise will be chosen as a representative .
The exception to this rule includes the Final Fantasy games , many of which are so vastly different from each other that they can barely be recognized as part of the same series , outside of the name .
It 's worth bearing in mind that there are technically a few different subgenres of the Japanese RPG .
These include action - RPGs like Ys , Kingdom Hearts , Secret of Mana , and ( arguably ) The Legend of Zelda .
There are also strategy RPGs , like Fire Emblem , Final Fantasy Tactics , Disgaea , Shining Force , and the like .
There are also a handful of Japanese - developed online RPGs , like Phantasy Star Online and Final Fantasy XI .
For the sake of focus , these types of games will be excluded from the list .

So ... when me and my friends talk about the " bar being set so low " in this industry , we 're not talking simply about programmers .
Stupid , crass ( " ghetto " , if you will ) behavior is endemic at all levels , and even at the biggest players .
Case in point , SAP getting sued to the tune of $ 100 million by Waste Management over a failed enterprise project .
( full article via cote )
The trash - disposal giant Waste Management is suing SAP , saying top SAP executives participated in a fraudulent sales scheme that resulted in a failed ERP ( enterprise resource planning ) implementation .
What makes this case interesting , in my opinion , is that the " fraudulent sales scheme " that SAP is accused of doing is a well - known marketing tactic used by practically every software vendor I 've ever known , and is probably familiar to you as well .
Read on ...
In 2005 , Waste Management was looking for a new revenue management system , according to a company statement .
" SAP proposed its Waste and Recycling product and claimed it was a tested , working solution that had been developed with the needs of Waste Management in mind , "
Emphasis mine .
They claimed it was a tested , working solution !
Further , they promised to implement it throughout Waste Management in 18 months .
There must be huge logistical challenges and biz - process re-engineering ( BPR ) factors to account for in such a deal , but 18 months is probably a reasonable time - frame to get a working , tested solution implemented .
However , writing plus implementing in 18 months , for such a huge company is of course a whole ' nother story !
" From the beginning , SAP assured Waste Management that its software was an ' out - of - the - box ' solution that would meet Waste Management 's needs without any customization or enhancements "
Wow !
No customization or enhancements !
How do you convince skeptical purchasing managers that such a bold claim is true ?
( Here 's where I start chuckling , knowing how common this practice is )
Waste Management said product demonstrations by SAP prior to the deal employed " ' fake software environments , even though these demonstrations were represented to be the actual software . "
If you 're in the business of selling enterprise software , you kind of have to go read the article , because it is a priceless account of how to really fuck up a major deal like this .
Waste Management ultimately signed a sales pact with SAP on Oct. 3 , 2005 , according to the court filing .
The charade about fully - functional and tested software collapsed immediately .
" Almost immediately following execution of the agreements , the SAP implementation team discovered significant ' gaps ' between the software 's functionality and Waste Management 's business requirements , " it states .
I guess deep - down inside , it 's this sort of stuff that drove me away from the " enterprisey " side of the industry .
For all the talk of pragmatism and being lean , and Agile , this sort of thing is just still too common .
" Waste Management has discovered that these gaps were already known to the product development team in Germany even before the SLA was signed .
Instead of admitting what it knew at the time -- that the software lacked basic functionality to run Waste Management 's business -- SAP undertook an elaborate fraud to perpetuate the original fraud and to recover additional money from Waste Management . "
How do you cover up fraud on this scale ?
Blame the client of course !
Members of SAP 's implementation team blamed Waste Management for the functional gaps and submitted change orders requiring that Waste Management pay for fixing them , according to the complaint .
We all play our part in the grand drama of IT , behaving in ways that improve the industry or lead to fiascos like the one described above .
The client is not always right , and I 'm sure Waste Management played into the fraud to a large degree , with clueless managers and unreasonable expectations .
The onus is on us , the technology providers , both at the executive level and below , to stand up and be honest about what can and cannot be accomplished , and risk our jobs if necessary .
That 's courage , although you have to admit , that given the red - hot demand for IT talent currently in place , it might not actually take that much courage to stick to your guns .

5.0 out of 5 stars A little book packed with ideas
A family - owned trucking firm that has a contract to deliver Diebold electronic voting machines to 14 voting districts in Maryland is headed by the former chairman of Maryland 's Republican party , Wired News has learned .
Office Movers , which is owned by The Kane Company in Elkridge , Maryland , received the contract from Diebold Election Systems to transport the company 's machines from warehouses to the polls for the state 's Feb. 12 primary and November general election .
John M. Kane , president and CEO of The Kane Company , was chairman of the Maryland Republican Party from the end of 2002 until December 2006 .
He is also a member of the statewide steering committee for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney .
According to one news report , Kane has been tasked since last month with raising money for Romney in Maryland , a Democratic stronghold .
His wife is a delegate on the Republican primary ballot for Romney rival Rudy Giuliani .
Even in this tumultuous election season , the company 's political affiliations might not raise conflict - of - interest questions were it delivering old - fashioned voting machines .
But the Diebold touch - screen voting machines used in Maryland produce no paper trail and have experienced glitches that have invited close scrutiny after previous elections .
A report compiled by the elections office in Montgomery County , Maryland , ( immediately northwest of the District of Columbia ) after the 2004 presidential election revealed that 189 machines ( 7 percent ) there failed on election day .
Of these machines , 58 would n't boot up and were taken out of service , and another 106 experienced frozen screens .
Other counties have experienced problems with the machines as well .
Local voting - integrity activists were surprised to hear of Office Movers ' deal with Diebold ( now known as Premier Election Solutions ) , and they worry that the integrity of elections is at risk if machines are transported by a company whose owner is so closely aligned with a party and candidate .
" What concerns us the most is that there is a chain - of - custody issue here , " says Mary Kiraly of the Maryland Election Integrity Coalition , an umbrella group of five organizations , including the Maryland branches of Common Cause and the American Civil Liberties Union .
" Twenty thousand voting units leave the custody of Board of Elections officials , and they are placed in the hands of a third - party private company responsible , not to the state Board of Elections , but to the vendor , " Kiraly says .
" How was this company chosen , and who vetted the employees who handle and deliver these vulnerable voting units ? "
According to Maryland 's statewide contract with Diebold , which the state signed in 2003 for $ 55.6 million , the vendor is responsible for providing secure storage and transport of its voting machines .
Although the machines are stored in county warehouses , private companies are subcontracted by Diebold to transport the machines from the warehouses to polls and back again at the end of the election .
Reached by phone , Kane acknowledges some irony in his company delivering the voting machines , but says there 's no conflict of interest since he's no longer head of the state Republican Party and is n't currently involved in it .
Although The Baltimore Sun reported last month that Kane would be raising money for Romney , he says his position on Romney 's presidential steering committee is purely ceremonial and that he 's done no fundraising except for his own $ 2,000 contribution .
" They just wanted the former chairman 's name ( on the committee ) to show that ( Romney ) had gravitas in the state , " he says .
Office Movers is contracted to deliver machines in 14 of the state 's 24 voting districts this year , including Montgomery County – Maryland 's most populous .
Four other private companies will deliver in the remainder of the state .
A fifth company , Signature Space , is contracted to serve as project manager , responsible for the logistics of all the deliveries of the companies .
Office Movers also delivered Diebold machines in the 2004 election cycle , when it was contracted to deliver machines to eight Maryland counties during that year 's general election , and to an unknown number during the primary .
It was hired by Diebold indirectly that year through a subcontractor commissioned to manage the deliveries and pick other contractors to deliver the machines .
According to a contractor who worked for Diebold at the time , when the subcontractor picked Office Movers for part of the project , Diebold wanted to keep the information confidential , because of Kane 's relationship with the Republican Party .
" They did n't want to have any political blowback ( from the contract ) , " says Chris Hood , who worked as a Diebold contractor from 2001 to 2004 producing voter - education materials .
Hood recalled a 2004 conference call with Diebold officials in which Tom Feehan , Diebold 's project manager for Maryland , told participants that the contract with Office Movers had been signed , but that they needed to keep the news under wraps .
Diebold had run headfirst into a firestorm of controversy in 2003 when it was discovered that CEO Walden O'Dell had sent a fundraising invitation to wealthy Republicans in Ohio saying that he was " committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes " to President Bush in 2004 .
Hood says because of the logistics involved in delivering thousands of machines to polls , Office Movers has possession of the machines for hours at a time .
" Anything could be done , " he says .
" You could take a whole truck of machines and drive it into the warehouse , and drive another truck out .
So a lot of things could happen .
But there is no security in the process of deploying voting machines .
Absolutely no security . "
Since the company picks up machines from polling places after elections , it means the company has possession of machines that fail or otherwise perform irregularly during the election or that might later be involved in recounts .
In a tight election , that arrangement could cast a shadow on any postelection troubleshooting or recount .
Ross Goldstein , deputy administrator with the Maryland state Board of Elections , says he was aware of Kane 's political connections , but that he's not concerned about them because the voting machines are secure .
" These machines are locked , sealed , tamper - taped , " he says .
" There are very strict protocols that the drivers follow .
I think it 's a little far - fetched to assume that he 's going to have drivers that are in cahoots .
There are enough other security procedures involved with the seals that I do n't think it 's an issue . "
Mike Morrill , spokesman for Diebold / Premier , says that Office Movers is a natural choice for delivering its machines , because the company has had contracts with various government agencies and local boards of elections going back many years .
" We 've all found them to perform very well , which is why we looked at them again this year , " he says .
As for Kane 's political connections , Morrill says he thinks Hood probably misunderstood what he heard on that 2004 conference call .
It would have been silly for Diebold to try to keep its deal with Kane 's company quiet , because Diebold provides each county with a report naming the company that will deliver its machines , and gives the same information to the state Board of Elections .
Although he says he was not aware that Kane was on the steering committee for Mitt Romney 's presidential campaign , he says that Kane 's and his wife 's political affiliations are well - known and irrelevant , since they 're part of Kane 's personal life , and his company has never been accused of political wrongdoing .
Morrill adds that if Diebold / Premier screened out companies involved in political activity of one type or another in Maryland , it would have trouble finding anyone .
" You assume somehow that all of the people who work for him would share ( his political ) perspective , " Morrill says .
" I do n't think you can assume that someone who engages in political activity on a personal level would then use their corporation to serve that purpose . "
Kane notes that his company has been delivering voting machines in the state for 38 years and that Office Movers withdrew from its contract to deliver voting machines in 2006 while he was chairman of the state Republican Party " out of fear of any conflict of interest being raised . "
" It was my desire not to be a story line , " he says .
" I did n't want to have a cartoon in The Baltimore Sun with me in the back of a truck with a screwdriver saying , ' Chairman Kane delivers the vote . ' "
That conflict - of - interest fear , however , did n't prevent the company from bidding on the contract in the first place .
The company 's withdrawal three months before the primary raised criticism at the time from Maryland 's Democratic Party , which believed that Kane was trying to disrupt the election and suppress the vote by creating chaos that would discourage voters from voting .
Vote suppression is generally viewed as a tactic that benefits Republican candidates .
Kane says that was never his motivation for canceling the contract and that he had n't been aware until after the contract was signed that his company was planning to deliver the voting machines that year .
He adds he has never had any personal contact with Diebold / Premier , and says he does n't even know the value of the delivery contract , though he thinks it might be around half a million dollars .
The Kane Company , which owns a number of other shipping companies in addition to Office Movers , makes $ 7 million a month in revenue , according to Kane .
David Paulson , spokesman for Maryland 's Democratic Party , says that Kane 's affiliations with the Republican Party and Romney 's campaign are a concern but does n't think they should prevent the company from having the delivery contract .
" It concerns me that an individual with heavy political ties to the Republican Party and to Mitt Romney is associated or involved in any way in the electoral process in a way that could be disruptive if one chose to be , " he says , " But there 's never been a hint , beside that breaking of the contract in 2006 , of manipulation or otherwise nefarious activity on behalf of Office Movers . "
He says he believes Kane is " an honest person " and would n't " do something illegal or unethical in service of a contract like this . "
But he also says that because Democrats control local boards of elections across the state , he expects that " these contracts and this delivery service will be closely watched and monitored to ensure that nothing untoward occurs . "

“ We ’re tired of the Hillary thing , ” Effertz said .
“ We ’d had enough of Bill and Hillary . ”
“ I do not like the way they ’ve been kind of nasty , ” said Erganian , of Rocheport , Missouri .
“ I do n’t want anybody in office like that . ”
Tuesday is “ Super Tuesday ” when 24 states , Missouri among them , hold nominating contests for one or both parties .
It is the biggest date in the six - month process to decide which of each party will face off in the November 4 election to succeed President George W. Bush .
When it comes to the November election , Missouri , home to the plain - speaking late President Harry Truman in the heart of America , has long been viewed as a bellwether , having voted for the winner in every presidential ballot except one since 1904 .
The former first lady is virtually tied with Illinois Sen. Barack Obama among Democrats in Missouri , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released on Sunday .
Super Tuesday could be a tight race nationwide for the two Democrats .
On the Republican side Sen . John McCain leads former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in most states , but not in the big - prize state of California .
Strong anti-Clinton feeling has people in both parties speculating that if the New York senator wins the Democratic nomination she could become a powerful unifying force -- for Republicans .
‘ VETTED , TESTED ’
The Clintons have been on the national political stage since Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992 .
Once his second term ended in 2001 , Hillary Clinton began her own , official , political career by winning a Senate seat from New York .
“ I ’ve been taking the incoming fire from Republicans for about 16 years now , and I ’m still here , because I have been vetted , I have been tested , ” she said on Sunday on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
Obama ’s supporters and Republican leaders alike say although many voters passionately support Clinton , at least as many passionately dislike her .
They offer various explanations and acknowledge that at least some are unfair .
Some anger at her is residual resentment of her husband whose second term was mired in a long impeachment process stemming from an extramarital relationship .
For some it ’s about her policies -- pro-gun control , for universal health care .
Others cite a personality they see as too aggressive and insincere .
Clinton ’s campaign has brushed aside the concerns , saying she has a proven track record of winning , in her New York campaigns and in voting last month in New Hampshire and Nevada .
Obama won in Iowa and South Carolina .
“ I can go up against Senator McCain or any of the Republicans and be able to defend our positions , put them forward to the American people and make an affirmative case as to why I should be the president , ” Clinton said on ABC .
“ Her record of reaching out across the aisle to find common solutions is the reason ... she has such a strong record of getting results , ” said Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee , insisting that Clinton had growing support among Republicans and independent voters .
‘ HIGH NEGATIVES ’
Concerns among Democrats about how Clinton might energize Republicans have been voiced in states with large numbers of rural , conservative voters like Missouri , Nebraska , Iowa , Kansas and others in the Midwest and South .
“ She gets really high negatives among conservatives and the fundamentalist crowd , ” said Rice University political science professor Paul Brace .
“ In some states that is going to mobilize them so much so that they may overlook shortcomings of a Republican candidate . ”
Sen . Claire McCaskill of Missouri , who has endorsed Obama , is one who has said a Clinton nomination would hurt Democrats .
Others in the party agree .
“ It is not fair , ” said Missouri State Auditor Susan Montee .
“ But the fact is ... she is actually a lightning rod .
She will bring people out to vote against her . ”
Wednesday ’s decision by former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards to pull out of the Democratic race intensified such talk because Edwards was popular with many rural Midwestern voters , who now must choose between Clinton and Obama .
“ She ’s been polarizing and divisive for a long time , before Obama was even in the campaign , ” said Ken Warren , a pollster and St. Louis University political science professor .
Missouri Republican State Committee member Donna Spickert said simply : “ She would mobilize the Republican Party . ”

The Milky Way is surrounded by a cloud of smaller dwarf galaxies in various stages of destruction .
Our galaxy ’s gravity is tearing them apart and adding their stars to the galactic halo .
The two largest and most familiar are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds ; only visible from the Southern Hemisphere .
According to new research , this might be the first time these objects have ever met the Milky Way .
After we ’re done with them , it wo n’t be a pretty picture .
The Magellanic Clouds were first named after the explorer of the same name .
To the unaided eye , they look like large glowing clouds .
They ’re both irregular galaxies ; the larger is about 1/20th the size and has tenth the mass of the Milky Way , and the smaller cloud is even , well , smaller .
Astronomers from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics recently calculated the three - dimensional velocities of the two galaxies with greater accuracy than ever before , and found they were strangely high .
There can really only two explanations for this : either the Milky Way has more mass than astronomers believe , or the clouds are n’t actually gravitationally bound to our galaxy .
In other words , the two galaxies are on their first pass by the Milky Way .
This new result creates problems , though .
The Milky Way is known to have a significant warp in its disk .
Astronomers explained this warp through the gravitational interaction between our galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds .
But if this is their first pass through , it does n’t explain the warp .
Another problem is a long trail of hydrogen gas streaming behind the clouds .
Once again , if this is the first interaction , it could n’t explain how a tidal stream of hydrogen could be stretched out .
The researchers are next planning to focus on the origin on the stream of hydrogen , trailing behind the clouds .
If they can find a different source , it gives strength to the theory that the clouds are here for the first time .

Physicist Bill Foster has been running against dairy magnate and perpetual candidate Jim Oberweis in a special election in Illinois to replace retiring Republican representative Dennis Hastert , former Speaker of the House .
The election was today , and with 96 % of precincts reporting , it 's been called for Foster , 52 % to 48 % .
This is great news for scientists and for Democrats , and awesome news for those of us who are both .
Oberweis 's signature issue is anti-immigrant xenophobia , and a Democratic victory in this reliably Republican district bodes very well for the national picture this fall .
We 've mentioned Bill 's campaign here before , and think he will be a great Representative .
He is not just any old particle physicist , but quite an accomplished one , having been a co-inventor of Fermilab 's antiproton Recycler Ring .
Once you 've mastered antiprotons , the Washington political process should be child 's play .
Congratulations !
The bad news is : because this was a special election to replace Hastert , they will have to do the whole thing over again in November .
Here 's hoping that Foster can repeat his great showing .
Lift - off of the Soyuz rocket appeared to go without a hitch
Soyuz launch
The Soyuz rocket carrying South Korea 's first astronaut , Yi So-yeon , has launched successfully on its voyage to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Ms Yi and two Russian cosmonauts blasted off from Kazakhstan 's Baikonur space centre at 1116 GMT .
The 29 - year - old bio - engineer will spend about 10 days in space and conduct a series of scientific tests .
The launch makes South Korea the ninth Asian country to have had an astronaut in space .
Before the launch , Ms Yi had boarded the rocket flashing a thumbs - up and saying she felt " great " .
Ms Yi was chosen from about 36,000 applicants for the mission , which is costing South Korea about $ 20 m ( £ 10 m ) .
Initially the back - up astronaut , she was moved up after Russian officials said the first - choice , 31 - year - old Ko San , had broken space centre rules .
' Wow '
She is flying in a Russian Soyuz TMA - 12 spacecraft alongside flight engineer Oleg Kononenko , 43 , and Sergei Volkov , 34 , the son of a famous Soviet cosmonaut .
At a news conference on Monday , journalists asked Ms Yi what she would do when she arrived at the ISS .
Ms Yi was chosen from about 36,000 applicants for the historic flight
Yi So -yeon training
" I guess first of all I am going to shout : ' Wow ! ' , " she replied .
She hoped that her spaceflight would help ease ties between the two Koreas .
" I hope someday they will be one , and I hope the North Korean people will be happy with my flight , " she said .
The first Asian astronaut ( or cosmonaut ) was Vietnam 's Pham Tuan , who travelled on a Soviet Soyuz mission in 1980 .
Since then , citizens of Mongolia , Afghanistan , Japan , India , Kazakhstan , China and Malaysia have also journeyed into space .
Ms Yi is scheduled to return to Earth on 19 April with the outgoing crew of the ISS .
Yesterday it was Maria Cantwell .
Today it ’s Ron Sims , King County Executive and committed Clinton superdelegate , who was on KUOW ’s Weekday this morning telling host Steve Scher that he is , at the very least , unhappy with the destructive potential of the Democratic nomination contest .
He also said he ’s listening very closely to the debate among superdelegates about how they should get Obama and Clinton to , in his words , “ Stop it . ”
The discussion starts at 49:50 , and I ’ve transcribed it below .
There ’s quite a bit of rambling and hedging , but the take - away , for me , is that Sims may be open to the idea of using his superdelegate power to help end the contest before it harms the party ’s chances in November ( although , classic Sims , he also seemed to suggest he’d be fine with the Democratic nominee not being decided until the convention in late August ) .
Bottom line :
He ’s wavering .
Ron Sims :
Oh yeah , I am .
Scher : Nothing s going to change that ?
Sims : I didnt say that .
You asked me ,  Was I committed to Hillary Clinton 
Scher :
As a superdelegate .
Sims :
As a superdelegate .
Theres a lot of superdelegate discussion going on right now .
The emails are hot and heavy over what we should do and when we should do it .
And , again , it goes back to the fact that were Democrats and we want to make sure that we come out of the convention with the strongest candidate or combinations of candidates .
So , I dont think anybodys made a decision to bolt in large numbers now .
But , obviously , everyday I have about seven or eight emails because people across the country are on the same list .
So they are comparing notes .
So , it s going to be fascinating
Ive watched this campaign .
Ive seen two people who I really like .
And it just seems , if you look at the polls now , [ they ] are inflicting great damage on each other and that s really gotta stop .
To have people who support Senator Obama say ,  Im not going to support Senator Clinton ,  and to have people who support Senator Clinton say ,  Im not going to support Senator Obamamy issue is , that should not be the national debate .
I think we have an opportunity to head in a different direction , and we need to do that , but obviously this campaign is not doing that .
And I think more of the superdelegates are beginning to say ,  Stop it . 
And that s being heard by the campaigns and the candidates , because theyve got to stop this madness .
Scher :
It seems like I m just going to have to take 30 seconds to read between the lines there that you are wavering and considering that your candidate maybe should withdraw in the interest of unity in the party .
Sims :
Oh , I didnt say that .
Scher : I know you didnt , thats why I m reading between the lines and putting words in your mouth to get you to be a little more specific .
You re not changing your vote yet , is what you said .
Sims : Yeah , I m not changing it yet .
Scher :
But you may because of the interest of unity for the party ?
Sims : Because I want a , uh and theres issues about when that takes place .
I think the delegates are going to be talking to each other , especially when the convention comes , and saying ,  What outcomes do we want ? 
Because both candidates are going to come into the convention without enough delegates to put them over the top .
Scher : Unless the superdelegates move sooner .
You re going to wait till the convention ?
Sims :
There s issues to me .
I want Michigan seated , and I want Florida seated , before the convention and not at the convention .
Scher : Allright , well debate this one again .
You superdelegates are just going to dangle it in front of us for a while .
Ron Sims is King County Executive .

Technology reporter , BBC News website
The iPlayer has been a big hit with users A row about who should pay for extra network costs incurred by the iPlayer has broken out between internet service providers ( ISPs ) and the BBC .
ISPs say the on - demand TV service is putting strain on their networks , which need to be upgraded to cope .
Ashley Highfield , head of future media and technology at the corporation , has said he believes the cost of network upgrades should be carried by ISPs .
Simon Gunter , from ISP Tiscali , said the BBC should contribute to the cost .
He said the BBC did not understand the issues involved .
' Bit odd '
The popular iPlayer service lets users download or stream programmes to a PC .
In its first three months more than 42 m programmes have been accessed via the catch - up TV service .
According to figures from regulator Ofcom it will cost ISPs in the region of £ 830 m to pay for the extra capacity needed to allow for services like the iPlayer .
Mr Gunter is leading the call for the BBC to help pay for the rising costs .
" The question is about whether we invest in extra capacity or go to the consumer and ask them to pay a BBC tax , " he said .
Bandwidth problems Mr Highfield told the BBC's Today programme such " inflammatory " comments were not helpful .
" The success of the iPlayer should be of benefit to the whole UK broadband industry , increasing those who want to take up broadband , " he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In his BBC blog last week Mr Highfield laid out a 19 - point plan of action for ISPs , and warned they should not try to charge content providers .
" Content providers , if they find their content being specifically squeezed , shaped , or capped , could start to indicate on their sites which ISPs their content works best on ( and which to avoid ) . "
In response Mr Gunter said it was a " bit rich that a publicly - funded organisation is telling a commercial body how to run its business " .
" Inflammatory comments about blacklisting ISPs do not help .
There seems to be a lack of understanding about how networks are built .
Either we are not explaining it properly or it is falling on deaf ears , " he added .
So - called traffic throttling has long been controversial and has been used by ISPs to control those users who eat up bandwidth by downloading huge amounts of material from often illegal file - sharing sites .
But the BBC's iPlayer service has changed the nature of the problem .
" The iPlayer has come along and made downloading a legal and mass market activity , " said Michael Phillips , from broadband comparison service broadbandchoices.co.uk .
He said he believed ISPs were partly to blame for the bandwidth problems they now face .
Inflammatory comments about blacklisting ISPs do not help
Simon Gunter , Tiscali " They have priced themselves as cheaply as possible on the assumption that people were just going to use e-mail and do a bit of web surfing , " he said .
ISPs needed to stop using the term ' unlimited ' to describe their services and make it clear that if people wanted to watch hours of downloaded video content they would have to pay a higher tariff , he added .
He said he believed the BBC needed to compromise .
" There has been talk , for instance , of the BBC bringing their servers into the loop as a way of lowering the backhaul costs , " he said .
But Mr Gunter said he was not convinced this would help .
" I have heard that the BBC is working on building a caching infrastructure so that storage devices can go on an ISP 's network but even if it goes ahead it does n't save costs on the backhaul network , " he said .
Gridlock warning Geoff Bennett , director of product marketing at optical equipment maker Infinera , said he believed the government should broker a deal between the BBC and ISPs .
While allowing BBC content to be ' cached ' by ISPs might be an instant fix to the problem it may not be the answer as more on - demand , bandwidth heavy applications come online , he said .
" There is a broader issue about the downloading of content and this requires an increase in the pipe where the bottleneck is occurring , " he said .
This would mean upgrades in the so - called backhaul or second mile network , he said .
" The industry has talked a lot about upgrading the last mile network with fibre to the home but the question needs to be asked about whether we should upgrade the second mile .
The price of this would be ten times less , " he said .
Some reports , including one from US analyst firm Nemertes Research , have warned of net gridlock as early as 2010 as networks struggle to cope with the amount of data being carried on them .
But the BBC believes that the growth is " manageable " , said Mr Highfield .
" We estimate that currently the iPlayer is having between 3 - 5 % impact on the network , " he said .

GRAND RAPIDS — After Aquinas College canceled a presentation by philosopher and gay - rights advocate John Corvino , a group of students now is looking for an independent venue to host the speaker .
Corvino 's presentation " What 's Morally Wrong with Homosexuality ? " was scheduled last week at the college , but administrators postponed it until April 22 after receiving complaints .
Aquinas President Ed Balog canceled the event Thursday , saying the Catholic school cannot endorse a program that directly opposes church teachings .
" I 'm not trying to keep people from seeing him .
I 'm trying to prevent the college from sponsoring an event that displays an attack on Catholic teaching values , " Balog said .
The cancellation came a week before Pope Benedict XVI 's scheduled meeting with more than 200 Catholic school officials from across the country .
The gathering Thursday , at Catholic University in Washington , D.C. , is being called a lecture , but Vatican watchers predict it will be an admonishment that teaching and activities at U.S. Catholic colleges and universities more closely adhere to church orthodoxy .
Video excerpts from John Corvino's speech " What 's Morally Wrong with Homosexuality ? "
Church officials wo n't give details about the content of the speech , but conservative Catholics are predicting , and hoping for , shock waves from Benedict , who before becoming pope was associated with public reprimands of Catholic theologians and blocked appointments of university faculty members he thought were too liberal .
" One thing the pope will emphasize is the importance for all ( Catholic ) schools to realize that they are n't independent contractors , they are part of the church , " said the Rev. David O'Connell , Catholic University 's president .
He said the Vatican is concerned about the lack of Catholic faculty at Catholic universities and about rampant " moral relativism " -- the belief that there is no objective right or wrong -- on campuses .
According to Corvino's Web site , the Wayne State University philosophy professor " challenges all sides of the debate to rethink easy assumptions about homosexuality . "
He has been speaking out on gay rights for 15 years , and has spoken on other Catholic campuses .
Some Aquinas students said they are upset about the way administrators handled the issue .
It has sparked an online debate in some parts of the community .
Tree Top Productions , an Aquinas student programming group , set up Corvino 's visit and said it was approved by an adviser .
" The programming board had been actively advertising since January and they canceled the morning of the event .
It was very disrespectful to Corvino , and to the students that wanted to hear him speak , " said junior Bev Pels , 21 .
" I think they 're not bringing him because there 's so much outside pressure .
It 's not that the administration is homophobic , but the policy appears to be that way and it 's alienating to students . "
She said organizers are hoping to find a new , off - campus venue that can seat up to 70 people .
Corvino has offered to speak for free .
Rebecca Kirk , 19 , of Sturgis , was upset by the college 's decision because , she said , Aquinas is known for being more open - minded than some private schools .
" We want to bring him ... so people can hear what he has to say , " Kirk said .
" The best way to get someone interested in hearing someone is by censoring him . "
Sophomore Anna Thiakos , 20 , agreed .
" It 's important that free speech is n't censored and that we address the problem of homophobia in our community , whether it 's from a secular or religious point of view . "
Balog said he was n't familiar with Corvino 's work until the day before the event .
The school initially had hoped to provide a follow - up speaker to present the church 's point of view on the issue .
But after reviewing some of Corvino 's presentation , in which he talks about a " sexual act " condemned by the church , they decided against that .
" We want to explore the issue from an academic perspective , not from the perspective of an antagonistic attack to core Catholic values , " Balog said .
Asked whether he was pressured by Bishop Walter Hurley to cancel the event , he said , " No .
He was one of the many people that wanted to ask for clarification . "
Other U.S. bishops have slammed various events at colleges in their dioceses as violating Catholic doctrine : a rally by abortion rights supporter and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton at St. Mary 's University in San Antonio ; a Georgetown University theologian 's questioning whether Jesus offers the only road to salvation ; and a performance of " The Vagina Monologues " at the University of Notre Dame .

Who would be a child or teenager today ?
They even mistime their coming - of - age , apparently .
" I think children act like adults at an alarmingly early age , " said Dame Jacqueline Wilson , who has sold more than 30 million books .
Her remarks came as a poll by her publisher suggested that more than half of parents believe childhood is now over by 11 .
But a glance through recent history shows that adults have long raised concerns about children " growing up " too quickly .
Did they always ?
EDWARDIAN
Clothes were Victorian - style and heavy fabrics restricted movement
This added to a feeling of a moral and physical decline among the youth , and was compounded by recruitment problems for the Boer War .
The Boy Scout movement was founded in an effort to address that .
The constant threat to children of a thrashing meant parents and teachers wielded great power .
Physical punishment was considered to be a matter of duty towards the child , says a spokeswoman for the Museum of Childhood in London .
" A surprising number of children got away with things like scrumping apples and placing booby traps .
But disobedience or defiance of authority , whether of parent , teacher , or any other adult was also taken particularly seriously , and likely to lead to moral reproach as well as physical punishment . "
They were abstaining [ from sex ] for a number of reasons , such as social pressure and lack of opportunity
Lesley Hall
Author
" There was quite a problem with truanting and some worked after school on the land or in a business , " he says .
" And there was a group left out , probably working in sweatshops . "
Lesley Hall , author of Sex , Gender and Social Change , says a lot of young boys were being employed in dead - end jobs like messaging because they were not old enough to have proper apprenticeships and there was anxiety that they were hanging around street corners smoking .
Under -age smoking is nothing new
" They were abstaining [ from sex ] for a number of reasons , such as social pressure and lack of opportunity .
Children were less free and able to go their own way .
People lived in neighbourhoods where everyone knew what was going on .
There was a certain amount of community policing that we do n't get now . "
But that 's not to say they were n't interested .
The " monkey - walk " was a pre-courtship ritual common among 14 and 15 year olds , which enabled mingling of the sexes in a collective way .
Members of the lower classes would go to some part of town and there the boys would hang around and watch and the girls walk past .
INTERWAR
Carefree days
About 1,000 middle class children attended the first clinic in about 1925 and paved the way for the provision of one in every local authority area under the 1944 Education Act.
Susan Isaacs , a pioneer in education psychology , wrote Nursery World , which advised middle - class parents on rearing children .
Meanwhile Sir Cyril Burt and John Bowlby advanced understanding of juvenile delinquency .
POSTWAR
" The militarised society was gradually fading and with it the hierarchy and deference that characterised it .
And a key shift in the child - parent dynamic came in this period , says Hugh Cunningham , author of The Invention of Childhood .
Post - war Britain was one big playground
The word " teenager " was coined in 1941 and by the early 50s the concept of the sexually - charged , rebellious youngster emerged through the likes of Marlon Brando in The Wild One .
Despite perceptions to the contrary , not a lot has changed to teenage sexuality since the 1950s , especially for boys , says sex psychologist Dr Petra Boynton .
What 's altered since the 50s is that then women were more likely to be virgins when they married but now they are getting married later and having their sexual experiences beforehand . "
60s & 70s
The start of the age of mass - consumption marked another moral panic , this time about the influence rock ' n ' roll was having on young people .
There was a newly - emancipated working - class in the 60s , and young people had cash and optimism in abundance .
The runaway success of Dr Benjamin Spock 's self - help book , Baby and Childcare , helped renew enthusiasm , mainly in the US but also in the UK , for strengthening the family , against the then pervasive Communist threat .
" The nuclear family for people like John Bowlby [ a British psychoanalyst noted for his work in child development ] and Benjamin Spock represented the best of liberal democracy .
It would be a happy place and a place of affluence and would stand against agitators . "
But 1973 , and the economic downturn , was a year when for the first time people became pessimistic and not optimistic about childhood , says Cunningham .
" Until then there was a clear agenda which dominated public discourse that we were making life better for children - the welfare state , NHS and education - but in the 70s we began to lose that confidence and now we never see optimism in reports about childhood . "
80s TO PRESENT
Since the mid-90s the internet , lads mags and an abundance of sexual imagery through TV and video has created a more sexual culture for young people , says Boynton .
But it 's an aspirational not an educational version of sex that increases anxiety .
It makes the whole question of when childhood ends very difficult because dependency is regarded a sign of childhood
Hugh Cunningham
A survey last week found that most adults believed children 's well - being was being damaged because childhood had become too commercial .
In the early 20th Century they were targeted by Meccano and teddy manufacturers , now it 's iPods and mobile phones on their wish - list .
But this love of things shiny and new has lent them a unlikely new authority as effective gatekeepers , over their adult parents , to the perplexing world of home entertainment technologies .
Yet the focus on home entertainment has also been a result of children being kept indoors .
Used to be sand castles , now sand phones
Parents now subsidise their children to a very late age , in a way unprecedented in history , says Cunningham , buying them houses in their 20s and 30s .
" This is a reverse from the normal flow of money from children to parents .
It makes the whole question of when childhood ends very difficult because dependency is regarded a sign of childhood . "
Far from growing up too fast , he says , they do n't grow up fast enough .
Two weeks into a Federal Communications Commission public comment period on whether Comcast deliberately degrades P2P broadband traffic , there 's no shortage of angry users who feel cheated and want the tampering to stop .
Evidence is also mounting that Comcast is blocking more than just P2P traffic .
" On numerous occasions , my access to legal BitTorrent files was cut off by Comcast , " a systems administrator based in Indianapolis wrote to the FCC shortly after the proceeding began .
" During this period , I managed to troubleshoot all other possible causes of this issue , and it was my conclusion ( speaking as a competent IT administrator ) that this could only be occurring due to direct action at the ISP ( Comcast ) level . "
The comment cycle began on January 14 .
It came at the request of net neutrality advocates whose petition to the FCC cited an Associated Press investigation concluding that in some instances Comcast " hindered file sharing by subscribers who used BitTorrent . "
The cable giant claims that it has delayed access when usage was high , but has not deliberately singled out any sites or services .
But Free Press , Public Knowledge and others groups want the Commission to issue a declaratory ruling on whether the practices with which Comcast and others have been charged violate the FCC's Internet policy statement .
That declaration , issued in August of 2005 , said that the FCC " has jurisdiction necessary to ensure that providers of telecommunications for Internet access or Internet Protocol - enabled ( IP - enabled ) services are operated in a neutral manner . "
So far most of the filers in this proceeding have written their own comments rather than rely on Web auto forms .
They say they want the Commission to find out what Comcast is really up to .
" If you so much as open a BitTorrent client on a computer on the Comcast network , your entire connection drops to almost a crawl , " one filer complains .
" Comcast is throttling my connection speed when I am transferring files from work to home , " another reports .
" They are also interrupting my connections . "
And a third : " I have experienced this throttling of bandwidth in sharing open - source software , e.g. Knoppix and Open Office .
Also I see considerable differences in speed ftp sessions vs. html .
They are obviously limiting speed in ftp as well . "
And a fourth : " Late during the summer of 2007 , I experienced that Comcast 's Bandwidth throttling system was affecting Lotus Notes traffic .
Several users at my company experienced an inability to communicate with our Lotus Notes email servers if they were uploading over 1 mb of data .
This problem caused a lot of headache for my company . "
Some commenters corroborate charges that the ISP inserts RST packets — the equivalent of a telephone hangup signal — into large file streams that the company does n't like .
" I believe that Comcast Communications is using an application called Sandvine to insert a proverbial ' dial tone ' into a data stream , " a commenter writes .
" There are security measures put in place to prevent a hacker from sneaking data into a data stream , but as Comcast can monitor those streams they can perfectly forge an RST packet that will be interpreted as coming from the other party . "
Another filer agrees :
" I personally feel that Comcast is inserting RST packets into other TCP protocols , not just BitTorrent , " he writes .
" We run a custom chat server on port 2001 .
The connection will never stay up for longer than an hour before the connection is reset .
A year or so earlier , this was never the case , and our connection would stay up for days on end .
When the traffic is encrypted ( in an SSH tunnel ) , the connection stays up , fine . "
Ditto , says yet another sysop :
" I suggest that they have selected specific ports that are known to carry sustained high bandwidth traffic and destinations or origins that could not possibly afford to enforce a restraining order and limited that traffic as best they could by rewriting packets to disturb the flow of traffic . "
And several filers argue that Comcast 's alleged practices already fall under the jurisdiction of a federal law : the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
" I suspect that violating criminal law is sufficient reason for the FCC to regulate Comcast 's actions , " one supporter of this argument writes .
" Need we also mention false advertising , and terminating users accounts for passing an invisible and undocumented monthly bandwidth quota ? "
Others are less certain of how exactly the FCC or the courts should regulate Comcast 's ISP behavior , but they are sure that the Commission - or somebody - should force the company to be honest with consumers about its practices .
" If Comcast 's technology is unable to meet the demands of its users and Comcast is forced to slow popular traffic , then maybe they are over - selling the service , " a commenter says .
" This calls into question their advertising model .
If they advertise X rates , but only delivery Y rates , then it should be sold as Y . "
Another consumer argues that honesty would only be fair , given that " in many places , Comcast ( and other cable companies ) may be the only high speed provider as DSL is not always available .
Until competing services such as Verizon FIOS can reach out , many users are stuck with this level of service . "
" I do n't like the idea of making an example out of them [ Comcast ] , " he concludes , " but a hefty fine and requiring them to publish their bandwidth caps may mitigate much of this down the road . "
Comcast has yet to file a response to any of these user complaints and suggestions .
The corporation will probably wait until the comment period of the proceeding ends and the reply - to - comments window opens on February 14th .
February 28 will be the last day to participate in this proceeding .
The docket number is 07 - 52 .
Would you like to voice your opinions without bystanders listening ?
Are you afraid of your lips being read ?
Do you think that those with speaking disabilities should be able to voice out their thoughts ?
Whether you are a spy , a telemarketer , have speaking disabilities , or a regular Joe that uses the phone on a daily basis , this new development could make your life a lot simpler .
Ambient Corporation has created a method which recognizes words and phrases by the use of a neckband called Audeo .
By patience and training , the Audeo can pick up nerve signals of specific words and phrases , wirelessly send them to a computer , which will voice out the actual conversation in a computerized tone .
They claim that an individual would not have to worry about inner- thoughts being translated and spoken , since it deserves “ higher ” effort ; the user must think specifically of the words he / she would like translated .
A successful demonstration was produced of this system using a limited vocabulary of 150 words .
Ambient has mentioned though , that a full vocabulary should be available with the Audeo by the end of the year .
To voice out our thoughts is a major advancement in communication .
Besides the additional discretion it provides , it could assist many with disabilities as well .
For example , it could help the handicapped control their wheelchairs , and also enable them to literally voice their opinions and thoughts .
If available for you to use , would you like to try out the Audeo System ?

Is this Democracy or what ?
by
Press reports on the recent New Jersey voting discrepancies have been a bit vague about the exact nature of the evidence that showed up on election day .
What has the county clerks , and many citizens , so concerned ?
Today I want to show you some of the evidence .
The evidence is a “ summary tape ” printed by a Sequoia AVC Advantage voting machine in Hillside , New Jersey when the polls closed at the end of the presidential primary election .
The tape is timestamped 8:02 PM , February 5 , 2008 .
The summary tape is printed by poll workers as part of the ordinary procedure for closing the polls .
It is signed by several poll workers and sent to the county clerk along with other records of the election .
Let me show you closeups of two sections of the tape .
( Here ’s the full tape , in TIF format . )
Above you can see the vote totals on this machine for each candidate .
On the Democratic side , the tally is Obama 182 , Clinton 179 .
On the Republican side it ’s Giuliani 1 , Romney 13 , McCain 40 , Paul 3 , Huckabee 4 .
Above is the “ Option Switch Totals ” section , which shows the number of times each party ’s ballot was activated : 362 Democratic and 60 Republican .
This does n’t add up .
The machine says the Republican ballot was activated 60 times ; but it shows a total of 61 votes cast for Republican candidates .
It says the Democratic ballot was activated 362 times ; but it shows a total of 361 votes for Democratic candidates .
( New Jersey has a closed primary , so voters can cast ballots only in their own registered party . )
What ’s alarming here is not the size of the discrepancy but its nature .
This is a single voting machine , disagreeing with itself about how many Republicans voted on it .
Imagine your pocket calculator could n’t make up its mind whether 1+13+40+3+4 was 60 or 61 .
You ’d be pretty alarmed , and you would n’t trust your calculator until you were very sure it was fixed .
Or you ’d get a new calculator .
This was n’t an isolated instance , either .
In Union County alone , at least eight other AVC Advantage machines exhibited similar problems , as did dozens more machines in other counties .
Sequoia , the vendor , is trying to prevent any independent investigation of what happened .
Tomorrow : Sequoia ’s story about how this happened , and why it ’s inadequate .
UPDATE ( March 20 ) : We now have copies of nine anomalous tapes , including the one shown above .
They ’re on our New Jersey voting documents page .
Kosovo's New Chapter Fury and Tension Grip Europe 's Newest Country

At the end of August 2007 , J. MAYER H. Architects completed the project â€ žAn der Alster 1â€œ .
The design for the office building is the result of a limited competion by the investor Cogiton in 2006 .
The building site is situated at the intersection between the Hamburgâ€™s lively downtown and its urban landscape rich in water and mature trees .
It is at the transition from city to nature , and the gateway building to the bustling metropolitan core .
The horizontal striped facade with its floating â€˜eyesâ€™ celebrates the view onto this unique context .
A public park in front of the building continues the design strategy of the facade into the landscape .
The â€˜eyesâ€™ in the faÃ§ade and the platforms in the park form places to meet and contemplate .
The office spaces serve both a generic spatial layout and specific moments related to the â€˜eyesâ€™ .
Large spans provide for various office layout configurations in combination with balconies and climatically tempered outdoor spaces of the â€˜eyesâ€™ .
The office building â€ ˜An der Alster 1â€™ links interior and exterior spaces to the public park in front of the building and to the city context of Hamburg , becoming a new anchor at the prestigious Aussenalster waterfront .

“ The Wire is a Greek tragedy in which the postmodern institutions are the Olympian forces .
It ’s the police department , or the drug economy , or the political structures , or the school administration , or the macroeconomic forces that are throwing the lightning bolts and hitting people in the ass for no decent reason . ”

The Pentagon used a missile to shoot down the satellite
Enlarge Image
Operatives had only a 10 - second window to hit the satellite - USA 193 - which went out of control shortly after it was launched in December 2006 .
Officials were worried its hydrazine fuel could do harm , but it is not yet known if the fuel tank was destroyed .
The controversial operation has been criticised by China and Russia .
On Thursday , China called on the US to provide more information about the mission .
Russia suspects the operation was a cover to test anti-satellite technology under the US missile defence programme .
The US denies the operation was a response to an anti-satellite test carried out by China last year , which prompted fears of a space arms race .
Precision needed
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says this operation was hugely ambitious .
BROKEN SATELLITE
Owner : National Reconnaissance Office Mission : Classified Launched : 14 Dec 2006 Weight : 2,300 kg ( 5,000lbs ) 1,134kg ( 2,500lbs ) could survive re-entry Carrying hydrazine thruster fuel
The operation went ahead hours after the space shuttle Atlantis landed , removing it as a safety issue for the military .
The satellite - believed by some commentators to be a radar imaging reconnaissance satellite - was passing about 130 nautical miles ( 250 km ) over the Pacific .
Earlier the military said it would use an SM - 3 missile fired from the cruiser USS Lake Erie , which is posted on the western side of Hawaii along with the destroyers USS Decatur and USS Russell .
But it is not yet known how successful the operation was - the missile needed to pierce the bus-sized satellite 's fuel tank , containing more than 450kg ( 1,000lbs ) of toxic hydrazine , which would otherwise be expected to survive re-entry .
The Pentagon said confirmation that the fuel tank has been hit should be available within 24 hours .
US officials said without an attempt to destroy the fuel tank , and with the satellite 's thermal control system gone , the fuel would now be frozen solid , allowing the tank to resist the heat of re-entry .
If the tank were to land intact , it could leak toxic gas over a wide area - harming or killing humans if inhaled , officials had warned .
Debris
Officials expect that over 50 % of the debris will fall to Earth within the first 15 hours after the strike - or within its first two revolutions of Earth .
USA 193 lost control a few hours after launch on a Delta II rocket
Left to its own devices , about half of the spacecraft would have been expected to survive the blazing descent through the atmosphere , scattering debris in a defined " corridor " which runs across the Earth 's surface .
Professor Richard Crowther , a space debris expert with the Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , said that if struck with the missile , about 25 % of USA 193 is likely to survive the fall to Earth .
" The smaller the debris is the more likely you are to get burn - through .
So if you fragment something before re-entry , less mass will survive to hit the Earth , " he told BBC News .
Russian suspicion
But Russia 's defence ministry has effectively branded the US operation a cover for testing an anti-satellite weapon .
The Russian defence ministry argued that various countries ' spacecraft had crashed to Earth in the past , with many using toxic fuel on board , but that this had never before merited " extraordinary measures " .
A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing , Liu Jianchao , said China was concerned about the " possible damage to security in outer space and to other countries " .
" We demand that the US ... swiftly brief the international community with necessary data and information in time , so that relevant countries can take preventative measures , " he said .
Last year , China carried out a test using a ground - based ballistic missile to destroy a satellite in space , prompting international alarm and fears of a space arms race .
On Tuesday , a US State Department spokesman stressed that the action was meant to protect people from the hazardous fuel and was not a weapons test .
The US government has also denied claims that the main aim of the operation was to destroy secret components on USA 193 .
Officials say classified parts would be burned up in the atmosphere and , in any case , that would not be a reason for shooting down the satellite .
Kirsten Dunst Not Doing So Hot
The latest actress to hit the rehab trail isand sources say that she is n't doing so great .
Although Kirsten has been in the headlines many times for her carefree partying ways , it was n't an intervention that coaxed her into treatment , but rather some nudges .
Kunst has played the role of Mary Jane Watson in the Spiderman series .
She was nominated by the National Movie Awards UK in the Best Actress category .
She is currently working on How to Lose Friends and Alienate People .
She has also signed on for another upcoming role in All Good Things , a film that is still in pre-production .
In the wake of Heath Ledger 's death , there are many stars who are taking a closer look at their lifestyles and trying to decide what they can do to get control of their personal situations .
Kirsten is receiving help with her addiction issues at Cirque Lodge Treatment Center , in Utah .
Other stars who have also stayed at Cirque are Lindsay Lohan , Richie Sambora and Eva Mendes , who actually just checked out of the facility .
Good luck to Kirsten .
We wish her the best !
Is the " Surprise Attack " on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 – which resulted in a significant loss of Americans lives – relevant to understanding the events of September 11 ?
According to American historian and Pulitzer prize winner , John Toland , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had " prior knowledge " of the attack . . . and failed to act .
" A massive cover - up followed Pearl Harbor a few days later ... when the Chief of Staff ordered a lid put on the affair .
‘ Gentlemen , ' he told half a dozen officers , ‘ this goes to the grave with us . ' "

On December 7 of last year , America ‘ celebrated ' the Sixtieth Anniversary of Pearl Harbor .
On that date in history — often referred to as " a day of infamy " — a surprise attack was staged by the Japanese on the American naval base in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii .
Heavy American casualties were inflicted on those based on the island outpost which lay halfway between the United States and Japan .
The devastation aroused the anger of the American people .
Soon afterwards , the U.S. government declared war on Japan and Germany and joined the Allies in World War Two .
A Day of Infamy
According to historian , John Toland , " The events of Sunday morning , December 7 , 1941 , have always been shrouded in mystery .
Japanese bombs had scarcely stopped falling on Pearl Harbor before shocked and angry Americans were calling for an investigation of the catastrophe , one of the most sudden and complete defeats in United States history .
Within weeks , Franklin D. Roosevelt had appointed a blue - ribbon committee , headed by Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts , to look into the events leading up to the Japanese attack .
Its judgment placed the blame on the Hawaiian commanders , General Short and Admiral Kimmel , in spite of much contradictory evidence .
" Their disgrace aroused a storm of controversy .
Pleading a wartime need for secrecy , the government kept a tight lid on the facts surrounding the Pearl Harbor disaster .
There were rumors of a whitewash , and knowledgeable crypt- analysts talked of a Japanese order given in the highly classified Purple Code ( which , under extreme security wraps , the United States had been decoding for years ) .
The so - called " winds execute " signal , they said , had warned Washington of imminent attack — a warning never passed on to Hawaii .
" Eight more investigations followed , during and after the war , as partisans on both sides — field officers versus the Washington establishment — traded sensational and sometimes incredible assertions , accusations , and denials .
Witnesses changed their testimony under pressure ; files were destroyed or ‘ mislaid ' ; and key government figures ‘ forgot ' where they were , what they said , and what they did in the crucial hours preceding the attack . "
INFAMY , by John Toland , raises and answers some important questions about Pearl Harbor .
Was there prior knowledge ?
Why were commanding officers Short and Kimmel not informed of an impending attack ?
Could Roosevelt have known of the approaching carrier force and decided not to act ?
Could the Americans have ambushed the Japanese and shortened the war ?
According to Toland , the Roosevelt administration had foreknowledge of Japan 's military plans .
Prior Warning
" Confirmation of Dutch foreknowledge of the Japanese attack also came from General Albert C. Wedemeyer .
In 1980 he informed the author that during a meeting in 1943 , Vice Admiral Conrad E. L. Helfrich of the Royal Netherlands Navy expressed wonder that the Americans had been surprised at Pearl Harbor .
The Dutch , Helfrich said , had broken the code and knew that the Japanese were going to strike Pearl Harbor .
" He seemed surprised that I did not know this , " recalled Wedemeyer , " and when I explained that I doubted seriously that this information was known in Washington prior to Pearl Harbor attack , Admiral Helfrich was skeptical because it was his clear recollection that his government had notified my government . " ( p. 317 - 318 )
" Vice Admiral Conrad E. L. Helfrich of the Royal Netherlands Navy expressed wonder that the Americans had been surprised at Pearl Harbor .
The Dutch , Helfrich said ... knew that the Japanese were going to strike Pearl Harbor ... it was his clear recollection that his government had notified [ the U.S. ] government . "
" By December 4 , Roosevelt and a small group of advisers , including Stimson , Knox and Marshall , were faced with three options .
They could announce to Japan and the world word of the approaching Kido Butai [ the Japanese fleet ] ; this would indubitably have forced the Japanese to turn back .
Second , they could inform Kimmel and Short that Japanese carriers were northwest of Hawaii and order them to send every available long - range patrol plane to discover this force .
An attack conceived in such secrecy would necessarily depend on complete surprise for success , and once discovered out of range of its target , Kido Butai would have turned back ... " A month before the Hull ultimatum to Japan , Ickes had written in his diary : ‘ For a long time I have believed that our best entrance into the war would be by way of Japan . '
The first bomb dropped on Oahu would have finally solved the problem of getting an America — half of whose people wanted peace — into the crusade against Hitler .
And the third option would accomplish this : keep Kimmel and Short and all but a select few in ignorance so that the Japanese could continue to their launching point unaware of their discovery .
This would insure that the Japanese would launch their attack .
If Kimmel , Short and others had been privy to the secret , they might possibly have reacted in such a way as to reveal to the Japanese that their attack plan was known . " ( p. 318 )
" One of Knox 's close friends , James G. Stahlman , wrote Admiral Kemp Tolley in 1973 that Knox had spent most of the night of December 6 at the White House with the President :
All were waiting for what they knew was coming : an attack on Pearl Harbor . " ( p. 320 )
" There , therefore , can be no question that between the dates of December 4 and December 6 , the imminence of war on the following Saturday and Sunday , December 6 and 7 , was clear - cut and definite ...
" Up to the morning of December 7 , 1941 , everything that the Japanese were planning to do was known to the United States except the final message instructing the Japanese Embassy to present the 14th part together with the preceding 13 parts of the long message at one o‘clock on December 7 , or the very hour and minute when bombs were falling on Pearl Harbor . " ( p. 108 )
Cover - Up ?
" A massive cover - up followed Pearl Harbor a few days later , according to an officer close to Marshall , when the Chief of Staff ordered a lid put on the affair .
‘ Gentlemen , ' he told half a dozen officers , ‘ this goes to the grave with us . ' " ( p. 321 )
Three years later , after the Army Pearl Harbor Board and Navy Inquiry announced its findings , one man from Rhode Island summed up the feelings of the American people :
" The Government 's cover - up of the responsibility for that catastrophe has done more to undermine morale than any other single event of the past three years .
The thinkers of America , and there are millions of them , wo n't stand for such guff .
I am but one of the millions of Americans today who are shocked , humiliated and indignant because of this announcement . " ( p. 130 )
" But there was little doubt in knowledgeable Washington circles that the navy would find it all top secret and the Pearl Harbor cover - up would continue . " ( p. 109 )
And the cover - up continues to this day .
Witness the plethora of Hollywood videos , history books and media coverage which say nothing of the real story behind Pearl Harbor .
But history has its own way of painting its victims .
On his death , President Roosevelt was described by one who knew him well as " a man who never told the truth if a lie would suffice . " ( p. 134 ) John O'Donnell in the New York Daily News wrote , " The evidence builds up to the simple brutal fact that F.D.R. , the Big Brain , through blind stupidity ... was directly and personally responsible for the blood and disaster . " ( p. 160 )
Pearl Harbor ... Operation Northwoods ... September 11
Is it possible that history is repeating itself now ?
I only raise the question , because there are so many questions that remain unanswered concerning the events of September 11 .
In the words of philosopher and poet George Santayana ,
" Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
The evidence presented by John Toland suggests that Pearl Harbor was a crisis created by the U.S. government on December 7 , 1941 to manipulate public opinion and sway the American people into going to war .

A fresh batch of data on Friday presented a bleak picture of the economy , with rising prices of imported goods , struggling manufacturing and an erosion in consumer confidence .
With the price of oil near record levels , import costs grew in January at the highest annual rate in a quarter century , the Labor Department said .
In New York , manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level in five years .
And consumers , responding to a national survey , said they felt worse about the economy than any time since the recession era of the early 1990s .
“ This is just horrible , ” wrote Ian Shepherdson , the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics , a research firm .
“ The sustained volatility in the markets , the rise in energy and food prices and , of course , the catastrophe in the housing market , is making consumers extraordinarily miserable . ”
The price of imports rose 1.7 percent in January and was up 13.7 year over year , the highest annual rate since the Labor Department records began in 1983 .
Fuel costs led the rise , ballooning by 5.5 percent last month .
Imported food and beverages also cost more in January , and the price of Chinese goods ticked up by 0.8 percent .
Export prices rose 1.2 percent , and American companies are also charging more for food , industrial supplies , and agricultural products .
Atheist - materialist Dr. Steven Novella is confident : all of our experiences and awareness arise from brain matter .
There is no soul , no immaterial mind , separate from the brain itself .
According to Dr. Novella , a neurologist at Yale , the debate is over , and all that is left to do is to eradicate a few stubborn pockets of resistance to the theory that the mind is merely a secretion of the brain , just as bile is a secretion of the liver .
Dr. Novella declares :
The materialist hypothesis– that the brain causes consciousness — has made a number of predictions , and every single prediction has been validated .
A bit of advice : whenever a scientist says of his own theory that “ every single prediction has been validated ’ , you ’re being had .
No scientific theory has had ‘ every single prediction ’ validated .
All theories accord with evidence in some ways , and are inconsistent in others .
Successful scientific theories prevail on the preponderance of the evidence , not validation of “ every single prediction ” .
Real science lacks the precision of ideology .
Both dualists and materialists recognize that matter influences the mind .
Wine affects dualists just as it does materialists .
The difference in viewpoint is this : dualists propose that the mind is in part caused by matter , and in part caused by something else .
Mental causation is dual .
Materialists believe that the mind is entirely caused by matter .
There is nothing else .
Who ’s right ?
We do n’t know for sure , but over the past century we ’ve learned an enormous amount about the brain , and we ’ve come to see that the materialistic model of the mind has enormous evidentiary problems .
The materialist theory makes quite a number of predictions that Dr. Novella elides .
An example will suffice :
Dr. Novella assets that
“ Every single question that can be answered scientifically – with observation and evidence …has been resolved in favor of that hypothesis [ strict materialism ] ”
No .
It is true that over the past century we have studied the electrochemistry , neuroanatomy , and molecular biology of the brain in remarkable detail , and our modern fund of knowledge of brain structure and function , even down to the molecular level , is vast .
What is genuinely remarkable is what has n’t been found , and it ’s a real problem for materialism .
Consider this : if the mind arises entirely from the brain , materialism predicts that there must be a specific material cause for each mental state .
That is , a specific mental state must be a specific brain state , nothing more or less .
For example , if I am thinking “ the White House is in Washington , D.C. ” , there must be a specific arrangement of molecules and neurons and action potentials in my brain that are the thought itself .
In the materialistic paradigm , please understand , matter does n’t just correlate with the thought ; matter is the thought .
Materialism is the proposition that all things are material , including thoughts .
Every time I think “ the White House is in Washington D.C. ” , there must exist in my brain that exact configuration of matter : 2,433 neurons with x concentration of acetylcholine located in 87,456 dendrites arrayed in a discrete geometrical pattern with action potentials precisely defined .
That exact configuration is the thought .
If I had a different configuration of matter– any difference – I would have a different thought .
If each mental state is a brain state , then this reduction must hold for every thought .
This is a straightforward prediction of materialism .
We have a vast knowledge of neuroscience .
Yet what is the scientific evidence supporting this most fundamental prediction of materialism– that every thought is reducible at the molecular level to a discrete and unique brain state ?
There is n’t a shred of evidence that any discrete mental state– any specific thought– can be reduced at the molecular level to a unique material brain state .
Not a shred .
The materialistic hypothesis creates even more problems .
Imagine that Dr. Novella and I are both simultaneously thinking “ the White House is in Washington , D.C. ” .
Do we both simultaneously have exactly the same brain state , defined in terms as acetylcholine , dendrites , etc . ?
If the thought “ the White House is in Washington , D.C. ” is entirely a material state of the brain , do we all have exactly the same state in our different brains when we think the same thought ?
No two human brains are identical .
If thoughts are merely brain states , and completely reducible to them , how can identical thoughts arise in different brains ?
It will do no good for Dr. Novella to fudge .
He might say ‘ mind states are emergent properties of matter , yet they are not rigidly linked to measurable properties of matter ’.
‘ Emergence ’ is a popular materialist circumlocution .
If you ’re a materialist , and you do n’t have a clue how something happens , assert ( confidently ) that it ’s an ’ emergent ’ property of matter .
A nice way to deflect the hard questions .
Yet ’ emergence ’ really offers materialists no refuge from the hard questions in the mind - brain problem .
This is why : if each mind state were emergent , and not merely identical with a material state of the brain , then each mind state would be defined in part by something other than the brain .
Thoughts would arise from something in addition to matter .
That ’s a dualist position .
So what ’s Dr. Novella ’s evidence that each thought is completely reducible to one discrete molecular state of the brain ?
Not a shred .
Dr. Novella can’t give even one rigorous scientific description of a mental state– a thought– in terms of a molecular brain state .
In fact , the inability to find a unique material cause adequate to completely account for each mental state is a fundamental prediction of dualism .
In neuroscience , dualism is holding up quite well .
Despite astonishing advances in neurobiology , not one unique material cause of a discrete mental state has been found .
So much for materialism ’s “ every single prediction … ”

24 . May 2007 by enacting a $ 95 billion supplemental appropriation to fund war operations through 30 .

- Wirtschaftskrise ist -
darüber streiten sich die Finanzmarktexperten .

Die " Wirtschaftswoche " zitiert den Aachener Private - Equity - Experten Ralf Fix mit den Worten , für viele Anleger habe sich " ein Tor zur Hölle " geöffnet .
Was dahinter hervorkomme , wisse niemand wirklich .
Auch auf China richten sich die Blicke inzwischen :
Dort leistet sich sei die rapide wachsende Mittelklasse in großem Stil neue Wohnungen - und die Kreditvergabe sei noch laxer als in den USA .
Die chinesischen Banken , die Hypothekenkredite über umgerechnet 289 Milliarden Euro gewährt hätten , nähmen keine Bonitätsprüfungen vor ,
zitierte die Zeitung " South China Morning Post " den Wissenschaftler Yi Xianrong von der chinesischen Akademie der Sozialwissenschaften .
Die Behörden befürchten vor allem in großen Städten wie Shanghai ungezügelte Spekulationen und eine starke Übertreibung bei den Preisen und versuchen daher , den Markt zu zügeln .

Dies ist eine gekürzte Fassung des Originalartikels , den Sie in der aktuellen Ausgabe von " National Geographic " lesen können .
12.Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,druck-497478,00.html
Massen sind nur klug , wenn ihre einzelnen Mitglieder verantwortungsbewusst handeln und eigene Entscheidungen treffen .
Eine Gruppe ist nicht schlau , wenn die Einzelnen einander nachahmen oder warten , bis ihnen jemand sagt , was sie zu tun haben .
Eine intelligente Gruppe - ob aus Ameisen oder Anwälten - ist darauf angewiesen , dass jedes Mitglied seine eigene Rolle spielt .
12.Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,druck-497478,00.html
" Heute denkt eine große Zahl von Menschen gemeinsam nach + das auf eine Weise , die wir noch vor wenigen Jahrzehnten für unmöglich gehalten hätten " ,
sagt Thomas Malone vom kürzlich gegründeten Zentrum für Kollektive Intelligenz in Massachussetts .
" Kein Einzelner kann alles wissen , was wir brauchen , um die Probleme unserer Gesellschaft zu lösen - vom Gesundheitswesen bis zum Klimawandel .
Gemeinsam wissen wir viel mehr . "
12.Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,druck-497478,00.html
Dazu müssen alle unabhängig denken und mit einem neutralen Mechanismus - Abstimmung , Versteigerung oder Durchschnittsbildung - zu einer Entscheidung gelangen .

Tatsächlich profitiert fast jede Gruppe davon , wenn sie solche Regeln befolgt .
Das jedenfalls meint James Surowiecki , Autor des Buchs " Die Weisheit der Vielen - warum Gruppen klüger sind als Einzelne " .
Ein Thema , das große Firmen zunehmend für Managementseminare entdecken .
Schon vor zwei Jahren waren etwa die " Hamburger Trendtage " dem Thema Schwarmintelligenz gewidmet .
Dabei wurden die Teilnehmer mit Aufgaben konfrontiert , die der Einzelne nicht überblickte , die die Gruppe als Gesamtheit aber löste .
12.Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,druck-497478,00.html
Keines der

Wie das funktioniert , darüber hat die Wissenschaft faszinierende Erkenntnisse gewonnen - und beginnt nun , mit ähnlichen Strategien Problemlösungen für die menschliche Gesellschaft zu entwickeln .

Als Individuen sind Ameisen hilflos , aber als Kolonie reagieren sie schnell und effizient auf ihre Umwelt .
Die Fähigkeit dazu nennt man kollektive Intelligenz oder Schwarmintelligenz .

Über die weitere Entwicklung sind sich Marktbeobachter uneins .
Die einen verweisen darauf , dass in den USA noch fast zehn Billionen Dollar Hypothekenkredite ausstehen , davon rund ein Drittel mit schlechter oder zumindest nicht primärer Bonität .

Was dahinter hervorkomme , wisse niemand wirklich .
Mehrere Experten in Deutschland äußerten sich dagegen optimistisch .
So sagte der Wirtschaftsweise Bert Rürup , er sehe noch keine gravierenden Auswirkungen auf die robuste Konjunktur in Deutschland .
" Die Krise wird auf die Finanzmärkte beschränkt bleiben , zumal sich die EZB außerordentlich klug verhält und den Markt ausreichend mit Liquidität versorgt " , sagte Rürup der " Berliner Zeitung " .

Fritz Teufel , Dieter Kunzelmann und Rainer Langhans waren ihre prominentesten Protagonisten , die schöne Uschi Obermaier ihr bis heute unvergessenes Maskottchen .

Eine Frage muss vorerst ungeklärt bleiben :
Wer profitiert eigentlich von dieser Anschmiegsamkeit an die Argumente des Gegners ?
Wer wird als Sieger vom Platz gehen , wenn sich die Grundpositionen derart ähneln ?
Newt Gingrich meint die Antwort schon zu kennen : Die Republikaner .
Zumindest , sagt er , hätten sie bei veränderter Grundstimmung wieder eine faire Chance , das Rennen ums Weiße Haus zu gewinnen .
Er glaube fest daran , das der Grundsatz von Magaret Thatcher noch immer richtig sei : " Erst gewinnst du das Argument und dann die Wahl . "

Mit dieser politisch klugen Einlassung stand der Noch - Feldherr nahezu allein da .
Das tut man , aber das kündigt man nicht an , sagte Senator Joe Biden , der Altmeister der demokratischen Außenpolitik .
Hillary Clinton erwiderte auf einer Wahlversammlung in Chicago : " Es war ein großer Fehler , das heraus zu posaunen .

Präsident George W. Bush , der in früheren Tagen selbst gern derartige Präventivangriffe auf dem Gebiet souveräner Staaten empfahl , brauchte mehrere Tage um den Vorstoß abzulehnen .
Das Aufspüren von Terroristen in Pakistan sei eine Angelegenheit der Geheimdienste und nicht des Militärs , sagt er .
12.Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,druck-499437,00.html
Die Mehrzahl der Amerikaner , daran besteht auch im fünften Jahr nach dem Anschlug auf das World Trade Center kein Zweifel , ist eben keineswegs kriegsmüde .
Sie will nicht den Krieg , nur die Erfolglosigkeit beenden .
Viele hassen mittlerweile Bush , der erst den Kriegsgrund ( " Massenvernichtungswaffen " ) und dann das Kriegsende ( " Mission accomplished " ) frei erfunden hat .
Aber die militärische Auseinandersetzung selbst will man deshalb noch lange nicht verloren geben .
12.Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,druck-499437,00.html
Der Feldzug gegen al- Qaida und Co gilt den meisten Amerikanern als die einzig denkbare , geradezu natürliche Reaktion auf den Anschlag vom 11 .
Sep. 2001 .
Dem Präsidenten wird nicht die Kampfansage an die Terroristen verübelt , sondern seine Erfolglosigkeit im Irak .
12.Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,druck-499437,00.html
Einer wie Gingrich , der für sich selbst das verstorbene Feindbild des Sowjetkommunisten beizeiten durch einen islamischen Fanatiker ersetzt hat , darf sich bestätigt fühlen .
Völlig korrekt sei das , was der junge Senator da über Pakistan gesagt habe , lobt er gönnerhaft .
Es gefällt ihm , dass da ausgerechnet vom politischen Rivalen ein neues Kampffeld eröffnet wurde , wo doch andere in diesen Tagen schon von Rückzug reden .
Pakistan , sagt Gingrich , sei " enorm gefährlich , wir brauchen eine Strategie " .
Wobei einer wie Gingrich mit " Strategie " in aller Regel den Einsatz von Raketen , Mörsern und Flammenwerfern meint .
Der Wind hat gedreht in Washington .
Amerika befindet sich im Krieg , nicht nur der Präsident .
Die Demokraten greifen zwar weiter den fehlgeschlagenen Irakfeldzug an , aber nicht mehr den gesamten " Krieg gegen den Terror " .
Der hat sich durchgesetzt - nicht nur als Metapher .

In a television documentary , America Rebuilds , Mr. Larry Silverstein made a statement which has been the source of great fascination for 9/11 researchers :
I remember getting a call from the Fire Department commander , telling me they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire .
I said , you know , ' We 've had such terrible loss of life , maybe the smartest thing to do is just pull it . '
And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse .
Download the video from here : http://www. 911 blogger.com/files/video/wtc7_pbs.WMV
Why is it of such interest ?
The answer is because of it's ambiguity , which allows it to be interpreted in two completely different ways :
1 ) I told them to demolish the building .
2 ) I told them to withdraw from the building .

( U.S. State Department )
Notice how Silverstein 's PR spokesman protects Silverstein by paraphrasing rather than quoting him :
Mr. Silverstein expressed his view that the most important thing was to protect the safety of those firefighters , including , if necessary , to have them withdraw from the building .
This , I suggest , is also carefully crafted .
None of these statements could ever be interpreted as clear evidence of either denial or complicity .

Tages werde man vielleicht verstehen , wie in den Neuronen Einzigartigkeit entstehe .

Doch die Frage nach den Gemeinsamkeiten ließ Koshland nicht mehr los .
" Wenn wir auf Jahrhunderte wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnis zurückschauen , so tritt ein Muster hervor " , schrieb er. Alle Forscherentdeckungen , so Koshland , könne man in eine von drei Kategorien einteilen .
Und die fangen - ebenso dekorativ wie leicht zu merken - alle mit " Cha " an : Charge , Challenge und Chance :
Charge bedeutet soviel wie Ladung .
Und Charge - Entdeckungen lösen Koshlands Typologie entsprechend offensichtliche Probleme , deren Lösungen nicht ganz so offensichtlich sind .
Kennzeichnend ist hier , dass die zeitgenössische Debatte geradezu mit einem bestimmten Problem aufgeladen ist .
Newtons Gravitationsgesetz oder die Suche nach einem Heilmittel für Herz - und Gefäßkrankheiten seien solche allgegenwärtigen Probleme .
Challenge bedeutet Herausforderung .
Und diese besteht laut Koshland darin , eine wachsende Zahl von Puzzlestücken zusammenzufügen , die für sich alle unerklärt , rätselhaft oder gar widersprüchlich sind .
Einsteins spezielle Relativitätstheorie gehöre ebenso zu diesen Fällen wie die Entdeckung der DNA - Struktur durch Watson und Crick .
Diese Kategorie zeigt auch , welche mühselige Kollektivarbeit Forschung ist .
Es gebe viele " Aufdecker " in solchen Fällen , oft komme dann aber nur ein Einziger mit der Erklärung daher und gelte fortan als " Entdecker " , so Koshland .
Chance , also einfach Glück , ist für die dritte Kategorie nötig , den Zufallsfund .
Man brauche zwar ein waches Gemüt , um den Fund zu erkennen , doch der Rest klingt reichlich simpel : Pasteur , Röntgen oder Plunkett - " diese Forscher sahen , was niemand zuvor gesehen hatte , und erkannten dessen Bedeutung " .

Daniel Ellsberg needs an intervention Calling Dr. Fielding !
Daniel Ellsberg , whom I admire -- or used to admire -- needs help .
In his Cindy Sheehan endorsement speech , Ellsberg indicates that a head gasket may have burst in the machineries of his mind .
In the first place , he is supporting the candidacy of a fool who has no business in Congress .
I am sorry for Ms. Sheehan 's loss , but she 's a big girl with a big audience + she must take responsibility the far - right crapola she has been peddling lately .
She has given mouth service to false claims that the income tax is unconstitutional and that the Democrats started World Wars I and II .
Not long ago , only John Birchers and neo -Nazis mouthed such ludicrous sentiments .
Speaking of ludicrous sentiments , let 's take a closer look at what Ellsberg has to say :

Finanztitel zählten vor dem Hintergrund der Kreditkrise auch außerhalb Deutschlands zu den größten Verlierern .
Im Mittelpunkt standen erneut Aktien von ABN Amro Holding , die um 5,9 % auf 33 Euro nachgaben .
Zwischenzeitlich waren die Titel um mehr als elf % auf 31,20 Euro eingebrochen .
Händler begründeten die Kursverluste mit Befürchtungen , wonach die geplante Übernahme der niederländischen Bank an Problemen bei der Finanzierung von Krediten scheitern könnte .
So könnte Fortis die zur Finanzierung geplante Ausgabe von Anleihen im Wert von zwei Milliarden Euro " etwas verschieben " , sagte Finanzvorstand Gilbert Mittler der Wirtschaftszeitung " Financieele Dagblad " .
Die belgische Bank plant zusammen mit der schottischen Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBoS ) und der spanischen Banco Santander ( BSCH ) die Übernahme von ABN Amro .
Ein anderer Börsianer verwies auf vage Spekulationen , wonach auch Barclays sein Übernahmeangebot für ABN Amro wegen Finanzierungsschwierigkeiten zurückzieht .
Die britische Bank hat aber derartige Gerüchte derweil dementiert .
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499258,00.html
" FAZ " : Landesbank Sachsen hat Probleme mit US - Krediten
Die Auswirkungen der Krise am US - Hypothekenmarkt sind inzwischen in ganz Europa zu spüren .
Die britische Man Group verschiebt nach Informationen der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters ihre Pläne , erstmals einen Hedge - Fonds an die New Yorker Börse zu bringen , auf unbestimmte Zeit .
In Deutschland nimmt die Finanzaufsicht Bafin im Zuge der US - Hypothekenkrise eine Fondsgesellschaft der SachsenLB unter die Lupe , wie die " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung " berichtet .
In Finanzkreisen heiße es , die Bafin führe mit der Landesbank derzeit Gespräche wegen deren Zweckgesellschaft Ormand Quay , für deren Liquidität die Landesbank laut Analyse der Kreditbewertungsagentur Standard & Poor 's mit 17,5 Milliarden Dollar geradestehe .
Ormand Quay investiert nach Angaben der Zeitung in langfristige Kreditanlagen und refinanziert sich durch kurzfristige Anleihen .
Im Juni hätten 82 % der Kredite aus Hypotheken bestanden .
Nach Angaben der Landesbank investiere Ormand Quay allerdings nicht in die besonders risikoreichen Ausleihungen an Kunden mit geringer Kreditwürdigkeit - die eigentlichen Auslöser für die Krise .
Ormand Quay sei vielmehr eine der größten Zweckgesellschaften der Welt .
Dabei handelt es sich um Tochterfirmen , die eigens für bestimmte Geldgeschäfte gegründet werden .
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499258,00.html
Im Vergleich zu ihren Jahreshöchstkursen haben die Finanzwerte damit zwölf bis 25 % abgegeben .

Wenn es der deutschen Wirtschaft schlecht geht , geht es den deutschen Anlegern doppelt schlecht :

" Beispielsweise zeigen Studien , dass Anleger Aktien , die sie besser kennen , ein größeres Renditepotential und ein geringeres Risiko beimessen .
Das ist logisch nicht haltbar " , erklärt Markus Glaser von der Universität Mannheim .
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499288,00.html
Das weckt Erinnerungen an die Jahrtausendwende .
Der New - Economy - Boom lief schon eine ganze Weile , doch die meisten Privatanleger kauften erst dann Aktien , als deren Wert schon zu bröckeln begann .
Zu lange hatten sie den verführerischen Geschichten gelauscht und gezaudert - jeder kannte einen Nachbarn oder Freund , der von enormen Gewinnen zu berichten wusste .
Das DAI verzeichnete 2001 mit 12,85 Millionen die bisher größte Zahl an Aktionären in Deutschland - doch es war zu spät , die Aktien fielen weltweit fast drei Jahre lang .
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
Dabei habe es vor der Krise an Warnungen nicht gemangelt : " Etliche Warnungen wurden in den Wind geschlagen .
Es ist falsch , jetzt zu behaupten , die Risiken und Probleme seien nicht absehbar gewesen . "
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
Eines allerdings ist klar :
Dass sich mittelständische Banken wie die IKB überhaupt an solchen Investitionen beteiligt haben und die unsicheren Werte in ihr Portfolio aufgenommen haben , ist nach Ansicht von Investment - Experte Leber schlicht " fahrlässig und außerhalb ihrer Kompetenz " .
Er hätte die IKB deshalb auch nicht gerettet : " Verantwortungslose Spieler müssen pleite gehen . "
Finanzmarktkrise gefährdet Aufschwung
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
" Wenn durch Liquiditätssignale und Zinssenkung das fehlende Vertrauen wieder hergestellt werden kann , dann sind wir aus dem Gröbsten raus " , sagt Ehrhardt .
Denn auch wenn nicht nur die amerikanischen , sondern auch die europäischen und asiatischen Finanzmärkte wackelten , sei die Krise letzten Endes eine amerikanische Krise .
Denn die Liquidität an den europäischen und asiatischen Aktienmärkten sei eigentlich gut , für die Krise gebe es aus dem Blickwinkel der Bewertung keinen Grund .
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
" Die Ratten verlassen das sinkende Schiff "
Aber auch die amerikanische Notenbank hat nach Einschätzung von Analysten nicht richtig reagiert .
" Sie hätte eindeutige Signale geben müssen , dass sie die Sache im Griff hat " , sagt Finanzexperte Ehrhardt .
Stattdessen habe man bestimmte Fonds einfach pleite gehen lassen und dabei zugesehen , wie Investoren ihre Gelder abgezogen hätten .
" Da ist der Eindruck entstanden : Die Ratten verlassen das sinkende Schiff . "
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
" Das Problem ist seit Herbst letzten Jahres bekannt und wird seit Monaten intensiv diskutiert .
Trotzdem haben die Ratingagenturen nicht reagiert " , sagt Leber .
Er gehe deshalb davon aus , dass es massive Schadensersatzklagen gegen die Ratingagenturen geben wird .
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
Immer lauter werden die Stimmen , die jetzt die Kontrolleure selbst kritisieren .
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
Weitaus stärker hält sich dagegen Fondsmanager Leber in seinen Schätzungen zurück .
" Nach dem , was bisher bekannt ist , gehe ich davon aus , dass es Ausfälle von 50 bis 100 Milliarden Dollar geben wird - ohne allerdings mögliche Schadensersatzforderungen gegenüber den Ratingagenturen miteinzurechnen . "
Denn die großen Ratingagenturen wie Standards &Poor's , Moddy 's oder FitchRatings sind in seinen Augen mitverantwortlich für das Ausmaß der Krise .
Sie beurteilen die Kreditwürdigkeit eines Schuldners , durch einen Code , der von " AAA " ( höchste Qualität ) bis " D " ( zahlungsunfähig " ) reicht .
Investoren verlassen sich gerade bei so komplexen Anlageformen wie es die Hypothekenkredite waren , in der Regel stark auf das Urteil der Ratingagenturen .
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
Auch das Vorgehen der Banken in Amerika und in Deutschland löst inzwischen Kopfschütteln aus .
" Das Neue daran ist , dass der Kreditgeber seine Kreditnehmer nicht mehr kennt " , sagt Finanzanalyst Ehrhardt .
So seien quasi Immobilien - Darlehen gegeben worden , ohne irgendeine Sicherheit zu haben .
Ein Prinzip , nach dem keine der betroffenen Banken normalerweise arbeiten würde .
Ehrhardt schätzt , dass etwa ein Drittel der in den USA vergebenen Hypothekenkredite schlechter Bonität nicht zurückgezahlt werden können - was insgesamt zu einem Schaden von etwa 300 Milliarden Dollar führen könnte .
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
Momentan weiß keiner , wo die unsicheren Kredite sind " , bestätigt auch Hendrik Leber , Fondsmanager und Geschäftsführer der Investmentberatung Acatis .
Er vermutet , dass es noch eine große Bank erwischen wird , die ebenfalls zu viel in den sogenannten Subprime - Markt investiert hat .
" Momentan verleihen die Kreditinstitute deshalb auch untereinander kein Geld mehr , was einen Liquiditätsengpass zur Folge hat , den die EZB mit ihren Finanzspritzen bekämpft . "
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
" Mir war nicht bekannt , dass die IKB und einige Landesbanken so tief in die Hypothekenkrise verstrickt sind und tatsächlich dreistellige Summen in den sogenannten Subprime - Markt investiert haben " , sagt Jens Ehrhardt , Vermögensverwalter und Fondmanager der gleichnamigen Fondsgesellschaft .
Die Beinahe - Pleite des Staatsfinanzierers IKB in der vergangenen Woche habe zu einem großen Vertrauensverlust der Banken untereinander geführt .
" Plötzlich wollte keiner mehr Geld verleihen , weil niemand weiß , welche Bank noch Probleme mit den faulen Krediten aus den USA bekommen wird . "
10 .Aug.2007 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-499278,00.html
" Alle sind unglaublich nervös .
Und es ist die Unsicherheit , die die Märkte tötet " , sagte ein Analyst der britischen Großbank Barclays der BBC .

Hektik und riesige Handelsumsätze an den Börsen in Frankfurt , New York , London - die Hypothekenkrise versetzt die Märkte in Alarmstimmung .
Die Europäische Zentralbank und die US - Notenbank pumpen massiv Geld in den Markt , um die Lage zu stabilisieren .
Analysten warnen : " Es ist Feuer unterm Dach . "
Hamburg - Zwei riesige Geldspritzen binnen 24 Stunden - die Europäische Zentralbank ( EZB ) sieht offenbar großen Handlungsbedarf , um der Panik an den Finanzmärkten entgegenzuwirken .
94,8 Milliarden Euro stellten die Währungshüter den Banken schon gestern zur Verfügung .
Heute kamen noch einmal 61,05 Milliarden Euro dazu .
So viel wie seit den Terroranschlägen vom 11 .
September 2001 nicht mehr .
Die japanische Zentralbank versorgte zuvor den Markt mit rund sechs Milliarden Euro .
Am Nachmittag zog auch die US - Notenbank Fed nach und stellte den Kreditinstituten in zwei Schritten insgesamt 19 Milliarden Dollar bereit .
Foto : DPA Video : Reuters
Zuvor hatten die US - Börsen ihre Talfahrt zu Handelsbeginn fortgesetzt - erst nach den Finanzspritzen der Fed beruhigte sich die Lage , zeitweise waren die Indizes sogar im Plus .
Am Abend schlossen der Dow Jones mit 0,23 % , der Index der Technologiebörse Nasdaq mit 0,45 % im Minus .
Analysten zeigten sich besorgt : " Wenn sich Notenbanken rund um den Globus zu so etwas veranlasst sehen , dann ist Feuer unter dem Dach " , kommentierte Händler Dirk Müller von IFC - Kursmakler .
" Es ist schwer abzuschätzen , was da noch hochkommt " , so der Experte über das internationale Börsenbeben , das die Krise am US - Immobilien und - Hypothekenmarkt hervorgerufen hat .
Über Derivate seien alle Marktteilnehmer weltweit miteinander so verquickt , dass keiner mehr durchblicke .
" Wenn es an einem Ende zwickt , kann das das ganze Finanzsystem zum Einsturz bringen " , warnte auch ein anderer Börsianer .
Die Analysten von ABN
Amro schrieben : " Das Kartenhaus beginnt zu wackeln . "

Captives for Rent
Companies are flocking to rent - a - captive s for risk transfer .
Russ Banham , CFO Magazine
00.000.19 94 D irectory Distributing Associates Inc. ( DDA ) stopped paying through the nose for workers ' compensation insurance .
Fed up with expensive state assigned - risk pools , DDA rented a captive facility instead -- and slashed its expenses by half .
" The strategy has driven down our costs and provided more claims control , " says Michael Shelton , CFO of the St. Louis­based order - fulfillment company , which currently has 60,000 employees .
" I can finally budget the expense .
In the past , I never knew what the next year would bring . "
Renting risk transfer may seem off the wall , but it 's a proven concept that has kicked around for more than three decades .
With commercial property - and - casualty insurance prices up 5 to 10 percent this year and headed for further increases , many alternative risk - transfer strategies are being dusted off and reconsidered .
Among them is the rent - a- captive .

In Bermuda , the seedbed of the captive movement , segregating cells had been legal but difficult , requiring a private act of Parliament .
New legislation enacted 00.000 .
2000 ( The Segregated Accounts Companies Act ) makes this a walk in the park today , requiring only a simple application process .
This has dramatically increased interest in rent - a- captives .

For example , for policy issuing and tax reasons , Atlas buys insurance from a so - called fronting insurance company .
The fronting carrier ( Milwaukee - based Legion Insurance Co. ) is theoretically liable for the policy losses , although it cedes this risk entirely to IPC Cos. , a Mutual subsidiary .

ATLAS IN THE VANGUARD Atlas Van Lines Inc. , a national moving company based in Evansville , Indiana , was an early adherent to rent - a - captive s .

" We joined Mutual back simply because we had to get affordable workers ' compensation insurance for our truckers , which at the time was n't available , " says Howard E. Parker , CFO of Atlas , which has annual revenues of $ 550 million .

" If you structure the rent - a - captive program correctly , you can have a real transfer of risk so you have both off - balance - sheet financing and tax deductions , " says Kathryn Westover , director of Strategic Risk Solutions Ltd. , a Colchester , Vermont - based captive manager and part of the Credit Suisse group of companies .

Captivating Vermont
Spreading from offshore domiciles , rent - a- captive structures have worked their way into the regulatory framework of several U.S. states , including Vermont , Hawaii + South Carolina .

( In offshore domiciles , rent - a - captive s can be owned by any type of organization . )

Fazit
Intense competition among traditionally known " offshore " jurisdictions and " onshore " players , such as various States of the United States of America , have caused a visible trend on increasing innovation in the creation and evolution of legal structures , all with the aim of providing better and cost - effective financial services to the international markets .
The Protected Cell Company , a multi-use corporate structure , constitutes a clear reflection of this legal - financial engineering dynamic phenomenon , whose success in the marketplace remains on challenge .

Lastly , with the aim of bringing securitization " onshore " the United States , the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ' Insurance Securitization Working Group focused in the adoption of a model law on " special - purpose vehicles " xxviii and on February 6 , 2001 agreed - in principle - to such model actxxix , which would facilitate setting up securitization special purpose entities within the USA .

the Italian securitization company has as precedent the " sociedad securitizadora " ( securitization corporation ) , which originated in Chile by means of Law 19,301 of 1994 ( which amended the Securities Markets Laws ) xxii .
The PCC concept resembles the Chilean sociedad securitizadora in the sense that it also provides for the segregation of assets , which back the different issued securities .
Under Chilean law , the sociedad securitizadora is deemed a special corporation ( " anónima especial " ) whose sole purpose is the acquisition of credits ( as defined by law ) and rights over cash flows + the issuance of debt securities ( short or long term instruments ) ;

Law No. 130 of April 30 , 1999 , approved by the Italian Parliament , provides for the creation of " securitization companies " , pursuant to which the receivables assigned to such entities are segregated from other assets of the securitization company and may only be attached by holders of the securitization securities pertaining to those receivables .

Based on the aforementioned , a PCC may be defined thus as :
A corporation whose patrimony is composed of assets contained in structurally separate parts named " cells " [ cellular assets ] , which are legally and functionally separate , distinct and independent among each other + of assets not constituting " cells " [ non-cellular assets ] , also structurally and legally independent , that has as main legal characteristic the fact that the portion of capital designated to a specific cell is neither liable for the general obligations , commitments or liabilities of the corporation nor for the specific liabilities of the other cells .
It is possible to extract the main characteristics of these entities from the above , as follows :
a ) Legal Entity : the PCC has its own juridical personality , thus is capable of owning rights and assuming obligations on its own .
The " cells " , although being separate individual patrimonies , do not constitute separate entities themselves ;
b) " Cellular " Patrimonies : the patrimony of the entity is divided in different " protected cells " , which allows segregation of funds , thus enabling ring - fencing among the distinct cells and the core patrimony ;
c ) " Core " Patrimony : a portion of the PCC 's patrimony is composed of general assets ( " non-cellular " assets ) , which are separate and distinct from each of the assets composing the protected cells , creating what is commonly known as the " core cell " ;
d) Segregation of Assets and Liabilities : the assets allocated to each specific cell may only be liable for liabilities incurred by such cell and thus should not be attached by creditors of the other company 's cells .
The liabilities unrelated to a specific cell are covered by the non-cellular assets or the core cell .
The core assets respond - on subsidiary grounds - once the specific cellular assets are depleted .
In summary , a PCC - structurally speaking - involves a core capital , cellular capital , cellular assets and liabilities + core assets and liabilities .
The ring - fencing rules are also applicable to any liquidator or receiver of the entity .
Thus the insolvency of a cell should not affect the business of the whole entity or the performance of the other cells .
For each business , activity or agreement contracted , the PCC must disclose which cell is contracting or if the entity is committing its core assets or both , core and specific cell assets .
The PCC must have a name and each and every cell must also be clearly identified in the formation documents of the entity .
Once formed , these entities may issue shares ( " cellular " or " non-cellular " shares , depending on whether they represent an equity interest in a specific cell or in the core assets ) or other types of securities .
The entity must keep accounting books showing the corresponding patrimonial divisions among the segregated cells and the core cell within the entity .

No asset protection is provided for the participants of a rent - a- captive program on an individual basis .
In order to circumvent such patrimonial risk - fencing deficiency the insurance industry developed the concept of the PCC .

In cases in which a company is not financially capable to self - insure itself it may still obtain self - coverage through the use of a " rent - a- captive " scheme .
In this case , such company would share the services of a captive with other companies of relatively similar size , by " renting " part of the capital of the rented captive .
Unrelated companies would use then the same captive to insure their risks .
The patrimony of the captive would thus cover the underwritten risks of the sponsoring entities in the case a triggering event occurs , as described in the respective
Comments from the Clintons and Clinton supporters are spurring a racial backlash .
Racial tensions roil Democratic race
A series of comments from Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , her husband and her supporters are spurring a racial backlash and adding a divisive edge to the presidential primary as the candidates head south to heavily African - American South Carolina .
The comments , which ranged from the New York senator appearing to diminish the role of Martin Luther King Jr. in the civil rights movement — an aide later said she misspoke — to Bill Clinton dismissing Sen.
Barack Obama ’s image in the media as a “ fairy tale ” — generated outrage on black radio , black blogs and cable television .
And now they 've drawn the attention of prominent African - American politicians .

“ A cross-section of voters are alarmed at the tenor of some of these statements , ” said Obama spokeswoman Candice Tolliver , who said that Clinton would have to decide whether she owed anyone an apology .
“ There ’s a groundswell of reaction to these comments — and not just these latest comments but really a pattern , or a series of comments that we ’ve heard for several months , ” she said .
“ Folks are beginning to wonder :
Is this really an isolated situation , or is there something bigger behind all of this ? ”
Clinton supporters responded to that suggestion with their own outrage .
“ To say that there is a pattern of racist comments coming out of the Hillary campaign is ridiculous , ” said Ohio Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones .
“ All of the world knows the commitment of President Clinton and Sen. Clinton to civil rights issues — and not only the commitment in terms of words but in terms of deeds . ”
Referring to the King quote , Sheila Jackson Lee , another Clinton supporter , said Clinton was trying to contrast King and Obama , not to diminish King : " It really is a question of focusing on the suggestion that you can inspire without deeds — what is well - known to the child who studies Dr. King in school is that yes , he spoke , but he also moved people to action . "
But other black Clinton supporters found themselves wincing at the Clintons ’ words , if not questioning their intent .
A Harlem - based consultant to the Clinton campaign , Bill Lynch , called the former president ’s comments “ a mistake ” and said his own phone had been ringing with friends around the country voicing their concern .
“ I ’ve been concerned about some of those comments — and that there might be a backlash , ” he said .
Illinois State Senate President Emil Jones , a prominent Obama supporter , echoed those sentiments .
" It ’s very unfortunate that the president would make a statement like that , " he said of Bill Clinton 's criticism of Obama 's experience , adding that the African - American community had " saved his presidency " after the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
" They owe the African - American community — not the reverse , " he said .
" Maybe Hillary and Bill should get behind Sen. Barack Obama . "
Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. , through a spokesman , used even stronger language .
" Following Barack Obama 's victory in Iowa and historic voter turnout in New Hampshire , the cynics unfortunately have stepped up their efforts to decry his uplifting message of hope and fundamental change .
" Regrettably , they have resorted to distasteful and condescending language that appeals to our fears rather than our hopes .
I sincerely hope that they 'll turn away from such reactionary , disparaging rhetoric . "
Many analysts think Clinton won New Hampshire on the back of a feminist backlash against criticism from her rivals and the media , and now , after his own defeat , it ’s Obama ’s turn .
Race is particularly complicated turf this year , however , in a contest that features two towering figures who pride themselves for breaking racial barriers in American politics .
The first is Bill Clinton , sometimes referred to as “ the first black president , ” who now finds himself on the same uncertain ground as any other white politician speaking dismissively of an African - American rival .
He was expected to call in to the Rev. Al Sharpton ’s radio show , which airs in South Carolina , Friday afternoon , to explain his “ fairy tale ” comment .
And the second is Obama , whose 1995 book — subtitled “ A story of race and inheritance ” — was hailed as one of the most astute examinations of race in America .
He has played the question of race with remarkable dexterity in this campaign , leaving little doubt among African - Americans that he ’s a member of their community , while delivering a message that excludes no one .
To whites , he ’s made clear that he ’s a bearer of racial redemption , not racial grievance , even extending public absolution during a televised debate to a rival , Sen .
Joe Biden , for past racially charged remarks .
Tolliver said Obama had no personal reaction to Clinton ’s remarks and was focused on his own message of “ hope . ”
But he ’s spoken in the past of the risk of falling into old narratives of racial division .
“ I think America is still caught in a little bit of a time warp :
The narrative of black politics is still shaped by the ' 60s and black power , ” he told Newsweek this summer .
“ That is not , I think , how most black voters are thinking .
I do n't think that 's how most white voters are thinking .
I think that people are thinking about how to find a job , how to fill up the gas tank , how to send their kids to college .
I find that when I talk about those issues , both blacks and whites respond well . ”
Now , though , some of those old patterns are reasserting themselves .
The series of comments Clinton critics ’ cite began in mid-December , when the chairman of Hillary Clinton ’s New Hampshire campaign , Bill Shaheen , speculated about whether Obama had ever dealt drugs .
In the final days of the New Hampshire campaign , however , the discomfort of some black observers intensified as Bill Clinton dismissed the contrast between Obama ’s judgment on the war and Clinton ’s as a “ fairy tale ” and spoke dismissively of his short time in the Senate .
And the candidate herself , in an interview with Fox News , stressed the role of President Lyndon Johnson , over Martin Luther King Jr. , in the civil rights movement .
“ I would point to the fact that Dr. King 's dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 , when he was able to get through Congress something that President Kennedy was hopeful to do , the president before had not even tried , but it took a president to get it done , ” she said , in response to a question about how her dismissive attitude toward Obama ’s “ false hopes ” would have applied to the civil rights movement .
“ That dream became a reality , the power of that dream became real in people 's lives because we had a president who said we are going to do it and actually got it accomplished . ”
An aide later said Clinton did n’t intend to diminish King , and later that day she went out of her way to stress his accomplishment and courage in leading a movement .
Then , when Obama lost New Hampshire , the first question on black media outlets like " The Tom Joyner Show " was whether white racism had defeated him , and when a Clinton supporter , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , said — though not directly in connection to Obama — that politicians ca n’t “ shuck and jive ” in early - primary states , it only added fuel to the fire .
Thursday , a key player in black South Carolina politics , Rep. Jim Clyburn , told The New York Times he ’d consider endorsing Obama in response to what he considered a lack of respect in the Clinton campaign ’s approach to Obama .
“ For him to go after Obama , using a ‘ fairy tale , ’ calling him as he did last week , it 's an insult .
And I will tell you , as an African - American , I find his tone and his words to be very depressing , ” Donna Brazile , a longtime Clinton ally who is neutral in this race , said on CNN earlier this week .
Asked in an e-mail from Politico about the situation Friday , she responded by sending over links to five cases in which the Clintons and their surrogates talked about Obama , along with a question :
“ Is Clinton using a race - baiting strategy against Obama ? ”
Brazile later said she was n't intending to raise the question herself , just to pass on a question that was being asked by others .
The black blogosphere was even less diplomatic , with the widely read site MediaTakeOut calling Clinton ’s comment on King “ explosive ” and the blog Jack and Jill Politics saying it “ pretty much solidified the image that , whatever happened in the '90s , you are now some out - of - touch rich white folks . ”
“ There ’s a concern about that kind of stuff — especially in the black community , ” said Bill Perkins , a New York state senator who is among Obama ’s leading supporters in Clinton ’s home state .
“ The dynamic changed in New Hampshire , and all these little mistakes contribute to the general sense that this is n’t a mistake . ”
Clinton ’s supporters dismiss the hubbub as the Obama campaign ’s strategy to woo African - American supporters in South Carolina .
“ Some of the Obama people are clearly trying to use Hillary ’s comments about Martin Luther King and distort them into something she did not say , which is outrageous , ” said former Pennsylvania Rep. William Gray .
“ It ’s a hot issue in South Carolina , and they ’re spreading the word all over .
I hope that the good senator will make sure that none of his people are doing that .
We do n’t need to have a debate about race or gender . ”
Obama ’s national spokesman , Bill Burton , would n’t comment on Gray ’s assertion .
“ Voters have to decide for themselves what they think about those comments , ” he said .
Clinton ’s campaign also released a statement from a deputy campaign manager , Bob Nash , defending the senator .
“ The stress of the political season can lead people to say outlandish things , and we assume that this was the case here .
With Dr. King ’s birthday upon us , it ’s important to keep in mind that his legacy is about the things that bring us together as one people , ” he said .
But Lynch , the Clinton consultant who is advising Clinton ’s South Carolina campaign , said he would n’t advise Clinton to fight on this terrain .
“ The more you kind of defend it , the worse it gets , ” said Lynch .
NEW YORK -- Real estate may have cooled considerably as an investment , but not real estate television .
House - flipping and home - renovation programs are still big hits on cable .
While “ for - sale ” signs sprout on lawns across the country , TV programmers are like developers who plow ahead with new housing projects anyway .
A new season of the A&E ; Network ’s “ Flip This House ” -- one of a troika , with TLC ’s “ Flip That House ” and Bravo ’s “ Flipping Out ” -- premieres Saturday night .
A&E ; has several new programs in development .
On TLC , at least six new ones are beginning in the next year , starting with “ Date My House , ” hosted by former “ Bachelor ” Bob Guiney , in which potential buyers spend a night in a home on the market .

HGTV had its highest prime - time ratings ever in January .
Nine of its top 10 series deal with the housing market , including “ House Hunters , ” “ My First Place , ” “ Hidden Potential , ” “ Buy Me ” and “ Designed to Sell . ”
The network on Feb. 29 did a special theme day of “ taking the big leap , ” or investing in that first house .
“ What ’s driving interest right now is that people are worried about it : ‘ What ’s the value of my home ?
How can I increase interest in my home ? ’ ” said Jim Samples , HGTV president .
“ And then there ’s the ‘ life - goes - on ’ factor .
People are still changing jobs , families are still getting bigger .
If anything , they tend to nest in this environment . ”
Samples admitted , though , that one of his first questions last fall upon taking over HGTV was how the housing market downturn would affect the network ’s programs .
HGTV essentially built itself on the public fascination with property .
At its start , the network had shows on crafts and landscaping , but now the home is the focus .
“ House Hunters , ” which premiered in 1999 , helped introduce real estate as a prime TV target .

When TLC’s “ Trading Spaces ” became a sensation , it showed that renovation and decoration could be entertainment instead of simply chores .
The network has concentrated recently on reviving that franchise , even bringing back original host Paige Davis after a two - year absence .
“ Flip That House ” will become more reflective of the economy , said Brant Pinvidic , TLC ’s senior vice president of programming .
Not every “ flipper ” gets rich quick .
The show will make sure every time at the end to clearly outline how each investor did , he said .
“ If the programming reflects the attitudes in the community and what people are feeling , it will do better than if the programs feel outdated , ” Pinvidic said .

A&E ; 's “ Flip This House ” is expanding its cast of characters for the upcoming fourth season , adding renovation teams in Atlanta and Los Angeles to join returning “ flippers ” from San Antonio and New Haven , Conn .
In a message marking International Mother Language Day , which was also celebrated today , UNESCO Director - General Koïchiro Matsuura stressed the importance of all languages to everyday life .
“ Far from being a field reserved for analysis by specialists , languages lie at the heart of all social , economic and cultural life , ” Mr. Matsuura said , explaining that ‘ Languages matter ! ’ is the UNESCO slogan for the International Year .
The agency held a series of events – including a round table , a seminar , several presentations and an information workshop – at its Paris headquarters to mark the Day and launch the International Year .
International Mother Language Day has been celebrated on 21 February each year since 2000 , and this year UNESCO said it had placed special emphasis on international instruments and standards that encourage multilingualism .
The agency warned that when a language fades , so does a part of the world ’s cultural tapestry , adding that globalization is placing many languages under ever greater threat .
Today , experts estimate that 96 per cent of the world ’s languages are spoken by only 4 per cent of the total population .
“ Opportunities , traditions , memory , unique modes of thinking and expression – valuable resources for ensuring a better future are also lost , ” UNESCO said in a statement .

According to series writer Matt Fraction , the battle between Tony Stark and new bad guy Ezekiel Stane is really just an allegory for the battle Bill Gates wages against smaller software providers every single day of his life :
Zeke is a post-national business man and kind of an open source ideological terrorist ...
He has absolutely no loyalty to any sort of law , creed , or credo .
He does n't want to beat Tony Stark , he wants to make him obsolete .
Windows wants to be on every computer desktop in the world , but Linux and Stane want to destroy the desktop .
He 's the open source to Stark 's closed source oppressiveness .

Yes , that 's right ; Invincible Iron Man will be the comic book to show that big business is sexy and exciting , just like superheroics :
I want to make this book bigger than Los Angeles and New York and show that business is truly international ...
We 've got Stane , who is post-national and Stark , who has facilities all around the world ; so this is going to be a globetrotting book .

Sound artist Scanner ( aka Robin Rimbaud ) embarks on a remarkable personal and artistic journey of discovery .
Listen again to the programme Salle des Departs
The Hopital Raymond Poincare in Garches , near Paris , is famous for treating road injury victims .
Every year 450 deceased people pass through its morgue , and after 40 years of conducting autopsies and talking to bereaved families , chief pathologist Professor Michel Durigon decided it was time to create a Salle des Departs , a place where families and friends could come to say goodbye to their loved ones without , as he says , " having to suffer sickly background music and a red carpet " .
The result was a commission for a ground breaking piece of art : first a room designed by Italian artist Ettore Spalletti , and now a musical sound scape , commissioned from British artist Robin Rimbaud ( Scanner ) and American composer David Lang .
( Listen to the pieces in full using the links at the bottom of the page )
Stage one , Spalletti's exquisite azure blue Salle des Departs is now complete , and it was the luminous impact of this space which proved a catalyst for Scanner , when he was invited to Garches by Michel Durigon .
For Scanner found himself moved beyond all expectation by the project .
His brief was daunting , but Durigon felt that the hospital needed an artist whose sensibility would be a source of sustenance to mourners , help them through their pain and suffering , and fully respect the memory of the deceased .
It was this last thought which triggered a painful series of memories for Scanner .
As a teenager , he lost his father in a terrible motorcycle accident .
The death was a blow which left his family unable to deal with the magnitude of the loss and of their own suffering .
This lack of formal mourning came back to haunt him when he met Michel Durigon .
Fate has presented him with a unique opportunity to mourn his own father 's death at last , by using his gift of music to help ease the pain of other bereaved families .
The programme follows the progress of his work on the project , from his fledgling musical compositions , to the final ' unveiling ' of the completed piece in Garches .

I am much given to ruminating on refactoring at the moment , as one of my current projects is a major overhaul of a fairly large ( > 31,000 lines ) application which has exactly the kind of dotted history any experienced developer has learned to fear - written by many different people , including short - term contractors , at a time in the company 's life when first - mover advantage was significantly more important than coding best - practice , and without any consistent steer on the subjects of structure , coding conventions , unit tests , and so on .
In other words , here be dragons .
In fairness , the application works and has been a critical part of a company that has gone from nothing to market - leading multinational in 7 years , so it has certainly pulled its weight .
It is in desperate need of a spring - clean though , and my team volunteered to spend 3 months evicting the cobwebs and polishing the brasswork .
Yes , volunteered - it 's a fascinating challenge , though perhaps not something you 'd want to make a career of .
Now , the first mistake to avoid here is the compulsion to throw it away and rewrite from scratch .
So often when confronted with a vast seething moiling spiritless mass of code a developer throws his hands into the air and declares it a lost cause .
How seductive is the thought that 31,000 lines of code could be thrown away and replaced with ~ 15,000 lines of clean , well - designed , beautiful code ?
Sadly , that 's often a path to disaster .
It 's almost a rule of the game .
jwz left Netscape because he knew their decision to rewrite from scratch was doomed .
Joel Spolsky wrote a rant about the same decision - in fact , the Netscape rewrite is commonly cited as a major factor in Netscape losing the first browser war .
The problem is that warty old code is n't always just warty - it 's battle - scarred .
It has years of tweaks and bug - fixes in there to deal with all sorts of edge conditions and obscure environments .
Throw that out and replace it with pristine new code , and you 'll often find that a load of very old issues suddenly come back to haunt you .
So , a total rewrite is out .
This means working with the old code , and finding ways to wrestle it into shape .
Naturally , Working Effectively With Legacy
Code now has an even more firmly established place on my ' critical books ' bookshelf than it did before .
Inspiration came from a less well - known book , however .
Buried in Chapter 10 of Code Reading is a single paragraph suggesting that it can be useful when working with unfamiliar code to paste it into a word processor and zoom out , getting a ' bird 's eye ' view .
One other interesting way to look at a whole lot of source code quickly under Windows is to load it into Microsoft Word and then set the zoom factor to 10 % .
Each page of code will appear at about the size of a postage stamp , and you can get a surprising amount of information about the code 's structure from the shape of the lines .
( Spinellis , 2003 )
The idea is that this lets you immediately identify potential trouble spots - if you see pages where the code is all bunched up on the right , it indicates massive nesting and over - long functions .
If you see heavy congestion , it indicates dense code .
It 's also easy to spot giant switch statements and other crimes against humanity .
Of course , you do n't actually need MS Word to do this - the Print Preview in Open Office is more than sufficient , and no doubt most office suites can do the same .
This 50,000ft view could be a useful tool in tracking progress .
I mean sure , we can have our build system spit out cyclomatic complexity and code size metrics , but would n't it be neat if we could do a weekly bird 's - eye printout of the source code and pin it up on the wall , giving a nice simple visual representation of the simplification of the code ?
Except , of course , that with average page lengths of 45 lines we 'd need almost 700 pages each time , and a hell of a lot of wall space .
A better solution would be to print a class per page .
At the start of the project , the application had about 150 classes , and the refactoring effort is focussed on about 80 of those .
Initially , gigantic classes would be an incomprehensible smudge of grey , but as the refactoring process starts tidying the code and factoring out into other classes , the weekly printout would start to literally come into focus , hopefully ending up with many pages actually containing readable code ( which happens roughly when the class is small enough to fit on no more than 3 pages at normal size ) .
The first time we pinned up the printouts , I suddenly recalled a Douglas Adams foreword reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt .
Adams was a great fan of P.G. Wodehouse , and explained Wodehouse 's interesting drafting technique :
It is the next stage of writing — the relentless revising , refining , and polishing — that turned his works into the marvels of language we know and love .
When he was writing a book , he used to pin the pages in undulating waves around the wall of his workroom .
Pages he felt were working well would be pinned up high , and those that still needed work would be lower down the wall .
His aim was to get the entire manuscript up to the picture rail before he handed it in .
( Adams , 2002 )
Hmm , is n't redrafting a literary cousin of refactoring ?
In many ways , I think it is - so why not apply this technique to refactoring ?
And we 've made it so .
We tied a piece of string horizontally across the wall - that 's our ' picture rail ' .
Every week we reprint the classes we have been working on , and replace the old printouts .
Then we move them up towards the string , in accordance with how happy we are with the view .
Obviously , this does n't replace all the other tools we have for evaluating code quality - e.g. the aforementioned metrics , unit tests , manual QA , and so on .
It does , however , make for a brilliant way of tracking our subjective satisfaction with the class .
Software quality tools can never completely replace the gut instinct of a developer - you might have massive test coverage , but that wo n't help with subjective measures such as code smells .
With Wodehouse - style refactoring , we can now easily keep track of which code we are happy with , and which code we remain deeply suspicious of .
As an added benefit , all those pages nicely cover up the hideous wall colour .

With Videos - On-Demand , Bollywood Meets Web 2.0
Bollywood.tv is using next - generation caching and content - delivery technology to bring its vast collection of South Asian films to online subscribers around the world .
In many ways the films of Bollywood , South Asia 's prolific film industry , are tailor - made for the Web :
They 're instantly digestible , they 're lavishly eye - catching , and they come in an unending stream of around 1,000 movies a year .
Plus , the huge expat Indian community of some 25 million worldwide offers a sizable potential market .
So it makes perfect sense that Bollywood . tv is using next - generation caching and content - delivery technology to bring its vast collection of South Asian spectacles to online subscribers around the world .
Based in London and owned by Australian investment firm Charter Pacific Corp. , Bollywood.tv was founded in 2005 .
It has amassed a catalog of 1,900 contemporary and classic Bollywood movies in languages including Hindi , Tamil , Kannada , Marathi , and Bengali .
The site charges $ 3.99 and up to watch full - length movies and has a monthly subscription offering as well .
Along with third - party providers like Bollywood.tv , big Bollywood studios are getting into the online act as well .
Last year two of the largest Indian film factories , Rajshri Group and Eros Entertainment , began making their movies available via download to fans across the Web .
Several recent South Asian blockbusters have been released simultaneously in theaters and on the Web .
Bollywood.tv CEO
Nigel Glynn - Davies said Thursday his company has started using the Velocix content - delivery system to move films across the Internet .
Velocix , which changed its name from CacheLogic earlier this month , offers what it calls " multisourced caching " -- a way of dividing large files ( feature - length videos , computer games , software applications , and the like ) into pieces and storing them across many different caching sites across the Internet , then delivering the whole dynamically from the best source .
Citing Cisco Systems research that shows consumer - generated traffic growing at 52 % a year between now and 2011 , Velocix CEO Phill Robinson said that conventional content - delivery networks , such as Akamai's , are not designed for such high - capacity requirements .
" Most content - delivery networks work exactly the same now as they did 10 years ago , " said Robinson -- they cache files locally on servers and deliver them from a single source based on the user 's location .
Velocix , by contrast , carves up large multiple gigabyte files into 256 - KB slices and shifts the source of the download or stream based on the optimal connection at any given moment .
Velocix also uses intelligent routing technology to deliver big files using a combination of peer - to - peer networks and caching .
As well as working with major broadcasters such as the BBC , Velocix is equipping independent content distributors to provide for - pay online video services to their audiences .
Last November the popular Italian soccer club AC Milan began providing streaming and on - demand video of matches to fans online , using Velocix 's technology .
The entry of the big studios into the movie - on - demand market means that Bollywood . tv could face some stiff competition in the coming years .
But in the world of South Asian movies , nobody ever said that less is more .

Social sites are already being targeted by hi-tech thieves
So say security professionals predicting what net criminals will turn to in 2008 to catch people out .
The quasi-intimate nature of the sites makes people share information readily leaving them open to all kinds of other attacks , warn security firms .
Detailed information gathered via the sites will also help tune spam runs or make phishing e-mail more convincing .
Friendly faces
There was no doubt that 2007 was the year that sites such as MySpace , Facebook , Bebo , Orkut rose to prominence as millions of people signed up to use them and started posting information about themselves and what they were up to .
But in 2008 these sites will become an attack vector for the hi-tech gangs who are now behind the vast majority of cyber crime .
Mary Landesman , senior security researcher at ScanSafe , said social sites would prove popular for two reasons .
" The technologies that play there and the third party add - ons make it an environment that is susceptible to compromise , " said Ms Landesman .
Already at the end of 2007 Brazilian users of Google 's Orkut were subject to an attack by a worm that tried to steal bank account details .
The malicious program , which also tried to hijack compromised computers , propagated via booby - trapped links placed on the personal page of Orkut users .
Still other attacks have tried to capitalise on the popularity of video clips seen on sites such as YouTube by putting booby - trapped links on pages that show the short films .
Alongside technical vulnerabilities in the networks go other problems with the amount of information that people share on social networking sites .
Social sites help make phishing attacks look more plausible
" That information can be very specific , very focused , " she said .
" It can mention company names , actual events and people . "
This information , said Ms Landesman , could help attackers embarking on social engineering attacks which attempt to con employees by posing as another worker or a business partner .
David Porter , head of security and risk at Detica , said the apparent familiarity of social network sites , which often help people build connections with people who share their interests and outlook meant many people were cavalier with their personal information .
" It is remarkable that people use social networking websites to publish details about their lives , loves , jobs and hobbies to the entire world that they would not dream of sharing with a stranger in a bar , " he said .
" Such data is invaluable to identity fraudsters , " he said .
This move to exploit social network sites would also fuel a move away from attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system to gain control of a PC or steal data .
Far better for the criminal , said Paul King , senior security advisor for Cisco , is to use those phishing e-mails to exploit the end user .
" So many attacks now are nothing to do with an exploit .
It 's about persuading you to click a link , " he said .
" There 's no vulnerability involved in you clicking on that .
None . "
The big challenge in 2008 for individuals and companies was coming to terms and recognising the sheer number of threats ranged against them .
But , he said , consumers and PC users should not feel stifled by all the potential security problems .
There were a lot of benefits to using social networking sites , said Mr King and the downsides should not put people off using them .
" It 's about trying to manage risk rather than avoid risk , " he said .
I suspect everybody on the planet has a tough talk “ To Do ” list – the list of difficult conversations we really should have , but keep putting off .
Talking with your significant other about their parents , asking your best friend about the money they owe you , telling your co-worker to quit making loud personal calls .
Oh , and explaining the birds and the bees to your ….
now 10 - year - old .
Well , that one he may have figured out without you .
We put these difficult conversations off because we dread the reaction , we do n’t want to start a fight , or do n’t want to handle it badly or sound petty .
Interestingly , the way we bring things up ( or respond to their attacks ) actually makes it more likely that we ’ll do damage .
Here are 5 insights to help you sidestep typical traps , and have a real conversation :
1. Do n’t Ease In or Be Indirect .
Anxious about a confrontation , we instead come at the topic sideways , and this is bound to leave them feeling ambushed .
Making indirect suggestions or using leading questions will only make it worse .
You ’re implicitly communicating : “ what I want to say to you is SO BAD … I ca n’t even say it directly . ”
Stating the issue more directly actually makes it less of a big deal : “ Hey , do you think you could keep it down ?
I ’ve just got to focus to get this out the door ….. ” or “ By the way , if I remember right , you still owe me some money .
Any idea when you might be able to pay it back ? ”
2. Stop Their “ Hit & Run ” with Humor .
Sometimes you ’re skipping along happily through your life , and someone else lobs a sarcastic remark in passing and “ bam ! ” you are left feeling ambushed and abandoned .
Perhaps you are at your parents ’ house for Thanksgiving and your aunt , ever critical of your “ insistence on working ” rather than staying home with the kids full - time , watches your boys bop each other on the head and comments , “ Yes , well , I ’m sure they just do n’t get enough attention . ”
You can fume .
Or you can speak up .
I ’d speak up , and with a bit of humor , “ You know , if I thought that staying home would mean they would n’t fight … boy that might actually change my mind ! ”
But do n’t leave it at that , because you risk simply returning sarcastic quip for hurtful quip .
Actually say : “ But I should ask , do you think they would behave differently if I were home ?
Because that ’s interesting … ”
3. Realize the Issue Is n’t the Real Issue .
Whatever the argument is about – where you ’ll spend the holidays , who forgot to call the plumber , what you ’re having for dinner – chances are this is n’t the real issue driving the dispute .
If the conversation becomes difficult , what you are really fighting about is how you ’re each feeling treated by the other .
Do you care about my feelings ?
Can I rely on you ?
Do you appreciate all I do for you ?
Not every fight has to be about these larger issues , but humans are hard - wired to see patterns and to seek emotional safety , so whatever the themes are in your relationship , they will play out over and over under the cover of everyday squabbles .
4. The Real Issues Need to Be Managed … .
Not Resolved .
Ready for this ?
Marriage researcher John Gottman of the University of Washington says that 64 percent of the fights married couples have are the SAME fights they are having five years later .
This is either really depressing , or really liberating .
In other words , most of the things we fight about are n’t actually resolvable .
It ’s a process of managing differences in preferences , habits and personalities – differences that are n’t going to go away , so we might as well quit getting worked up about “ how they are ” and instead focus on working out ways to get around those issues .
5. Talk Backwards as Well as Forwards .
Since so much of what we fight about are really surface reflections of deeper differences , put your energy into understanding those differences .
If you argue about money , talk about where your attitudes , fears and habits around money came from .
How did your parents handle money ?
What are your worst fears ?
This is helpful even when the topic seems more mundane .
For the first five years of our marriage , my husband and I could not pick out a Christmas tree without having an enormous fight .
We fought about when to go .
We fought about where to go .
We fought about which tree .
We fought about why he was being so difficult and ruining such a joyous expedition ( which it decidedly was not ) .
This is actually one of the fights we ’re not having anymore .
It ’s because we finally sat down to talk about our early family experiences and resulting emotional associations with getting and decorating the Christmas tree .
Needless to say , we had opposite experiences and traditions , and I was replicating exactly the obligatory , pressured early experience he had always dreaded .
Simply understanding what he was reacting to , and his understanding that this was n’t my experience or intention , actually changed things .
We decided to create our own tradition around the tree , which he is in charge of .
We ’ll go get the tree any day now … right ?

Three types of predictions are thus in order : ( 1 ) Predictions about PLT research ( direction , fads , major results ) ( 2 ) Predictions about programming languages ( whether about specific languages , or about families etc. ) and ( 3 ) Predictions about industrial use of languages / language - inspired techniques ( adoption , popularity ) .
A Cuneiform clay tablet which for over 150 years defied attempts at interpretation has now been revealed to describe an asteroid impact which in 3123 BC hit Köfels , Austria , leaving in its wake a trail of destruction which may acccount for the biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorrah .
The " Planisphere " tablet ( see pic ) - inscribed around 700 BC - was unearthed by Henry Layard in the remains of the library of the Assyrian royal palace at Nineveh , close to modern - day Mosul , Iraq .
It 's a copy of the night diary of a Sumerian astronomer containing drawings of constellations and " known constellation names " , but it required modern computer tech to finally unravel its exact meaning .
Alan Bond , Managing Director of Reaction Engines Ltd and Mark Hempsell , Senior Lecturer in Astronautics at Bristol University , subjected the Planisphere to a programme which " can simulate trajectories and reconstruct the night sky thousands of years ago " .
They discovered that it described " events in the sky before dawn on the 29 June 3123 BC " , with half of it noting " planet positions and cloud cover , the same as any other night " .
The other half , however , records an object " large enough for its shape to be noted even though it is still in space " and tracks its trajectory relative to the stars , which " to an error better than one degree is consistent with an impact at Köfels " .
That a large body had impacted at Köfels had long been suspected , the evidence being a giant landslide 500 m thick and five kilometres in diameter .
The site had no impact crater to back the theory , but the researchers now believe they have a plausible explanation for that .
The Bristol Uni press release explains : " The observation suggests the asteroid is over a kilometre in diameter and the original orbit about the Sun was an Aten type , a class of asteroid that orbit close to the earth , that is resonant with the Earth ’s orbit .
This trajectory explains why there is no crater at Köfels .
" The in coming angle was very low ( six degrees ) and means the asteroid clipped a mountain called Gamskogel above the town of Längenfeld , 11 kilometres from Köfels , and this caused the asteroid to explode before it reached its final impact point .
" As it travelled down the valley it became a fireball , around five kilometres in diameter ( the size of the landslide ) .
When it hit Köfels it created enormous pressures that pulverised the rock and caused the landslide but because it was no longer a solid object it did not create a classic impact crater . "
Mark Hempsell , hinting at the possible fate of Sodom and Gomorrah , adds : “ Another conclusion can be made from the trajectory .
The back plume from the explosion ( the mushroom cloud ) would be bent over the Mediterranean Sea re-entering the atmosphere over the Levant , Sinai , and Northern Egypt .
“ The ground heating though very short would be enough to ignite any flammable material - including human hair and clothes .
It is probable more people died under the plume than in the Alps due to the impact blast . “
While the biblical fate of the legendary dens of vice ( “ Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah - from the Lord out of the heavens ” - Genesis 19:24 ) sits nicely with the asteroid theory , it 's never been categorically proven that they actually existed in their suspected location close to the Dead Sea .
Tales of fiery destruction raining from the skies are not , though , restricted to the Bible .
Hempsall told the Times that " at least 20 ancient myths record devastation of the type and on the scale of the asteroid ’s impact " - including the Ancient Greek myth of how Phaeton , son of Helios , lost control of his dad 's chariot and plunged into the River Eridanus .
A translation of the Planisphere and the researchers ' findings can be found in the book A Sumerian Observation of the Köfels ' Impact Event .
The tablet is object number K8538 in the British Museum collection . ®
Algebra techniques that do n't work , except when they do
In Problems I Can't Fix in the Lecture Hall , Rudbeckia Hirta describes the efforts of a student to solve the equation 3x2 + 6 x - 45 = 0 .
She describes " the usual incorrect strategy selected by students who can't do algebra " : 3x2 + 6 x - 45 = 0 3x2 + 6 x = 45 x ( 3 x + 6 ) = 45
She says " I stopped him before he factored out the x . " .
I was a bit surprised by this , because the work so far seemed reasonable to me .
I think the only mistake was not dividing the whole thing by 3 in the first step .
But it is not too late to do that , and even without it , you can still make progress .
x ( 3 x + 6 ) = 45 , so if there are any integer solutions , x must divide 45 .
So try x = ± 1 , ±3 , ±5 , ±9 , ±15 in roughly that order .
( The " look for the wallet under the lamppost " principle . ) x = 3 solves the equation , and then you can get the other root , x= - 5 , by further application of the same method , or by dividing the original polynomial by x - 3 , or whatever .
If you get rid of the extra factor of 3 in the first place , the thing is even easier , because you have x(x + 2 ) = 15 , so x = ± 1 , ±3 , or ±5 , and it is obviously solved by x=3 and x= - 5 .
Now obviously , this is not always going to work , but it works often enough that it would have been the first thing I would have tried .
It is a lot quicker than calculating b2 - 4 ac when c is as big as 45 .
If anyone hassles you about it , you can get them off your back by pointing out that it is an application of the so - called rational root theorem .
But probably the student did not have enough ingenuity or number sense to correctly carry off this technique ( he did n't notice the 3 ) , so that M. Hirta 's advice to just use the damn quadratic formula already is probably good .
Still , I wonder if perhaps such students would benefit from exposure to this technique .
I can guess M. Hirta 's answer to this question : these students will not benefit from exposure to anything .
[ Addendum 20080228 : Robert C. Helling points out that I could have factored the 45 in the first place , without any algebraic manipulations .
Quite so ; I completely botched my explanation of what I was doing .
I meant to point out that once you have x( x+2 ) = 15 and the list [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 15 ] , the ( 3,5 ) pair jumps out at you instantly , since 3+2=5 .
I spent so much time talking about the unreduced polynomial x( 3x+6 ) that I forgot to mention this effect , which is much less salient in the case of the unreduced polynomial .
My apologies for any confusion caused by this omission . ] [ Addendum 20080301 : There is a followup to this article . ]

Video - hosting site LiveLeak pulled the controversial anti-Quran film * Fitna Friday afternoon , * citing a barrage of threats .
The 17 - minute film by Dutch politician Geert Wilders , posted Thursday , received more than 3 million views before being taken offline .
Fitna
juxtaposes passages from the Islamic holy book with graphic footage of terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe .
In one scene , the sound of paper ripping can be seen as a reader pages through the Quran .
Put together as a warning that Islam poses a threat to the Netherlands , Fitna includes newspaper headlines about terror attacks , graphic images of beheadings at the hands of Islamic radicals , and a riot - provoking Danish cartoon from 2005 that depicts the prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban .
In place of the video Friday afternoon , a brief and poignant message appears on - screen : " Following threats to our staff of a very serious nature ....
LiveLeak has been left with no choice but to remove Fitna from our servers .
" This is a sad day for freedom of speech on the net ....
We would like to thank the thousands of people from all backgrounds and religions who gave us their support . "
Wilders released the 17 - minute film via LiveLeak despite concerns voiced by the Dutch government and international organizations .
UPDATE : A copy of Fitna can still be seen on Google Video .

PLATES IN FOCUS PLATES IN FOCUS
Federal investigators have concluded that steel plates on the interstate bridge that collapsed last summer in Minneapolis were inadequate to hold the structure together and appear to have been what allowed it to fail , killing 13 people , two officials familiar with the investigation said Monday .
The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) plans to call Tuesday for states to perform safety assessments on the so - called gusset plates in steel girder bridges any time they add weight to a bridge , the sources said .
Design changes in 1977 and 1998 added additional pavement and concrete barriers that increased the weight of the Interstate 35W bridge in downtown Minneapolis .
The officials , and three others who discussed the findings , spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigators ' conclusions before Tuesday 's release .
The Department of Transportation 's Federal Highway Administration plans to act immediately to order states to conduct the safety assessments , said one of the officials .
The bridge over the Mississippi River , one of Minneapolis ' main commuting routes from the north , tumbled 115 feet into the river during afternoon rush hour on Aug .
1 . In addition to the 13 deaths , about 100 others were injured .
Gusset plates are flat steel structures used to bolt together the steel girders that carry the weight of a bridge .
Bridge engineers typically design the plates to be far stronger than the girders because if one fails , the whole bridge will collapse .
In the wreckage of the I - 35W bridge , investigators found 16 gusset plates that were fractured , said one of the officials .
Eight of the plates were in the location on the south side of the bridge where the collapse began , according to that official .
The fractures prompted engineers to calculate whether the plates were adequate to hold the bridge together .
What they found was that the half - inch thick plates should have been an inch thick — double the size .
VIDEO : NTSB statements on bridge collapse
The sources said the NTSB has many months of investigation before it can declare what caused the collapse , but the investigation is now focused on the plates .
Several officials said they did not believe that a widespread problem exists with substandard bridges across the country .
The I - 35W bridge withstood 40 years of use before it collapsed .
However , more attention should be paid to the gusset plates to ensure that bridges in the future do n't collapse , they said .
There are about 465 similarly designed steel truss bridges across the country .
Such designs were popular during the middle of the last century , but have fallen out of favor .
Today , engineers try to design bridges that have redundant designs that allow a single girder or plate to break without causing the structure to collapse .
The findings suggest that bridge inspectors , who are required to regularly check for signs of wear or cracks , did not miss any problems on the Minneapolis structure , an official said .

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama claimed victory by a wide margin over Sen. Hillary Clinton in Mississippi's Democratic primary Tuesday .
Sen . Barack Obama claimed a big victory in Mississippi's Democratic primary .
" What we 've tried to do is steadily make sure that in each state we are making the case about the need for change in this country .
Obviously the people in Mississippi responded , " Obama told CNN after his win .
Mississippi had 33 pledged delegates up for grabs , which will be allocated proportionally .
With 99 percent of the precincts reporting , Obama had 61 percent of the vote , compared with Clinton 's 37 percent .
The state 's Democratic voters were sharply divided among racial lines , exit polls indicated .
Watch what the results mean »
As has been the case in many primary states , Obama won overwhelming support from African - American voters .
They went for him over Clinton 91 - 9 percent .
See the results
The state has a larger proportion of African - Americans ( 36 percent , according to the 2000 census ) than any other state in the country .
And black voters make up nearly 70 percent of registered Democrats .
But Mississippi white voters overwhelmingly backed the New York senator , supporting her over Obama 72 percent to 21 percent .
According to The Associated Press , only two other primary states were as racially polarized -- neighboring Alabama , and Clinton 's former home state of Arkansas .
The exit polls also indicated roughly 40 percent of Mississippi Democratic voters said race was an important factor in their vote , and 90 percent of those voters supported Obama .
In Ohio , roughly one in five voters said race factored into their decision .
About 60 percent of those voters picked Clinton over Obama .
Clinton 's campaign issued a statement congratulating Obama on his win , and said they " look forward to campaigning in Pennsylvania and around the country as this campaign continues . "

Pennsylvania is the next battleground for the Democrats .
It holds its primary April 22 and has 158 delegates at stake .
Obama also finished first in the Texas Democratic caucuses .
The caucuses were held last week , but the race was not called until Tuesday night .
Watch Obama talk about his win »
Obama will get more delegates out of the state than Clinton , who won the state 's primary .
Under the Texas Democratic Party 's complex delegate selection plan , Texas voters participated in both a primary and caucuses last week .
Two - thirds of the state 's 193 delegates were at stake at the primary , while the remaining third were decided by the caucuses .
Obama leads Clinton in the overall delegate count 1,597 - 1,470 , but neither candidate is close to the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination .
Between 125,000 and 150,000 voters were expected to cast ballots Tuesday , according to Pamela Weaver of the Mississippi Secretary of State 's Office .
While the number would represent a 25 to 50 percent increase in turnout from the 2004 primaries , Weaver still described the voting rate as light to moderate .
Obama touched on the Mississippi Delta 's economic struggles during a final campaign stop in Greenville , Mississippi , according to the AP .
" We just have n't seen as much opportunity come to this area as we'd like , " he told those gathered at a restaurant , the AP reported .
" And one of the challenges , I think , for the next president is making sure that we 're serving all communities and not just some communities . "
Obama campaigned in Mississippi on Monday and spent part of Tuesday doing the same , while rival Clinton made a swing through the state on Thursday and Friday .
In addition , former President Bill Clinton made the rounds for his wife in Mississippi over the weekend .
For Mississippi , it 's a moment to bask in the national spotlight .
And for a state with images of a strictly segregated past , the Democratic primary is a chance to alter some long held stereotypes .
" We 're seeing a contest where I think you 're going to see a huge turnout of voters voting either for a woman or an African - American , and that gives us a chance to make a statement , " said Marty Wiseman , a professor of political science at Mississippi State University .

This spring , U.S. mortgage lenders will likely host the biggest blowout sale on foreclosed properties , writes James R. Hagerty and Kris Hudson in Tuesday 's Journal .
While foreclosed homes account for one out of every nine on the market across the U.S. , in some cities -- including Las Vegas and San Diego -- foreclosure - related sales are responsible for more than 40 % of all homes sold in recent months .
This glut of foreclosed properties may pose an opportunity for home buyers .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The final epilogue to the tumultuous writers strike has been written , but Hollywood is bracing for a possible a sequel to the costly walkout -- this one starring film and television actors .

While the TV industry has rushed to bring derailed shows back on the air since screenwriters returned to work three weeks ago , the threat of renewed labor unrest by actors in the months ahead has put movie studios in a tenuous situation .
Filmmakers are reluctant to launch any production that cannot be completed before the expiration of the Screen Actors Guild ’s major film and TV contract on June 30 -- a date being treated as the union ’s de facto strike deadline .
Assuming a typical 60 - day movie shoot , plus extra time for days off , possible overruns and re-shoots that might be necessary , that means few if any big - studio movies will start filming after the end of this month , industry experts say .
“ The studios for the most part are not greenlighting any movies that would have to be in production after that ( June 30 ) deadline , ” said an insider at one leading talent agency who was not authorized to speak publicly about client issues .
Labor jitters have even prompted Hollywood ’s leading insurance carrier , Fireman ’s Fund Insurance Co , to offer a first - of - its - kind “ strike expense ” policy for studios .
The policy covers the costs of a strike - related production shutdown in the event that an actor ’s illness , equipment damage or other unexpected loss pushes the shooting schedule of a movie past SAG ’s June 30 contract deadline .
To qualify , a film must be scheduled to finish shooting by June 15 and already be covered by a so - called completion bond , which insures a movie ’s financial backers against the cost of failing to finish a picture on time and on budget .
STRIKE FATIGUE
Nerves are still raw from a 14 - week strike by 10,500 writers that shut down much of the television industry and derailed numerous film projects , idling thousands of production workers and costing the local economy some $ 3 billion .
The walkout ended February 12 after the two sides reached agreement on a deal giving writers more money for work distributed over the Internet .
The contract was formally ratified by the Writers Guild of America membership last week .
The Screen Actors Guild shares many of the same contract demands .
But SAG also faces issues unique to its 120,000 members , such as forced commercial endorsements through product placement in TV shows and movies .
Many in Hollywood believe strike fatigue is running too high for another work stoppage to materialize .
But with tens of millions of dollars at stake when a film production is disrupted , movie studios are playing it safe .
Some of the industry ’s biggest names are caught up in the uncertainty .
Steven Spielberg has called off the April start to a DreamWorks film about the trial of the 1968 anti-war activists , the Chicago Seven , according to Daily Variety newspaper
Michael Bay , director of the 2007 summer action blockbuster “ Transformers , ” is keeping his fingers crossed as he and DreamWorks stick to an early June start date for a sequel to the movie .
“ If there is a strike , we shut down .
But shutting down is n’t that big a deal , ” Bay told Variety , explaining that he hoped to mitigate the cost of a potential disruption by working out special deals in advance with equipment vendors and sound stages where he would shoot .
Independent producers who rely on third - party financing lack such flexibility because investors require completion bonds , which insurance companies are hesitant to issue for any film that cannot be finished by June 15 .
“ There were a number of projects that we had to surrender on and admit there was just no way to meet the bond deadline , ” producer Paul Schiff , whose credits include “ Rushmore ” and “ Date Movie , ” told the Los Angeles Times .
PRESSURE FOR TALKS
Meanwhile , SAG leaders have come under mounting pressure to open contract talks with the major studios as soon as possible , leading to tensions between the guild and its sister union , the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ( AFTRA ) .
SAG President Alan Rosenberg , who campaigned on a promise to take an aggressive stance at the bargaining table , has insisted the guild will not be ready to begin official talks before early April .
Some leaders of AFTRA and SAG ’s New York wing have agitated for talks to begin sooner , as have several high - profile actors , including George Clooney and Tom Hanks , who met with Rosenberg over dinner last month .
They and other stars also took out full - page ads in Hollywood trade papers calling for immediate negotiations .
And over 1,000 SAG members recently presented Rosenberg with a petition urging the union to limit any voting on a new contract or strike authorization to those members who have worked a specified number of days during the past six years .
Rosenberg said he opposes the idea but would take it to SAG ’s governing board at its next meeting in April .
Rosenberg and SAG executive director Doug Allen recently suggested that informal talks like those that led to contracts with the WGA and the Directors Guild of America , were already under way .
“ We will certainly continue to meet with the CEOs of the major networks and studios as we prepare for formal negotiations , ” they wrote in a February 28 memo to members .

HOUSTON
- The seven astronauts aboard NASA ?s shuttle Endeavour will cast off from the International Space Station ( ISS ) late Monday after a record - long stay at theorbiting laboratory .
Shuttlecommander Dominic Gorie and his crew will undock from the station at 7:56 p.m.EDT ( 2356 GMT ) tonight , wrapping up a packed 12 days of construction to delivera Canadian - built robot and the first module of Japan ?s massiveKibo laboratory .
? I sort oflooked at this flight sort of like a college team looking at MarchMadness ?
every spacewalk was a win , every robotics [ operation ] was a win , ?
Gorietold reporters on Earth during a Sunday crew conference .
?
We ?ve got a greatwinning team .?
Gorie andhis crew launched toward the station on March 11 .
They are set to landWednesday evening at 7:04 p.m. EDT ( 2304 GMT ) at NASA ?s Kennedy Space Center inCape Canaveral , Fla. , to complete a record - setting 16 - day mission to the ISS .
Station andshuttle astronauts will shut the hatches between their two spacecraft at about5:13 p.m. EDT ( 2113 GMT ) today after a brief farewell ceremony .
? We ?ve seensome incredible changes on the station and it ? s been a real privilege to behere and see all that , ? said the station ? s
Expedition16 commander Peggy Whitson , adding that she and crewmate Yuri Malenchenkohave welcomed the addition of three new modules in the last five months .
Aconstruction marathon
Endeavourastronauts performed five spacewalks at the ISS , a new record for a single shuttlevisit , to build the Canadian Space Agency ?s $ 209 - million Dextre maintenancerobot and install the attic - like Japanese Logistics Pressurized Module thatwill provide storage room for Japan ?s main Kibo lab .
? It ?s agreat moment , and it ? s going to open up a new era for Japan and its space program , ? said Japanese astronaut Takao Doi , who installed the Kibo module usingEndeavour ?s robotic arm .
The shuttlealso ferried first - time spaceflyer NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman to the ISS tojoin the station ?s Expedition 16 crew .
? I guess myonly regret is that I ?ve gotten kind of used to hanging out with these guyshere in the blue shirts , ? said Reisman , referring to his former shuttlecrewmates .
? I? m going to miss them .?
Reismanwill serve as a station flight engineer until early June and is replacingEuropean Space Agency ( ESA ) astronautLeopold Eyharts , of France .
Eyharts arrived at the ISS in early Februaryduring an earlier shuttle flight and helped deliver , and later commission , thestation ? s European - built Columbus laboratory .
?
Of course , I would love to stay longer up here on the station , but I think it ? s time forme to go back , ?
Eyharts said Sunday .
BeforeEndeavour pulls away from the space station , pilot Gregory H. Johnson will flythe shuttle around the ISS on a victory lap of sorts while his crewmatesphotograph it from afar .
? I? m justlooking forward to getting to do some hand - flying on the vehicle , ?
Johnsonsaid , adding that Gorie gave him a few pointers earlier on Sunday .

The Globe and Mail is running a somewhat sensationalistic piece about a Canadian university , Lakehead University , that decided to start using Google 's email system to replace its own buggy and frequently crashed offering .
The problem ?
Fears concerning US data privacy laws , such as the Patriot Act , mean that professors are told not to send confidential info , including grades , via email .
This has upset a number of professors who are protesting the use of Google 's products .
There are a few different points that are worth sifting out of this .
First is the question of whether US laws like the Patriot Act , are potentially harming US businesses , as foreign organizations choose not to do business with them due to the implications of those laws .
Chances are likely that this is happening quite frequently , even if those fears are totally overblown with respect to reality .
Of course , it 's not clear why a company like Google does n't just set up local servers in certain countries , like Canada , to deal with local companies -- and then consider those out of the reach of US laws and authorities .
It would seem like a smart business move .
The second question , though , is whether or not the government is really sniffing through everyone 's email .
The article seems to imply that , thanks to the Patriot Act , the feds have open access to Google 's servers .
While you can understand the paranoia , that 's a bit overstated .
The article says : " Using their new powers under the Patriot Act , U.S. intelligence officials can scan documents , pick out certain words and create profiles of the authors . "
That 's not accurate .
Or , rather , it 's leaving out huge parts of how this is done .
The Patriot Act did n't just hand all of Google 's info over to the feds so they can create profiles on anyone .
I 'm not one to defend the Patriot Act , which I think is a terrible piece of legislation , but it does no one any good to make false statements about what it has allowed .
The third question is whether or not Google 's own ad displays next to email is troubling to a university -- which is a bogeyman I thought had been killed back around 2004 .
Given the cost ( free ) to the university , you 'd think they 'd understand the tradeoff .
The " payment " is the ads .
If it 's such a problem , then the university is free to go spend however many millions of dollars on building its own system .
Or , perhaps Google can offer up an ad - free version for paranoid universities .

It ’s income tax time again .
Just like other special occasions , one would expect the green blogosphere to erupt in lists of eco-advice ( see Five Super - Simple Steps to Green Trick - or - Treating or The 12 Green Days of Christmas ) .
Since I can only think of one method to green up tax time ( e- file ) , I will share my thoughts on income taxes and how they could / should benefit the environment instead of creating a list of 5 ways to green your taxes .
Unlike many people I know , I actually do n’t mind paying taxes .
The problem I have with taxes is that I do n’t agree with how the money is spent by the government .
In return for my payment of taxes , I expect peace and health for all world citizens , as I do feel this is our responsibility as a wealthy nation engaged in a global economy .
These expectations are clearly tied to the environment , of which I expect my tax dollars to consider in every expense .
I wish I could choose how my tax money was spent by the government .
I would tell the government not to use any of my money for war , human rights violations , resource exploitation , big oil companies , etc. and instead delineate what percentage of my dollars should be spent on education , universal health care , environment preservation , etc .
I understand it would not be practical to allow Americans to decide how all of their tax money is spent , as a certain amount would need to be set aside for infrastructure , but why could n’t we be given a checklist of prioritized choices to accompany our 1040s ?
Since it is unlikely my ideas of choice will be implemented , I wish that Americans were given more tax credits for living green .
If was I was in charge of the IRS , I would let CFL and carbon credit purchases be used as a deduction , much the way larger energy saving home improvements are allowed currently .
I would give tax credits beyond hybrid vehicles to biofuels , bicycles , and public transportation .
I would give tax credits for people living off the grid , eating organically , recycling , etc .
Our founding fathers fought against taxation without representation .
Although I am technically represented by elected officials , most of which I did not vote for , my ideals are not represented by many of our government ’s policies .
I am not alone in this regard , when considering 81 % of Americans think “ things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track . ”
I believe we have taxation without moral representation .
I wish I was as brave as Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner , documented in An Act of Conscience , who lost their home and freedom in protest of income tax funded war .
This pacifist couple filed 1040s , then donated the money to peace charities instead of the government .
Obviously , I am not a tax expert , but I do insist on self preparing my taxes each year .
I do n’t think our founding fathers in 1862 ( when the first income tax was enacted to fund a war ) or when the 16th Amendment was added in 1913 , envisioned a system so complicated Americans had to hire and pay someone to figure out their income taxes .
I think the time has come to green our taxes by letting the government know how we want our tax money spent .
Perhaps I will send the IRS a list with my taxes this year .

Time to impeach Bush and Cheney
By Ralph Remington
It is high time that all progressive elected officials who take their jobs seriously demand impeachment proceedings against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
This president and his vice president have condoned illegal wiretapping , readings of private e-mails and phone calls , and spying on the American people under the guise of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
They ’ve used surveillance to kidnap people and throw them into dungeons abroad without any political or legal accountability .
They have condoned torture at both Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib .
They have been implicated in the outing of a CIA officer in retaliation for the exposure of going to war under false premises .
They have ignored Congressional authority on several occasions .
They lied to the American public about the reasons for taking our sons and daughters , mothers , and fathers to war .
They have spent over $ 700 billion on a war in a time when over 45 million Americans are without health care ; while at the same time cutting the benefits of veterans who have returned from fighting their “ War of Choice ” .
They have established a presidency and executive branch that does not respect the rule of law .
Bush is , in fact , sneering at the American people and in effect saying , “ I am King ” .
Together Bush and Cheney have flouted the agreement of transparency with the American people .
Our cities , counties , and states are vulnerable because we have allowed a virtual king to be created in Washington , D.C.
If we now have a king at the head of our democratically elected government then we elected officials , on the local , state and national levels are defunct .
Our purpose and our jobs are nothing more than ceremonial .
Congress has allowed the Executive branch of our government to overreach , in the name of politics and fear over what impact impeachment proceedings will have on the upcoming elections in ’08 .
This is not what our founders intended .
It does n’t matter if we ’re approaching an election year or not .
We cannot allow the Executive branch to take on more power than it has ever had .
This is doubly important as we approach a new election because our new executive leaders will inherit more expansive powers than any other President or Vice President in the history of the United States of America ; powers that the founders never intended for them to have , be they Democrat or Republican .
Politicians and political staff are even getting confused .
People are refusing to oppose Bush because they wrongly think that they ’ve taken an oath to the President .
When former White House counsel , Harriet Meirs , did n’t appear before Congress she cited executive privilege .
But what she and others fail to realize is that they have n’t taken an oath of loyalty to the president regardless of what he does , they ’ve taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America .
Those are two entirely different things .
Bush and Cheney have blatantly obstructed a congressional investigation .
And , finally , the commutation of Scooter Libby speaks to a cover - up of gigantic proportions .
We should all be out in the streets .
As musician Gil Scott Heron said , “ The revolution will not be televised ” .
Bush and Cheney should be impeached for political crimes perpetrated in combination .
As John Nichols from The Nation Magazine recently stated , “ Nancy Pelosi is disregarding her oath of office .
She should change course now . ”
The Judiciary Committee should begin impeachment proceedings as soon as possible .
We in city council and at the state legislature should not disregard our oaths .
There are some who say that this does n’t have anything to do with local government .
They are missing the point .
If the president , as the leading representative of our democracy is an outlaw and we , other elected officials , allow that state of affairs to continue , we are also outlaws .
The Minneapolis City Council needs to construct a resolution to recommend impeachment immediately , before it ’s too late .
Our own collective integrity demands it !

A study in Social Science Quarterly says that religious women are less likely to have abortions than secular women - not because they 're more pro-life , but because they 're less likely to get pregnant before marriage .
“ Religious influences on attitudes are much more powerful than religious influences on behavior , ” the authors note .
“ While religion is the main reason for differences in abortion attitudes , religion is a relatively minor reason for differences in abortion behavior . ”
Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , researchers led by Amy Adamczyk , PhD , of John Jay College of Criminal Justice and Jacob Felson of William Paterson University measured sexual behavior and out - of - wedlock pregnancy to religious and denominational affiliation .
The study used multiple religion measures with longitudinal data to examine the influence of religion on abortion behavior .
Researchers found that religious women were less likely to obtain an abortion than secular women , in part because they are less likely to become pregnant before marriage .
Among those who become pregnant before marriage , religious women are more likely than secular women to take the traditional religious path and marry the father of the child , rather than get an abortion .
Because religious women lead a sexually conservative lifestyle , they are less likely to find themselves pregnant and without a potential marriage partner , when abortion may be a particularly appealing option .
Also , religious women are more likely to get married if they become pregnant .

Today , the Supreme Court declined to accept an appeal in a case that asks the question — do terminally ill patients have the right to access to experimental drugs ?:
The Supreme Court today declined to consider whether dying patients have a right to be treated with experimental drugs not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
The court , without comment or recorded dissent , let stand a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit , which said the terminally ill have no constitutional right to drugs the agency had considered safe enough for additional testing .
The challenge was brought by the Washington Legal Foundation and the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs .
The latter organization is headed by Frank Burroughs of Fredericksburg , and named in honor of his daughter , Abigail Burroughs , who was diagnosed at 19 and died at 21 of a form of cancer rare in someone her age .
The young woman died in 2001 , and the drug she was seeking was later approved .
Because , of course , a bureaucrat in Washington has the right to decide if someone who will die anyway should try a risky procedure .
What is particularly distressing about this is that this was n’t a ruling on the merits of the case , it was simply a ruling on whether the court would accept the case for appeal .
All that ’s needed to accept a case is a “ yes ” vote from four of the nine justices .
Which means there are n’t even four members of the Supreme Court willing to give this issue the hearing it deserves .
This issue is personal to me because I have a family member who died from cancer and if there was any chance that an experimental drug or procedure would have prolonged her life , she would ’ve tried it .
She was my mother .
Today , the Supreme Court effectively said that she , and the millions of other people suffering from conditions that will kill them , can just die .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
The U.N. Security Council failed to reach a consensus when it met to consider condemning an attack that killed eight people at a prominent Jewish seminary as an act of terrorism .
Ambulance workers put one of the casualties from the seminary attack into an ambulance .

The council said Libya -- a new , nonpermanent member -- blocked the statement on Thursday night .
Ibrahim Dabbashi , Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , said the attack on the school was no different than Israeli military offensives against militants in Gaza .
But Dan Gillerman , Israel 's ambassador to the United Nations , said he saw no connection between Thursday 's shooting and Israel 's operations in Gaza .
" This is not a story of retaliation , " he said .
" These people have been terrorizing Israel for years , have been carrying out suicide bombings and indiscriminate attacks for years . "
A gunman broke into the Jewish seminary about 8:30 p.m. , spraying automatic - weapons fire , authorities said .
Most of the victims were students in their teens and 20s , medical officials said .
At least nine others were wounded before an off - duty Israel Defense Forces officer fatally shot the gunman , Jerusalem District Police commander Aharon Franko said .
The gunman was carrying an AK - 47 and a pistol -- and had time to swap weapons during the massacre .
Police are trying to identify the gunman and figure out how he managed , while drawing little notice , to enter the large three - story school in a bustling residential neighborhood .
" There was no alert or warning about this attack , " Franko said .
Watch the immediate aftermath of the attack »
A first responder said the bodies were on the floor of the study hall surrounded by holy books .
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack .
Video from Thursday 's scene showed a frantic crowd of rescue workers carrying bloodied victims into ambulances .
Dozens of police officers were scouring the campus and streets around the yeshiva in case there were other gunmen .
Outside the school , scores of Israeli men gathered from surrounding neighborhoods , demanding justice for the attack .
Authorities are calling the incident at west Jerusalem 's Merkaz Harav yeshiva an act of terrorism .
The school is one of the largest seminaries in Israel , with about 500 students in the yeshiva and 200 in an advanced graduate program .
" Israel is at the forefront of the struggle against terrorism and will continue to defend its citizens , who are exposed to this threat on a daily basis , " Israel 's Foreign Ministry said in a written statement .
" Israel expects the nations of the world to support it in its war against those who murder students , women and children , by any means and with respect for neither place nor target . "
President Bush backed Israeli leaders in a statement issued Thursday , saying , " I condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack in Jerusalem that targeted innocent students at the Merkaz Harav yeshiva .
This barbaric and vicious attack on innocent civilians deserves the condemnation of every nation . "
But Libya's Dabbashi compared the attack with " bloodshed in the Palestinian territory . "
" For us , the human lives are the same .
We judge the incident itself , " Dabbashi told reporters after the Security Council meeting .
" When we have to condemn the killing of the Israeli civilians , we also have to look at what 's happening in Gaza . "
Jerusalem security increased
Security was bolstered , with thousands of additional officers across Jerusalem and the rest of Israel , authorities said .
Meanwhile , celebratory shooting took place in Gaza City after the news of the attack , with hundreds chanting and clapping in the streets .
But Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas criticized the killings .
" The Palestinian Authority condemns any attack on innocent civilians , " Abbas ' office said in a written statement .
The shootings came just a day after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who met with both Israelis and Palestinians , announced that peace talks will resume between the two sides .
Abbas suspended peace negotiations last week after fierce fighting broke out between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza , but he agreed to resume negotiations after meeting with Rice .
Israel will continue peace talks with the Palestinians regardless of the attack in Jerusalem , Foreign Ministry spokesman Aryeh Mekel said Thursday .
Israel conducted a large - scale operation in Gaza to hunt down Palestinian militants who have been firing dozens of rockets into Israel .
At least 70 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed during the operation , Israeli and Palestinian sources said .
Militants also fired at least 25 rockets toward Israel , wounding at least two civilians .
" This operation came directly after the attack committed inside Gaza .
This operation is a normal response , " said Fawzi Barhoom , a Hamas spokesman in Gaza .
Watch Barhoom 's reaction to the attack »
Gillerman said the Security Council should condemn the attack .
" They are so , so quick sometimes to criticize Israel for defending itself .
I would like to see those members convene as we speak in order to condemn this in the strongest possible terms . "
Thursday 's attack was the worst inside Israel since April 17 , 2006 , when a suicide bombing outside a falafel restaurant in Tel Aviv killed nine people .
Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for that attack .
Attacks in Jerusalem are rare .
Eight people were wounded August 10 in the Old City when a Palestinian resident grabbed a security guard 's gun and fired ; and four Israeli security guards were wounded May 26 when two Palestinian gunmen began firing in east Jerusalem .
All three of the assailants were killed .

VISITORS to France have always had to watch out for strikes that might disrupt their holidays or business trips .
So far this year air - traffic controllers , taxi drivers and ( this week ) dockers have walked out .
Last November it was the railwaymen .
Plus ça change , you might think .
But the pattern of French industrial action is changing .
A study commissioned by the labour ministry found that the number of days lost to strikes has fallen since the late 1990s — yet the number of French firms hit by industrial disputes went up by roughly half between 1998 and 2004 .
That is because workers now favour short , sharp walkouts lasting less than a day , and these fail to register in the official figures .
They inflict the maximum disruption with the minimum loss of workers ' pay .
In a world of just - in - time production , a just - in - time walkout , or a union meeting that strays beyond the break , can wreak havoc and put pressure on management .
Workers at Toray Plastics Europe , in south - east France , won a dispute this way last month .
Technology is also transforming traditional industrial disputes .
Blogs are being used to draw outside attention to disputes within companies and win support from consumers , politicians and the local community .
Workers at a subsidiary of Fnac , a retailer , used a blog to rally support and gather evidence for a redundancy protest , which they then took to employment tribunals .
Workers at a Savoy furniture firm used a blog in a campaign that won them an improved redundancy offer .
At La Redoute , another store chain , workers have set up a blog called “ On redoute La Redoute ” ( we fear La Redoute ) to stay informed about possible closures of branches and call centres , and to organise resistance .
The internet allows expressions of discontent to be aggregated , giving workers the opportunity to stage protests without actually going on strike .
The most dramatic example came last September in Italy , at the local arm of IBM .
About 2,000 employees of the computer giant — logging on from home to dodge legal problems — staged a virtual protest against a new pay settlement at IBM 's corporate campus in Second Life , an online virtual world .
A month later the head of IBM Italy resigned and the RSU union agreed on a new pay deal .
This innovative use of the internet was recognised with an award at the Forum Netxplorateur , a conference held in Paris in February .
The award was presented by the president of Microsoft France .
The leglike pectoral fin for walking is the clue that this newly found fish is an anglerfish , even though it does not have a lure on its head for attracting prey .
Its flat face and forward - looking eyes are just two of a host of reasons why University of Washington professor Ted Pietsch thinks the fish found in January probably represents a new family of vertebrate animals .

A fish that would rather crawl into crevices than swim , and that may be able to see in the same way that humans do , could represent an entirely unknown family of fishes , says a University of Washington fish expert .
The fish , sighted in Indonesian waters off Ambon Island , has tan- and peach - colored zebra-striping , and rippling folds of skin that obscure its fins , making it look like a glass sculpture that Dale Chihuly might have dreamed up .
But far from being hard and brittle like glass , the bodies of these fist - sized fish are soft and pliable enough to slip and slide into narrow crevices of coral reefs .
It ’s probably part of the reason that they 've typically gone unnoticed – until now .
The individuals are undoubtedly anglerfishes , says Ted Pietsch , a UW professor of aquatic and fishery sciences who has published 150 scholarly articles and several books on anglerfishes and is the world 's leading authority on them .
In the last 50 years scientists have described only five new families of fishes and none of them were even remotely related to anglerfishes , Pietsch says .
Husband and wife Buck and Fitrie Randolph , with dive guide Toby Fadirsyair , found and photographed an individual Jan. 28 in Ambon harbor .
A second adult has since been seen and two more – small , and obviously juveniles – were spotted March 26 , off Ambon .
One of the adults laid a mass of eggs , just spotted Tuesday .
The Randolphs are part - owners of Maluku Divers , a land - based dive facility in Ambon City .
Toby Fadirsyair , who works for Maluku Divers , said he may have seen something similar 10 or 15 years ago but the coloring was different .
Reference books were consulted but nothing similar to the fish photographed in January was found .
Seeking international fish experts eventually led them to Pietsch .
" As soon as I saw the photo I knew it had to be an anglerfish because of the leglike pectoral fins on its sides , " Pietsch says .
" Only anglerfishes have crooked , leglike structures that they use to walk or crawl along the seafloor or other surfaces . "
Anglerfishes – also called by names like frogfishes and toadfishes – are found the world over and typically have lures growing from their foreheads that they wave or cause to wiggle in order to attract prey .
Get too close to the lure and you 're lunch .
The newly found individuals have no lures so they seek their prey differently , burrowing themselves into crevices and cracks of coral reefs in search of food .
" Several times I saw these fish work themselves through an opening that seemed much smaller than the fish , sometimes taking a minute or more to get all the way through , " says David Hall , an underwater natural history photographer who was able to dive with Maluku Divers and take additional photos of the new find .
" They must have pretty tough skin to keep from being scraped and cut , but there is no evidence of superficial injury or scars in my photographs . "
With its unusual flattened face , the fish 's eyes appear to be directed forward , something Pietsch says he 's never seen in 40 years as an icthyologist , a scientist who studies the structure , classification and habits of fishes .
Most fishes have eyes on either side of their head so that each eye sees something different .
Only very few fishes have eyes whose radius of vision overlaps in front , providing binocular vision , a special attribute well developed in humans that provides the ability to accurately judge distance .
Randolph , a longtime diver , says the similar color pattern of the two adults surprises him because he typically sees variations in skin color between members of the same anglerfish species and has even seen individual anglerfish that change colors depending on the surroundings .
Whether the new fish represent a new family will entail DNA testing and a close examination of a specimen , says Pietsch , whose anglerfish work is currently funded by the National Science Foundation .
Scientists have already described 18 different families of anglerfishes and this is probably a 19th , Pietsch says .
Families are large groupings , for example , all dog species belong to the larger family that includes wolves , coyotes and , even , hyenas .
One can see an example of an anglerfish family , the one named Antennariidae , at www.tolweb.org/Antennariidae/21993 , a part of the Tree of Life Web project .
When only a single fish had been sighted , Randolph and Andy Shorten , co-owner of Maluku Divers , kept the find quiet to protect the animal .
With more individuals being found , and having a better idea of where to look to find others , the two became comfortable enough to post images on the firm 's Web site , see www.divingmaluku.com/new-frogfish.
" Seeking out these fish is probably going to be like the Holy Grail of divers for a while , " Shorten says .
Indeed just do a Google search for " new frogfish Ambon " on the Internet and up pops a lot of dive sites carrying news of the find .
" I do n't think it will turn out that there are a lot of these animals but all that scrutiny will help us find out for sure , " Shorten says .
For example , 35 years ago nobody realized pygmy seahorses existed but once they were discovered and people understood where to look for them , they turned out to be widespread throughout the ocean .
The fish were seen in 15 feet of water .
It 's possible the fish could be found at other locations , Pietsch says .
All other anglerfish families have ranges broader than a single island group and ocean conditions like those at Ambon are found at various places across Indo - Australian waters .

Do n't believe the hype .
It 's not just Flavor Flav 's catchphrase , it 's good advice for parents , teachers , police , and anyone else concerned about the threat of Internet predators .
According to a new study by researchers at the University of New Hampshire 's Crimes Against Children Research Center , most of what you think about Web - based sex predators is probably wrong .
The study , published in the February / March issue of the journal American Psychologist and titled , " Online ' Predators ' and Their Victims : Myths , Realities and Implications for Prevention , " was based on three surveys : two of teen Internet users , and one involving hundreds of interviews with law enforcement officials .
The results reveal that " the stereotype of the Internet ' predator ' who uses trickery and violence to assault children is largely inaccurate . "
Much of the public 's concern comes from fear - mongering journalism .
While TV shows like NBC ’s " To Catch a Predator " and the " Today Show " gain high ratings scaring parents into thinking that threats to children lurk around every corner and abound on the Web , the reality is quite the opposite .
Among the study 's findings :
Myth # 1 : The sexual abuse of children has jumped , largely because of the surge in Internet predators .
Despite popular belief ( and a fact - challenged 2001 " Newsweek " magazine headline that claimed that the Internet has created a " shocking increase in childhood exploitation of children " ) , sex assaults on teens dropped significantly ( more than 50 percent ) between 1990 and 2005 .
Ironically , it is the alarmist news coverage of sex offenses that has jumped dramatically over the past decade — not the attacks themselves .
Myth # 2 : Internet predators are a new threat to children .
In fact , the largest threat to children always has been , and remains , the child 's parents and caregivers .
Children are in far more danger of being abused , kidnapped , or killed by their parents than any stranger on the street or on the Web .
While the Internet is a new way for some predators to find victims , if the Internet had not been invented they would have found victims in other ways — at home , school , or church , for example .
Myth # 3 : Children should not interact with strangers online because of the potential for abuse .
If there is one thing that the Internet does better than anything else , it is connecting people who do n't know each other .
That 's the magic of the World Wide Web ; it 's just as easy to communicate online with someone around the block as around the world .
Of course everyone ( including kids and teens ) should be careful about divulging personal information , but in virtual life , just as in real life , the vast majority of strangers are not a threat .
Myth # 4 : Most Internet predators are pedophiles .
The public largely assumes that people looking for sex online are targeting young children , but that 's not true .
In fact , most predators seek relationships and sex from teens and adolescents , not from younger children .
Myth # 5 : Internet predators often use deception to abduct and forcibly rape their victims .
The reality is that Web predators rarely use deception ; most victims are well aware that the person they are communicating with online is an adult interested in sex .
The predators rarely trick or force their victims into sex ; they do n't need to because the victims often voluntarily meet with them , intending to have sex .
Most Web predators are guilty of statutory — not forcible — rape because the victim is under the age of consent .
Misplaced concern
There is no doubt that Internet predators are real , and do pose a threat .
But the real danger is the public 's deeply flawed understanding of the problem .
" To prevent these crimes , we need accurate information about their true dynamics , " said Janis Wolak , lead author of the study .
" The things that we hear and fear and the things that actually occur may not be the same . "
Until the news media start accurately characterizing child sexual abuse and the real dangers of Internet predation , America 's children will remain at greater risk .

South Korea loves Starcraft .
People here still play the decade old game online and matches are always played on TV .
South Korea also has a broad selection of English training books that go from your basic workbook to well …
Starcraft English !
Yes , through the magic of Starcraft you can boost your English vocabulary .
While the concept seems strange , Starcraft English is actually brilliant .
It ’s designed for hardcore fans who immediately know what a Zealot is regardless of the “ difficulty ” of the word or the language barrier .
( Note : Starcraft was only released in English in Korea ! )
Let ’s take a look at how Starcraft English works .
The book is divided into three segments .
The first portion goes through the different units and intelligently breaks words apart and pulls out word stems .
Protoss has the “ proto ” prefix , which can be used for a bunch of English words like prototype .
Underneath the English word there is an equivalent in Hangul .
We ’ve got the same train of thought going on for Hydralisk , which has the “ hydra ” prefix .
Not all of the units or skills are easy to break down , but Starcraft English goes through all of them .
Look at what they thought up for the Defiler .
“ Defile a holy place with blood . ”
OK !
And that picture on the right is priceless .
After reading about the meaning behind the units Starcraft English explains the audio conversations that play when you click on the units .
Every quote is pulled apart , including the jokes .
Some have happy drawings like this one for the Firebat sound byte .
Part three picks apart all the little things like menus , the copyright information and common strategies like “ dealing with a flood of zerglings . ”
It even explains the meaning of Blizzard and related weather terms .
OK , so you probably wo n’t be fluent in English from reading Starcraft English , but it ’s a clever idea that capitalizes on the popularity of Blizzard ’s game .
Also it ’s the only English training book I ’ve ever seen based on a video game .
I ’ve seen books on how to learn English by watching Prison Break and even one based on Gundam , but Starcraft English is out of this world .

Because the hunt for the fabled Amber Room , regarded as one of Russia 's truly great art treasures , could be over .
The Amber Room , so - called for its ornate amber panels , was kept in Russia for more than 200 years , before it was looted by the Nazis during the Second World War .
Its treasures and amber panels were spirited away to Germany , but the exact location of it was lost in the chaos that engulfed Germany at the end of the war .
The mystery of its resting place has fuelled 50 years of hunting , debating and conspiracy theorising .
But despite the large following of hunters , it had seemed that not even Indiana Jones could lay its mystery to rest .
Until now .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A group of German treasure hunters now claims to have located the Amber Room in an underground cavern near Germany 's border with the Czech Republic .
If the claim turns out to be true , it could put an end to one of the greatest treasure hunts of modern history .
What is the Amber Room ?
The Amber Room was an ornately decorated chamber created by Prussian and Russian craftsmen in the 18th century .
The intricacy and detail of the design have led some to describe it as the eighth wonder of the world .
It was handed to the Russian Tsar , Peter the Great , by the Prussian King , Frederick Wilhelm I , in 1716 .
It was then kept in Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo , St Petersburg , until the palace was over - run by the Nazis in 1941 .
They then packed the contents of the Amber Room into 27 crates before destroying the palace and taking the Amber Room to the German city of Königsberg , near the Baltic Sea .
That is where it was last seen in 1945 .
Ever since , treasure hunters across Europe have dedicated their lives to finding it , while researchers have been trying to work out exactly what happened to the precious decorations .
How was the latest claim discovered ?
The latest claim to have solved the riddle has come from a group of German hopefuls , who say they have discovered two tonnes of Nazi gold in an underground man-made cavern near the village of Deutschneudorf , on Germany 's border with the Czech Republic .
The team believes the material in the chamber to be gold after conducting an electromagnetic test .
They are now excavating the area .
One of the group , the 53 - year - old mayor of Deutschneudorf , Heinz - Peter Haustein , has been searching for the Amber Room in the region for 10 years , spending tens of thousands of euros in the process .
He claims the area is home to a maze of underground Nazi storage rooms .
He also believes the Nazis hid valuable items there at the end of the war .
When Christian Hanisch came across the co-ordinates of the cavern while looking through some documents left by his father , a Luftwaffe signaller , he and Mr Haustein became convinced they were on to a winner .
Is it the real thing ?

We wo n't know for weeks yet , as the digging site first has to be made safe before the underground cavern can be reached .
In true treasure - hunt style , the site will also be checked for booby traps .
But Mr Haustein is confident .
He says he is " well over 90 per cent sure " the find really is the genuine Amber Room .
But there are plenty of followers of the Amber Room tale who will have heard that before .
Many have claimed to have found the treasure over the past 50 years and , so far , all have proved to be false alarms .
There have been some genuine finds , though .
One of the panels from the Amber Room was found by German police in 1997 .
What are the most popular theories on the Amber Room ?
There are many theories detailing exactly what became of the Amber Room .
Needless to say , many do n't believe the most straightforward explanations .
One has it that it was destroyed when the British bombed Königsberg .
Another suggests it was burnt during a fire at Königsberg Castle .
The castle was thought to be housing parts of the Amber Room at the time .
Some believe that it was lost at sea when a German boat carrying them was torpedoed .
Another suggests that Russian soldiers burnt it .
If all the past claims are to be believed , the Amber Room has turned up periodically in Germany , and also in Lithuania .
A couple of British investigative journalists took up the mystery in recent times , even consulting Russian archives .
They released their finding s in a book in 2004 .
Their conclusion ?
That the room had been destroyed in the Königsberg Castle fire , just before the city was taken by Soviet forces .
What are the wilder theories ?
Just like any other mystery , the story of the Amber Room has attracted some pretty dubious theories on its disappearance .
Even Mr Haustein's idea that the Nazis had time for a secret dumping mission at a time when their resources were stretched to their limits seems far - fetched .
But the speculation does n't stop there .
Some even say that the search for the Amber Room is cursed .
One story has it that an investigator who claimed to have uncovered a radio message detailing the fate of the Amber Room was then found dead , apparently struck down by the curse .
But the wildest theory has to be that upon Hitler 's death , his body was never burnt , but was buried with the Amber Room .
If that 's true , the latest team could be in for a grim discovery when they reach their target .
Is n't there an Amber Room in Russia ?
Anyone who has visited Tsarskoye Selo , near St Petersburg , will know that the Amber Room seems to be fine and well , and on display in the partially restored Catherine Palace .
But do n't be fooled – it is an exact replica , painstakingly recreated to coincide with the 300th anniversary of St Petersburg in 2003 .
The replica took more than 20 years and six tonnes of amber to complete , and needed a large donation from a German company in 1999 to finish .
It was such a proud occasion that Vladimir Putin and the then German chancellor Gerhard Schröder attended its unveiling .
Will this discovery end the debate ?
Do n't bet on it .
So much attention has been focused on the mystery of the Amber Room that unless water - tight proof is provided , there are plenty of people willing to keep on looking .
Even Mr Haustein is hedging his bets .
He says that if his discovery turns out not to be the genuine Amber Room , it should provide clues about where to look next .
And there are lots of places to look , as the region on the German and Czech border is criss - crossed with old copper , tin and silver mines .
Better start digging .
Could the Amber Room still be around somewhere , waiting to be discovered ?
Yes ...
* A genuine panel was found in 1997 , suggesting that at least a few other pieces might still be around
* The latest discovery is based on co-ordinates and high - tech tests .
There 's something down there
* The region is full of underground caverns , which could have been used as storage facilities by the Nazis
No ...
* Anyone who has spent a fortune and a decade searching for something has a vested interest in claiming to have succeeded
* A comprehensive study of the fate of the Amber Room concluded it had been burnt in a fire during the Second World War
* With all those people looking for it , surely it would have been found by now if it really was still around ?

( October 24 ) Play video
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - President Bush on Monday nominated Ben Bernanke to succeed Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , whose term is set to expire at the end of January .
Bernanke , currently chairman of the president 's Council of Economic Advisers and a former Fed governor , was widely considered one of the leading candidates for the job .
In Washington , Bush praised Bernanke for speeches that included " keen insight and clear , simple language , " a possible hint that he expects Bernanke to be slightly less confusing than Greenspan , who was often criticized for talking in nebulous language laden with economic jargon .
Wall Street seemed to like the move .
Stocks rallied as news leaked about Bernanke 's nomination .
But Bernanke will have big shoes to fill following Greenspan , who earned the nickname of the Maestro for his steering of the economy during his more than 18 - year tenure as Fed chair .
Expected to be confirmed easily Still , Barry Ritholtz , chief market strategist with Maxim Group , a New York - based money management firm , said investors appear to be pleased with the decision since Bernanke is a well - known and respected economist .
He added that he sees no reason why Bernanke would not be approved by the Senate .
" This is much more John Roberts than Harriet Miers , " Ritholtz said , referring to the relatively smooth confirmation process for Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts and the controversy surrounding Miers , Bush 's choice to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor .
" He is a known entity that is well - respected on the academic side , in Washington and by the stock market . "
To that end , Richard Shelby , a Republican Senator from Alabama and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , lauded the selection .
" Dr. Bernanke is an eminently qualified and superb choice for the nomination of Federal Reserve Chairman .
He is extremely well - versed in monetary policy issues and has earned tremendous respect and confidence from policymakers in this country and around the world , " he said in a statement .
Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York , a member of the Senate Banking Committee , also praised Bernanke .
" We need a careful , non-ideological person who understands that the Federal Reserve 's main job is to fight inflation and Ben Bernanke seems to fit that bill , " Schumer said in a statement .
But he added that it will be important to find out at the confirmation hearing if Bernanke would " adopt the Greenspan model of flexibility in monetary policy that has served our economy so well . "
Like Greenspan , Bernanke is known for his tough stance on fighting inflation , namely that the central bank will move to nip pricing pressure in the bud with interest rate hikes when there is any sign of accelerating inflation .
With that in mind , many expect that Bernanke 's view on interest rates should be similar to Greenspan's .
And Bernanke stressed at Monday 's announcement that he would not differ too much from Greenspan .
" If I am confirmed to his position , my first priority will be to maintain continuity with the policies and policy strategies established during the Greenspan years , " he said .
" I 'll do everything in my power , in collaboration with my Fed colleagues , to help ensure the continued prosperity and stability of the American economy . "
More of a hawk on inflation ?
The Fed has raised short - term interest rates 11 times starting in late June of last year in a bid to keep inflation in check .
But economists are now debating whether the Fed is close to stopping or if inflation remains a major threat .
And some expressed concerned about comments Bernanke made in a speech as Fed governor that suggested he would consider actually sparking higher inflation in order to combat the threat of deflation , or falling prices that can cripple the economy .
" The U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost , " Bernanke said in remarks to the National Economists Club in Washington in November 2002 .
" By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services , " he said .
During that speech , Bernanke added that " prevention of deflation remains preferable to having to cure it .
If we do fall into deflation , however , we can take comfort that the logic of the printing press example must assert itself , and sufficient injections of money will ultimately always reverse a deflation . "
Those remarks could raise some concerns about his approach to monetary policy , said Chip Hanlon , president of Delta Global Advisors , an investment advisory firm in Huntington Beach , Calif .
" He 's going to find it difficult to distance himself from his printing press comments , " said Hanlon .
Then there 's the question of Bernanke 's support for so - called inflation targets .
" Maybe he will act more to target inflation and be more strict " than Greenspan was , Hanlon added .
But Mark Zandi , chief economist with Economy.com , a research Web site , said that even if Bernanke were to adopt specific inflation targets , that would not be that much of a departure since he thinks the Greenspan Fed has been aiming for an unofficial target of annual " core " inflation between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent for the past few years .
Zandi added that despite the market 's short - term unhappiness with the Fed 's rate hikes , investors still would rather have someone in the mold of Greenspan , in other words , someone who wo n't let inflation get out of control .
" Wall Street is happy with Bernanke 's seemingly hawkish stance .
At the end of the day for stocks and bonds , what matters most is low and stable inflation , " Zandi said .
" Ultimately , if you err on the side of being dovish it will only come with more pain from slower growth .
The hit to growth would be more substantial from higher inflation than from interest rate hikes . "
Big shoes to fill Still , Ritholtz said that faced with concerns of a slowing economy as well as price increases in energy and food , Bernanke , if approved , will face some tough challenges ahead .
" He will be dealing with a combination of a slowing economy , inflation pressures and a tumultuous stock market , " Ritholtz said .
So all eyes will be on Bernanke to see if he can also keep the economy on solid footing .
Greenspan , who became
Fed chair in 1987 , was widely praised for his handling of several economic problems , such as the 1987 market crash , a real estate collapse in the early 1990s , the crisis in Asian , Latin American and Russian markets in 1997 and 1998 and the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks .
One economist expressed concerns that Bernanke , who has spent most of his career in the academic world , may lack some of the " real world " experience that Greenspan was able to use as Fed chair .
Before serving as Fed chair , Greenspan spent several decades as the head of an economic consulting firm in New York and served as a director for many large corporations .
" Despite Bernanke 's sharp macroeconomic intellect we 're afraid that he may not be able to conduct monetary policy with the virtuosity of a maestro , " wrote Richard Yamarone , director of economic research for Argus Research Corp. in a report Monday .
He added that " Greenspan 's ability to accurately appreciate economic conditions is due to his expansive experience as a practical economist . "
But Bill Davison , managing director of fixed income with Hartford Investment Management , said he was not worried about Bernanke 's background .
" During volatile periods in the market you do n't want to rely on academic theory .
You want to rely on market practitioners .
But Bernanke seems like a smart guy who has been around the Fed process and I do n't anticipate he would make big mistakes in volatile situations , " he said .
Davison added that he expected Bernanke to continue the recent spirit of openness in the Fed that has marked Greenspan 's tenure .
In recent years , the Fed has given a lot more information to the markets about its rate decisions -- in a much more timely fashion .
In other words , Davison thinks Bush came to the conclusion that if it ain't broke , do n't fix it .
And that 's a good thing .
" Bush has insured a smooth transition with the least amount of disruption to Fed policy , " Davison said .
" That 's what the market needed . "

Creationism is Bullshit ! & The Bible is Bullshit !
For your viewing pleasure , here are two episodes of Penn & Teller ’s TV show “ Bullshit ! ” .
The first episode is “ Creationism is Bullshit ! ” .
The second is “ The Bible is Bullshit ! ”
Now , I ca n’t say that I ’m the biggest fan of Penn & Teller ’s brand of Libertarianism , however their irreligiousness and their magic shows , I can definitely get behind .
In terms of the first video on Creationism , I think the episode was great , but could have been so much better had they interviewed Elliott Sober .
If you want to read the absolutely definitive work on why Intelligent Design is neither a scientific theory nor a viable alternative to evolution , I strongly recommend you read his chapter in the book Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Religion ( edited by William Edward Mann ) .
Sober ’s piece uses pure logic and mathematics to prove that the arguments of Intelligent Design theorists like Michael Behe ( who does a lot of work on so - called ‘ irreducible complexity ’ ) are exemplars of a poverty of thought .
If you do n’t have time to read Sober ’s article ( lazy bastards ! lol ) , I ’ll relay my favourite part of the chapter .
Basically , he proves , using Beye ’s Theorem , that the argument for God ’s existence based on Irreducible Complexity ( or arguments based on other observed phenomenon such as ‘ cosmic design ’ ) are tautological , circular and useless .
For you math people in the crowd , basically it goes like this :
Now if you did n’t follow that , do n’t worry , I probably would n’t have either .
But read the chapter and then you can impress your friends by throwing that out there .
Anyway , without further adieu , I give you the glorious sacrilege :
Penn & Teller : Creationism is Bullshit !
Penn & Teller : The Bible is Bullshit !

' Exhaustive ' Pentagon - sponsored study finds no Saddam - Qaeda link Mike Sheehan
Published : Monday March 10 , 2008
|
Print This Email This After reviewing hundreds of thousands of captured Iraqi documents , a Pentagon - sponsored review has found no evidence of operational links between Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein and the al - Qaeda terror network , a McClatchy article reports .
The " exhaustive " study found that Saddam Hussein did provide some support to other terrorist groups but , as Warren Strobel writes for McClatchy , " his security services were directed primarily against Iraqi exiles , Shiite Muslims , Kurds and others he considered enemies of his regime . "
Strobel reiterates that the new study " found no documents indicating a ' direct operational link ' between Hussein 's Iraq and al Qaida before the invasion , " according to an unnamed US official .
The study is due to Congress and for general release by midweek .
As is well known , President George W. Bush and his administration freely connected Saddam and al - Qaeda as a key pretense for the invasion of Iraq after the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Polls indicated that a large majority of Americans believed the president 's assertion .
In the time since then , the Saddam / al - Qaeda tie has been criticized and deconstructed in the press and blogosphere and by study panels , but the upcoming Pentagon report promises to be a particularly stark and thorough refutation of one of the primary Bush administration arguments for the invasion of Iraq .
The subsequent war has come at the cost of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives , nearly 4,000 US troop deaths , and some half a trillion US dollars and counting .
Bush and his staff still tie Saddam 's Iraq and al - Qaeda , despite previously released documents and reports indicating the same findings as the forthcoming extensive review .
As recently as last April , Vice President Dick Cheney again asserted a link between the Iraqi dictator and the terror network .
Further excerpts from Strobel 's article for McClatchy , available in full at this link , follow ... # Then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld claimed in September 2002 that the United States had " bulletproof " evidence of cooperation between the radical Islamist terror group and Saddam 's secular dictatorship .
Then - Secretary of State Colin Powell cited multiple linkages between Saddam and al Qaida in a watershed February 2003 speech to the United Nations Security Council to build international support for the invasion .
Almost every one of the examples Powell cited turned out to be based on bogus or misinterpreted intelligence .
...
The new study , entitled " Saddam and Terrorism : Emerging Insights from Captured Iraqi Documents " , was essentially completed last year and has been undergoing what one U.S. intelligence official described as a " painful " declassification review .

The issue of al Qaida in Iraq already has played a role in the 2008 presidential campaign .
Sen . John McCain , the presumptive GOP nominee , mocked Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill , recently for saying that he'd keep some U.S. troops in Iraq if al Qaida established a base there .
" I have some news .
Al Qaida is in Iraq , " McCain told supporters .
Obama retorted that , " There was no such thing as al Qaida in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade . "
( In fact , al Qaida in Iraq did n't emerge until 2004 , a year after the invasion . ) #

Air Bubbling Dyson vacuums work on the principle of
The limitation of cyclonic separation is that it can't get rid of particles less than some size from the air .
A technique which could remove all particles would be to bubble the water sucked in by a vacuum cleaner through some water .
That would cause all the particulates ( and some noxious gases ) to get dissolved in the water , which could easily be removed when you were done cleaning .
My suspicion is that this technique would require a lot of power to force the air under water , but that it would be quite effective .
It might also work well as a standing system in a house , by having an air purifier which is constantly sucking up air from around a house and bubbling it through a central water tank , and periodically flushing the tank .

Good idea , but
The problem with it is that it is very inconvenient .
You can't just pull it out of the closet for a quick vacuum , you need to fill the water reservoir , drain it when you are through , then clean it .
Good idea , but 72 years too late .
I bought one in the 80s , and it worked great ; you could watch the motes in a sunbeam just disappear from the air within seconds of turning it on in a room .

I use such a thing .
The maintenance is not trivial , still tolerable once a week .
I was dreaming about something low - power constantly - working and noiseless to instantly clean the air , but I am not aware of anything commercially available .

What about spraying droplets of water into the center of the separator ?
Water and dust could come together into drops of mud that would be large enough to collect .
Another approach would be to put an electrostatic precipitator after the cyclonic separator -- I think some coal - fired power plants do this for ash .

There is a company called rainbow that does it .
Sadly , they are only sold through MLM or second hand .

A storm swept the world in 1968 .
It started in Vietnam , then blew across Asia , crossing the sea and the mountains to Europe and beyond .
A brutal war waged by the US against a poor south - east Asian country was seen every night on television .
The cumulative impact of watching the bombs drop , villages on fire and a country being doused with napalm and Agent Orange triggered a wave of global revolts not seen on such a scale before or since .
If the Vietnamese were defeating the world 's most powerful state , surely we , too , could defeat our own rulers : that was the dominant mood among the more radical of the 60s generation .
In February 1968 , the Vietnamese communists launched their famous
Tet offensive , attacking US troops in every major South Vietnamese city .
The grand finale was the sight of Vietnamese guerrillas occupying the US embassy in Saigon ( Ho Chi Minh City ) and raising their flag from its roof .
It was undoubtedly a suicide mission , but incredibly courageous .
The impact was immediate .
For the first time a majority of US citizens realised that the war was unwinnable .
The poorer among them brought Vietnam home that same summer in a revolt against poverty and discrimination as black ghettoes exploded in every major US city , with returned black GIs playing a prominent part .
The single spark set the world alight .
In March 1968 , students at Nanterre University in France came out on to the streets and the 22 March Movement was born , with two Daniels ( Cohn - Bendit and Bensaid , Nanterre students then , and both still involved in green or leftist politics ) challenging the French lion : Charles de Gaulle , the aloof , monarchical president of the Fifth Republic who , in a puerile outburst , would later describe as chie - en - lit - " shit in the bed " - the events in France that came close to toppling him .
The students began by demanding university reforms and moved on to revolution .
That same month in London , a demonstration against the Vietnam war marched to the US embassy in Grosvenor Square .
It turned violent .
Like the Vietnamese , we wanted to occupy the embassy , but mounted police were deployed to protect the citadel .
Clashes occurred and the US senator Eugene McCarthy watching the images demanded an end to a war that had led , among other things , to " our embassy in Europe 's friendliest capital " being constantly besieged .
Compared with the ferment elsewhere , Britain was a sideshow ( " ... in sleepy London
Town there 's just no place for a street fighting man , " Mick Jagger sang later that year ) : university occupations and riots in Grosvenor Square did not pose any real threat to the Labour government , which backed the US but refused to send troops to Vietnam .
In France , the existentialist philosopher Jean - Paul Sartre was at the peak of his influence .
Contrary to Stalinist apologists , he argued that there was no reason to prepare for happiness tomorrow at the price of injustice , oppression or misery today .
What was required was improvement now .
By May , the Nanterre students ' uprising had spread to Paris and to the trade unions .
We were preparing the first issue of The Black Dwarf as the French capital erupted on May 10 .
Jean - Jacques Lebel , our teargassed Paris correspondent , was ringing in reports every few hours .
He told us : " A well - known French football commentator is sent to the Latin Quarter to cover the night 's events and reported , ' Now the CRS [ riot police ] are charging , they 're storming the barricade - oh my God !
There 's a battle raging .
The students are counter - attacking , you can hear the noise - the CRS are retreating .
Now they 're regrouping , getting ready to charge again .
The inhabitants are throwing things from their windows at the CRS - oh !
The police are retaliating , shooting grenades into the windows of apartments ...'
The producer interrupts : ' This can't be true , the CRS do n't do things like that !'
" ' I 'm telling you what I 'm seeing ...'
His voice goes dead .
They have cut him off . "
The police failed to take back the Latin Quarter , now renamed the Heroic Vietnam Quarter .
Three days later a million people occupied the streets of Paris , demanding an end to the rottenness of the state and plastering the walls with slogans : " Defend The Collective Imagination " , " Beneath The Cobble - stones The Beach " , " Commodities Are The Opium Of The People , Revolution Is The Ecstasy Of History " .
Eric Hobsbawm wrote in The Black Dwarf : " What France proves is when someone demonstrates that people are not powerless , they may begin to act again . "
I had been planning to head for Paris - it was something we had been discussing at the paper - but then I received a late - night phone call .
A posh voice said , " You do n't know who I am , but do not leave the country till your five years here are up .
They wo n't let you back . "
In those days , citizenship for Commonwealth citizens was automatic after five years .
I would not complete my five years until October 1968 .
Already Labour cabinet ministers had been discussing in public whether or not I could be deported .
Friendly lawyers confirmed I should not leave the country .
Clive Goodwin , the publisher of our mag , vetoed the trip and went off himself .
I went a year later to help Alain Krivine , one of the leaders of the May 1968 revolt , in his presidential campaign , standing for the Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire .
As we touched down at Orly airport , returning from a rally in Toulouse , the French police surrounded the plane .
" Hope it 's you , not me , " muttered Krivine .
It was .
I was served an order banning me from France which stayed in force until François Mitterand 's election many years later .
The revolution did not happen , but France was shaken by the events .
De Gaulle , with a sense of history , considered a coup d'état : in early June , he flew from a military base to Baden - Baden , where French troops were stationed , to ask whether they would support him if Paris fell to the revolutionaries .
They agreed but demanded rehabilitation for the ultra - right generals whom De Gaulle had fired because they opposed pulling out of Algeria .
The deal was done .
Yet De Gaulle slapped down his interior minister for suggesting that Sartre be arrested : " You cannot imprison Voltaire , " he ruled .
The French example did spread , worrying bureaucrats in Moscow as much as the ruling elites in the west .
An unruly and undisciplined people had to be brought to heel .
Robert Escarpit , a Le Monde correspondent , wrote on July 23 1968 : " A Frenchman travelling abroad feels himself treated a bit like a convalescent from a pernicious fever .
And how did the rash of barricades break out ?
What was the temperature at five o'clock in the evening of May 29 ?
Is the Gaullist medicine really getting to the roots of the disease ?
Are there dangers of a relapse ?...
But there is one question that is hardly ever asked , perhaps because they are afraid to hear the answer .
But at heart everyone would like to know , hopefully or fearfully , whether the sickness is infectious . "
It was infectious .
In Prague , communist reformers - many of them heroes of the anti-fascist resistance during the second world war - had that spring already proclaimed " socialism with a human face " .
The aim of Alexander Dubcek and his supporters was to democratise political life in Czechoslovakia .
It was the first step towards a socialist democracy and was seen as such in Moscow and Washington .
On August 21 , the Russians sent in the tanks and crushed the reform movement .
In every west European capital there were protests .
The tabloid press in Britain was constantly attacking leftists as " agents of Moscow " and was genuinely taken aback when we marched to the Soviet embassy , denouncing the invasion in strong language and burning effigies of the bloated Soviet leader , Leonid Brezhnev .
Alexander Solzhenitsyn later remarked that the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia had been the last straw for him .
Now he realised that the system could never be reformed from within but would have to be overthrown .
He was not alone .
The Moscow bureaucrats had sealed their own fate .
In Mexico , students took over their universities , demanding an end to oppression and one - party rule .
The army was sent in to occupy the universities and did so for many months , making it the best - educated army in the world .
On October 2 - with the eyes of the world on Mexico City 10 days before the Olympic games were due to begin there - thousands of students poured on to the streets to demonstrate .
A massacre began at sunset .
Troops opened fire on the crowd listening to speeches in one of the city 's main squares - dozens were killed and hundreds more injured .
And then in November 1968 Pakistan erupted .
Students took on the state apparatus of a corrupt and decaying military dictatorship backed by the US ( sound familiar ? ) .
They were joined by workers , lawyers , white - collar employees , prostitutes , and other social layers , and despite the severe repression ( hundreds were killed ) , the struggle increased in intensity and , the following year , toppled Field Marshal Ayub Khan .
When I arrived in February 1969 , the mood of the country was joyous .
Speaking at rallies all over the country with the poet Habib Jalib , we encountered a very different atmosphere from that in Europe .
Here power did not seem so remote .
The victory over Ayub Khan led to the first general election in the country 's history .
The Bengali nationalists in east Pakistan won a majority that the elite and key politicians refused to accept .
Civil war led to Indian military intervention and that ended the old Pakistan .
Bangladesh was the result of a bloody caesarean .
The glorious decade ( 1965 - 75 ) , of which the year 1968 was only the high point , consisted of three concurrent narratives .
Politics dominated , but there were two others that left a deeper imprint - sexual liberation and a hedonistic entrepreneurship from below .
We had cause to be grateful for the latter .
We were constantly appealing for funds from readers when I edited The Black Dwarf in 1968 - 69 .
One day a guy in overalls walked into our Soho office and counted out 25 grubby £ 5 notes , thanked us for producing the paper and left .
He would do this every fortnight .
Finally , I asked who he was and if there was a particular reason for his generosity .
It turned out he had a stall on Portobello Road and , as to why he wanted to help , it was simple .
" Capitalism is so non-groovy , man . "
It 's only too groovy now and far more vicious .
In some ways , the 60s were a reaction to the 50s , and the intensity of the cold war .
In the US , the McCarthyite witch - hunts had created havoc in the 50s , but now blacklisted writers could work again ; in Russia , hundreds of political prisoners were released , the gulags were closed down and the crimes of Stalin were denounced by Khruschev as eastern Europe trembled with excitement and hopes of rapid reform .
They hoped in vain .
The spirit of renewal infected the realm of culture as well : Solzhenitsyn's first novel was serialised in the official literary magazine , Novy Mir , and a new cinema took over most of Europe .
In Spain and Portugal , ruled at the time by Nato 's favourite fascists , Franco and Salazar , censorship persisted , but in Britain DH Lawrence 's Lady Chatterley 's Lover , written in 1928 , was published for the first time in 1960 .
The book , in its complete form , sold two million copies .
Following Simone de Beauvoir 's pioneering work in The Second Sex ( 1949 ) , Juliet Mitchell fired off a new salvo in December 1966 .
Her lengthy essay , Women : The Longest Revolution , appeared in the New Left Review and became an immediate point of reference , summarising the problems faced by women : " In advanced industrial society , women 's work is only marginal to the total economy ... women are offered a universe of their own : the family .
Like woman herself , the family appears as a natural object , but it is actually a cultural creation ...
Both can be exalted paradoxically , as ideals .
The ' true ' woman and ' true ' family are images of peace and plenty : in actuality they may both be sites of violence and despair . "
In September 1968 , US feminists disrupted the Miss World competition in Atlantic City , warning shots in a women 's liberation movement that would change women 's lives by demanding recognition , independence and an equal voice in a male - dominated world .
The cover of the January 1969 issue of Black Dwarf dedicated the year to women .
Inside , we published Sheila Rowbotham 's spirited feminist call to arms .
( As I write this , Professor Rowbotham , now a distinguished scholar , has her job under threat from the ghastly , grey accountants who run Manchester University .
We are now in an epoch of production - line universities with celebrities paid fortunes to teach eight hours a week and genuine scholars dumped in the bin . )
And , yes , there was also the pleasure principle .
That the 60s were hedonistic is indisputable , but they were different from the corporatised version of today .
At the time they marked a break with the hypocritical puritanism of the 40s and 50s , when censors prohibited married couples being shown on screen sharing a bed and pyjamas were compulsory .
Radical upheavals challenge all social restrictions .
It was always thus .
In the prefigurative London of the 18th century , sexual experiments required the cover of break - away churches such as the Moravians and surreal Swedenborgians ( for whom " love for the holy " was best expressed in the " projection of semen " ) : both preached the virtues of combining religious and sexual ecstasy .
Sexual orgies were a regular feature of Moravian ritual , according to which penetration was akin to entering the wounds in Christ 's side .
William Blake and his circle were heavily involved in all of this and some of his paintings depicting this world were censored at the time .
I hope this does not come as too much of a shock to my old friend Tony Benn and others who sing Jerusalem without realising the hidden meaning of :
Bring me my bow of burning gold !
Bring me my arrows of desire !
Bring me my spear !
Homosexuality in Britain was decriminalised only in 1967 .
Gay liberation movements erupted with activists demanding an end to all homophobic legislation and Gay Pride marches were launched , inspired by the Afro - American struggles for equal rights and black pride .
All the movements learned from each other .
The advances of the civil rights , women 's and gay movements , now taken for granted , had to be fought for on the streets against enemies who were fighting the " war on horror " .
History rarely repeats itself , but its echoes never go away .
In the autumn of 2004 , when I was in the US on a lecture tour that coincided with Bush 's re-election campaign , I noticed at a large antiwar meeting in Madison a very direct echo in a utopian bumper sticker : " Iraq is Arabic for Vietnam . "
The sound engineer in the hall , a Mexican - American , whispered proudly in my ear that his son , a 25 - year - old marine , had just returned from a tour of duty in the besieged Iraqi city of Fallujah , the scene of horrific massacres by US soldiers , and may show up at the meeting .
He did n't , but joined us later with a couple of civilian friends .
He could see the room was packed with antiwar , anti-Bush activists .
The young , crewcut marine , G , recounted tales of duty and valour .
I asked why he had joined the marine corps .
" There was no choice for people like me .
If I 'd stayed here , I 'd have been killed on the streets or ended up in the penitentiary serving life .
The marine corps saved my life .
They trained me , looked after me and changed me completely .
If I died in Iraq , at least it would be the enemy that killed me .
In Fallujah , all I could think of was how to make sure that the men under my command were kept safe .
That 's all .
Most of the kids demonstrating for peace have no problems here .
They go to college , they demonstrate and soon they forget it all as they move into well - paid jobs .
It 's not so easy for people like me .
I think there should be a draft .
Why should poor kids be the only ones out there ?
Out of all the marines I work with , perhaps four or five percent are gung - ho flag - wavers .
The rest of us are doing a job , we do it well and hope we get out without being KIA [ killed in action ] or wounded . "
Later , G sat on a sofa between two older men - both former combatants .
On his left was Will Williams , 60 , born in Mississipi , who had enlisted in the army aged 17 .
He was sure that , had he not left Mississippi , the Klu Klux Klan or some other racist gang would have killed him .
He , too , told me that the military " saved my life " .
Following a stint in Germany , he was sent to Vietnam .
Wounded in action , he received a Purple Heart and two bronze stars ; he also began to change following a rebellion by black troops at Camranh Bay protesting racism within the US army .
Following a difficult period readjusting , Williams read deeply in politics and history .
Feeling that the country was being lied to again , he and Dot , his companion of over 43 years , joined the movement opposing the war in Iraq , bringing their Gospel choir voices to rallies and demonstrations .
On G's right was Clarence Kailin , 90 years old that summer and one of the few remaining survivors of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade that had fought on the Republican side in the Spanish civil war .
He , too , has been active in the movement against the war in Iraq .
" Our trip was made in considerable secrecy - even from our families .
I was a truck driver , then an infantry man and for a short time a stretcher - bearer .
I saw the brutality of war up close .
Of the five Wisconsinites who came to Spain with me , two were killed ... later , there was Vietnam and this time kids from here died on the wrong side .
Now we have Iraq .
It 's really bad , but I still believe there is an innate goodness in people , which is why so many can break with unworthy pasts . "
In 2006 , after another tour of duty , G could no longer accept any justification for the war .
He was admiring of Cindy Sheehan and the Military Families Against the War , the most consistently active and effective antiwar group in the US .
A decade before the French Revolution , Voltaire remarked that " History is the lies we agree on " .
Afterwards there was little agreement on anything .
The debate on 1968 was recently revived by Nicolas Sarkozy , who boasted that his victory in last year 's presidential elections was the final nail in the ' 68 coffin .
The philosopher Alain Badiou 's tart response was to compare the new president of the republic to the Bourbons of 1815 and Marshal Pétain during the war .
They , too , had talked about nails and coffins .
" May 1968 imposed intellectual and moral relaivism on us all , " Sarkozy declared .
" The heirs of May ' 68 imposed the idea that there was no longer any difference between good and evil , truth and falsehood , beauty and ugliness .
The heritage of May 1968 introduced cynicism into society and politics . "
He even blamed the legacy of May ' 68 for greedy and seedy business practices .
The May ' 68 attack on ethical standards helped to " weaken the morality of capitalism , to prepare the ground for the unscrupulous capitalism of golden parachutes for rogue bosses " .
So the 60s generation is held responsible for Enron , Conrad Black , the subprime mortgage crisis , Northern Rock , corrupt politicians , deregulation , the dictatorship of the " free market " , a culture strangled by brazen opportunism .
The struggle against the Vietnam war lasted 10 years .
In 2003 people came out again in Europe and America , in even larger numbers , to try to stop the Iraq war .
The pre-emptive strike failed .
The movement lacked the stamina and the resonance of its predecessors .
Within 48 hours it had virtually disappeared , highlighting the changed times .
Were the dreams and hopes of 1968 all idle fantasies ?
Or did cruel history abort something new that was about to be born ?
Revolutionaries - utopian anarchists , Fidelistas , Trotskyist allsorts , Maoists of every stripe - wanted the whole forest .
Liberals and social democrats were fixated on individual trees .
The forest , they warned us , was a distraction , far too vast and impossible to define , whereas a tree was a piece of wood that could be identified , improved and crafted into a chair or a table .
Now the tree , too , has gone .
" You 're like fish that only see the bait , never the line , " we would mock in return .
For we believed - and still do - that people should not be measured by material possessions but by their ability to transform the lives of others - the poor and underprivileged ; that the economy needed to be reorganised in the interests of the many , not the few ; and that socialism without democracy could never work .
Above all , we believed in freedom of speech .
Much of this seems utopian now and some , for whom 1968 was n't radical enough at the time , have embraced the present and , like members of ancient sects who moved easily from ritual debauchery to chastity , now regard any form of socialism as the serpent that tempted Eve in paradise .
The collapse of " communism " in 1989 created the basis for a new social agreement , the Washington Consensus , whereby deregulation and the entry of private capital into hitherto hallowed domains of public provision would become the norm everywhere , making traditional social democracy redundant and threatening the democratic process itself .
Some , who once dreamed of a better future , have simply given up .
Others espouse a bitter maxim : unless you relearn you wo n't earn .
The French intelligentsia , which had from the Enlightenment onwards made Paris the political workshop of the world , today leads the way with retreats on every front .
Renegades occupy posts in every west European government defending exploitation , wars , state terror and neocolonial occupations ; others now retired from the academy specialise in producing reactionary dross on the blogosphere , displaying the same zeal with which they once excoriated factional rivals on the far left .
This , too , is nothing new .
Shelley 's rebuke to Wordsworth who , after welcoming the French Revolution , retreated to a pastoral conservatism , expressed it well :
In honoured poverty thy voice did weave
Songs consecrate to truth and liberty ,
Deserting these , thou leavest me to grieve ,
Thus having been , that thou shouldst cease to be .
WASHINGTON --
The CIA 's secret interrogation program has made
extensive use of outside contractors , whose role likely included the
waterboarding of terrorist suspects , according to testimony yesterday
from the CIA director and two other people familiar with the
program .
Many of the contractors
involved are n't large corporate entities but rather individuals who
are often former agency or military officers .
However , large
corporations also are involved , current and former officials said .
Their identities could n't be learned .
The broader involvement of contractors , and the likelihood they
partook in waterboarding , raises new legal questions about the Central
Intelligence Agency 's use of the practice , which is designed to
simulate drowning .
It also will fuel the contentious debate over the
administration 's use of harsh interrogation techniques .

It also will fuel the contentious debate over theadministration 's use of harsh interrogation techniques .
The role of contractors in sensitive security programs has become a
hot issue on Capitol Hill .
It is n't clear what laws govern their work
and who is accountable when activities go awry , as they did when
employees of the security firm Blackwater allegedly killed 17 Iraqi
civilians and wounded 24 others in September .
An investigation of that
is under way ; Blackwater continues to provide security services to
State Department employees in Iraq .
In testimony before the House yesterday , CIA Director Michael V .
Hayden was asked whether contractors were involved in waterboarding al
Qaeda detainees .
He replied : " I 'm not sure of the specifics .
I'll
give you a tentative answer : I believe so . "
An agency spokesman
declined to clarify the answer .
According to two current and
former intelligence officials , the use of contracting at the CIA's
secret sites increased quickly in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , in
part because the CIA had little experience in detentions and
interrogation .
Using nongovernment employees also helped maintain a
low profile , they said .
The sites were designed to handle only the
most sensitive detainees .
Gen .
Hayden has said fewer than 100 people
have been held at these sites .
In his comments yesterday , Gen .
Hayden said that among the reasons the
agency eliminated waterboarding from its interrogation program was
that the legal landscape has changed .
In his comments yesterday , Gen .
Hayden said that among the reasons theagency eliminated waterboarding from its interrogation program wasthat the legal landscape has changed .
" In my own view , the view of my lawyers and the Department of
Justice , it is not certain that that technique would be considered to
be lawful under current statute , " he told lawmakers on the House
intelligence panel .
Gen .
Hayden maintained that the practice was legal at the time the CIA
used it , from 2002 to 2003 , on three al Qaeda suspects .
" All the
techniques that we 've used have been deemed to be lawful , he said .
The use of outside contractors raises awkward questions about
accountability .
" The government may be prohibited from doing
something , but is a corporation ? " asked R.J. Hillhouse , a former
political - science professor who has researched the outsourcing of
military and intelligence operations for her book " Outsourced . "
Ms. Hillhouse said procurement law has traditionally differentiated
between the reporting responsibilities of government officers and
contractors .
Gen .
Hayden , however , said private contractors involved in CIA
interrogations " are bound by the same rules " as the agency 's
officers .
Lawmakers are concerned that using contractors in interrogations may
violate the law , or at least government policy , which states that
" inherently governmental activities " must be performed by
government personnel .

Jeffrey Smith , a former CIA general counsel , said it might make sense
to use contractors who have a language specialty to screen detainees ,
for example .
But waterboarding crosses into the realm of activities
only the government should perform .
" If we 're going to ask contractors to do these things , then we
have to find a way to assure that they comply with the law and that ,
to the extent we direct them to do activities that violate local law ,
that we protect them , " Mr. Smith said .
He added that he opposes
the waterboarding .
Sen . Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat , wrote to Attorney
General Michael Mukasey on Wednesday to ask his views on the legality
of involving contractors to program interrogations .

" I believe the interrogation of detainees falls squarely within
the definition of an inherently governmental activity , " Sen .
Feinstein wrote .
The 2006 Detainee Treatment Act includes a legal
shield for U.S. government employees who use officially authorized
interrogation techniques .
" It is not all that clear to me , given our experiences in Iraq ,
that private contractors are held to the same standards as are
government employees , " Rep. Jan Schakowsky , the Illinois Democrat
who asked Gen. Hayden about contractors ' use of waterboarding , said in
an interview .
" People who actually work for us are accountable to
us .
Using employees of private companies to engage in what most of the
world anyway believes is torture , I find problematic . "
The CIA established its detention sites in several countries ,
including Thailand , Afghanistan and multiple countries in Eastern
Europe .
Waterboarding reportedly took place in Thailand and possibly
other countries .
The Justice Department is currently investigating the CIA's
destruction of interrogation tapes that reportedly included footage of
waterboarding .
Lawmakers have urged the department to expand its
inquiry to include a criminal inquiry of the technique .
The attorney
general told a separate House committee yesterday he was n't ready to
do that .
Providing additional details about the workings of the once highly
secret interrogation program , Gen .
Hayden said , " was a very
difficult decision . "
He described the program as " a covert
action , " which is perhaps the most secret type of operation the

HATE preacher Abu Hamza has refused any more treatment from his prison nurse after finding out the man is gay .
The nurse , nickname Queenie , has been helping to wash and dress the convicted terrorist for more than two years .
A prison source told the Mirror the full - time staffer is openly gay and has a camp voice .
Officers at Belmarsh jail are said to be surprised Hamza , 48 , has not noticed before .
Now the cleric is claiming it is against his religion and human rights to be treated by a homosexual .
The source said Hamza 's solicitor wrote to the governor demanding his client is given a new regular nurse .
The prison service refused saying it does not discriminate on grounds of sexuality .
The source said : " The nurse is upset about it .
He has spent the last couple of years doing everything for Hamza , even wiping his bottom .
" It shows how little respect Hamza has for others .
The nurse dresses him , washes him , cleans his teeth , cuts his toenails , trims his beard and applies ointment for his skin disorder . "
Egyptian - born Hamza , serving seven years for inciting murder and racial hatred , requires care because he is limited by his hook hands .
The source said : " His nurse is open about being gay .
He even speaks with a camp voice .
His nickname is Queenie .
" Hamza has been refusing treatment while he is on duty but he wo n't be able to keep that up because it is causing him a great deal of discomfort . "
The prison service said : " We do not comment on individual prisoners . "
One -quarter of married couples in Japan have had no sex in the past year , a survey shows , urging an open discussion of the issue as the country struggles to boost a dwindling birth rate .
Sex is particularly elusive as people grow older , with the study finding that 37.3 per cent of Japanese married couples in their 50s were not having sex .
Nihon University 's Population Research Institute , which conducted the study with the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , said that there needed to be a serious look at the issue .
" There may be a need to look into the fundamental aspect of reproduction , the frequency of having sex , as a new problem in a nation with a low birth rate , " the institute said in this week 's report .
There was no comparable data for other countries but earlier surveys by condom manufacturer Durex has put Japan among the world 's least sexually active nations .
Japan has one of the world 's lowest birth rates , presenting a potential future demographic crisis for the world 's second largest economy which takes in few immigrants .
The Government has been studying ways to make society more family friendly , including providing more legal protection to professional mothers and reducing Japan 's notoriously long working hours .
But Naohiro Ogawa , head of the institute , said that Japan 's low birth rate cannot be explained just by socioeconomic factors , saying the study found no correlation between sex drive and stress .
Experts from the WHO , the institute and the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population , will hold a conference in Tokyo in November to discuss the matter , he said .
Sex was most frequent among young married people .
The survey found that 42.2 per cent of couples who are in their 20s and have lived together for less than five years had sex once a week or more often .
Negotiation theory , first articulated in the 1960s , consists , some 40 years later , of
a significant inventory of well - tested propositions .
The focus has been on how
individuals can develop sufficient trust in one another to exchange information
about their preferences , then seek an accommodation of their differences .
As the
authors who write on this subject in the anthology concede , they are not entirely
sure how good the fit is between negotiation behavior and interrogations ; how -
ever , their work suggests heuristic parallels and their call for more research
about the similarities makes sense .
Perhaps the most appealing and relevant aspect of negotiation theory is the princi -
ple that one should try to learn as much as possible about an opponent ’s strengths ,
weaknesses , fears , needs , and aspirations .
This is exactly what good interrogators
try to do as well .
It is an approach that can lead to the development of a human
connection between two sides .
In contrast to the adoption of harsh measures
involving the use of force , interrogations that rely on building rapport with a sub -
ject — so vital to successful negotiations — would seem an attractive method .
It has
the added advantage of comporting well with America ’s long - standing devotion to
human rights and fair play .
As with virtually all aspects of interrogation as a disci -
pline of study , this rapport hypothesis has not been systematically and thoroughly
tested .
The tenets of negotiation theory may provide a valuable framework for
additional scientific testing of interrogation practices .
Just as one appreciates the solid work that has gone into this initial exploration
into interrogation , so does one look forward to further findings in the anticipated
Phase II .
The Intelligence Science Board should be careful , though , not to cast its
net too narrowly , focusing only on the empirical science of how most profitably to
question subjects .
While this topic is important , the board needs to pay attention
as well ( as it does only fleetingly here ) to the key ethical and foreign policy impli-
cations of interrogation techniques .
Perhaps nothing has hurt America ’s standing in the world so much recently as
the media stories related to Abu Ghraib , Guantánamo , secret detention centers
abroad , and extraordinary renditions .
All are related to interrogation as a means
of intelligence collection .
Any research team that looks seriously into the topic of
interrogation should pay closer attention to this broader picture .
Interrogation
methods are not just about what works best to gather information ; they are also
about what can stand the light of day from a moral point of view in the eyes of
American citizens and people around the world .
For the next iteration , the Intel -
ligence Science Board may wish to have an ethicist on board , and perhaps an
expert or two who can look at the wider foreign policy implications that flow from
the choices America makes about how to question detainees .
It would be helpful , as well , to have someone prepare a more refined index in the
next volume , rather than simply offer a list of terms with dozens of page num -
bers that follow each item .
One can only wish the board well in carrying forward this vital research , helping
the United States find better ways to protect itself through interrogations with -
San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders was expected to veto the resolution passed yesterday by the City Council that urges the California Supreme Court to overturn California ’s ban on same - sex marriage .
Sanders , whose position on the issue has been to support civil unions but not same - sex marriage , instead made an emotional shock announcement at a press conference last night .
( Full raw press conference video here )
Said the mayor : “ Two years ago , I believed that civil unions were a fair alternative .
Those beliefs , in my case , have since changed .
The concept of a ‘ separate but equal ’ institution is not something that I can support . ”
The reason ?
Sanders ’ daughter Lisa ( middle in photo ) , is a lesbian .
Lisa reportedly told her father that she was gay and in a committed relationship four years ago , and Sanders said he could no longer deny her the rights offered to everyone else in the country .
Said Sanders : “ In the end , I could not look any of them in the face and tell them that their relationships — their very lives — were any less meaningful than the marriage that I share with my wife Rana . ”
MSNBC reports that Sanders said “ he thought of friends and members of his staff who are gay ” when making his decision : “ I just could not bring myself to tell an entire group of our community they were less important , less worthy or less deserving of the rights and responsibilities of marriage than anyone else , simply because of their sexual orientation …
I want for them the same thing that we all want for our loved ones .
For each of them to find a mate , whom they love deeply and who loves them back .
Someone who they can grow old together and share life ’s experiences . ”
Sanders is a Republican former police chief .

White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said they had received the Bloch letter and it was under review .
The White House previously acknowledged conducting about 20 meetings over the past several years for federal employees on GOP election prospects while insisting that such informational briefings are neither unlawful nor unusual .
... The special counsel 's office said it had interviewed 21 of the 36 GSA political appointees who attended the Jan. 26 meeting with J. Scott Jennings , the White House deputy director of the Office of Political Affairs .
The counsel 's office also talked to Jennings and interviewed Doan for nine hours over two days .
It said Doan , in her June 1 response , did not dispute that she posed a question on how Republican candidates can be helped , but " tries to shift the focus of this matter and minimize her illegal activity . "
She also suggested that some political appointees who talked to the office might have had reason to be biased because they were unhappy with poor performance ratings .
" Ms. Doan did n't just disparage the employees [ who gave information about her statements to the Committee ] , under oath she told the Special Counsel , and again I quote , ' until extensive rehabilitation of their performance occurs , they will not be getting promoted , they will not be getting bonuses or special awards or anything of that nature . '
Apparently Ms. Doan 's position is that it is fine for her to retaliate against her employees by denying them promotions , bonuses and awards so long as she does so in secret and no one knows about it . "
GSA head Lurita Doan was a suspicious appointee to begin with .
Her qualifications to head the nation 's main federal contracting agency , the General Services Administration ( GSA ) , seemed to have been primarily that she and her husband had given hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions to Bush and other right wing politicians .
Yesterday Bush 's Office of Special Counsel recommended she be fired for engaging in " the most pernicious of political activity " banned by the 1939 Hatch Act and for refusing to cooperate with the investigation .
" " Doan solicited the political activity of over 30 of her subordinate employees when she asked ' How can we help our [ Republican ] candidates ? ' "
The recommendation points out that " Doan has shown no remorse and lacks an appreciation for the seriousness of her violation .
" Like Gonzales , she serves " at the pleasure " of the president and apparently he gets a great deal of pleasure surrounding himself with incompetent crooks and scoundrels whose appreciation of the law is exactly what his own his : nil .
Bush and Rove -- not to mention Cheney -- are likely to sympathize with Doan when the Office of Special Counsel letter to Bush criticizes her for defending the meeting by claiming it was attended by political appointees who witnessed a presentation that " would likely be in line with ' their own beliefs .
'" It was clear from the moment Doan took the stand at Henry Waxman 's House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that she is a deceitful partisan hack who has been schooled to repeat , " I do not remember .
" Watch the video of Blue America freshman Bruce Braley ( D - IA ) questioning Doan and showing how she conspired with Karl Rove to politicize the GSA in the most narrowly partisan possible way .
Doan has been caught trying to use government resources to defeat Democratic elected officials .
Waxman 's committee has uncovered a clearly illegal conspiracy between Rove 's office , the Republican National Committee and Doan 's GSA .
Today ' sreports that Scott Bloch , head of the Office of Special Counsel , recommends that " Administrator Doan be disciplined to the fullest extent for her serious violation of the Hatch Act and insensitivity to cooperating fully and honestly in the course of our investigation . "
She 's being dragged back in front of Waxman 's Committee tomorrow for further questioning .
Her typical Republican - caught - in - the - act claim that it was everyone else 's fault but her own and that the witnesses were biased against her was refuted by a review of performance evaluations , which found satisfactory ratings and positive remarks for all the cooperating employees .
Bloch 's letter to the White House , predictably , does not touch on Rove 's role , something which Waxman owes it to America to expose tomorrow .
Although the media is all abuzz about Miers and Taylor getting subpoenaed in the Purge - gate coverup -- who can keep up with all the scandals permeating every aspect of this regime so foul ?-- our Lurita has been hauled back in front of Waxman 's committee just now .
Waxman got the show off with a bang :

Obama in Iowa : Gloves Off !
As Caucuses Near , Illinois Senator Goes After Hillary on Credibility , Electability and the Clinton Record
With a little more than a month until the Iowa caucuses , Democratic presidential contender Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , is out to show voters that he can take a punch -- and throw a few , too .
Over the course of a long day on the campaign trail in rural , western Iowa , Obama seemed to relish the chance to mix it up on policy and personalities with Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - N.Y. , the national front - runner .
The two -- along with former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards -- are locked in a tight , rollicking and increasingly acrimonious race in first - in - the - nation Iowa .
Last week , Clinton -- apparently feeling the heat -- took one of her sharpest jabs yet at Obama , mocking his claim that his childhood years in Indonesia provide him with unique insight into foreign affairs .
" Now voters will judge whether living in a foreign country at the age of 10 prepares one to face the big , complex international challenges the next president will face , " Clinton said .
Obama fired back in an interview with " Nightline " co-anchor Terry Moran : " You know , we must be doing pretty well in Iowa .
She was n't paying much attention to what I said before then . "
( CLICK HERE to read the transcript of the interview )
And then , Obama went out of his way to belittle Clinton 's experience as first lady .
" I think the fact of the matter is that Sen .
Clinton is claiming basically the entire eight years of the Clinton presidency as her own , except for the stuff that did n't work out , in which case she says she has nothing to do with it , " Obama said , and added , referring to his relationship with his wife , Michelle , " There is no doubt that Bill Clinton had faith in her and consulted with her on issues , in the same way that I would consult with Michelle , if there were issues , " Obama said .
" On the other hand , I do n't think Michelle would claim that she is the best qualified person to be a United States Senator by virtue of me talking to her on occasion about the work I 've done . "
With this line of attack , Obama is openly calling Clinton out on one of the basic arguments of her candidacy and her career -- that her experience at Bill Clinton 's side in the White House and before , make her the most qualified person in the race .
Obama continues to paint himself as the most " authentic " candidate whose real life experiences distinguish him from his democratic rivals .
He claims that his experience living abroad , traveling the world , witnessing poverty and even facing racism as a black man has given him a perspective that some of America 's best presidents have also possessed .
" Our most successful presidents have been people who were successful not because of their wealth of Washington experience , " Obama said , " but because of the life lessons and schools of hard knocks that they had gone through . "
Obama often makes the argument that these " hard knocks , " in addition to his outsider status in Washington , give him the unique ability to change U.S. politics .
" I think this whole argument about ' He speaks well , he 's got good ideas , but he needs more experience , ' " Obama said to a crowd gathered in a School in Western Iowa .
" What they really mean is I have n't been in Washington long enough .
They want to boil all the hope out of me . "
He is hammering on the theme that he is the candidate with fresh ideas -- the real " change agent " to take on the status quo in Washington .
" If you think that we 've got to do things fundamentally differently , restore a sense of trust in out government , and have greater transparency -- then I might be your guy , " Obama said .
Restoring America 's Reputation Abroad
Obama presents himself as the one candidate -- partly because of his international background , who can repair America 's image abroad .
" I think I can present a new foreign policy and a new way of doing business that the world will respond to , " he said .
Critics disagree and believe Obama is naive for saying that he would meet with the leaders of Iran and North Korea without preconditions .
Obama discounts his critics , blaming Bush and Cheney for having " shifted the [ foreign policy ] debate in a profoundly damaging way . "
" We 're still operating under an old model , we do n't recognize the new threats of the 21st century " Obama said .
" How the world perceives us will have a great deal of influence on how safe we are . "
While Obama acknowledges that violence has decreased in Iraq , he believes the surge has failed to create the space for Iraqis to make political progress .
He argues that it is in the interest of national security to start withdrawing US troops .
" If we cannot execute an intelligent , thoughtful exit strategy , and the Iraqi government cannot respond in an effective , positive way , over the course of the next two years to end our occupation in Iraq , then we may be looking at a decade - or two decade long stay in Iraq , " he said .
" And that , I believe , would be disastrous for our long - term national security . "
Iowans ' ' Extraordinary Privilege '
While Obama is leading in Iowa , he is showing no signs of relaxing .
According to the most recent Washington Post / ABC
News poll , 30 percent of Iowans support Obama , 26 percent support Clinton , and 22 percent support Edwards .
Obama continues to press hard against Clinton , reach out across party lines , and convince Iowans of just how important their votes will be .
" Those of you who live in Iowa , you have this extraordinary privilege , " Obama told a crowd gathered in a school in Western Iowa .
" You are going to decide , more than probably any other American who the next president is going to be , who the next leader of the free world is going to be -- So I hope all of you decide to take advantage of this opportunity . "
Citing the compressed primary calendar and thus the increased influence of early states , Obama recognizes the importance of winning Iowa .
" I think if you do n't do well in Iowa , it 's going to be hard to make up for it later , " he said .
However , he believes that Clinton is under more pressure to carry Iowa because of her front - runner status and her portrayal in the media as inevitable .
" The overwhelming favorite who has been touted as inevitable over the last six months better win Iowa , " Obama said .
" Do n't you think ? "
Obama is also counting on some Republicans to help him carry Iowa .
Which is why he has been spending time campaigning in the rural , more conservative , Western Iowa .
" We got Democrats and Independents and yes we even have some Republicans , " Obama said to a crowd in Dunlap , Iowa .
" I know this because when I 'm shaking hands afterwards they whisper to me .
They say ' Barack , I'm a Republican , but I support you . '
And I say ' thank you , why are you whispering ? ' "
Winning Republican votes is just one way Obama aims to set himself apart from Clinton .
As the Caucuses near , his offensive against Clinton will likely only heat up more , in hopes of knocking the " inevitable " candidate down in Iowa .

A current discussion on django - developers about identity mapping raised a sore point with me : when is something a cache ?
In the linked message , Philippe Raoult discussing the id / object map as a cache .
In my mind , it is clear that it is not a cache .
There are two defining characteristics of a cache :
It makes things go faster , and
It does n’t make things behave differently .
An important test of cache - ness is to imagine disabling it .
How does that affect the whole system ?
If you answered “ it goes slower ” , then you have a cache .
If you answered , “ some stuff would n’t work right ” , then you are talking about something besides a cache .
Of the two traits above , counter - intuitively , the second is more important .
If I have a component which is transparent to the rest of the system , and was supposed to make things faster , but does n’t , then I have a bad cache .
If I have a component which speeds things up but cannot be disabled because it would break things , then I have no cache at all .
Another role sometimes confused with caching is persistence .
The defining characteristic of persistence is that you can give it a thing , and later it will give it back to you .
That ’s its promise .
Caches make no such promise .
In fact , there is a term for when a cache does n’t have what you are looking for : a cache miss .
When evaluating a component , you need to keep a clear eye on what you are using it for .
A tool built for caching cannot be slotted into the persistence role .
The cache contract does n’t include the promise to return data .
No matter how infrequently your cache misses , it still misses .
Similarly , if the component in question is important to the semantics of the system , then it is n’t a cache , because it breaks the promise to not make things behave differently .
Iowa Democratic Caucus Poll
The poll was conducted Dec. 28 - 29 .
Question 1 was conducted among 788 likely voters in the Democratic caucuses , for a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 % .
The data have been weighted for age and gender .
Crosstabs are weighted also .
1 . If the vote for the Democratic nominee for president were held today would you vote for :
Day Age Gender Total Dec 28 Dec 29 18-29 30-44 45-64 65 + Male Female ( Base ) ( 788 ) ( 375 ) ( 413 ) ( 87 ) ( 236 ) ( 260 ) ( 205 ) ( 378 ) ( 410 ) % % % % % % % % % Clinton 30.0 29.0 31.2 17.4 27.7 27.4 41.9 19.2 40.3 Edwards 29.0 27.6 30.3 13.2 34.4 31.0 26.9 32.0 26.3 Obama 22.0 22.1 22.8 40.8 28.5 19.0 12.0 26.1 19.0 Another candidate 14.0 16.5 11.2 23.4 7.2 16.4 13.7 19.2 8.6 Undecided 5.0 4.8 4.6 5.1 2.2 6.3 5.5 3.5 5.9
2 . If you are planning to vote for a candidate other than Clinton , Edwards , or Obama , and your candidate fails to receive the required 15 % of the overall caucus vote in the first round of voting , and if the remaining choices were Hillary Clinton , John Edwards , Barack Obama , which candidate would you vote for as your second choice ?
( among those who were either undecided or planned to vote for another candidate )
Some things never change .
In a continuation of the Bush administration ’s Orwellian doublespeak on the Iraq War , President Bush recently gave an upbeat speech in Dayton , Ohio , extolling the progress in Iraq and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s military offensive in the southern oil port of Basra against " criminal " elements .
Strangely , as violence erupted in many cities across the country in response to Maliki ’s offensive , the president claimed that " normalcy is returning back to Iraq . "
Yet the widespread violence belied the " security gains " of the U.S. troop surge .
Of course , the U.S. troop surge had little to do with the reduced violence  now seemingly temporary  in Iraq .
U.S. forces were at comparable strength in 2005 to try to quell the violence during the Iraqi national elections .
Instead , the violence increased during that year .
According to William Polk  a former U.S. State Department official who has studied many examples of counterinsurgency warfare , some in the field  for the administration to adequately execute its " clear , hold , and build " strategy under existing counterinsurgency doctrine , it would have to increase American forces six - fold .
That is something the already exhausted U.S. military could not possibly do .
In addition , Polk points out that two of the foremost authorities on guerrilla warfare , China ’s Mao Zedong and North Vietnamese Gen .
Vo Nguyen Giap , who defeated the United States in Vietnam , pointed out that holding an expanding amount of territory overstretches and weakens counterinsurgency forces and thus strengthens the insurgents .
So something else besides the surge must have temporarily lessened the carnage .
In all likelihood , the U.S. surge was a Bush administration - induced muscular mirage designed to mask the real change in American policy  a Neville Chamberlain - style appeasement and payoff of U.S. enemies .
In fact , the United States began the rather un - macho arming , training , and paying of former Sunni insurgents to fight al - Qaeda in Iraq .
In addition , in many Shi’ite areas , the United States worked quietly with Moqtada al - Sadr ’s militias to provide aid and reconstruction , thereby enabling a nationwide truce with his Mahdi Army .
Although it looks bad , paying off your enemies instead of fighting them can be a smart strategy , at least in the short - term .
The problem is that when you stop paying your former enemies , the " former " label may be quickly rescinded .
One of the signs of progress touted by the president in the Dayton speech was Iraq ’s new law allowing mid-level Sunni Ba’athists back into the government and military .
Yet many analysts think that this legislation might have the opposite effect and actually be a way for the Shia to remove Sunnis from those positions .
The Sunnis are impatient with being shut out of the Iraqi government and may return to the " dark side " if their high expectations for the new law are not quickly met .
With underlying suspicions between ethno- religious groups in Iraqi society  the Shia who control the Iraqi government are leery of letting the Sunnis back into positions of some power  those expectations are unlikely to be met .
Thus , new laws on paper mean nothing if there is an insufficient social consensus to make them work .
Anther problem with paying off U.S. enemies is that in the long - term , the United States is strengthening all sides for the almost inevitable full - blown civil wars .
A preview of one of those civil wars was on display during the intra-Shi’ite violence in Basra .
Although President Bush , in his speech , supported Maliki ’s offensive in the name of destroying " terrorists and extremists , " the prime minister ’s offensive was apparently his own idea and not coordinated with American forces .
Although another measure of progress cited by the president was recent legislation setting a date for Iraqi provincial elections later this year , Maliki ’s offensive seemed designed to weaken the rival Shi’ite Mahdi Army ’s strong position prior to those elections .
Many say that the Mahdi Army could win a majority of the seats .
As the United States learned in 2005 , in a fractious nation , elections can often exacerbate societal cleavages rather than heal them .
Thus , instead of demonstrating progress on national reconciliation , the law for local elections already may have destabilized the country further .
In contradiction to its formal nationwide cease - fire , the Mahdi Army fought back in Basra and throughout Iraq .
In Basra , the Iraqi security forces had trouble subduing Mahdi fighters , and in the Baghdad slum of Sadr City the security forces were apparently so poor that the Americans took the lead in fighting Sadr ’s militias .
In the long - term , Maliki ’s ill - timed and freelance offensive may have backfired  by effectively torching the cease - fire with Sadr forces throughout Iraq and showing that the Iraqi government is too militarily weak to provide security .
Some return to " normalcy . "
Superconductors are materials that conduct electrical currents without any loss below a certain temperature .
Normally , high magnetic fields destroy superconductivity , turning the material into a normal conductor .
Novel experiments on organic superconductors revealed a new superconducting phase between the normal conducting and the superconducting state .
Prof. Peter Fulde from the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden and Prof. Richard Ferrell predicted the existence of this special superconducting state in 1964 , characterized by a spatial modulation of the superconductivity .
At about the same time , two further researchers independently predicted the same phase .
Therefore , the state is called Fulde - Ferrell - Larkin- Ovchinnikov ( FFLO ) state .
Phase diagram of the organic superconductor k-( BEDT - TTF ) 2Cu( NCS ) 2 .
At low temperatures the Fulde - Ferrell - Larkin- Ovchinnikov - Phase ( FFLO ) occurs .
In the diagram it is visible as interspace between the blue and the red curve .
Superconductors have no electrical resistance at low temperatures .
They are , for example , applied for magnet coils in magnetic resonance scanners or in particle accelerators .
Each superconducting material becomes a normal conductor in the presence of a certain magnetic field .
However , for some materials a new superconducting hybrid phase occurs between the normal and the superconducting state in high magnetic fields and at low temperatures .
In this phase , parts of the material stay superconducting whereas other parts turn into the normal - conducting state .
Due to this hybrid state , the superconductivity can also survive in very high magnetic fields .
This state appears in stacked materials that consist of ultra- thin conducting and insulating layers .
The first successful experiments on an organic superconductor were performed in static magnetic fields at the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in 2007 .
This material was expected to become a normal conductor at about 22 Tesla ( Tesla is the unit for the magnetic flux density and a measure for the strength of the magnetic field ) but if the magnetic field is applied parallel to the organic molecule layers the superconductivity survives in much higher fields due to the formation of the hybrid phase .
Recently , a second series of experiments was completed .
The hybrid phase was investigated with another method in more detail and also at lower temperatures .
It was possible to observe superconductivity on that material in high magnetic fields up to 32 Tesla .
Scientists of the Universities of Geneva / Switzerland , Braunschweig / Germany , Osaka / Japan , and of the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in France as well as of the Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory of the Forschungszentrum Dresden - Rossendorf were involved in these recent investigations .

I 've lost count of the number of times people have referred to me and others who are raped by someone they know as someone who was " date raped " in a way that makes it clear that they believe that what happened was n't a real rape .
The clear assumption is that none of those " date rapists " are truly violent people who deserve to be charged with any crime .
Sometimes these people will be " generous " and say that what happened to some of the more worthy " date rape " victims was deplorable .
What they fail to acknowledge is that the key difference between those who rape someone they know and someone who rapes a stranger is strategy .
Those who minimize the majority of rapes by calling them " date rape " judge rapists based on the actions of the victim , often with the assumption that the victims must know before being raped that the person who will rape them is a rapist .
This thought process mirrors that of rapists who also minimize their actions and who use the actions of their victims to justify rape .
" She willingly got in the car with him " is little different from the soon - to - be rapist telling himself , " She willingly got in the car with me so what I 'm planning is her fault , not mine .
My intentions are written all over my face .
Only someone who wants it would sit there so serenely . "
Many of these " date rapists " likely use the exact words of non-rapists who minimize " date rape . "
If a rapist is going to hear my words before a planned " date rape " those words are , " If you do n't stop , you are a violent criminal who deserves the same punishment as those you call real rapists .
If you do this you are no better than the rapist who breaks into his intended victim 's house .
Show some character and stop right now . "
For this I frequently get called a radical ( or worse ) who does n't know what she is talking about .
Which brings me to a recent gang rape case in Washington state that has gotten attention primarily because the 16 - year - old girl identified 2 of her 4 rapists to the police through those boys '
MySpace accounts .
But there is more to this case .
She willingly got into the car with the boys and for many people that 's all they need to hear to decide this could n't have been a serious crime .
From the Seattle Times :
Police got a search warrant for MySpace.com records and found descriptions of the attack .
" The messages included details of the assault ... and confirmed that four males were involved , " Detective Carl Kleinknecht said .
In other messages , two suspects and other recipients exchanged ideas that included possibly killing the girl if she went to police , concocting a cover story and even boasting of the attack .
These messages make it clear that at least 2 of these teenage boys who committed " date rape " knew they had committed a serious crime and they were n't ashamed of their actions .
Notice that any victim blaming they had planned would be a well thought out lie meant to protect themselves from legal accountability .
The discussion of murder between " date rapists " and their friends cannot be dismissed as idle talk since 2 of these rape defendants have been charged with unlawful possession of a firearm .
Those who minimize " date rape " helped these boys decide that this girl was an acceptable target because she trusted them .
As long as the minimizing and victim blaming continues " date rapists " will continue to feel that they are doing nothing wrong and that they are not violent offenders .
If these boys and their friends had n't written about this crime or if the police had n't found their words , I 'm sure many people would scorn this girl as someone attempting to ruin 4 innocent lives by lying to protect her reputation .
Some people will likely still blame this girl because they need to do this to keep from feeling remorse for their attitudes about other victims of " date rape . "
For these people , the victims of " date rape " must be at fault or they must be seen as liars .
Otherwise , they would have to acknowledge that they have sided with real rapists and compounded the harm done to real rape victims .
That 's a personal responsibility they will dodge with every fiber of their being .
In their world view personal responsibility is for " date rape " victims only .

A number of conversations I have had recently indicate to me that a lot of the world still does n’t get what ’s behind open source .
It ’s easy : economics .
The first thing you can trivially explain is why people work on open source at all .
This has been a source of a vast amount of speculation , particularly irritatingly by sociologists .
Ben
Hyde has a fantastic list to which I will only add the explanation I love to hate : geek pride .
We do it just to show off to each other .
Nope , it ’s all bollocks – the motivation is simple : by solving your common problem together , you reduce your costs .
There is absolutely no point in financing five different companies to produce five different products that do n’t quite do what you want – far better to tweak the open source thing to do exactly what you need ( often expressed as “ scratching your itch ” around the ASF ) .
Some people whine that , because this is an option open only to geeks , open source is not really available to completely open participation .
Well , kinda .
If you are n’t a geek yourself , you can always hire one .
What do you mean , you do n’t want to spend your money on free stuff ?
Why not ?
We all spend our time on it .
Time that we could convert into money , if we so chose .
So why do n’t we ?
Because participating in the open source projects we participate in is worth more to us , in purely monetary terms , in the long run .
This is why I no longer have much to do with Apache : it does what I need .
I have no itch to scratch .
This leads me into the second easily explainable fact .
People complain that open source projects do n’t care about users .
It ’s true .
They do n’t – they care about people who are participating in the costs of producing the software .
If you are n’t contributing , why would your voice matter ?
Of course , you have to be careful when applying these obvious truths to what you see around you .
For example , the presence of companies like Red Hat in the market complicates analysis .
They have their own set of economic drivers , including the needs of their customers , which they then apply to the calculation around their participation in various projects .
As the reach of open source extends , so do end users actually start to get an indirect say in what happens .
But it costs them .
Money .
Back in the good old days , it was so much simpler .
All it cost me then was time .
Kate Beagley 's body was found in woodland in Hertfordshire
Karl Taylor , 27 , of Covent Garden , London , was jailed for life with a minimum term of 30 years at the Old Bailey for killing Kate Beagley .
Miss Beagley , a 32 - year - old manager from Surrey , was found with head and neck wounds in a wood in Hertfordshire .
Taylor told the court she committed suicide using a knife he dropped .
Miss Beagley 's naked body was found four days later dumped in Oxhey Wood .
She had been driven there by Taylor in the boot of her grey VW Golf car , which he told police he had intended to steal when he met Miss Beagley .
The prosecution told the court he went on the date intending to murder her , hiding the knife up his sleeve as the two of them sat in the Roebuck pub in Richmond Hill .
Taylor told police he just wanted Miss Beagley 's car
First date tragedy Lies of a killer
The couple had met a few days earlier at a nightclub in London and exchanged telephone numbers .
However , police were later told , by a woman who shared a table with the couple during their date , that Miss Beagley made no effort to talk to Taylor and appeared to be ignoring him .
Taylor stabbed Miss Beagley to death as they sat on a park bench at a beauty spot overlooking the River Thames at Richmond .
Peter Clarke QC , prosecuting , said Taylor told police he stabbed her during an argument after telling her : " All I want is your car . "
The court heard he then told detectives : " She pushed me away .
She was grabbing me and I stabbed her in the throat .
" I constantly and consistently cut her in the neck because she was going for my face . "
' Hysterical '
Taylor stripped her body and washed it with mineral water before dumping it .
Mr Clarke said Taylor threw the murder weapon , her clothing and unwanted belongings on the roadside by the M1 .
Kate was a loving , thoughtful daughter , sister and friend , as devoted to us all as we were to her
Alan Beagley
He later showed off his " new car " to friends and family and sold Miss Beagley 's mobile phone to a friend .
But giving evidence in court , Taylor told the Old Bailey Miss Beagley had stabbed herself more than 30 times .
He said : " I saw her prodding herself and she was moving her head and her neck towards the knife like you would do if you were hysterical . "
He said that after she finished , he realised she had died .
A letter Taylor wrote to Miss Beagley 's parents , which was never passed to them , was read out in court .
In it he described Kate as " a kind but unhappy girl " and " an angel in the dark " .
He added : " Without any doubt what I did was wrong .
But ask yourself this - whose life have I really taken ? "
' Foul deed '
Jailing Taylor , Judge Giles Forrester said : " You took advantage of the vulnerability of that girl for your own ends .
" Having carried out this foul deed , you took away and callously concealed this body , adding to the distress of her family and friends . "
Speaking outside court , Miss Beagley 's father , Alan , said his family 's lives had been turned upside down by her death .
" Kate was a loving , thoughtful daughter , sister and friend , as devoted to us all as we were to her , " he said .
" She was great fun to be with and is missed tremendously by everyone who knew her .
She had a gung - ho approach to life and lived it to the full .
" We cherish and are grateful for all the memories of the wonderful times we spent together . "
Det Ch Insp Mark Preston - Heard added : " This was a tragic and senseless loss of life .
" Kate was a totally innocent young woman who had her life cut short when she had so much to live for . "
Barack Obama at a fundraiser in Pennsylvania has pointed out the influence of prolonged economic downturn on the psyche of the people .
He elaborated , Pennsylvanians in regions that have been hit hard by a 25 year economic downturn were bitter .
Here is what Barack Obama said ( sorry the audio is poor ) :
Hillary Clinton took the opportunity and slammed Obama for his words , saying that the people she meets were “ resilient ” and “ rolling up their sleeves ” and Obama ’s remarks were “ elitist ” .
This is such major bullshit , even in CNN ’s Situation Room she was slapped around by all three pundits unanimously .
See CNN :
This is the single most destructive campaigning within a party that I have ever seen .
If she really counts on getting another chance in 2012 , she ’d better think again !

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans are finally driving less - thanks to rising gas prices .
Seventy - two percent of respondents to a recent poll said recent price increases in gasoline have caused financial hardship for them or their households , according to a national CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Wednesday .
" For some time we 've been trying to determine the breaking point for when gas prices take their toll on the consumer , " said John Kilduff , an energy analyst at the trading firm MF Global .
" It appears we 've found that point . "
Americans driving less .
Rising fuel prices have caused most Americans to cut back on their driving .
Of the over 1,000 American adults surveyed in the poll conducted March 14 - 16 , 64 % said they have made some changes to their driving behavior as a result of higher gas prices , with 19 % saying they have cut back on driving enough to have a major effect on their daily lives .
And 5 % say they have stopped driving altogether .
Gas sales have started to sink as Americans curtail their driving .
A recent Commerce Department report showed sales at gasoline stations , which have been bolstered recently by record - high fuel prices , tumbled 1 % .
" Consumers have been surprisingly resilient , but it 's psychologically damaging to see prices above $ 3.50 , " said Kilduff .
Prices getting worse .
The median price of gasoline hit a record $ 3.285 a gallon on Sunday and has only slipped about six - tenths of a cent since then , according to a fuel price survey conducted for the motorist group AAA .
Drivers in California have to shell out more than $ 3.63 a gallon on average , and motorists in Alaska , Oregon , Washington , and Hawaii on average all had to pay more than $ 3.40 at the pump .
Consumers are paying 28.3 % more for gas now than they were at this point last year , according to AAA .
And Americans expect the price of gas to keep climbing .
Seventy - two percent said it was " very likely " for gasoline to hit $ 4 a gallon in 2008 .
One in five said it was " somewhat likely " to see $ 4 gas .
If gasoline hits an average $ 4.50 a gallon Americans say they will reduce the miles they drive significantly enough to affect their daily lives .
If gasoline hits an average of $ 8 a gallon , Americans said they would quit driving altogether .
Some experts say drivers should expect gas to reach an average of $ 4 a gallon before the price of gas finally comes down in the late spring as high prices crimp demand .
The price of gasoline usually increases this time of year , as refineries curtail output as they switch from winter to pricier summer blends .
And as oil continues its record surge above $ 100 , some think this years ' gas spike will be more pronounced .
" High gas prices have increased the costs of transportation of all goods , which impacts everything , " said senior Wachovia economist John Silvia .
" Real , disposable consumer income is being hit hard . "
Relief may be ahead .
Some analysts expect gas prices to retreat .
Gasoline prices - though rising - have not actually matched crude oil 's ascent , because gasoline inventories have reached near 15 - year highs on sinking demand , according to Kilduff .
Gasoline demand has grown an average of 1 % annually over the past six years , but this year 's demand for gas is expected to increase only 0.3 % from last year , down from last year 's annual growth of 0.4 % , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , a government agency that measures oil and gas supplies .
If vapid demand can successfully drive gasoline prices down , then perhaps drivers will see gas prices start falling significantly in the summer .
" That national average wo n't get to $ 4 a gallon , " said Kilduff , who believes gas will peak around $ 3.50 on average in mid-April before coming down again .
" We 're in the process of getting the worst of this behind us . "
DEADMALLS.COM PRESENTS DIXIE SQUARE MALL : HARVEY , IL
David Wojcik 's Commentary : Posted November 20 , 2006 ( user submitted October 7 , 2006 ) Demolition on Dixie Mall has halted .
The developer is not to be found and has not paid contractors .
Developer moved out of offices subleased from Demolition Contractor United Demolition on Kostner Ave. Illegal removal of asbestos has Atty General looking into developer .
Il. Dept of Public Health and Il. EPA have issues with work completed by developer .
Stephen Rybak's Commentary : Posted January 8 , 2005 ( user submitted )
The demolition and redevelopment of the Dixie Square Mall property in Harvey has begun ... I did a final inspection of the mall and work has started and the old Montgomery Wards has started to be demolished , so a dead mall is soon to be gone for good .
This mall was prominently featured in the 1980 feature film " The Blues Brothers " .
The mall was already closed for a year when producers rented it out , renovated the interior display , and drove cop cars through it .
Travis Bell from www.BluesBrothersCentral.com recently took his 1974 Dodge Monaco ( the same make and model used in the film ) on a re-enactment of Jake & Elwood 's ride through Dixie Mall .
The video is available on the site .
Excellent editing by Travis inter-cuts his footage with scenes from the actual movie that provide for an entertaining short to watch .
Click link below and then click link that says " Big Mall Video " to watch .

Tons of pictures and information on this site !
Ross Schendel 's Commentary : Posted August 14 , 2001 ( user submitted ) L iving just north of the Chicagoland metro area , I had no idea Dixie Square Mall in Harvey , IL existed until Pete tipped me off .
I even have friends in Chicagoland and they had no idea it existed .
The reason is thus :
The 800,000 square - foot mall was shuttered in September , 1979 .
It has been left standing since .
Abandoned .
With this new knowledge , I set out to find the mall .
Because of circumstances beyond my control , my first visit was fruitless .
It was already dusk when I arrived at the mall , and almost immediately after entering the parking lot two squads boxed me in and interrogated me as to my actions .
I calmly and politely told them I was working on a website devoted to the decline of retail ventures in suburbia , et al. , and they bought it without a hitch but told me to leave immediately .
Upon further investigation I noticed that the main Harvey Police Precinct , a newish looking building with approximately a dozen squads parked out front , was ON the outlot to the mall .
In fact , the Police Precinct uses part of the mall parking lot for their helipad .
Less than a week later I had time to go back ; this time , during the middle of the afternoon .
I parked my car in a nearby lot with cars in it , grabbed my camera and walked toward the mall and started taking pictures .
I came to an anchor 's loading dock area .
Parts of the loading dock garages were still there , parts were completely smashed out .
What could have caused such damage to those ?
I walked around the corner , looking for an entrance , and find one .
It is not boarded up .
In fact , someone had bashed in the board - up across the doors and the board up , as well as the remnants of the doors ( with lots of glass ) , were strewn all over .
I cautiously walked inside the gaping hole where the doors once were , and to my amazement there were still labels and decor on the walls from the anchor ( presumably Sears ) when it was open in the 1970s .
This was like a living time capsule .
" Curtains " and a brand name was written on one wall , and above all exits was printed " Thank you ... Please come again ... "
I was ecstatic to have made such a find ; I did not expect this much to be visible after so many years .
I would have gone in further , as the actual mall part was accessible through here ( and as I later found out , many other areas ) ; however , the mold was obnoxious .
The mold smell was so strong it made me dizzy and gave me a strong headache , so I went out .
I started walking down the outside of the anchor to find more entrances like this to take more pictures , and I saw them .
Dogs .
There were two Dobermans about 100 feet ahead of me in the way that I was walking .
They were walking , also , and had not noticed me .
Immediately I turned around and made a break for my car , which was 50 feet or so away .
The dogs had noticed me running and came quickly , but I was way too far ahead of them and in my car by the time they were even halfway so they turned around and went inside the mall .
This disappointed me , because at this point I was not afraid of any people I would encounter .
However , dogs are a different story .
They are completely unpredictable and unreasonable .
After this I took my car around the mall and got out only to take pictures and go right back in , for fear the dogs may be nearby .
At some points they were , but mostly they did their own thing .
Also , I found out that the gaping holes at that anchor that was presumably Sears were to be found ALL over the mall .
The entire mall was open .
Mall entrances , anchor doors , even service entrances and the boiler area were all completely open .
I walked in some doorways but only to take pictures and leave .
I would have gone i n further to explore , but it just did n't seem safe .
After another turn I found a mall entrance with an anchor on one side .
This anchor had winged pillars / decor and a brown facade , and was probably Montgomery Ward .
At another turn the third anchor to the mall I am almost 100 % positive to be JCPenney .
It is typical of some current still - standing Penney 's designs .
This is the anchor with the copious graffiti on the front of the board - up .
I 'm surprised this board - up is still there .
This was actually and surprisingly the only area of the mall to have lots of graffitti .
Perhaps the proximity of the Police Precinct keeps the miscreants away .
Also interesting to me was the metallic hooped device seemingly at center court .
It looks like a giant basketball hoop chain sticking up in the air .
It 's not easily discernable in the pics .
This was also near the only labelscars on the outside of the mall , which read City Life .
I 'm completely unsure what City Life was .
It sounds like a dance club , maybe a disco of some sort .
But I am completely at a loss .
Maybe someone reading this can clue me in , or maybe tell me more about the specifics of this mall when it was open .
It was closed almost 2 years before my birth .
Another point of intrigue to this mall was the amount of plant overgrowth .
The parking lot is full of weeds that have evolved into shrubbery and some of them even into full - fledged trees .
One such pine tree was at least 30 feet tall , maybe more .
Parts of the parking lot are so overgrown it is almost impossible driving .
Yet , surprisingly , other parts of the parking lot have original yellow pavement markings and the like .
Parking spaces can be made out quite clearly .
Also , the mall would have been more easily to photograph from the outside were it not summer .
The overgrowth completely covers the outside of the mall in some areas .
To end this I want to also mention the area this mall is in .
This area is in DIRE need of rehabilitation .
I am completely blasted that this mall is still standing .
Any piece of real - estate in this location , 20 miles from downtown chicago , and within miles of three major interstates , should not be to waste like this !
It seems like the community of Harvey has covered the mall up , so to speak .
If I had n't been tipped off by this mall , I would never have found it .
Even if I had driven down Dixie Hwy , I would not have noticed the mall .
Since the malls shuttering , numerous other buildings have surfaced in the outlots affronting Dixie Hwy , such as the Harvey Police Precinct and another long governmental building .
A lot of the outlot buildings are also dead and rotting just like the mall , but the mall is still buried .
It is actually quite a ways off Dixie Hwy , and closer to the next parallel road east .
The easiest entrance was off 151st Street , just east of Dixie Hwy .
Harvey in and of itself is completely downtrodden .
The economic base of this community is as bad if not worse than in Jennings , MO .
There seems to be no saving grace here , what with the mass exodus of people for suburbs further out or even back to the city .
The inner-ring suburb problem has a poster child in Harvey .
The boarded up businesses and houses do n't just occur near the mall , they occur everywhere in the city .
If anyone has more information on this mall , or perhaps a link to some info , feel free to E - Mail me about it - I 'd be VERY interested .
In terms of deadmalls , this one takes the cake .
I 've heard of and seen malls that have sat abandoned for 5 - 6 years ( see River Roads ) but this has been sitting abandoned for 22 years and looks no worse for wear , really .

( Recasts after Fed decision , updates prices , adds comment )
NEW YORK , March 18 ( Reuters ) -
The dollar posted its largest single - day gain against the yen in nine years on Tuesday and rallied against the euro after the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark U.S. interest rate by a less - than - expected 75 basis points to 2.25 percent .
Some investors had been betting the U.S. central bank could cut by as much as 100 basis points .
Lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of dollar - denominated securities and stem demand for the dollars to buy them .
Analysts said while the cut was smaller than expected , there were likely more to come .
“ People are still reacting to the Fed cutting 75 basis points rather than the 100 ( basis points ) the market had priced in , ” said Camilla Sutton , currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto by telephone .
“ It ’s a small positive move . ”
The dollar was up 2.43 percent on the day versus the low - yielding yen but , at 99.55 yen , stayed under the 100 mark breached last week JPY= .
It was the largest one - day percentage advance since Feb 16 , 1999 , according to Reuters data .
The dollar also managed to break back above parity against the Swiss francs CHF= at 1.0013 Swiss francs .
The euro was down 0.6 percent at $ 1.5635 , it was the largest one - day percentage loss for the euro in six weeks .
Monday 's record peak for the euro / dollar was $ 1.5904 EUR = .
The Fed ’s action takes the bellwether federal funds rate down to 2.25 percent , the lowest since February 2005 , and comes two days after the central bank announced the latest in a series of emergency measures to stem a fast - spreading global financial crisis .
The Fed has now cut rates a full 3 percent since September .
The Fed said in the statement accompanying the rate cut decision that “ recent information indicates that the outlook for economic activity has weakened further ” while “ inflation has been elevated , and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen . ”
“ The U.S. dollar is now the second lowest yielding currency in the developed world thanks to the Federal Reserve ’s 75 ( basis point ) rate cut , ” said Kathy Lien , chief strategist Forex Capital Markets LLC in a research note .
“ If the US economy does not recover or liquidity problems do not ease , we still believe that the Federal Reserve could drop interest rates to 1 percent , which would come close to matching Japan ’s levels . ”
Dollar dealers also were reacting to the strength of the U.S. equity market , which were strong throughout the day and surged to new highs after the Fed action .
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gaining 3.5 percent , while recently battered broader - based averages moved up even more .
The greenback pushed off some of its recent credit - related concerns on stronger - than - expected results from Goldman Sachs GS.N and Lehman Brothers LEH.N early in the session .
Demand for the Japanese yen tends to increase as investors ’ aversion to risk grows .
As U.S. stocks rallied , with investors willing to take on more risk , the dollar recouped some of Monday ’s sharp losses versus the low - yielding yen .
The dollar ’s sharp sell - off on Monday led traders to fret about the possibility of joint dollar - buying intervention by U.S. , Japanese and European authorities .
European Central Bank officials have recently expressed concern about “ excessive ” moves in currencies , but analysts say the ECB may be willing to accept the strong euro to help rein in inflation .
The ECB ’s main task is to keep prices stable and avoid second - round inflation effects , ECB board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi told a Brazilian newspaper , adding that exports have held up well in recent years despite the rise in the euro .

The White House on Wednesday defended the use of the interrogation technique known as waterboarding , saying it is legal — not torture as critics argue — and has saved American lives .
President Bush could authorize waterboarding for future terrorism suspects if certain criteria are met , a spokesman said .
A day earlier , the Bush administration acknowledged publicly for the first time that the tactic was used by U.S. government questioners on three terror suspects .
Testifying before Congress , CIA Director Michael Hayden said Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Abu Zubayda and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri were waterboarded in 2002 and 2003 .
Waterboarding involves strapping a suspect down and pouring water over his cloth - covered face to create the sensation of drowning .
It has been traced back hundreds of years , to the Spanish Inquisition , and is condemned by nations around the world .
Hayden banned the technique in 2006 for CIA interrogations , the Pentagon has banned its employees from using it , and FBI Director Robert Mueller said his investigators do not use coercive tactics in interviewing terror suspects .
Senate Democrats demanded a criminal investigation after Hayden ’s revelation .
Bush personally authorized Hayden ’s testimony , White House deputy spokesman Tony Fratto said .
“ There ’s been a lot written out there — newspaper , magazine articles , some of it misinformation , ” Fratto said .
“ And so the consensus was that on this one particular technique that these officials would have the opportunity to address them — in not just a public setting , but in a setting in front of members of Congress , and to be very clear about how those techniques were used and what the benefits were of them . ”

Slide a 16x16 block across the entire image from left hand corner to bottom right hand corner .
For each 16x16 block perform a discrete cosine transform ( DCT ) on it and then quantize the 16x16 block using an expanded version of the standard JPEG quantization matrix .
Each quantized DCT transformed block is stored in a matrix with one row per ( x , y ) position in the original image ( the ( x , y ) being the upper left hand corner of the 16x16 block being examined ) .
The resulting matrix is lexicographically sorted and then rows that match in the matrix are identified .
For each pair of matching rows ( x1,y1 ) and ( x2 , y2 ) the shift vector ( x1 - x2 , y1 - y2 ) ( normalized by swapping if necessary so that the first value is +ve ) is computed and for each shift vector a count is kept of the number of times it is seen .
Finally the shift vectors with a count > some threshold are examined , the corresponding pair of positions in the image are found and the 16x16 blocks they represent are highlighted .
This is the story of my attempt to ' cheat ' in an on - line spot - the - ball competition to win an Aston Martin .
It 's also the story of my failure , but you get free source code that implements automatic detection of image alteration using copy / paste or tools like the Clone Tool in Photoshop .
First , take a look at this photo : Notice anything strange ?
In fact this image has been tampered with to cover up a truck .
The truck is completely hidden by foliage .
Here 's the original : Would n't it be nice to be able to detect that automatically ?
It is possible .
Here 's an image automatically generated by my code showing what was moved .
All of the red was moved to the blue ( or the other way around ) .
I was motivated to work on this program by greed ( or at least my never - ending love of having a little flutter on things ) .
Best of the Best runs spot - the - ball competitions in airports to win very expensive cars .
But they also run the same competition online .
That meant I could get my hands on the actual image used ... could I process it to discover where the ball had been removed ?
( In reality , this is n't the right way to win because the actual ball position is not governed by where it actually was , but where a judge thinks it was ) .
Would it be cheating if I could ?
Apparently not , the competition rules say I should use my skill and judgment in determining the ball position .
Surely , skill covers my programming ability .
So , I went looking for tampering algorithms and eventually came across Detection of Copy - Move Forgery in Digital Images written by Jessica Fridrich at SUNY Binghamton .
The paper describes an algorithm for detecting just the sort of changes I thought I was looking for .
Unfortunately , I know nothing about image processing .
Fortunately , the paper is written in a very clear style and a bit of Internet research enabled me to track down the knowledge I did n't have .
( Also , thanks to Jessica for sending me the original images she used to test my implementation ) .
In brief the algorithm does the following :
Here 's another picture showing a golfing image that 's been touched up to remove something from the grass :
To get access to image data I used the FreeImage library and wrote a small C program that implements Jessica 's algorithm .
You can download the source here ; it 's released to you under the GNU GPL .
The program has two key parameters that affect how the image is processed : theand the Theis a number used to ' blur ' the image ( actually it changes the quantization ) : the higher the factor the more blurring and hence more 16x16 blocks are likely to seem the same to the algorithm .
Increasing thewill tend to increase the false matches .
Theis simply the number of blocks that have to appear to have been copied together .
This prevents us from seeing a single 16x16 block as evidence of copying .
Increasing themeans ever larger groups of blocks have to be identified together before they are identified as copying .
Back atI grabbed the image for Supercar Competition ( SC - 272 ) , cut out a section that I thought the ball had to be in ( just to speed up processing ) and ran the algorithm .
After some parameter tweaking the algorithm came up only with what look like false matches to me ( along the bar where it 's all one color ) :
And , of course , that 's not where the judge thought the ball was .
So , I guess I wo n't be driving home in the V8 Vantage , but what geek needs that when they 've got a cool piece of software that detects copy / move forgery in images ?
Which leaves me with one question : how are spot - the - ball images generated ?
Is this an algorithm problem , a problem because they use JPG ( which is already transformed ) for their images , or are these images generated in some other way ?

This week , news broke that the administration at Amherst Regional Middle School would not distribute the March issue of a student newspaper called The Chestnut Street Journal .
The issue reports the findings of a student - conducted poll about perceptions of the school 's mission statement , disciplinary procedures and student input in the school community .
School officials have justified banning the issue by calling the students ' research and statistical methods " flawed . "
Are school officials overreacting ?

Florida GOP Official Threatens Ron Paul Straw Poll Voter with Violence
The Pinellas County Republican Executive Committee planned to hold a straw poll on the night of the CNN - sponsored Youtube Republican debate in St. Petersburg .
In October the REC Board announced the straw poll and advised its members that only 1,200 tickets would be available and sold for the straw poll .
Anyone would be allowed to vote in the straw poll as long as they were over 18 years of age and held a Florida driver 's license .
They were also told that they should snap up the tickets quickly if they were interested in participating in the poll since the committee anticipated a large voter turnout .
Ron Paul supporter and Pinellas County REC member Sophie ( last name withheld for privacy ) of Clearwater , Florida was concerned about the limited number of tickets available and was considering purchasing a block of tickets that she could then individually resell to other Paul supporters .
She telephoned the local REC office and spoke with a Marilyn .
She asked about the possibility of buying tickets in bulk .
The woman advised her that she could purchase a block of 50 tickets .
Later Marilyn contacted Sophie and informed her that she would be able to purchase as many tickets as she would like .
Sophie then purchased several hundred tickets and resold the prepaid tickets to fellow Paul supporters .
In the end she managed to resell about 2/3 of the tickets she had bought .
Once at the straw poll , Sophie and others noticed that Mitt Romney supporters were voting for their candidate dozens of times each .
The St. Petersburg Times would later document this in an article .
Sophie was upset that the rules she had been told were not the rules after all .
On Thursday , the day after the debate , she called chairman of the Pinellas County Republican Executive Committee , Tonoy DiMatteo to inform him of the misdeeds that had occurred at the straw poll .
She was shocked when he answered : “ It 's too bad for you , and if you start any trouble you will be hurt . ”
( Watch Sophie 's account of the incident here . )
Obviously upset by the incident , Sophie called her local Meetup group organizer , Paul Bourgeois , who said that Romney even had 5 - year - old kids voting in the straw poll .
Paul had , at an earlier time , discussed the rule changes with Tony .
Mr. DiMatteo made it very clear to Paul that he and Sophie had not better take this any further or else .
If you would like to call or write Tony DiMatteo ( who is , perhaps not surprisingly , a Giuliani supporter ) and let him know that you will not stand for this criminal activity , have at it :
Pinellas County Republican Executive Committee Tony DiMatteo ( Chairman ) 727.539.6009 pinellasgop@verizon.net
Does n't Mitt get it ?
This only makes the revolution stronger .
They ai n't seen nothin ' yet .

Mandi Hamlin , right , who claims a Transportation Security Administration agent forced her to remove a nipple ring with pliers in order to board an airplane demonstrates what she was asked to do by the TSA during a news conference Thursday , March 27 , 2008 , in Los Angeles , as her attorney Gloria Allred looks on .

Mandi Hamlin wants an apology from the TSA .
Hamlin was forced to remove a nipple ring with pliers in order to board an airplane in Lubbock , Texas .
In another world , another dimension , not one controlled by neocon sadists and professional mass murderers hired by the banksters , one where the herd is not brainwashed to be submissive to goons in uniforms , Hamlin may have told TSA flunkies take a hike .
Instead , she submitted to humiliation , as required .
The Associated Press reports :
The female TSA agent used a handheld detector that beeped when it passed in front of Hamlin ’s chest , the Dallas - area resident said .
Hamlin said she told the woman she was wearing nipple piercings .
The agent then called over her male colleagues , one of whom said she would have to remove the jewelry , Hamlin said .
Hamlin said she could not remove them and asked whether she could instead display her pierced breasts in private to the female agent .
But several other male officers told her she could not board her flight until the jewelry was out , she said .
She was taken behind a curtain and managed to remove one bar - shaped piercing but had trouble with the second , a ring .
“ Still crying , she informed the TSA officer that she could not remove it without the help of pliers , and the officer gave a pair to her , ” said Hamlin ’s attorney , Gloria Allred , reading from a letter she sent Thursday to the director of the TSA ’s Office of Civil Rights and Liberties .
Allred is a well - known Los Angeles lawyer who often represents high - profile claims .
Hamlin “ heard male TSA agents snickering as she took out the ring .
She was scanned again and was allowed to board even though she still was wearing a belly button ring . ”
Allred explained that after “ nipple rings are inserted , the skin can often heal around the piercing , and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove . ”
Naturally , a woman with nipple piercings is not a threat to aviation or national security — but then the point is not safety but rather making sure the commoners understand we now live in a police state .
Snickering sadistic goons are not hired to protect passengers from al - Qaeda but rather to humiliate , even torture and kill them .
All of this is quite normal now , nearly seven years on from the inside job of September 11 , 2001 , when “ everything changed , ” that is when the government declared war on the American people and the Constitution , not fanciful terrorists squirreled away in a remote cave , terrorists wet nursed by the CIA .
Perverse normality and historical example reveal the ultimate outcome of snickering goons with pliers : Gestapo zones , where travelers may be tortured and murdered — for instance , Carol Ann Gotbaum , killed by thugs at Phoenix ’s Sky Harbor International Airport — will migrate soon enough from airports to not only train and subway stations , but street corners as well .
Forget the Fourth Amendment , all of this will be deemed legal because it fulfills “ special needs , ” for instance “ public safety , ” a public apparently dimly aware of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and that shaved head cops do not have a right to search without probable cause .
Get ready for checkpoints not much different than those in Baghdad or the West Bank .
Get ready for mentally deranged police officers returned from multiple mind - bending tours in Iraq getting in your face , asking for your papers , or biometric ID card .
In Iraq , such resistance resulted in disappearance , torture , and murder .
Blackwater cleared intersections with automatic gunfire in Iraq .
Is it possible the same will happen here ?
You bet , if history is followed .
Bush ’s neocon handlers , who claim to sculpt reality , have managed to impose National Security Presidential Directive 51 , effectively rendering the United States into a Caesaristic police state .
Add the Patriot Act , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , and the John Warner Defense Authorization
Act of 2007 and you have a martial law and police state structure in place .
“ This directive , ” writes Larry Chin about NSPD 51 , “ completely unnoticed by the media , and given no scrutiny by Congress , literally gives the White House unprecedented dictatorial power over the government and the country , bypassing the US Congress and obliterating the separation of powers .
The directive also placed the Secretary of Homeland Security in charge of domestic ‘ security ’ . ”
If you ’d like a better idea of how these folks define “ security , ” take note of the FBI ’s long and sordid history of undermining people exercising their rights under the First Amendment , COINTELPRO serving as the most obvious example .
Ditto military intelligence and the CIA .
As history repeatedly demonstrates , such dictatorial power ultimately results in totalitarianism and its unavoidable excesses , including mass internment and death squads .
In the not too distant future , people may look back fondly on the days when all they had to do was take off their shoes or remove nipple piercings with pliers at the airport .
Far worse may soon happen to them at the neighborhood checkpoint if they do not have their Real ID biometric card or some erroneous bit of information shows up in the terrorist database , beamed to every militarized cop car in America , or what was once America .

Apparently all is not kosher in corn country .
BMW of Lincoln , Nebraska posted an auction on eBay for a brand new M3 Sedan for $ 60,000 .
Perhaps they were hoping for the kind of eBay madness that would push the price to six figures ( something other dealers are doing right on the show floor ) .
If that 's what they were after , well , they did n't get it .
The car was won by a gentleman in California for the listed price : $ 60,000 .
The problem is that the dealer does n't want to give him the car .
Not long after the auction ended , the winning bidder got a call from BMW of Nebraska telling him the auction was " a mistake , " and that he could n't have the car .
In spite of the fact that the dealership changed the Buy It Now price twice -- and so was paying attention to the auction -- and eBay rules that make it clear that if someone wins the auction then you must complete the transaction , the buyer is still trying to get someone to give him the car he won at the winning bid price .

NEWBURYPORT - A Salem driving instructor who police say had a blood alcohol level of nearly three times the legal limit pleaded not guilty yesterday in Ipswich District Court to operation of a vehicle under the influence of alcohol .
Ipswich police said Daniel Winsky , 52 , was in the passenger seat instructing two student drivers when he was stopped the day after Christmas .
According to the police report , an Ipswich woman had spotted Winsky exiting his driving instructor 's car and entering the Cumberland Farms store in downtown Ipswich .
The woman told police she could smell alcohol coming from the instructor while standing in the checkout line with him , the report says .
Minutes later , police stopped the driving instructor 's vehicle , which belongs to Anthony 's Auto School of Ipswich .
Winsky 's eyes were " bloodshot and glassy , " and he had " a strong odor of alcohol coming from his breath , " the police report states .
Winsky denied that he had been drinking , police said , but he failed four sobriety tests at the scene , including a portable breathalyzer test , which registered .233 The state 's legal limit is .08 .
After the car was stopped , both driving students said they had not smelled alcohol on Winsky , the police report states .
But in an interview with an Ipswich police detective two days later , the report states , one of the students said that Winsky had alcohol on his breath during a previous driving lesson .
Police searched the auto school car when Winsky was stopped but did not find any alcohol .
Winsky told police he had been taking cough medicine , and a bottle of Robitussin cough syrup was found in a bag in the back of the car .
Winsky was not arrested at the scene , and the car was driven away by another employee of the auto school .
On Jan. 10 , Winsky was sent a citation charging him with operating under the influence of alcohol , and at a Feb. 12 hearing , an Ipswich court clerk found probable cause to issue the complaint .
After yesterday 's arraignment , Winsky 's attorney , John Morris , strongly denied the charge .
" He was n't drinking ; he was n't driving , " Morris said .
" He takes his position very seriously , and they did n't arrest him .
I think that says a lot . "
Morris also said that under state law , the results of the portable breathalyzer test are not admissible in court .
At yesterday 's hearing , Judge Allen Swan released Winsky without setting bail and ordered him to refrain from his auto instruction work while the case is being heard .
Winsky , who could not be reached for comment , has not faced previous criminal charges , said Ann Dufresne , a spokeswoman for the Registry of Motor Vehicles .
Dufresne said that the registry 's Safety and Compliance Unit held a hearing on the matter Jan. 11 and revoked Winsky 's driving instructor 's certificate .
Dufresne said Winsky could appeal the decision if found not guilty .
Winsky is due back in Ipswich District Court April 24 for a pretrial hearing .

Gecko + mussel = tape that sticks when wet /
New adhesive is first that can be reused , even underwater
Cross a gecko with a mussel and what comes out is a new type of adhesive tape that can repeatedly stick and restick , even underwater .
Geckos and mussels both have astounding abilities to stick .
The feet of many gecko species are padded with millions of tiny hairs that enable them to ascend smooth vertical walls .
Mussels glue themselves to wet rocks , unmoved by crashing surf .
Researchers at Northwestern University , led by Phillip B. Messersmith , a professor of biomedical engineering , have made a small piece of adhesive , about 2 square millimeters , that mimics the structure of the gecko foot and then coated it with a polymer inspired by mussel glue .
While other researchers have made gecko - inspired adhesives , this is the first that adheres well when wet , which could make it useful for bandages and underwater robots .
" Under wet conditions , our adhesive is equally as adhesive as a gecko foot is under dry conditions , " Messersmith said .
The researchers describe their invention , which they have named " geckel , " in the current issue of the journal Nature .
" I think it 's very original , " said Ralph Spolenak , a professor of nanometallurgy at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research .
" It combines two completely different concepts and creates something new out of it . "
Gecko feet employ a weak attraction known as the van der Waals force to hold on .
Multiplied across millions of hairs , that is enough to hold up the gecko .
Even more remarkable , when the gecko lifts its foot in a certain direction , the hairs effortlessly detach .
And the gecko foot is self - cleaning .
It does not pick up dirt and dust as the gecko walks along .
Mussels , meanwhile , excrete a protein that can displace water molecules and very strongly bind several oxygen atoms in the protein to an atom in a metal or mineral .
Mimicking the gecko foot hairs , the adhesive consists of tiny silicone pillars that were coated with the mussel - inspired polymer .
Because the researchers wanted the adhesive to be reusable , they lowered the number of metal - oxygen bonds .
You see , sir , Captain Henderson was ticking me ( and he knows I 'm ticklish ) and I kind of spazzed out a little and my knee hit the stick and that started us on a kind of strange rolling maneuver .
Henderson got a little sick and started to barf all over the place and well , you know how it is when one guy starts barfing .
so I started to barf all over the place , too , and it was kind of funny , you know .
So we got the aircraft leveled out and everything and I looked over at Henderson and he looked over at me and we 're both just covered in a slimy wash of egg salad sandwich plus bile .
So he asks me if I 'd clean up the cockpit for fifty bucks .
I said " Hell No ! " and he said that he was n't going to clean it up and that 's when we both decided to eject .
Oh , one more thing , sir ... can we get egg salad taken off the in - flight rations ?
Thank you sir .
I knew you 'd understand .

There are 10 types of people in the world : those who get the subtlety and those who do not .
Enormous numbers of people are being replaced by ( or perhaps converted into ) robots , reports suggest , and the trend is set to continue .
Indeed , the issue has become so salient in Japan that a specialist thinktank , the Machine Industry Memorial Foundation ( MIMF ? ) , has been set up to monitor the gradual infiltration of society by mechanoid impostors .
Reuters reports that MIMF 's latest estimates predict that 3.5 million Japanese workers - nearly three per cent of the population - will actually be automatic surrogates as of 2025 .
In fact , the idea is that this is positive - the greying of Japan 's population is well known , as is its failure to reproduce itself .
The Reuters scribes seem to imply that , rather than being invaded from within by an unwelcome droid fifth column , Japan will willingly convert itself from a flesh - based to a machine civilisation as a matter of choice , rather as the Cybermen ( of Doctor Who fame ) did in their remote past .
" Robots are important because they could help to alleviate ... shortage of the labour force , " said Takao Kobayashi of MIMF .
But there are still obstacles in the way before the Land of the Rising Sun can go fully cyborg : it seems that ageing Japanese citizens remain reluctant to be converted into eternal machine workers .
Blighty is thought by some to be facing a similar problem , as noted media robomageddon professor and gladiatordroid expert Noel Sharkey has famously said :
This has become a passion for me .
There is a cultural mythology about robots ... there are some real dangers that we may soon have to face .
We need proper informed public debate ... we must decide what we want from them before we dehumanize ourselves further .
" People need to have the will , " adds Kobayashi .

He knew his colors and shapes , he learned more than 100 English words , and with his own brand of one - liners he established himself in television shows , scientific reports and news articles as perhaps the world ’s most famous talking bird .
But last week Alex , an African gray parrot , died , apparently of natural causes , said Dr. Irene Pepperberg , a comparative psychologist at Brandeis University and Harvard who studied and worked with the parrot for most of his life and published reports of his progress in scientific journals .
The parrot was 31 .
Scientists have long debated whether any other species can develop the ability to learn human language .
Alex ’s language facility was , in some ways , more surprising than the feats of primates that have been taught American Sign Language , like Koko the gorilla , trained by Penny Patterson at the Gorilla Foundation / Koko.org in Woodside , Calif. , or Washoe the chimpanzee , studied by R. Allen and Beatrice Gardner at the University of Nevada in the 1960s and 1970s .
In 1977 , when Dr. Pepperberg , then a doctoral student in chemistry at Harvard , bought Alex from a pet store , scientists had little expectation that any bird could learn to communicate with humans , as opposed to just mimicking words and sounds .
Research in other birds had been not promising .

Gold : The Leading Indicator of Systemic Financial Collapse
Falling Dominoes Rising Gold -
The failure of Windows Vista to improve upon Microsoft 's accepted standard is an indication that an era is ending .
Another indication — just as obvious and far more significant — US central bank credit is no longer automatically able to create economic expansion .
Suddenly , cheap credit does not produce growth .
An era is over .
THE ECONOMISTS ' GREAT CONUNDRUM
CREDIT , GROWTH & THE GREAT DEPRESSION
Putting more gas in a stalled engine does n't work
… since August , when the real estate sector began to turn ugly , the Federal government – i.e. , Joe Taxpayer -- has doled out nearly $ 1 trillion in direct and indirect support to the credit markets in a so - far failed attempt to unfreeze them Rick Ackerman , Rick 's Picks , March 16 , 2008
Credit , like steroids , can be classified as a performance enhancing drug .
When introduced into an economic system , its effects are obvious and , in the beginning , positive .
Like steroids , however , over time its effects become less positive and underlying problems more apparent and , in the end , are often fatal , e.g. deflation and the Great Depression .
THE END OF AN ERA
In 2008 , we are at the end of an extraordinary era of credit set in motion by the Bank of England in 1694 .
Debt - based money , sic capital , issued by the Bank of England allowed England to tax its present and future citizenry ad infinitum in order to embark on its highly successful quest of global dominion known as imperialism .
As long as the captured wealth of conquered nations offset the costs of war , England 's treasury and empire expanded .
But by the end of the 19th Century , England 's expansion ended and the keys to its kingdom were transferred to its surrogate successor , the US
In 1913 , banking and business interests transferred the English model of debt - based central banking to America .
That year the US Federal income tax and the US Federal Reserve Bank became law and life in the US has never been the same .
Prior to the introduction of the Federal income tax and the Federal Reserve Bank , the lives of Americans were generally free from individual and collective debt .
After 1913 , everything changed
Seventy years later , in 1983 , Nobel Laureate Buckminster Fuller made the following observations on the growth of US indebtedness :
Throughout its first 127 pre-World War I years , the U.S. government often had no national debt .
World War I left the U.S.A. with a national indebtedness of $ 33 billion .
The U.S.A. banking system went truly bankrupt in 1929 , but the New Deal 's 1933 Bank Moratorium postponed recognition of that fact
Since then the moment of acknowledgment that the U.S. government itself is financially bankrupt has been postponed first by further - and further - ahead postponements of the payoff dates for U.S. notes and bonds and by successive votes of the U.S. Congress to increase the national debt limit .
By " money accounting " ( in contradistinction to real - wealth accounting ) , the U.S.A. is now realistically bankrupt .
Since Nixon became president , the U.S.A. has been unable to pay even the interest on its national debt , let alone reduce the principal .
Before Nixon , Congress assumed tax underwriting of ever greater interest - bearing on ever more postponed and greater national debt limits .
For all the Nixon years and all the years of his successors the president has had annually to file a negative budget , meaning the U.S. cannot even pretend to be able to pay the interest on its indebtedness .
The implications of US debt cannot be underestimated ; for just as global investors were once blind to the underlying credit worthiness of subprime securities , today , they are just as blind to the actual creditworthiness of US debt , sic US Treasuries .
SUBPRIME TREASURIES BACKED BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE US
WHAT'S THE COST OF INK ?
( Not much unless you 're buying it in cartridges from Lexmark , Hewlett - Packard , Epson or Canon )
If , as Buckminster Fuller wrote , the U.S.A. has been unable to pay even the interest on its national debt , let alone reduce the principal and therefore is realistically bankrupt , its credit rating should reflect that unfortunate state .
But as long as US debt is rated AAA by the same agencies that gave AAA ratings to subprime mortgage - backed CDOs , US treasuries will continue to enjoy the same demand highly rated subprime securities once received .
However , nothing lasts forever , not even collective denial .
What happened to AAA rated subprime CDOs will happen eventually to AAA rated US Treasuries .
Values vanish overnight when risk is repriced and its effects are swift and draconian .
This is what is happened to banks and hedge funds now invested in AAA mortgage backed securities .
Peloton Partners 'ABS hedge fund achieved an 87 % return on equity in 2007 and on January 24 , it was named the best Euro Hedge fund for 2007 ; but in February 2008 , only one month later , the fund was declared insolvent and its assets seized .
The same quick deleveraging will likewise happen someday to those now invested in US Treasuries .
That day will come sooner rather than later .
The end of the credit era is near .
The citadel of credit itself is under attack .
The prime banks , the primary dealers used by the Fed to feed credit into the system are themselves now in trouble .
THE DOMINO THEORY REDUX
BAILING OUT BEAR STEARNS
The decision by the Fed to bail out Bear Stearns is tantamount to Britney Spears bolting from rehab — it is now clear the Fed has no intention of cleaning up the mess .
Instead , it 's aiding the perpetrators .
Matthew Lee , Executive Director of Inner City Press , regarding the Fed bailout of Bear Stearns states :
The Fed has hit a new low with this , they did nothing to protect consumers from predatory lending and now their response is to bail out one of the most notorious enablers of predatory lending …
Investment banks such as Bear Stearns were the alchemists who invented the now toxic brew of subprime mortgage backed securities that investors will no longer buy .
What the banks did n't expect is that they would get caught holding the bad debt .
They assumed the AAA rated debt they kept was better than what they sold to others .
It was — but it still was n't safe .
To their collective surprise , banks holding billions of dollars of illiquid AAA rated mortgage backed securities are exposed to billions in losses .
But , now , the US Federal Reserve has come to their rescue .
This is because investment banks , sic prime banks , such as Bear Stearns are the very center of the mechanism by which the Fed feeds credit into the system .
The citadel of credit is in danger .
The collapse of Bear Stearns is only the tip of the iceberg .
Banks such as Morgan Stanley , Citicorp , Lehman Brothers , UBS , Bank of America , Wells Fargo etc. are all exposed to this rapidly imploding pool of mortgage - backed securities .
THE BANKERS ' BEGGING BOWL
Bankers from Morgan Stanley , Citicorp , and UBS along with Bear Stearns have already made the rounds of sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East , asking for sufficient capital to remain solvent .
All received promised infusions of billions in capital albeit at very high rates ; e.g. 9 % - 11 % but now one of them , Bear Stearns , involved in a now questionable $ 1 billion investment by China 's CITIC , has fallen .
Which bank will be next ?
Bear Stearns was temporarily rescued by the US Fed via a loan through JP Morgan Chase .
This is because the US does n't have a sovereign wealth fund of its own .
Fifty years ago the wealthiest nation in the world , today the US is the world 's largest debtor — its wealth now composed primarily of liquid pools of debt fed by a printing press .
GOLD — THE LEADING INDICATOR OF SYSTEMIC COLLAPSE
Against this background , gold again broke the $ 1,000 per ounce price level .
One year ago , gold was in the mid-$ 600 range .
Now , it 's 50 % higher , a remarkably accurate measure of the rise in systemic stress in global financial markets .
Today 's era of credit is built on a foundation of debt .
The longer credit - based systems exist , the more debt is created , debt which must be serviced and retired ( or rolled - over ad infinitum as the US hopes ) .
The cycle of credit begun in England in 1694 has almost run its course ; the mountains of debt created in its wake are increasingly unstable and are about to collapse .
The rising price of gold is the market 's bet credit markets are in deep trouble .
They are .
You can bet on it — and should ( and soon ) !

In college , I majored in political science with a focus on East Asia ( B.A. University of California at Davis , 1966 ) .
My in - depth study of economics did not occur until much later .
In the 1990s , I became curious about the Great Depression and in the course of my study , I realized that most of my preconceptions about money and the economy were just that - preconceptions .
I , like most others , did not really understand the nature of money and the economy .
Now , I have some insights and answers about these critical matters .
In October 2005 , Marshall Thurber , a close friend from law school convened The Positive Deviant Network ( the PDN ) , a group of individuals whom Marshall believed to be " out - of - the - box " thinkers and I was asked to join .
The PDN became a major catalyst in my writings on economic issues .
When I discovered others in the PDN shared my concerns about the US economy , I began writing down my thoughts .
In March 2007 I presented my findings to the Positive Deviant Network in the form of an in - depth 148 - page analysis , " How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper In The Process . "
The reception to my presentation , though controversial , generated a significant amount of interest ; and in May 2007 , " How To Survive The Crisis And Prosper In The Process " was made available at www.survivethecrisis.com and I began writing articles on economic issues .
The interest in the book and my writings has been gratifying .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - First , researchers grew enough fungus to give dandruff to 10 million people .
Next , they sequenced its genes .
Then they found out that not only does an icky fungus live on your head and cause dandruff -- but it could be having sex .
On your head .
Right now .

A team at Procter & Gamble Beauty said on Tuesday they had sequenced the genome of Malassezia globosa , a fungus that grows on the skin of between 50 percent and 90 percent of the population .
It causes dandruff and a range of other skin conditions .
Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers said their study can shed light on ways to fight not only dandruff , but an infection that can threaten the lives of newborns .
“ A complete genomic sequencing of a Malassezia genome opens tremendous opportunities for researchers to understand the interactions of fungi and humans , ” said Thomas Dawson , a scientist at P&G Beauty who led the study .
“ It ’s amazing that the understanding of the genetic make - up of a microscopic organism can have broad implications ranging from human health to agricultural science . ”
The team at P&G Beauty , a subsidiary of the company that makes household products ranging from toilet tissue to shampoo , said M. globosa is capable of excreting more than 50 different enzymes that help digest and break down compounds in the hair and scalp .
“ The M. globosa genome sequence also revealed the presence of mating - type genes , providing an indication that Malassezia may be capable of sex , ” they wrote in their report .
Other fungi can reproduce sexually , but this particular type had not been known to , Dawson ’s team said .
This means it could find a way to evade dandruff shampoo .
They said dandruff can affect up to 90 percent of people , and that it has been known for more than 100 years that Malassezia can cause dandruff and eczema .
Malassezia fungi also cause systemic infections in newborns , and is related to some fungi that affect plants such as corn .
The fungus joins organisms ranging from yeast to rice to human beings that have had their genomes sequenced .
Dawson ’s team said they grew 10 liters ( quarts ) of the fungus , “ equal to the amount of fungus that would be found on the heads of 10 million people , ” the company said .

Cost of Iraq War : $ 3 Trillion ;
Cost of Solar Plants to Power all 105 million U.S Households : $ 500 Billion ( April 10 , 2008 )
Let 's cut to the chase on the Iraq War and ask a cold , brutal question :
Is the war to secure Iraq 's oil a good " investment " of American capital and lives ?
First let 's nail down the war 's cost and what 's at stake in terms of " return on investment . "
Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes have written a book The Three Trillion Dollar War : The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict ; Vanity Fair published this excerpt : The $ 3 Trillion War .
The authors have since posited that the $ 3 Trillion estimate is actually too conservative : $ 3 Trillion May Be Too Low Our original estimate of the cost of the Iraq war was too conservative : in reality the cost for the US will be much higher .
Let 's not be coy about the hoped - for " return " on the $ 3 Trillion investment of cash and 4,000 +
American lives : it 's the oil .
Free the U.S. from the threat of weapons of mass destruction , foster democracy , blah , blah , blah .
The purpose of the war is obvious : secure Iraq 's oil for the West , establish American military hegemony over the region , and create a bulwark that limits Iran 's reach / influence .
So how much is Iraq 's oil worth ?
According to this report from the Brookings Institute : In its 2000 World Petroleum Assessment , the Department of the Interior 's U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) presented figures based on extensive geologic studies by a team of more than 40 geoscientists claiming that , as of the end of 1995 , Iraq had 100 bbl of proven reserves , of which 22 bbl had already been recovered .
Hence , according to the USGS , Iraq 's current proven reserves amount to only 78 bbl - - only two - thirds of the DOE 's more commonly accepted 112 bbl estimate .
Let 's be generous and assume Iraq has 100 bbl ( billion barrels ) of proven oil reserves .
At $ 100 / barrel , that oil in the ground is worth $ 10 trillion .
But we can't assume the U.S. will have sole rights to the 100 billion barrels ; if Iraq sells its petroleum like other oil exporters , then it will sell oil to a variety of customers such as Japan , China , Europe , etc. Since U.S. demand is about 25 % of global demand , then it would be reasonable to assume that at most 1/3 of Iraq 's oil would flow to the U.S.
That 's about 33 billion barrels , which at $ 100 / barrel is worth $ 3.3 Trillion .
Gee , that 's a lousy return on an investment of $ 3 Trillion and 4,000 lives / 20,000 seriously wounded Americans .
( Not to mention the Iraqi casualties .
Yes , the war saved those who would have been killed / tortured by Saddam 's dictatorship , and that is not a small number .
But the war caused casualties which by any fair estimate equal or exceed the casualties Saddam 's government , hobbled as it was by " no fly zones , " would have inflicted on the Iraqi populace had it been left in power . )
If there is one absolute in the price of oil , it is that it is volatile .
If a global recession cuts demand for oil by 5 % or more , then the price could plummet to $ 50 / barrel or less .
That would certainly make the $ 3 Trillion " investment " a lousy one .
If , on the other hand , supplies plummet far below demand due to Peak Oil , then oil could easily climb to $ 200 / barrel or even $ 300 / barrel .
At $ 200 / barrel , then 30 billion barrels would be worth $ 6 Trillion - - a reasonable " return " for the " investment " of $ 3 Trillion , but not a great return , for the U.S. has to pay interest on the $ 3 Trillion it borrowed to fund the war .
The only way to judge whether a return on investment is adequate is to compare it with alternative investments .
With that in mind , let 's ask : how much would it cost , using today 's technology , to build enough solar - generated electrical capacity to power all 105 million U.S. households ?
And I mean everything : heating , cooling , TVs , refrigerator , etc .
For cost estimates , let 's turn to two large solar projects currently in the works : SoCal Edison to build $ 875 million solar energy installation ( AP ) Southern California Edison Co. plans to build the nation 's largest solar energy installation — an array of collector cells covering two square miles of rooftops that could power about 162,000 homes , the utility announced Thursday .
Edison said it asked state regulators for approval to begin installing the technology on the rooftops of commercial buildings throughout the region over the next five years .
The project would cost an estimated $ 875 million .
The array of solar cells placed atop commercial building rooftops across Southern California would generate 250 megawatts of electricity .
A one - megawatt power plant running continuously at full capacity can power 778 households a year , according to the U.S. Department of Energy .
According to my calculations , 250 megawatts X 778 households = 196,250 homes served , so the SCE estimate ( 162,000 homes ) seems conservative .
2 big projects will amp up solar power in Southland ( L.A. Times ) Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Southern California Edison plan to announce today the country 's largest rooftop solar installation project ever proposed by a utility company .
And on Wednesday , FPL Energy , the largest operator of solar power in the U.S. , said it planned to build and operate a 250 - megawatt solar plant in the Mojave Desert .
FPL Energy 's proposed 250 - megawatt plant , dubbed the Beacon Solar Energy Project , will be situated on about 2,000 acres in eastern Kern County .
Here are the details on the Beacon solar thermal power plant , which is expected to cost $ 1 Billion : BEACON SOLAR ENERGY PROJECT FACT SHEET
The basic idea of solar thermal power generation is simple : place thousands of mirrors on 2,000 acres of hot , clear - sky desert and focus them on tubes filled with high - heat - conductivity liquid which transfers the accumulated thermal energy to turbines which generate electricity .
The electricity is generated during peak - use daytime hours ; surplus power is stored onsite in high - tech systems using molten salt or transferred elsewhere in the electrical transmission grid .
The most important thing to know is that this is not " new - fangled technology " : nine plants of this design has been operating in the Mojave Desert since the 1980s .
And these are n't the only such mega - solar projects being planned .
According to Wikipedia 's article on the topic : Solel has signed a contract with Pacific Gas and Electric ( PG&E ) to build the world 's largest solar plant in the Mojave Desert .
When fully operational in 2011 , the Mojave Solar Park will deliver 553 megawatts of solar power , the equivalent of powering 400,000 homes , to PG&E ’s customers in northern and central California .
The plant will cover up to 6,000 acres ( 24 km² ) of land .
Let 's put this information together .
SCE 's photovoltaic - panels - on - roofs project will cost $ 875 million and will generate 250 megawatts , enough for between 160,000 and 200,000 households .
The Beacon solar - thermal plant will cost $ 1 Billion and generate 250 megawatts on 2,000 acres of desert .
Once completed , the plant will require 68 staffers to operate and maintain it .
( see factsheet link above . )
As you know from previous entries this week , there are 105 million households in the U.S. ( Source : U.S. Census Bureau ) .
If we take the Dept. of Energy estimate that 1 megawatt suffices for 778 households , then we can estimate that 525 solar plants each generating 250 megawatts would supply all the power needed for all 105 million U.S. households .
For a more conservative analysis , then reckon 250 megawatts will supply 175,000 households .
Then we 'd need 600 solar plants .
With the mildest attempts at conservation ( see below ) , then 250 megawatts should easily power 200,000 households .
( Note : few households practice strict conservation ; just turning off all the adapters and electronics which are not in use would cumulatively shave off hundreds of megawatts of demand .
About 5 percent of household electricity in the U.S. is lost to energizing computers , television and other appliances that are turned off , as a result of poorly designed standby circuitry .
According to The U.S. Department of Energy , there are 2,776 electrical generation plants in the U.S.
That means 140 power plants do nothing but generate the electricity wasted by DVD players , TVs , answering machines , stereo systems , xBoxes and computers plugged into wall sockets while not in use .
One solution : put as many of these devices as is practical on power strips which can be turned off with one switch . )
The cost of current - technology solar plants which generate 250 megawatts each cost between $ 875 million and $ 1 Billion .
So if the U.S. built 500 solar power plants each generating 250 megawatts , the total cost would be $ 500 Billion -- 1/6 of the cost of the war .
Even if you refuse to make any conservation effort then you need 600 plants , and the cost is $ 600 Billion .
Throw in another $ 100 Billion for new transmission lines , and you might spend $ 700 Billion -- a third of the cost of the war .
The U.S. spends $ 250 Billion a year on imported oil .
The U.S. consumes about 21 million barrels a day and pumps less than 5 million barrels a day domestically .
Note that the 500 solar plants would generate at least 35,000 new jobs ( perhaps laid - off oil - industry workers could be retrained ? ) , and that the total land area required would be a trivial ( compared to the deserts in Nevada alone ) 2,000 acres X 500 = 1,000,000 acres or 1,563 square miles .
The Mojave Desert alone is 50,400 square miles ; the deserts in Nevada are even larger .
Other suitable solar sites include New Mexico , Colorado , Texas , Utah and Arizona .
Fun Fact : The Nevada Test Site ( used for nuclear tests ) is 1,350 square miles , roughly equivalent to the area needed to power 105 million U.S. households .
Conclusion : as an investment in energy security , the war in Iraq is a poor investment compared to the construction of 500 solar power plants for approximately $ 500 - 600 Billion .
While we have to pay hundreds of billions a year for the privilege of consuming imported oil , the solar plants require only modest maintenance and operating expenses for decades to come .
Yes , I know we still need oil for transportation and industry : but what if urban transportation ( buses and compact autos ) were converted to electrical or plug - in - hybrid power trains ?
How many of those 16 million barrels of imported oil could be spurned ?
We all know the answer : millions of barrels a day .
What would it take to reduce oil imports to zero , and for the U.S. to live off the 5 million barrels a day which it pumps domestically ?
It certainly looks like $ 3 Trillion would go a long way toward making that a reality -- and that 's with existing , off - the - shelf solar technology and a national electrical grid which is already in use .
Here is an excellent overview of solar thermal power generation : Solar without the Panels Utilities are using the sun 's heat to boil water for steam turbines .
( Technology Review , published by M.I.T. )
The appeal of solar thermal power is twofold .
It is relatively low cost at a large scale : an economic analysis released last month by Severin Borenstein , director of the University of California 's Energy Institute , notes that solar thermal power will become cost competitive with other forms of power generation decades before photovoltaics will , even if greenhouse - gas emissions are not taxed aggressively .
Solar thermal developers also say that their power is more valuable than that provided by wind , currently the fastest - growing form of renewable energy .
According to the U.S. Department of Energy , wind power costs about 8 cents per kilowatt , while solar thermal power costs 13 to 17 cents .
But power from wind farms fluctuates with every gust and lull ; solar thermal plants , on the other hand , capture solar energy as heat , which is much easier to store than electricity .
Utilities can dispatch this stored solar energy when they need it -- whether or not the sun happens to be shining .
" That 's going to be worth a lot of money , " says Terry Murphy , president and chief executive officer of SolarReserve , a Santa Monica , CA , developer of solar thermal technology .
" People are coming to realize that power shifting and ' dispatchability ' are key to the utility 's requirements to try to balance their system . "
Here is a paper which concludes solar - thermal is a better investment than PV ( photovoltaic ) panels : The Market Value and Cost of Solar Photovoltaic Electricity Production ( 37 pages ; by Severin Borenstein , director of the University of California 's Energy Institute )
The market benefits of installing the current solar PV technology , even after adjusting for its timing and transmission advantages , are calculated to be much smaller than the costs .
The difference is so large that including current plausible estimates of the value of reducing greenhouse gases still does not come close to making the net social return on installing solar PV today positive .
Here is an excellent summary of standard costs , solar versus coal / oil - gas - fired plants .
Please note that these cost estimates fail to consider the rising cost of coal , natural gas and oil ; once the solar plant is built , operating costs are low and stable .
Will 10 cents a kilowatt be achievable by conventional power plants if coal , natural gas and oil all double in cost ?
Obviously not .
Shrinking the cost for solar power ( CNET ) Conventionally generated electricity ranges between 5 and 18 cents per kilowatt hour ( the amount of money to get a kilowatt of power for an hour ) but in most places it 's below 10 cents , according to the Energy Information Agency .
Solar thermal costs around 15 to 17 cents a kilowatt hour , according to statistics from Schott , a German company that makes solar thermal equipment .
A solar thermal plant would need a facility to store the heat harvested in the day by its sunlight - concentrating mirrors so that the heat could be used to generate electricity at night .
" You need the kind of system that can run in the evening , " Morse said .
At some sites , such as Nevada Solar One , excess heat is stored in molten salt and released at night to run the turbine .
The plant , ideally , should be capable of generating about 300 megawatts of electricity .
Those plants can churn out electricity at about 13 cents a kilowatt .
That 's still a relatively high price , so utilities would need to group two , three or more 300 - megawatt plants together to share operational resources , Morse said .
" They could share control rooms or spare parts , " he said .
That would knock the price closer to 11 cents a kilowatt hour .
" Under 10 cents is sort of the magic line , " he said .
Dolezalek puts it another way : the plants need to be around 500 megawatts in size .
Most solar thermal plants right now are n't that big .
The 22 - year - old thermal plant in California 's Mojave Desert is 354 megawatts .
Utility company Southern California Edison is erecting a 500 - megawatt plant scheduled to open in 2009 .
By 2014 , solar thermal plants located in the Southwest could crank out nearly 3 gigawatts of power , estimated Travis Bradford of the Prometheus Institute for Sustainable Development , a nonprofit based in Cambridge , Mass .
That 's enough for about 1 million homes .

Following up on this previous BB post , thousands of Chinese security personnel today fired tear gas in an effort to scatter more than 600 monks taking part in the second day of rare street protests inside Tibet .
Tibetan Buddhist monks from Sera and Drepung monasteries refused to return to their quarters for several hours , according to reports .
I have traveled in this region , and to those monasteries , and have spoken with monks and nuns who participated in similar actions in previous years .
What is taking place this week would seem to be the most significant series of demonstrations inside Tibet in nearly 20 years .
Snip :
The Tibet demonstrations follow a string of marches around the world to commemorate the 49th anniversary of an uprising against Chinese rule in the remote , mountainous region that has become a flashpoint for protesters ahead of the Beijing Olympics .
" The police were armed with electric prods .
Other uniformed security forces had firearms , " the source told Reuters , requesting anonymity .
" The monks chanted : ' Release our people ' , " the source said , quoting a witness .
The group , from the Sera Monastery , also shouted " We want human rights and freedom " , the source said .

More from the UK's Times :
Clearly rattled by the bold display of opposition , Chinese authorities have
ordered the closure of the north face of Mount Everest to expeditions until
after the Olympic torch is carried up to its peak in early May .
The expedition
web portal posted a copy of a notice from the Mountaineering
Association of the Tibet Autonomous Region asking climbers to delay their
ascents .
The notice , dated March 10 , said : " Concern over heavy climbing activities ,
crowded climbing routes and increasing environmental pressures will cause
potential safety problems in Qomalangma [ Everest ] areas .
We are not able to
accept your expedition , so please postpone your climbing . "
( … ) Chinese officials had said previously that the north face of the mountain ,
which straddles the border between Tibet and Nepal , would remain open .
They
could now be concerned that international activists may try to use the
occasion of the arrival of the Olympic torch to stage some kind of
demonstration on the world 's highest mountain .
Last April , four protesters
at the Everest base camp on the Tibetan side unfurled a banner reading , " One
World , One Dream , Free Tibet 2008 " – referring to the official games slogan .
The group was deported .

Germany ’s role in the secession of Kosovo
By Martin Kreickenbaum
26 February 2008
On February 20 , the German government officially recognized the independence of Kosovo .
It did so despite the foreseeable political dangers : an impending conflict with Russia , the eruption of new conflicts in the Balkans , and the incitement of separatist tendencies in other crisis regions across the globe .
It was not as if the government in Berlin had not been warned .
In January , the influential Institute for Science and Politics , which has close ties to the government , urgently warned against a unilateral declaration of independence for the Serbian province .
In its report , the institute warned that the secession of Kosovo would endanger the entities of Bosnia - Herzegovina and Macedonia and threaten “ US and European Union relations with Russia . ”
In the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung , a legal expert who is an advisor to the German Foreign Office warned that independence for Kosovo creates a precedent which can be directed “ in other cases against the Western states . ”
Warnings also came from inside the ranks of Germany ’s governing coalition consisting of the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , Christian Social Union ( CSU ) and Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , with the speaker for the SPD parliamentary group on foreign policy , Gert Weisskirchen , even describing Kosovo as a “ mafia state . ”
The German government , however , swept aside such objections and was one of the first to recognize Kosovo as an independent state .
The government led by Angela Merkel ( CDU ) was making clear that it was prepared to follow behind the US and risk increased tensions with Russia .
In so doing , the present government was departing from the close cooperation with the Putin regime in Moscow inaugurated by the former government , led by Gerhard Schröder of the SPD .
Leading political and business circles in Germany and the European Union are increasingly worried about the dependence of Europe on oil and gas imports from Russia .
The Balkans serve as an important transit region for pipeline projects , whereby oil and gas from the Caspian Sea are to be pumped to Western Europe , circumventing Russia .
Control of the Balkans and the lessening of Russian influence in the region are therefore of crucial importance and have become a major element in German and European foreign policy .
This was made clear in an extensive report drawn up by Franz Lothar Altmann for the Institute for Science and Politics published in January 2007 .
German foreign policy has been increasingly directed toward weakening the position of Serbia , a traditional ally and client state of Russia , since the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse of the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1990s .
In 1991 , the German government promoted the break - up of Yugoslavia by rushing to recognise the independence of Slovenia and Croatia .
In 1995 , it used the Bosnian war as a pretext for international deployments by the German army , under the cover of supposed humanitarian assistance , and high - ranking diplomats from Germany have ever since been instrumental in determining the fate of Bosnia - Herzegovina .
Since the break - up of the Soviet Union , Kosovo has increasingly become a central focus of German policy in southeastern Europe .
In 1989 , then - Serbian president ( and subsequently Yugoslav president ) Slobodan Milosevic disallowed the autonomy of the province of Kosovo , and shortly afterwards dissolved the Kosovan parliament .
In response , an anti-Serb , unofficial government was founded — the Kosovo Democratic League ( LDK ) — under the leadership of an ethnic Albanian president , Ibrahim Rugova , who appointed as prime minister his close ally , Bujar Bukoshi .
This government went into exile in Germany , where it received political support from German backers .
At the start of the 1990s , Albania received the backing of the German government , then led by Helmut Kohl ( CDU ) .
This support took the form of a German - Albanian agreement signed by German President Roman Herzog in Tirana in 1995 .
The pact called for the “ right of self - determination for all peoples , ” but was clearly aimed at Kosovo , a majority of whose population was ethnic Albanian .
At the same time , an office of the German Information Service ( BND ) was set up in Tirana with the task of providing logistical assistance to an underground Kosovar ( Albanian Kosovan ) militia in Kosovo .
The money for this project was raised by Bukoshi , who maintained close contact with the German foreign minister at the time , Klaus Kinkel of the Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) .
In 1995 , Bukoshi distanced himself from the non-violent path favoured by Rugova and began assembling recruits for the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosovo ( FARK ) , which in 1998 was integrated into the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) .
The conflict in Kosovo intensified following bombing attacks by the KLA on five Serbian refugee camps in 1996 .
With assistance from both the US and Germany , the KLA was able to expand and supply its fighters with weapons and equipment acquired across the border in Albania .
In 1998 , following increasing international pressure for an embargo on weapons , the Albanian prime minister , Fatos Nano , appealed to NATO for assistance regarding control of his country ’s border region with Kosovo in an attempt to rein in the KLA .
Any dispatch of NATO combat troops to Albania at this point would have meant a direct confrontation with the KLA and would have dealt a severe blow to Germany ’s designs in the Balkans .
German Foreign Minister Kinkel vetoed such an intervention , declaring : “ Naturally , one must consider whether morally and ethically one should prevent the Kosovo Albanians from purchasing weapons for self - defence . ”
The German defence minister at the time , Volker Rühe ( CDU ) , put forward the position , which was later to become the official position of the German government , that Milosevic was carrying out ethnic cleansing on a large scale .
He said , “ The problem of Kosovo can not be solved by my sending troops to Albania , closing the border with Kosovo and thereby encouraging the operations of Mr. Milosevic . ”
His comments amounted to a blank cheque for the activities of the KLA .
In 1999 , the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung revealed that the KLA was being encouraged by Germany and other countries to cause a humanitarian crisis , which would be used as the justification for NATO to intervene .
The newspaper quoted from the general report of the parliamentary meeting of NATO on the Kosovo crisis : “ The Serbian repressions diminished during the period of October to December 1998 .
On the other hand , there were insufficient measures to contain the KLA , which was able to collect donations in the US and Western Europe — in particular , from Germany and Switzerland — as well as to win recruits and smuggle weapons over the Albanian border .
On this basis , the KLA was able to sharply intensify its attacks on Serbian security forces and civilians from the start of December 1998 . ”
At the February 1999 conference at Rambouillet in France , the Yugoslav government , then headed by President Milosevic , was confronted with an ultimatum whose terms were clearly unacceptable .
The document had been drafted mainly by US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer ( Green Party ) .
Fischer had previously ensured that the Austrian , Wolfgang Petritsch , represent the European Union in the negotiations at Rambouillet .
Petritsch was not only a hard - line opponent of Serbia , which dominated the Yugoslav federation , he also had close contacts with the KLA and organised the participation of the Western - backed guerrilla movement , which was represented at the negotiating table by Hashim Thaci .
This move signalled de facto international diplomatic recognition for Thaci , who at the time was being investigated for terrorist attacks against the Serbian security force and the liquidation of oppositional elements amongst his own KLA fighters .
The German government thereby played a key role in ensuring that the KLA became the determining political factor in Kosovo .
As expected , the Serbian side rejected the ultimatum laid down at Rambouillet and NATO commenced , in March of 1999 , its air war against Serbia .
This opened the way for the first military intervention by the German army on foreign soil since the end of the Second World War .
Then German chancellor Schröder ( SPD ) spoke of “ removing the taboo on the military , ” thereby articulating Germany ’s reawakened great - power ambitions .
At the end of the 11 - week NATO bombardment , Kosovo was placed under United Nations administration , with political and military control in the hands of those leading NATO powers which had conducted the war .
The civilian administration was in the hands of the UN mission , UNMIK , while military control was maintained by the NATO - led KFOR force .
The UN Security Council resolution that established UNMIK , while removing Kosovo from the practical control of the Yugoslav state , not only did not speak of Kosovan independence , it guaranteed the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Yugoslav federation , i.e. , it continued to deem Kosovo to be an integral part of Yugoslavia .
This was , among other things , a concession to Russia , which would not have acceded to language that established a legal basis for Kosovan secession .
Kosovo ’s unilateral declaration of independence last week , and its recognition by the US and major EU members states , occurred without the benefit of a new UN Security Council resolution .
Passage of any such resolution had been blocked by Russia , which declared it would utilize its veto power in the Security Council .
Thus the unilateral secession of the province was in breach of international law .
From the very start of the joint UN - NATO administration of Kosovo , the German government was able to ensure that important posts in both UNMIK and KFOR were held by German diplomats and generals .
A German general , Klaus Reinhardt , took over as head of KFOR in 1999 .
Reinhardt was followed by Holger Kammerhof , who led KFOR from September 2003 to August 2004 .
Another German officer , Roland Kather , led KFOR from September 2006 to August 2007 .
The biggest anti-Serbian pogrom carried out by Albanian ultra-nationalists took place under Kammerhof .
In March 2004 , dozens of Serbs , Roma and Ashkali were murdered and thousands driven out by Albanian Kosovar forces , while KFOR troops stood by and watched .
Two prominent German diplomats have been active in the leadership of the UN civilian mission in Kosovo , UNMIK .
Michael Steiner led the UN administration from 2002 to 2003 .
Steiner had been coordinator for Balkans policy under Schröder .
Since September 2006 , the same post in UNMIK has been occupied by Joachim Rücker , who , like Steiner , is close to the SPD .
Rücker had previously worked for the UN and the German Foreign Office in Bosnia - Herzegovina .
Also prominent in the region have been Tom Koenigs ( Green Party ) ; the deputy to the first UN supervisor Bernard Kouchner ( the current French foreign minister ) , with responsibility for creating a civil administration in Kosovo ; and Bodo Hombach ( SPD ) , formerly head of Schröder ’s chancellery .
In 1999 , Hombach was appointed coordinator of the European Union stability pact for southeastern Europe .
Leading German politicians were also involved in UNMIK ’s plans for the reconstruction of Kosovo ’s infrastructure and the development of its economy .
The “ revival ” of the Kosovan economy was to take place under strict “ free - market ” principles and meant , in practice , that the NATO powers — with Germany in the forefront — could appropriate the province ’s natural resources .
“ Revival ” meant the privatisation of Kosovo ’s industrial and agricultural enterprises , which had previously been largely state - owned .
Such privatisations were top priority for the Kosovo Trust Agency ( KTAS ) , which was created in 2003 under the auspices of former German foreign minister Nikolaus Graf Lambsdorff ( FDP ) .
He was succeeded in 2004 by Joachim Rücker .
Rücker oversaw a process of ruthless privatisations .
Workers employed in state industries were either sacked or offered minimal compensation payments to quit their jobs .
Most of the some 200 state enterprises were sold off in obscure dealings to foreign investors , leading to accusations of corruption against KTAS .
In addition to other minerals , Kosovo has the second largest reserves of brown coal in Europe , although the province itself is wracked by energy shortages and many households receive only a few hours of electrical power per day .
Official unemployment stands at 45 percent , but is reckoned to be nearer to 70 percent — a testament to the fact that the priority for the UNMIK administration is satisfying foreign investors rather than the needs of the local population .
Individuals and business interests involved in KTAS read like a “ who ’s who ” of the German business world , and include such prominent financial enterprises as the Deutsche Bank , the HypoVereinsbank , and major companies such as Siemens .
Their spokesman in Kosovo is Michael Schäfer , formerly a political director with the German Foreign Office .
Schäfer is alleged to have used his post and influence on behalf of the former prime minister of Kosovo , Ramush Haradinaj , who was accused of crimes against humanity by the International Court of Justice in the Hague .
Haradinaj , who was a leader of the KLA , is described in a 2005 report drawn up by the German Information Service as one of the most powerful and dangerous clan leaders in Kosovo .
The report states : “ The organisation around Ramush Haradinaj , which is centred in the area of Decani and based on clan relations , is involved in the entire spectrum of criminal , political and military activities , with substantial repercussions for security throughout Kosovo .
The group totals around 100 members and is involved in the smuggling of arms and drugs and illegal trade in goods .
In addition , it controls local government organs . ”
Nevertheless , the German government continues its close partnership and cooperation with criminal and ultra-nationalist forces in Kosovo .
In their leadership role in UNMIK and KFOR , German officials shut their eyes to the crimes carried out by extreme nationalists in the province , who have led a campaign of murders and expulsions to ensure an “ ethnically pure ” Albanian Kosovo .
By 1998 , the proportion of Serbs living in Kosovo had declined to less than 10 percent .
Around half of the province ’s 120,000 remaining Serbs live in ethnic enclaves .
At a very early date , leading German politicians pushed for independence for Kosovo .
In 2001 , Gernot Erler ( SPD ) , the minister of state in the foreign office , told German radio ( Deutschlandfunk ) that borders should not be regarded as inviolable in the case of Kosovo .
In fact , as early as April of 1999 , while the NATO air war was ongoing , the then - speaker on foreign policy for the CDU , Karl Lamers , raised the demand for Kosovan independence in the German parliament .
Since 2005 , the Western powers have intensified their efforts to push ahead with the secession of Kosovo .
This project was accelerated with the appointment of former Finnish prime minister Martti Ahtisaari as UN mediator .
Ahtisaari developed a plan that involved “ conditional independence ” for the province — in practice , the creation of a European protectorate .
The plan met with bitter opposition from Serbia and Russia .
In the subsequent negotiations between Serbia and the so - called troika ( the US , Russia and the European Union ) , it was once again a German , Wolfgang Ischinger , the German ambassador in London , who led the negotiations on behalf of the European Union .
Ischinger vehemently promoted the Ahtisaari plan in the face of opposition from Serbia , and was instrumental in forcing through the secession of Kosovo from Serbia .
Ahtisaari has his own allies .
Between 2000 and 2004 , Ahtisaari was chairman of the International Crisis Group ( ICG ) , a US - financed think tank , whose executive committee is filled with high - ranking diplomats and military figures from North America and Europe .
On the board of the ICG are the American billionaire George Soros , retired US Gen .
Wesley Clark , who was the chief commander of NATO forces in the 1999 war against Serbia , Joschka Fischer , Friedbert Pflüger ( CDU ) and Uta Zapf ( SPD ) .
From early on the International Crisis Group lobbied in support of the secession of Kosovo and played a key role in the privatisation of the Kosovan industrial complex at Trepca .
German foreign policy has been actively working to separate Kosovo from Serbia for over a decade .
Germany had hoped to secure this aim with the agreement of Russia .
Now , however , German support for the secession of Kosovo at the behest of an alliance of Western powers has enraged Moscow and once again ignited the fuse of the Balkan powder keg .
Updated The Guardian has pulled out of its targeted advertising talks with Phorm , following a public outcry over plans for the UK's three largest ISPs to report the browsing habits of their customers in exchange for a cut of revenues .
The national newspaper had confirmed its involvement with Phorm in a story on 14 February .
The U - turn makes The Guardian the first commercial partner to dump Phorm since launch ( although it is still months before the system is due to go live ) .
If it had remained signed up as a publisher , readers would have been served targeted advertising based on the content of other websites they visit .
But since Valentine 's Day , disquiet over the privacy , security and ethical implications of profiling people 's web use has built , and the UK liberal 's newspaper of choice has now decided it does not want to be associated with Phorm .
In an email to a concerned reader , advertising manager Simon Kilby revealed the retreat :
It is true that we have had conversations with them [ Phorm ] regarding their services but we have concluded at this time that we do not want to be part of the network .
Our decision was in no small part down to the conversations we had internally about how this product sits with the values of our company .
I hope you appreciate that the quality of the Guardian 's editorial is funded by our advertising sales operation and it is our duty to keep abreast of all developments in this sector .
In this instance , however , I agree with you that this is not something that we should be partnering .
A spokeswoman confirmed the email 's veracity on Tuesday afternoon .
The withdrawl of the UK's most popular newspaper website * from its publisher network is a massive blow for Phorm and its investors , already bloodied by ferocious public opposition to involvement by BT , Virgin Media and Carphone Warehouse .
The increase in the value of Phorm stock prompted by the ISPs signing on has been wiped out by controversy over its history as a spyware developer , and secret trials conducted by BT on customer data last summer .
Web inventor Sir Tim Berners - Lee has also criticised moves to opt users in automatically , and a group of internet law experts has written to the Information Commissioner to argue that the technology is an illegal wiretap .
Phorm responded to a request for comment on being dumped by its biggest news publishing partner with this statement :
Guardian Newspapers has reiterated to us its goal of participating in the OIX .
They have told us that , from an immediate resource perspective , and prior to the full deployment of the OIX , they are simply focused on more urgent projects .
Known as 121 Media in its spyware days , Phorm sells its new venture as a win - win - win for ISPs , advertisers and publishers .
By profiling a web browser 's interests , and then using that information to target an advertisment when he visits a site that is a member of Phorm 's Open Internet Exchange ( OIX ) - so the pitch goes - he is more likely to click .
That means the advertiser gets more potential sales , the publisher 's ad space is worth more , and the ISP and Phorm gets their cut for providing the profile .
As well as The Guardian , the Financial Times and MySpace have joined OIX as publishers .
Cries that consumers ' privacy and ability to trust their ISP will be screwed by the win - win - win have naturally chimed with Guardian readers .
In response to its technology section 's first coverage of the escalating row , commenter " xenosphilos " wrote : " It 's such a shame that the Guardian have signed up to Phorm 's proposition .
I would have hoped that this venture would have been a prime concern for the journalistic side of the business but it's hard to see how a hard - nosed commercial decision can be challenged from within the organisation . "
As the row intensified through March , a defence ** of ISP - level targeting by Neil McIntosh , the head of editorial development for The Guardian website , was published .
Suspicious commenters immediately blasted him for failing to disclose the commercial relationship with Phorm in the piece .
He admitted fault , but maintained his argument that the system will be useful to readers , comparing it to Facebook .
Yet today 's news means The Guardian wo n't be part of any " utility " emerging from Phorm .
Phorm 's unprecedented PR rearguard also argues that " less irrelevant advertising " will be a boon for the online public . ®
* With 19.52 million visitors in February , The Guardian is the UK's most popular newspaper website according to the industry standard ABCe audit system .
** Following publication of this story , Neil McIntosh got in touch to say he 's no fan of Phorm , rather was he making a weary comment on the inevitability of such systems .
We regret the misunderstanding .
Update
Following publication of our story , Phorm got in touch to say that contrary to reports , MySpace is not a partner in the OIX .
If Apple 's attorneys have the right touch to get patents for its " pinch " and other multitouch gestures used on the iPhone , the company may be able to put the touch on competitors that want to use the same gestures on their devices .
AP / Sakuma
Is pinching proprietary ?
We may find out in the coming months as many companies , inspired by the success of Apple 's iPhone , release their own multitouch - enabled laptops , smartphones and tablets .
In doing so , these companies – including RIM , Nokia and Synaptics – may run afoul of multitouch patent applications recently filed by Apple .
" If Apple 's patents are granted , the company could absolutely stop others from using similar technology , " says Raj Abhyanker , a patent lawyer who used to write patent applications for Apple .
" They 'd also be in an especially good position to stop others from including certain features .
Apple could stop [ their use ] not only on mobile devices but also desktops . "
Patent experts contacted by Wired.com stressed that the patent office can take four or more years to grant patents , and Apple is far from certain to win these patents .
Indeed , other companies , including BenQ - Siemens and Nokia , have also filed patent applications on a series of gestures and touch applications for multitouch devices .
However , with more than 200 patent claims for the iPhone alone , including several multitouch - related patent applications , Apple is clearly seeking to control as much of the multitouch world as it can .
Multitouch technology itself is far from being an Apple invention .
Jeff
Han wowed the crowd at TED in 2006 with a demo of his multitouch research , and Bill Gates demo'd Microsoft 's Surface Table in early 2007 , months before the iPhone was released .
Even Apple CEO
Steve Jobs reportedly used Microsoft 's work with tablet PCs as the jumping - off point for iPhone development .
However , the iPhone is arguably the first mainstream gadget to successfully implement a set of concrete touch gestures and link them to specific functions .
Pinching zooms in and out .
Double tapping initiates a " smart zoom " that hones in on a particular area of the screen .
What 's more , iPhone and iPod Touch users are now familiar with these gestures and their effects , and will expect to see other multitouch devices work the same way .
" It seems that Apple could win patent claims where they are directed toward a touchscreen user device , " says Chad Peterman , an expert on patent and antitrust litigation and an attorney at Patterson Belknap Webb and Tyler .
While a gesture like " the pinch " in and of itself is not patentable , if you connect that motion to a specific function on a popular device , it is possible to argue that other devices using the same technique are infringing , Peterman says .
If Apple 's patent applications are successful , other manufacturers may have no choice but to implement multitouch gestures of their own .
The upshot :
You might pinch to zoom on your phone , swirl your finger around to zoom on your notebook , and triple - tap to zoom on the web - browsing remote control in your home theater .
That 's an outcome many in the industry would like to avoid .
Synaptics , a company that by most estimates supplies 65 to 70 percent of the notebook industry with its touchpad technology , is working on its own set of universal touch gestures that it hopes will become a standard .
These gestures include scrolling by making a circular motion , moving pictures or documents with a flip of the finger , and zooming in or out by making , yes , a pinching gesture .
" My guess would be that 80 to 90 percent of consumer notebooks will have these new multigestures by the end of the year , " says Mark Vena , vice president of Synaptics ' PC business unit .
Years before the iPhone and iPod Touch were introduced , Apple began quietly filing detailed patents pertaining to the technology and user interface of its capacitive multitouch interface on the iPhone .
The company is thought to have secured much of its multitouch and gesturing technology by acquiring a company called FingerWorks .
Its founders , Wayne Westerman and John Elias , have continued working for Apple and filing multitouch patents .
As far back as 2004 , Apple had begun filing applications for multipoint touchscreens and gestures connected to those touchscreens , including the pinch as well as other important usability features .
All together , there are around 200 patents filed for the iPhone alone .
This week , Apple filed yet another multitouch patent , this time for an advanced multitouch gesturing - control panel to be used in conjunction with Mac OS X .
For companies like Synaptics , which is trying to bring the rest of the industry up to speed with its own brand of multitouch technologies , Apple 's pending patents could spell trouble .
At a basic level , winning a patent requires the development of " a new and useful process , machine or a composition of matter , " according to the patent code .
But there are other factors that weigh heavily in awarding a patent .
Popularity often becomes a component in awarding some patents .
There have also been cases where patents were awarded to companies who came up with novel uses or implementations for older technologies .
Multitouch may not be new , but " using the pinching motion where the zoom is relative to the space between the users fingers … meets the base requirement for patentability , " according to Peterman .
William James , an attorney with Van Pelt , Yi & James , which counts Apple among its clients , agrees .
" The technological pieces do n't have to be new to be able to patent an interface like that , " he says .
" It helps , but a new application of existing technology will sometimes suffice . "
While it would be hard to patent a simple flicking motion , the pinch in particular raises a red flag for some patent experts , who say that Apple could claim infringement if it is eventually awarded the patent .
Indeed , all indications are that the company is very serious about this technology .
On the same day the iPhone launched , Apple even applied for a trademark in a Far East intellectual property office for the term " multi- touch . "
Yet it appears that the company is not trying to patent the entire multitouch concept , but rather trying to protect certain uses of it – specifically the methods to interpret gestures , and in some cases , the gestures themselves .
Whether Apple succeeds in that attempt is still uncertain .

Author Abstract
This paper examines the extent to which the positive relationship between personal wealth and entry into entrepreneurship is due to financing constraints .
I exploit a tax reform and use unique micro-data from Denmark to study how exogenous changes in the cost of external finance shape both the probability of entering entrepreneurship and the characteristics of those who become entrepreneurs .
As expected , differences - in - differences estimates show that the entry rates for individuals who faced an increase in the cost of finance fell by 40 % relative to those whose cost of external finance was unchanged .
However , while some of the fall in entry was due to less wealthy individuals with high human capital ( confirming the presence of financing constraints ) , the greatest relative decline in entry came from individuals with lower human capital , many of whom were above median wealth .
This finding suggests that an important part of the positive relationship between personal wealth and entrepreneurship may be driven by the fact that wealthy individuals with lower ability can start new businesses because they are less likely to face the disciplining effect of external finance .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chinese police arrested nine Buddhist monks suspected of bombing a government building in Tibet , the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday .
China has accused Tibetan groups of planning suicide attacks following last month ’s riots and protests , but this appeared to be the first report of a bomb attack during the unrest .
President Hu Jintao said earlier on Saturday that the Dalai Lama was trying to “ split the motherland ” through violence -- an accusation the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader has repeatedly denied in the past .
Xinhua said the bombing of the government building occurred on March 23 , but did not say whether it had caused any damage or deaths .
Nine monks from the Tongxia Monastery in Gyanbe Township in Tibet had confessed to the crime , Xinhua added .
“ Cewang Yexe , one of the suspects , brought a homemade bomb with a motorcycle to the site and moved it into the office building with the help of others , ” it reported .
“ They detonated the bomb and ran away . ”
China announced earlier this month that police had seized guns , bullets and explosives in some Tibetan Buddhist monasteries .
But violence reported until now had come during rioting , when protesters torched shops in Tibet ’s regional capital Lhasa and pelted security forces with stones .
The Dalai Lama has rejected claims that he orchestrated the deadly rioting in Lhasa and subsequent protests across Tibetan areas .
He has spoken against the use of violence and asked China for talks about the problems in Tibet .
Chinese officials have said that groups campaigning for independence in Tibet have joined Muslim Uighurs fighting for an independent “ East Turkestan ” in Xinjiang , northwest China .
A mainland - backed paper in Hong Kong reported this week that Tibetan and Uighur forces were also collaborating with al Qaeda to target the Olympic Games in Beijing in August .
Human rights groups have said Beijing is using perceived terror threats , denied by exile Uighur and Tibetan groups , to justify tougher controls in these restive regions .
Also detained in the crackdown in Tibetan areas were some of the young monks who interrupted a state - sponsored media tour in western China this week to yell they had no human rights , the U.S. - based International Campaign for Tibet said on Saturday .
Although local officials and trip organizers made no attempt to break up the demonstration , reporters at the monastery saw security forces taking photos of the monks .

NATIONAL UNITY
President
Hu depicted the Tibet troubles as a threat to Chinese unity in a meeting earlier on Saturday with visiting Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd .
“ Our conflict with the Dalai clique is not an ethnic problem , not a religious problem , nor a human rights problem , ” Hu said .
“ It is a problem of either preserving national unity or splitting the motherland . ”
Hu also reiterated China ’s position that it was open to talks with the Dalai Lama , but that the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader was blocking the way by trying to “ split the motherland ” , “ incite violence ” and “ ruin the Beijing Olympics ” .

The Dalai Lama , asked on Friday night on U.S. television station NBC what message he would like to give China , said : “ We are not against you .
And I ’m not seeking separation . ”
China has bared its teeth at foreign critics who have demanded a softer stance towards the Dalai Lama , a Nobel Peace Prize laureate .
On Friday Beijing denounced a European Parliament call to consider boycotting the opening ceremonies of the Summer Olympics , having earlier condemned a resolution by U.S. lawmakers that urged an end to the crackdown in Tibet .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said the European parliamentarians had “ rudely interfered in China ’s internal affairs ” , “ seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people ” and “ confounded black and white ” , Xinhua reported .
“ The European Parliament turned a blind eye to facts .
It did not condemn the Dalai clique who masterminded and organized the violent crimes , ” she said .
Against this background of growing friction , President Hu used his address at the Boao Forum to try to reassure world politicians and business leaders at the annual meeting on the southern Chinese island of Hainan .
“ Reform and opening - up are what have made China ’s fast development possible in the last 30 uears , and they also hold the key to China ’s future development , ” he said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Gold ended higher on Monday , holding slim gains even as a late - session selloff ate into solid early gains that had pushed bullion to a record high overnight on panic buying amid global financial turmoil .

Bullion should find support in the near term as investors flee to safe - haven assets while the dollar plumbs record lows and a recession - wary Federal Reserve cuts interest rates .
Dealers said gold will remain volatile in the near term , with prices in uncharted territory ahead of a rate - setting decision by the U.S. central bank on Tuesday .
Bill O’Neill , managing partner of LOGIC Advisors in Upper Saddle River in New Jersey , said gold rose on panic buying during the Asian and European trading sessions .
But gold gave back some gains when global stock markets did not deteriorate further .
“ I think some people let go of positions ( after ) gold ran up on thin volume initially , ” O’Neill said .
Spot gold was quoted at $ 1,001.00 /1,001.80 an ounce by New York ’s last quote at 2:15 p.m. EDT after falling to a low of $ 998.90 .
Earlier , it hit a record high of $ 1,030.80 , against its close of $ 996.90/997.70 in New York late on Friday .

“ It looks as though there is just profit - taking after a great run .
There could be selling to meet margin calls as equities tank , ” said David Thurtell , analyst at BNP Paribas .
European shares finished 4 percent lower , led lower by banks , while U.S. stocks erased early losses but the broad - based Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index was still slightly lower by afternoon trade .
A fire sale of Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N stunned Wall Street and pummeled global financial stocks on Monday on fears that few banks are safe from deepening market turmoil .
Investors often turn to gold as insurance in times of financial market crises and economic uncertainties .
Sinking crude oil prices also weighed on gold , which is used as a hedge against inflation .
U.S. crude futures had fallen nearly $ 7 a barrel in afternoon trade .
It settled down $ 4.53 to $ 105.68 a barrel in mid-morning trade .
The dollar tumbled to a 12 - 1/ 2 year low against the Japanese yen and record lows against the euro and Swiss franc as emergency liquidity - boosting measures by the Federal Reserve over the weekend failed to ease worries about the U.S. financial sector .
MARKET GETS SUPPORT
Some analysts said gold should get support from the financial market concerns and a weaker dollar .
“ With the concerns surrounding the other brokerages and banks , it ’s going to keep the gold market very steady , and it ’s going to keep the demand for hard assets , ” O’Neill said .
He expected gold futures could retest record highs in the near term
Wall Street now expects the Fed could slash the Fed Funds rate by another 100 basis points to 2 percent at the end of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting by Tuesday afternoon .

The AquaDom breaks all records as the largest cylinder aquarium in the world , at over 25 meters high .
Filled with about 900,000 liters of seawater , it contains some 2600 fish of 56 species .
It is placed at the lobby of the Radisson SAS Hotel in Berlin .
Combined with a vast amount of sandblasted glass , the giant AquaDom gives a transparent - like feeling to the lobby .
Guests and visitors are able to travel through the aquarium in a glass - enclosed elevator to reach a sightseeing point and restaurant under the glass roof .
Two full - time divers are responsible for the care and feeding of the fish and maintenance of the aquarium .
The AquaDom was opened in December 2003 .
It cost about 12.8 million euros .
The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium is the world 's second largest aquarium and part of the Ocean Expo Park located in Okinawa , Japan .
The main tank holds 7,500 - cubic meters of water and features the world 's largest acrylic glass panel , measuring 8.2 meters by 22.5 meters with a thickness of 60 centimeters .
Whale sharks and manta rays are kept amongst many other fish and plant species in the main tank .

Wristwatches Banned in College - Entry Exams
Thanks to One Lousy Cheater
Some kid used his mobile phone - connected watch to receive incriminating text messages during a college - entry exam in Thailand and now “ all kinds of watches ” have been banned from 18 exam centres .
Thailand has a seriously competitive testing system , with selectivity in some engineering and medicine programs reaching 1 in 100 .
Still , you ’d think that a kid caught using an innovative way to cheat would be sent to the head of the class ( kinda like Captain Kirk and that Kobayashi Maru business ) .
I wonder what they ’ll do when everyone has cellular / GPS implants — little bit harder to ban , I ’d imagine .

Lizz Winstead 's group , Wake Up World with Hope & Davis , a comedy newscast similar to The Daily Show has a new newsbreak video out that could either be a simple slip of the tongue or a very scary peek into the real souls of the Bush administration .
Earlier this week at the press briefing , Dana Perino was asked about the official White House stand towards China 's brutality in Tibet , as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was visiting with the exiled Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama at the same time that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with Chinese leaders to urge them to speak to the Dalai Lama .
Meanwhile , rioters raged through Lhasa , and Tibetans are claiming more than 130 dead .
Maybe all of those things rocketing through that perky little brain of hers yielded some confusion .
Because , while Rice is supposed to be working her way to a peaceful accord , Perino claimed the exact opposite .
Q China sent more troops into Tibet to crack down on the demonstrators .
The United States have any reaction to that ?
" The ground operation did not achieve its objectives , " he said , referring to a massive ground offensive launched in the dying days of the war , when the United Nations was brokering a ceasefire agreement .
Olmert has faced mounting calls to step down in the run-up to the release of the findings on the conduct of Israel 's political and military leaders in the 34 - day war which left more than 1000 people dead .
The report comes nine months after an interim inquiry found Olmert and other political and military leaders responsible for " severe failures " after launching the war against Lebanon 's Hezbollah militia in July 2006 .
Olmert , 62 , was the only senior leader criticised in the commission 's preliminary report to have hung on to his job and had been quoted as saying ahead of the report that he had " absolutely no intention " of stepping down .
A minister from his centrist Kadima party said before the report was delivered that the premier , widely considered one of Israel 's savviest politicians , was intent on resisting pressure to go .
" There will be no early elections , the prime minister is determined on this point and no pressure will make him change his position , " Finance Minister Roni Bar - On told a Kadima meeting .
Today 's report was expected to focus on Olmert 's controversial decision to order a massive ground offensive in south Lebanon 60 hours before a UN - brokered ceasefire agreement was due to take effect on August 14 .
Thirty - three Israeli soldiers were killed in the offensive launched just one hour after the final version of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 was presented to Israel .
Major Tomer Buhadana was one of those wounded during the last 48 hours of war , which in all killed 1200 Lebanese , mostly civilians , and more than 160 Israelis , mostly soldiers .
Buhadana is now one of the leaders of a group of reservists calling on Olmert to quit over the war , widely considered a failure in Israel for failing to stop Hezbollah rocket fire and to retrieve two soldiers whose seizure sparked the conflict on July 12 .
" Our protest is an extension of the war , " he told AFP ahead of the report .
" Many people want to turn a new page but are unable because we believe that assuming responsibility is essential . "
Speculation was running high about Olmert 's future ahead of the report , with Defence Minister Ehud Barak considered to hold the key to his fate .
If Barak decides to take his centre - left Labour party out of the government , it would leave Olmert 's coalition short of the 61 seats needed for majority in the 120 - member parliament .
Barak has said he would decide on whether to quit only after the report is released .
Although he has hinted he did not wish to bring down the government he might have no choice if public pressure is high enough , analysts say .
Such a move would likely lead to new elections , an option not welcomed by the current government since opinion polls predict they would be won by the right - wing opposition party Likud .
An opinion poll published by privately owned Channel 10 television yesterday had found that 58 per cent of Israelis wanted Olmert to step down if the commission 's criticism of his conduct of the war was " very severe " , against 23 per cent who said he should stay on whatever the findings .
Olmert is also embroiled in a series of corruption scandals since officially assuming his post in May 2006 after his predecessor Ariel Sharon fell into a coma .
Former army chief Dan Halutz quit a year ago and ex-defence minister Amir Peretz was ousted from the ministry and as head of his Labour party less than two months after Winograd 's interim findings .

AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - The U.S. dollar ’s value is dropping so fast against the euro that small currency outlets in Amsterdam are turning away tourists seeking to sell their dollars for local money while on vacation in the Netherlands .
“ Our dollar is worth maybe zero over here , ” said Mary Kelly , an American tourist from Indianapolis , Indiana , in front of the Anne Frank house .
“ It ’s hard to find a place to exchange .
We have to go downtown , to the central station or post office . ”
That ’s because the smaller currency exchanges -- despite buy / sell spreads that make it easier for them to make money by exchanging small amounts of currency -- do n’t want to be caught holding dollars that could be worth less by the time they can sell them .
The dollar hovered near record lows on Monday , with one euro worth around $ 1.58 versus $ 1.47 a month ago .
At 2:04 p.m. EST on Jan. 14 , 2008 , the MESSENGER spacecraft skimmed 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) above the surface of Mercury in the first of three flybys of the planet .
Initial indications from the radio signals indicate the spacecraft is still operating nominally .
The first science data return from the flyby was received just minutes before the closest approach point with the planet , as planned .
“ The engineers and operators at the Deep Space Network ( DSN ) in Goldstone , Calif. , in conjunction with engineers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ( APL ) in Laurel , Md. , pulled off a tremendous feat , acquiring and locking onto the downlink signal from the spacecraft within seconds , providing the necessary Doppler measurements for the Radio Science team ” said MESSENGER Mission Systems Engineer Eric Finnegan , of APL . “
The spacecraft is continuing to collect imagery and other scientific measurements from the planet as we now depart Mercury from the illuminated side , documenting for the first time the previously unseen surface of the planet . ”
Tomorrow at noon EST , the spacecraft will turn back towards the Earth to start down - linking the on - board stored data .
Measurements of this Doppler signal from the spacecraft will allow improve knowledge of Mercury ’s gravity field .
Keeping a Rendezvous with Mercury
Between January 9 and 13 , 2008 , as the MESSENGER probe approached Mercury for its first flyby , the Narrow Angle Camera , part of the Mercury Dual Imaging System ( MDIS ) , acquired a series of images of the planet in support of spacecraft navigation .
These images have been put together as frames in a movie .
The final frame of the movie has the highest spatial resolution ( 20 km / pixel , 12 miles / pixel ) and was recorded when the spacecraft was at a distance of about 760,000 kilometers ( 470,000 miles ) from Mercury .
Mercury is about 4.880 kilometers ( about 3,030 miles ) in diameter .
As part of MESSENGER 's flyby on January 14 , MDIS will obtain high - resolution image sequences with the Narrow Angle Camera , and the Wide Angle Camera will collect images in eleven colors .
The images will cover portions of the planet never before seen by spacecraft , as well as regions that were photographed by Mariner 10 in 1974 and 1975 .
The new data for the previously studied areas of Mercury will help scientists to interpret the data for the parts of the planet that MESSENGER will reveal for the first time .
Additional information and features from this first flyby can be viewed online at http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/mer_flyby1.html.
The latest released images and science results from the flyby will be posted as they become available .
MESSENGER ( MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry , and Ranging ) is a NASA - sponsored scientific investigation of the planet Mercury and the first space mission designed to orbit the planet closest to the Sun .
The MESSENGER spacecraft launched on August 3 , 2004 , and after flybys of Earth , Venus , and Mercury will start a yearlong study of its target planet in March 2011 .
Dr. Sean C. Solomon , of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , leads the mission as principal investigator .
The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory built and operates the MESSENGER spacecraft and manages this Discovery - class mission for NASA .
Should policy discussions between officials be disclosed under the Freedom of Information ( FOI ) Act ?
Or should they be withheld to reassure civil servants that they can speak frankly , safe from the press and public 's prying eyes ?
These issues were central to two recent High Court cases .
Each involved the Government challenging rulings by the Information Tribunal that such material should be disclosed .
The first involved a request for the submissions which the Export Credits Guarantee Department ( ECGD ) received from other government departments about a proposal to extract oil and gas near the island of Sakhalin , north of Japan .
The project is contentious because oil spills could endanger a near - extinct species of whale .

Friends of the Earth applied for the information under the environmental information regulations , which provide a similar right of access to the FOI Act .
The decision under both laws is simple : does the balance of public - interest arguments favour disclosure or confidentiality ?
A critical issue has been how much weight to give to the sensitivity of the documents themselves .
The Government argues that the decision - making process itself requires " space to think " , even where the information itself is innocuous .
In earlier cases it has taken this to absurd lengths arguing for the withholding of even the blandest minutes .
The Tribunal , on the other hand , has been impatient with general arguments and insisted that the Government should show how disclosure of the actual information involved would harm the public interest .
In the ECGD case the Tribunal concluded that disclosure of one of the three submissions would improve , not harm , the quality of decision - making and that another did little more than ask to be kept informed .
In court , the Government argued that the Tribunal had made an error of law by refusing to give any weight at all to its arguments about frankness and collective ministerial responsibility .
The judge accepted that these factors should be taken into account , but it also found that the Tribunal had done so .
It made no criticism of the Tribunal 's view that these arguments were not trump cards in favour of confidentiality .
The Government 's challenge was dismissed , though an appeal to the Court of Appeal is still possible .
The other case involved a 2004 review of the readiness of the identity - card programme 's IT systems which the Tribunal also held should be disclosed on public - interest grounds .
The Government argues that doing so would make it impossible for officials to speak frankly to those carrying out such " gateway reviews " in future .
In a surprise move , the Attorney General has intervened on behalf of the Speaker of the House of Commons to argue that the Tribunal had breached parliamentary privilege by quoting a select committee report in support of its decision , and that this breaches the 1689 Bill of Rights prohibition against a court questioning statements made in Parliament .
The AG argues that if such reports are accepted as evidence , the other party must have the right to challenge them , which would inevitably breach privilege .
The irony of this case is that the 2004 report , of the work and pensions select committee , had questioned whether " the current levels of secrecy are necessary " .

The TSA has been known to take issue with products designed in Cupertino before , but for one particular traveler , it was Apple 's thinnest laptop ever that caused the latest holdup .
Upon tossing his ultra -sleek slab of aluminum underneath the scanner , security managed to find enough peculiarities to remove it from the flow , pull it aside and wrangle up the owner for some questions .
Apparently , the TSA employee manning the line was flabbergasted by the " lack of a drive " and the complete absence of " ports on the back , " and while hordes of co-workers swarmed to investigate , the user 's flight took off on schedule .
Thankfully , said owner was finally allowed to pass through after some more in - the - know colleagues explained in painfully simple terms what an SSD was , but the poor jet - setter most definitely paid the price for trying to slip some of the latest and greatest under the sharp eyes of the TSA ( and cutting it close on time , of course ) .

Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson put forth a number of “ new ” ideas for changes in the regulatory structures .
Nothing I saw will help all that much in the current crisis .
It ’s more like re-arranging the deck chairs as the ship is going down .
It seems like most of it is being proposed to prevent another crisis like the one we are in from occurring in the future .
That simply insures that Wall Street will have to invent whole new ways to create a crisis in the future .
I am sure they will be up to the task .
~ John Mauldin ( April 4 , 2008 )
We have seen this before .
In 1980 , Congress abolished the law that prohibited banks from paying market rates of interest on deposits under $ 100,000 — a law that had been designed to hurt small investors and also make low - cost funds available to banks .
It was a price control .
It blew up after 1976 .
Price controls restrict the supply of whatever is controlled .
The new law was the Monetary Control Act of 1980 .
Why did Congress pass it ?
Because the banks were hemorrhaging money .
Why ?
Because Federal Reserve policy had changed .
Under Arthur Burns and his short - termed successor , G. William Miller , the FED had pumped in fiat money with abandon .
This began in the 1970 — 71 recession , which was caused by tight - money policies imposed after Johnson left office in 1969 .
In fiscal 1971 and 1972 , Nixon ’s administration ran back - to - back deficits of $ 23 billion , which were considered gigantic at the time — and were .
The FED ’s policy of monetary expansion accelerated the outflow of gold , which had begun under Eisenhower ’s second term and became a major problem under Johnson in 1968 .
So , Nixon unilaterally took the country of the gold exchange standard , under which foreign governments and central banks had been able to buy gold from the U.S. Treasury at $ 35 / oz .
That marked the beginning of the stagflation of the 1970’s .
The FED accelerated this inflationary process in the recession of 1975 .
Interest rates rose in response to rising prices .
Paul Volcker replaced Miller in the fall of 1979 .
Under him , the FED changed policy : from targeting interest rates to tight money .
Short - term rates soared as the new conditions — high demand for loans , tight money — pushed rates higher than they had ever been in the 20th century .
In 1974 , an entrepreneur created the Capital Preservation Fund .
It invested only in short - term Treasury debt .
It was not a bank .
It was called a money - market fund .
It could legally offer investors a rate of return close to what the U.S. Treasury was offering big investors .
Banks could n’t .
You could write checks off of it .
Savings accounts in banks offered no such option .
I worked for Howard Ruff as a telephone consultant from 1977 — 1979 .
We recommended Capital Preservation Fund .
It was a time of rising interest rates .
The fund had imitators .
Soon , money was flowing out of banks into a new investment medium , money market funds .
The banks could not compete .
They were trapped : rising interest rates , falling deposits , and a price control on what they were allowed to offer to small depositors .
Meanwhile , the loans that they had made to Latin America as agents of the oil - exporting nations ’ gigantic inflow of funds began to go bad in 1980 .
The market value of these loans began to fall , threatening the biggest banks ’ balance sheets .
So , Congress changed the rules that year .
It allowed the banks to keep these bad loans on the books at book value : the price originally paid .
That decision led to today ’s subprime crisis , where bad debt that was rated AAA turned out to be worthless .
New accounting rules , adopted last year , require banks to mark their value to market .
This has threatened the banks ’ balance sheets .
In 1980 , Congress intervened in another area .
It abolished Regulation Q , the interest rate ceiling on small deposits ( under $ 100,000 ) .
This raised the cost of funds for the banks , but it kept them from bankruptcy .
As part of the payoff to the banks , Congress allowed banks to make mortgages , putting them in competition with the savings & loan industry .
Soon , the S&L industry responded by raising its rates to “ depositors ” ( legally , investors ) and making more long - term mortgage loans .
This was the ancient carry trade : borrow short , lend long .
With Carter ’s recession of 1980 , which ended but then was replaced by a worse one under Reagan in 1981 , the S&L industry went into a crisis .
They began going bankrupt in the mid-1980 ’s because of a slowdown in home sales due to the recession and its aftermath .
It took Congress hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out the S&L industry .
Step by step , Congress solves one crisis by sowing the seeds for the next one .
THE HORSES ARE OUT OF THE BARN
The subprime real estate loans have been made .
The slightly safer Alt - A loans have been made .
The unqualified borrowers bought their homes at the top of the housing bubble : 2005 , 2006 .
In 2007 , the market visibly reversed .
Now the delinquency rate has risen .
As the subprime crisis has spread around the world ever since last August , over - leveraged hedge funds and investment pools have been hit with hundreds of billions of dollars of losses .
The Carlyle Capital fund , created in 2006 to buy Fannie Mae mortgages with borrowed money ( 32 to one leverage ) is the poster child of stupid money invested by supposedly very smart people .
It got a $ 400 million margin call on $ 16.6 billion in debt and went bust in just one week — the week of the Bear Stearns disaster .
The investment banks that loaned smart people all that stupid money are now hemorrhaging .
They are lining up to get paid by busted hedge funds .
When the courts and the lawyers get through with them , whatever is left over will have to be put on the books at market value , not book value .
Mayday !
Mayday !
The horses are out of the barn .
What is crucial to the solvency of the American financial sector today is a legal way for accountants to count missing horses as if they were still safely locked inside the barn .
This , the government has recently provided .
The Division of Corporate Finance of the United States Government has therefore modified the new rule by allowing a specific interpretation of the rule .
As of March , it will allow institutions to cook the books temporarily .
In March 2008 , the Division of Corporation Finance sent the following illustrative letter to certain public companies identifying a number of disclosure issues they may wish to consider in preparing Management ’s Discussion and Analysis for their upcoming quarterly reports on Form 10 - Q .
What , exactly , does the modification allow ?
Postponement .
The key phrase is “ unobservable inputs . ”
We note that you reported a significant amount of asset - backed securities , loans carried at fair value or the lower of cost or market , and derivative assets and liabilities in your financial statements in your recent Form 10 - K. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 , Fair Value Measurements , defines fair value , provides a framework for you to measure the fair value of your assets and liabilities , and requires you to provide certain disclosures about those measurements .
Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities in orderly transactions .
Under SFAS 157 , it is appropriate for you to consider actual market prices , or observable inputs , even when the market is less liquid than historical market volumes , unless those prices are the result of a forced liquidation or distress sale .
Only when actual market prices , or relevant observable inputs , are not available is it appropriate for you to use unobservable inputs which reflect your assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability .
Current market conditions may require you to use valuation models that require significant unobservable inputs for some of your assets and liabilities .
So , the corporate accounting team looks at the current market price of the asset and then searches for mitigating factors .
This is pick - and - choose accounting .
For example , consider providing a range of values around the fair value amount you arrived at to provide a sense of how the fair value estimate could potentially change as the significant inputs vary .
To the extent you provide a range , discuss why you believe the range is appropriate , identifying the key drivers of variability , and discussing how you developed the inputs you used in determining the range .
This reminds of me of the new , improved way of teaching arithmetic .
The student can get extra credit for explaining why he got the wrong answer .
Investors will still be kept , if not in the dark , then at least the shadows .
But existing investors prefer this .
They do not want the truth .
They prefer the illusion of solvency .
Like Japanese bankers from 1990 to 2006 , they do not want the capital losses to be written down where the investment world can see them .
The game must be kept going for the economy not to fall into a major recession .
Investors were lured into leveraged investments that have gone bad .
These investments are not going to get better .
They will get written off as losses .
The question is : When ?
The government and the big banks want this answer : later .
GETTING FROM NOW UNTIL THEN
If the price of housing continues to fall , the number of bad loans will increase .
Borrowers will find themselves under water : owing more than their homes are worth .
They will either walk away or just stop paying their monthly bills , and wait for a court to kick them out .
This will take years if they just sit there , paying only their property taxes on time .
They may not know this yet , but hundreds of thousands of them will find out .
The ability of the mortgage - holding financial institutions to conceal these bad loans from the capital markets is limited .
The longer the price decline continues , the more of the loans will be called into question .
The standard figure is $ 200 billion in bad loans .
This is standard because most of this is behind us .
The problem is , the figure is acknowledged to be overly optimistic .
According to a report issued by the International Monetary Fund , losses could reach $ 800 billion .
This was reported by Germany ’s major news magazine , Der Spiegel ( March 26 ) , but it has received little attention in the American media .
Understand , this is not $ 800 billion of losses in a broad market , such as all U.S. stocks .
This is concentrated in the financial sector , which supplies capital to the economy .
This is the center of the economy — exactly where Ludwig von Mises wrote in 1912 that the forecasting errors are concentrated during a period of monetary inflation fostered by the central bank .
But , in this case , the errors were not confined to one nation .
They have spread into the international financial markets that bought America ’s AAA - rated debt .
The bad news keeps dribbling out .
It has not created a panic in the capital markets because investors do not understand the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
They do not understand the extent to which capital has been misallocated .
They do not see the severity of the losses under recessionary conditions .
These losses can be concealed by cooking the books temporarily .
They can not be concealed if the decline in housing prices continues .
There is nothing on the horizon that I see that will reverse this decline .
The chief economist for the National Association of Realtors thinks the housing market may turn up in the second half of 2008 .
This is similar to the happy - face prediction that led to the departure of his predecessor , David Lereah .
For a time chart that tracks their statements and the housing decline , click here .
Yun ’s March , 2008 forecast is this :
Rising sales will also bring down inventory and help strengthen home prices .
The national median price of an existing home will fall in the first half of the year and then rise in the second half .
For the year as a whole , the median price will have fallen by 1 percent — after having fallen 1.4 percent last year .
His figures are immediately suspect .
From January , 2007 to January , 2008 , according to the Case - Shiller index , which is widely accepted , the median house price fell in 10 cities declined by 11.4 % .
This is the steepest decline in the index ’s 21 - year history .
In 20 cities , it was down 10.7 % , the steepest decline in the index ’s 8 - year history .
We are in the early stages of a recession .
Why should we expect American housing prices to bottom in June ?
The interest rate re-sets are contractually scheduled to continue through 2009 .
Who expects the foreclosure rate to slow ?
If they increase , why should prices increase in the second half of 2008 ?
Or 2009 ?
CONCLUSION
The media will promote the changes that will centralize control under the Federal Reserve System .
This is a foregone conclusion .
But the changes will not fix the financial system ’s losses from the previous mistakes .
These mistakes have not begun to spread through the economy .
The public is not in panic mode .
It has not been in panic mode since 1991 .
Today ’s investors do not remember what a serious recession can do .
The public ’s faith shown in the FED is remarkable .
That faith will be abandoned by a growing minority of Americans when the economy moves into full - scale recession .
The press will do what it can to blame anyone and anything except the FED , but this strategy has limits .
The government and the FED have worked together to create this crisis .
They will work together to cover up the effects of prior policies .
This will lead to even greater crises .
We have a tiger by the tail .

Nearly a quarter cannot identify Adolf Hitler , with ten percent thinking Hitler was a munitions manufacturer .
A third do not know that the Bill of Rights guarantees the freedom of speech and religion .
More than a quarter think Christopher Columbus sailed after 1750 .
Fewer than half can place the Civil War in the correct half - century .
Half have no idea what the Renaissance was .
Nearly half think that The Scarlet Letter was either about a witch trial or a piece of correspondence .

Here are the top 10 tech - related April Fools ' jokes to play on friends and co-workers .
The best geek pranks make a gadget or a co-worker 's computer appear " broken . "
Watch with glee as the unsuspecting victim goes mental trying to figure it out .
The list was compiled mostly from reader submissions to last year 's April Fools ' widget .
Remember , jokes are supposed to be funny , so do n’t really break anything .
__1 . Re-map the Keyboard of Your Excitable Co-worker__Every company has a sales rep who uses exclamation marks excessively ( " C'mon guys !!
We can do better this quarter !!! " ) .
Use a program like KeyExtender , a registry hack that re-maps their keyboard so that exclamations and question marks are switched .
They may begin to question their sunny outlook in life : " C'mon guys ??
We can do better this quarter ???
Guys ? ? "
As they paw helplessly at their keyboards , sidle up and ' fix ' their problem .
Do n’t forget to smile .
_ _2 . The Speech - to - Text Platform Joke__You 'll need a wireless keyboard for this .
Set up a meeting with a colleague to teach them a speech - recognition program ( you 'll need a plausible reason why the company needs this ) .
Then , right before the meeting , connect your keyboard wirelessly to the victim 's computer .
Explain to the victim that the program will have to be trained to recognize their voice , and give them a sample sentence to try out .
As they do this , have a co-worker a few desks away type gibberish into the program page ( " Boomshakalaka ! ) .
The poor guy will make a fool of himself talking louder and changing his pronunciation to try and make it work .
3. Desktop Havoc on the MacA London design firm called Troika has produced video of an amazing computer " virus , " which may or may not be publicly available .
It 's probably just a clever art project , but it 's too good not to mention here .
Nonetheless , Troika 's Newton Virus is a Mac bug that rearranges the desktop icons using the accelerometers built into recent MacBooks .
When the unsuspecting user picks up their laptop , all the icons and menu items fall to the ground as though under the influence of gravity .
Watch it here :
This prank is perfect for control freaks who ca n’t stand to see even one icon moved on their desktop .
They must be stopped !
__4 . Optical Mouse Confusion__This is an update of the old mouse - ball - removal trick : A small piece of tape over the laser sensor on an optical mouse will cause it to go haywire .
Just color the nonstick side of the tape with a Sharpie and then tape it over the lens .
A Wired.com reader last year reported that someone at a major tech company ( it rhymes with ' Frisco ' ) was fooled by this trick four times in a single day .
Sometimes the simplest pranks are the most enjoyable .
__5 . Change the Language Settings on Google__When a co-worker leaves her computer unattended for a minute , quickly go to Google 's home page and click on " Preferences . "
There , you can choose the interface language of the search engine .
Klingon , Hacker and Yiddish are all excellent choices , but Elmer Fudd is our personal favorite .
As Elmer , you can use the Google Diwectowy , perform a Google Seawch or find out if you 're ‘ feewing wucky . '
You 'll be amazed how few people realize you can do this .
The change - the - language trick also works well on cellphones .
_ _6 . The BlueScreen of Death Screensaver__The BlueScreen of Death error in Windows has driven lots of users to the fringe of computer homicide .
Tap into the river of pain by installing the BlueScreen of Death Screensaver on a friend 's machine .
It 's available at Microsoft 's IT website Technet , but there are several others out there .
Just make sure it does n’t have a real virus .
The Blue Screen of Death
What ’s likely to happen ?
The victim will reboot his machine by hitting the restart button .
Hopefully , they did n't save their work !
__7 . Splitting Monitor Cables__This is one even software geeks wo n't easily figure out .
Open up their monitor cable ( do n't worry , it 's safe ) and wire the RGB lines to different colors – this will totally warp the image on the screen .
Everyone will assume it's a software problem .
You 're so clever .
You can thank us later .
__8 . The Old Screenshot - as - Desktop - Wallpaper Gag__This classic is as good as gold .
Take a screenshot of your friend 's desktop and make it their desktop wallpaper .
You 'll have to minimize applications , hide all of the desktop icons , and set the Windows task bar to auto hide .
Pull up a comfortable chair and pretend to feel their pain while they click like mad and rail at the gods .
__9 . Change Autocorrect in MS Office__People are too reliant on some common programs that help them cheat , such as the Autocorrect feature in MS Office .
Capitalize on their laziness by adding a few of your favorite " alternative " spellings .
Common words like " about " or " together " work well .
Even better , try subtly adjusting the spelling of your victim 's name .
It 's so hard - wired into most people 's fingers , they hardly look at it .
Right , Mr. Dumass ?
__10 . Remotely Monitor a Friend 's Webcam__Spy on your best buddy at work through his webcam ( think American Pie ) , record the feed , then show a compilation of his brow - furrowing and nose - picking at the next staff meeting .
This is why they like you .
You can do this through remote - monitoring programs , such as WebCam Monitor on Windows ; and even do it through an iPhone using Telekinesis , an iPhone app that allows you to take pictures on a Mac laptop using its built - in iSight camera .
But wait , April Fools ' does n't end here .
If you play tricks on friends or co-workers , take a picture and submit it using this Reddit widget .
We 'll feature the top picks in an upcoming gallery .
The first sign that something was wrong inside the large tanker parked under a flyover came at 8.15 am yesterday when Pete Hobbs and his colleagues heard a faint banging .
Then as they approached the lorry , the plaintive cries from inside became audible .
They said : " Help us .
We 're dying . "
Within minutes the full paraphernalia of a major emergency had descended on the underpass in a scruffy corner of south - east London where early yesterday Mr Hobbs and his workmates fitting a new water main unwittingly stumbled upon a new example of the desperate and dangerous lengths that illegal immigrants are prepared to go to in order to reach Britain .
Covered from head to foot in the black charcoal dust that they had hidden in for at least 12 hours , eight migrants – including a 12 - year - old boy – emerged from the sealed hatches of the German - registered lorry , gasping for air .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The men , confirmed last night as two Eritreans , three Iraqi Kurds and three Iranians , collapsed on to the pavement on the edge of a housing estate in Abbey Wood , near Woolwich , in front of astonished emergency workers and locals .
Mr Hobbs , 19 , from Chatham , Kent , a contract worker , said : " We 'd just started working and we noticed this big lorry parked up under a flyover .
At first all we could hear was this frantic banging from inside the tanker .
We rushed over and we could hear men's voices shouting ' help us ' and ' we 're dying ' .
We banged on the cab door and got the driver out .
He was wearing ear plugs so he could n't hear anything .
He said to call the police and soon afterwards these guys started climbing out .
They were totally black from whatever was inside .
It was a weird sight .
They were coughing and wheezing and the ambulancemen laid some of them out on the ground to help them .
They were wrapped in blankets and looked in a bad way . "
An air ambulance , a chemical response team and about a dozen police , fire service and ambulance vehicles were called to the scene amid concern that the tanker was carrying a hazardous substance .
In reality , it was carrying about 15 tonnes of charcoal powder for use in the Crossness sewage treatment works , less than a mile from the underpass .
It is understood the migrants were lying on top of the cargo but had sunk into powder and run short of oxygen after breathing all the air in the sealed tank .
While many thousands have risked their lives – and unknown numbers been killed – by clinging on to lorry axles or huddling under the wind deflectors above drivers ' cabs , anti-trafficking campaigners said it was the first time that illegal immigrants have been found inside a fully loaded chemical tanker .
The 55 - year - old driver of the lorry , owned by a German freight company called H Freund , was last night being held at a police station in south London on suspicion of people trafficking .
Scotland Yard said the lorry had begun its journey at the company 's headquarters in Cologne , but it was not known where or how the migrants had got inside .
H Freund declined to comment on the incident and said it was co-operating with the authorities .

It is understood the vehicle made its journey via Calais , where hundreds of asylum - seekers attempt to board lorries every night .
Lorraine Johnson , 57 , who lives opposite the flyover , said : " The ambulancemen and police were pulling these people out .
I thought they were all dead , they were just limp .
It took four of the emergency guys to pull one up out of the hatch . "
The men were taken to hospital and treated for breathing problems before being discharged into the custody of the Border and Immigration Agency ( BIA ) .
Migrants pay between £ 2,000 and £ 20,000 to trafficking gangs who smuggle them across Europe into the UK .
The BIA said last month that about 18,000 potential illegal immigrants had been stopped trying to enter Britain last year , of whom 13,000 had been found hidden on vehicles travelling through ports .
Nick Kinsella , head of the UK Human Trafficking Centre , which highlights the plight of such people , said : " This is about criminals selling people in the same way that they sell any other commodity and there is good money to be made . "
A perilous journey
* The worst human trafficking tragedy in Britain was in June 2000 when 58 Chinese illegal immigrants were found suffocated in a lorry at Dover docks .
Perry Wacker , 41 , a haulier from Rotterdam , closed the only air vent on the container of his lorry to prevent customs officials from discovering his illicit cargo , each of whom had paid thousands of pounds to a criminal gang to be brought to Europe .
Officials found the bodies of 54 men and four women hidden behind a consignment of tomatoes .
Wacker was jailed for 14 years .
* In December 2001 , eight bodies were found in a sea container in Waterford in the Irish Republic .
The victims , thought to be from Turkey , Romania and Albania , had suffocated inside a consignment of office furniture from Italy .
It is thought they had spent four days at sea on the journey from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge and died after the voyage was delayed for 48 hours by bad weather .
A lorry driver taking the container to nearby Wexford was alerted by the banging of five survivors on the sides .
* A tragedy was narrowly averted in October 2003 when 26 Sri Lankan refugees were found suffering the effects of breathing in engine fumes in a van travelling through Dover .
Officials said they would have lapsed into unconsciousness after another hour in the vehicle .

Atlanta was an accident - a beautifully contrived one , at that .
The city is relatively young , tracing its infancy when a random point at the railroad map was called " Terminus . "
The railroads were built , and Terminus was renamed Atlanta .
Today , Atlanta is proof that accidents produce the greatest discoveries .
The industry 's leading giants , including Coca - Cola , has decided to settle in this random point .
The city 's progressive feel is imminent wherever you go .
The 1996 Olympics remain a thing of the past , as Atlanta is now a venue for the South 's best nightlife , dining , and art .
Guests must see its list of entrepreneurial achievements , starting with the Atlanta history center and the High Museum of Art .
Tourists can visit downtown Atlanta and see the Georgia Aquarium , the CNN Center , the World of Coca Cola , and the Centennial Olympic Park , or visit Sweet Auburn 's historic sites .
Five million people have resulted from the railroad industry 's mishap , and there is no stopping attractions and industries from dotting its fields .
Atlanta , Georgia has played a great part in making America , truly the United States of America in the 20th century .
Martin Luther King Jr. , the architect of united America , famously said , ' The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience , but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy . 
If one is to really look past the literal meaning of these words , it would n't be impossible to understand what the Atlanta culture really stands for .
It 's a culture of tolerance , of unity , of principles , of standing up for what you believe in and of equality .
These are the qualities that often easily transcend times and places “ but somehow , for those who care to think , Atlanta embodies a bigger purpose than its sights .
And this is not to mean that there are no sights to see in Atlanta “ quite the opposite .
Atlanta is riddled with historical buildings , important places , natural beauty and places of interest .
It is , then , no wonder that a place like “ the capital of the State of Georgia “ has become a leading tourist destination in the South of America .
Tourism has become one of the most productive of revenue streams in Atlanta over the years , with over 2 million tourists estimated to regularly visit the city every year .
The largest claim to fame that Atlanta can make is its incredibly consistent weather all through the year , a longstanding tradition of producing great leaders and politicians , world class standard of infrastructure , beautifully maintained parks and public places , well restored historical sites and buildings , a host of culinary delights local to the city and a variety of cultural shows taking place in the city , especially in summer months .

If you are traveling with your family , you will be better off finding a slightly higher priced but much safer hotel within the city limits , than cheap hotels .
Given the length and breadth of the city , it 's really not difficult to find such a hotel in Atlanta .

Many famous Atlanta hotels are within short driving distances of the international airport .
Being the world 's busiest airport , the Hartsfield - Jackson Int. Airport at Atlanta has world class transport infrastructure to ensure that tourists and visitors arriving do not have much difficulties in reaching their destination places in Atlanta .

Best Time to Travel to Atlanta
The best time to travel to Atlanta is during the months of May to August .
These are the months when Atlanta is at its brightest and cheeriest with a number of outdoor music and food festivals taking place .
During winter months , even though winters down south are not really harsh , tourists can hope to find great deals with Atlanta hotels , allowing them to explore options other than merely cheap hotels .
This is not , however , a line set in stone .
Many tourists , especially the ones from Europe , are best advised to visit Atlanta during mild winters that last from September through to January .
This makes sense as the intense heat and humidity of summer may make the stay in Atlanta uncomfortable for tourists who are not used to such climes .
In the end , it can be said with confidence that the geographical location of Atlanta has made sure that it remains an enjoyable place all year round , rarely experiencing extremes of weather ( of course , barring seasonal high winds and occasional storms ) .

Failure to reproduce results deals blow to work on olfactory networks .
A paper in < i> Nature </i > co-authored by Nobel prizewinning scientist Linda Buck has been retracted after the researchers were unable to reproduce the results .
The authors now report that they have found “ inconsistencies ” between the original data and the data published in 2001 .
The retracted paper ( Z. Zou , L. F. Horowitz , J. - P. Montmayeur , S. Snapper and L. B. Buck < i> Nature </i> < b>414,</b> 173–179 ; 2001 ) describes tracing individual neural pathways from scent receptors in the nose through to the brain 's olfactory cortex .
Researchers in Buck 's lab , then at Harvard Medical School in Boston , Massachusetts , produced transgenic mice that expressed a plant protein in neurons that have a specific odour receptor .
The plant protein can travel across the junctions between neurons , allowing researchers to map neuronal networks by pinpointing the protein 's location .
But researchers in Buck 's lab , now at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , Washington , have since been unable to reproduce the original results .
A subsequent review cast doubt on the validity of the published data .
“ There were inconsistencies in the data that were in figures contributed to the paper by the first author compared to the original data , ” says Buck .
“ I would say that we have totally lost confidence in the conclusions of that paper . ”
A synopsis of author contributions , published together with the retraction ( see page 120 ) , lists co-first - author Zhihua Zou as solely responsible for providing data and figures for the paper .
Zou , now a researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston , did not respond to < i> Nature < / i >'s requests for comment .
Lisa Horowitz , who shared first authorship with Zou and continues to work in Buck 's lab , was credited only with providing reagents and designing experiments .

Harvard Medical School has formed an ad hoc committee to review the retraction , and Buck has asked the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to review two later publications on which Zou was the lead author .
“ It 's disappointing of course , ” says Buck .
“ The important thing is to correct the literature . ”
The retracted paper has been cited 138 times , according to Thomson Scientific 's ISI Web of Knowledge .
But the retraction will probably have only a minor effect on the field , says olfactory - neuron researcher Hitoshi Sakano of the University of Tokyo , Japan .
Other researchers have corroborated some of the paper 's results using other techniques , he notes .
Neuroscientist Gilles Laurent of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , whose work on insect olfactory networks has occasionally conflicted with the results reported by Buck 's lab , says that this has not hindered his research .
“ These questions are sufficiently complex and require such large amounts of data at high resolution that I have never considered them convincingly resolved in any system , ” he says .
Two Years Later , the Housing Crash is On
The Domino Effect on the U.S. Economy
Solutions for Surviving the Economic Downfall of America
The Good News
U.S. Spending Top Three List : War , Disease and Debt
Sobering Economic News Wins You No Friends in a Delusional Nation
( NewsTarget ) Americans have always been fond of the idea of getting rich without effort by putting their money in things that produce no profits and then magically being able to ride those investments , milking them for spending cash that supports a drunken spending lifestyle .
From 1998 - 2001 , that profit vehicle was , of course , dot - com stocks .
From 2001 to the present , it 's been housing .
Never mind the fact that a house produces nothing real , earns nothing real and actually loses utility with each successive year of its existence ( roof repairs , anyone ? ) --
Americans have been convinced over the last seven years that housing prices would rise forever , allowing people to simply extract money from their home equity as if their house were some sort of giant ATM machine .
As the markets are finally demonstrating today , the " economic good times " spurred by a runaway housing price boom ( and powered by astonishingly fraudulent lending practices by dishonest banks ) are over .
A day of reckoning has arrived , and the unwinding of this false wealth that has been propping up the U.S. economy for so many years is about to be unleashed upon the American people .
( Today 's stock market meltdown is only the beginning ... ) That this day of economic reckoning would arrive has been obvious to me for years .
On December 29 , 2005 , I published a two - part article series entitled , " Do n't get caught in the housing bubble crash . "
Part two is available HERE
In those articles , I stated : There 's no question whatsoever that this housing market will experience a correction .
... It 's eventually going to come tumbling down .
The only question is whether it 's going to be a correction or a crash .
Friends , I believe it is time to take your money and exit the speculative real estate market .
The average person does n't understand anything about finances and never will .
The average person can't even calculate a 15 percent tip at a restaurant , and he or she is buying real estate because he or she wants to double his or her money .
Are you kidding me ?
Take your money and run ; that 's my advice .
Run from the inflated real estate marketplace before you become another victim .
These super hot , speculative housing bubbles and stock market bubbles cannot continue .
They always correct .
Gravity kicks in , and , eventually , things unwind .
A lot of people get hurt .
They lose their money .
To some of those people , I say , " That 's a really expensive education you just paid for . "
A lot of life 's lessons are hard to learn , but some of them can be rather expensive .
So , it 's December 2005 .
I 'm going on the record as saying this bubble is going to pop , folks , and you can call me a pessimist or a doomsayer if you want .
The fact is , if you understand math , you know I 'm right .
If you want to protect your own finances , you 'd better take a good , hard look at this and make some decisions about what you 're going to do .
Do not leave yourself over - leveraged in speculative real estate .
You thought you were going to retire on the beach , and it ends up you 're flipping burgers as a second job to pay off what you owe the bank , and they garnish your wages on top of that .
That 's what happens to people who do n't get out in time .
I point out these predictions not to prove I was right , but rather to demonstrate how easy it was to see these things coming .
The inevitable bursting of the housing bubble was a no brainer to any rationally - minded person , and yet everywhere I turned back in 2005 , I kept hearing ( from apparently intelligent folks ) things like , " Housing prices have never fallen , " or , " Buying a house is the best investment you can make !
" Nonsense .
Any fool could see that while housing prices were rising 15 - 25 % a year in some regions , there were no underlying fundamentals that would justify such an increase in the value of the property .
The population , for example , was n't increasing by 25 % per year .
Houses were n't becoming 25 % more useful .
Land was n't becoming 25 % more scarce .
So what could possibly explain the rapid rise in housing prices ?
That easy lending practices were being so aggressively pushed could only mean that more money was being artificially injected into the housing market , causing a fictitious rise in the value of homes based on the fact that there was too much money floating around in the hands of people who probably would n't qualify for such loans under normal , rigorous lending conditions .
And once you realize that , it 's not difficult to figure out that And that , of course , will inevitably lead to a sustained drop in housing prices that , as I predicted , could ultimate see many homes drop to 50 % of their peak values .
That 's what 's coming .
I do n't even have to offer a prediction of it :
It 's just a natural reaction to the economic practices that have been so unwisely pursued in this country for years .
The U.S. economy , as any astute financial observer has noted for years , is running on artificial wealth that has been manufactured by the Federal Reserve and swallowed by gullible consumers chasing that pot of gold at the end of the easy money rainbow .
An alarmingly large percentage of U.S. economic activity is driven by consumer spending and the taxation of such activities .
So when housing prices plummet and consumer bankruptcies start piling up , here 's what we 're going to see next :
We are going to see cities and states go belly up , pension programs terminated ( or watered down ) , and financial institutions teetering on the brink of disaster .
And the worst part of it all ?
This is the part where the late Aaron Russo and his filmcomes into play .
If you have n't already watched this documentary on the massive fraud of the Federal Reserve and the IRS , watch it now at Google Video : http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5355...
This is also the part where Ron Paul comes in ( www.RonPaul2008.com ) , since Ron Paul is the only Presidential candidate who understands the financial destruction being caused by the Federal Reserve and has pledged to end the Fed 's control over the U.S. money supply .
( The Fed , by the way , is a privately - owned corporation that is n't even controlled by U.S. lawmakers . )
But given that most Americans are still likely to vote for status quo candidates and not for the radical changes required to bring economic sanity to our nation , it seems inevitable that While all that 's happening , of course , the Federal Reserve is going to be trying ( in vain ) to print its way out of the debt implosion by creating hundreds of billions of dollars out of thin air -- an act that quietly steals money from the people due to the loss of purchasing power ( inflation ) .
The amount of money needed to bail the U.S. out of its impending financial crisis will be so large that the real value of saved money in U.S. currency ( i.e. dollars ) could be reduced anywhere from 30 % to 80 % .
Imagine :
One day you have $ 25,000 in the bank that buys a car , and the next year , that same $ 25,000 only buys half a car .
Nobody stole dollars from your account , but This is what 's coming next .
The mathematically - impaired American masses , largely unable to follow basic economics , are destined to watch all this unfold with bewilderment , not knowing why their dollars are becoming worthless , but being rightly outraged by the turn of events at the same time .
The MSM ( Mainstream Media ) will be no help , of course , since it 's in on the scam .
It will likely find some foreign scapegoat like blaming China 's currency or Middle East oil prices for the disastrous effects of stupid domestic economic policies that have been pursued by Democrats and Republicans alike .
( Of course , nobody has put the U.S. more deeply into debt than George W. , largely thanks to spending on war . )
There 's little question that hard economic times are coming , and not one in a hundred people has any real clue what to do about it .
Not even many mainstream investment professionals , by the way -- they 're the same idiots who probably told you to buy into the housing bubble in the first place , am I right ?
( Remember , through 2006 and 2007 when I was urging everybody to get OUT of the housing market , many investment " professionals " were urging people to keep on buying and leveraging their money in yet more housing !
We 'll all get rich !
[ Insert Howard Dean scream here ...]
Yaaaargh ! )
So what can YOU -- the intelligent reader -- do with all this information ?
You 're the exception to the idiocy of the masses , as is evident by the very fact that you get at least part of your news and information from non-mainstream sources .
So how can you protect yourself from these hard economic times ?
Here are some sensible solutions :
First off , let me share with you one of the best books on what 's coming in terms of the U.S. economy .
( It 's also loaded with financial investment recommendations in the last chapter . )
The book is called The Coming Economic Collapse : How You Can Thrive When Oil Costs $ 200 A Barrel by Stephen Leeb .
Leeb is right on the money when it comes to understanding economics trends ( and telling the truth about what 's coming ) .
He was one of the first to predict oil would reach $ 100 a barrel ( which it did just a few weeks ago ) , despite the raucous laughter from the investment community following his prediction .
( He predicted that price when oil was hovering around $ 25 a barrel , by the way ... )
His book gives outstanding investment recommendations for those who have savings or retirement funds they wish to protect from the coming economic fallout .
Rather than repeating that investment advice right here , I would prefer that you get his book , read it and the follow his recommendations that best suit your risk vs. reward goals .
Secondly , let me say thatfor everybody involved : Households , cities , states and even the U.S. federal government .
Although there may be a few remaining grunts and gasps of debt spending that manage to squeeze through the cracks , the bottom line is that this debt bubble party is essentially over .
This means we 're going to see a contraction in spending at all levels , and a significant lull in the national economy .
You see , until now , we 've actually been partying on China 's money .
It 's true !
China has been lending the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars , and the U.S. has been using that money to finance wars and lousy health care spending policies that keep the American people perpetually diseased .
This nation has actually been partying like a rich banker 's daughter on her 21st birthday who borrowed daddy 's credit card and hit the town for a night of ( finally ) legalized drinking .
It 's largely been someone else 's money that has financed our drunken - sailor spending spree , and that line of credit will soon be significantly slowed ( or made a whole lot more expensive to finance ) .
Why ?
Because .
With the U.S. in debt far more than ever before -- and hemorrhaging wealth by the second through spending on war and disease ( health care ) -- it wo n't be long before the serious lenders of the world ( China , Japan , Abu Dhabi , etc. ) figure out that .
They 'll hike up the rates for future loans to the U.S. , and that will cause the U.S. federal government 's debt spending addiction to suddenly become a more expensive habit than a D.C. Mayor 's crack addiction .
Overnight , the U.S. could become a sub - prime borrower .
Its banks have already landed in that category , thanks to the huge cash injections from wealthy foreigners we 've seen taken on by U.S. banks in the last few weeks !
And all this , of course , meansGetting back to how you can protect yourself in these hard economic times , this is a time to .
Here 's what I 've consistently recommended to intelligent people over the years : 1) Own your car .
Do n't borrow money to drive a car .
It 's better to own a beater than to make payments on something you can't really afford .
2 ) Own your home .
Instead of moving to a larger home when you qualify for loans , work to pay off your existing home mortgage and own your home outright .
At the very least , pay down your loan so you have 50 % equity in your home , which should insulate you from all but the very worst housing bubble price drops .
3 ) Stop spending money on stupid overpriced things like Starbucks coffee , soda , brand - name laundry detergent , diamond jewelry and processed foods .
Stretch your money by buying low - cost , bulk food ingredients like lentils , brown rice and quinoa 4 ) Protect your health !
Mark my words :
There will be no such thing as a national health care system that 's any good ; not under ANY future president .
Why ?
Because our entire health care paradigm is focused on treating disease rather than promoting health .
If you 're waiting around for a health care system to make you healthy , you 're on a fool 's errand .
Take charge of your health right now and use nutrition , superfoods , sunlight , exercise and avoidance of all toxic chemicals to boost your health ( and thereby insulate yourself from future health care minefields ) .
5 ) Own some productive land .
Can you actually grow at least 10 % of your own food ?
How about 25 % ?
Owning productive land that actually generates fruits , nuts or edible herbs and plants is a form of .
Regardless of what happens to the world economy , land that can produce food and medicine willhold value ( to yourself and others ) .
Climate matters .
An acre of land in wind - swept South Dakota is n't worth much .
That same acre in Southern California or Hawaii is a whole lot more useful in terms of producing things that people value .
6 )
Own a good bicycle ( and know how to repair it ) .
There 's no form of transportation that 's more affordable .
Too out of shape to pedal ?
No worries :
Get yourself anfrom Electric Bikes Northwest ( they ship all over the country ) .
Electric bikes cost almost nothing to operate ( far less than a penny per mile ) and still give you a bit of exercise .
7 ) Do n't save all your money in one bank !
And certainly do n't save it all in U.S. currency .
Diversify .
Banks may fail .
The currency may even fail .
Be prepared to wake up one day and see your green U.S. dollars declared worthless .
Disclaimer : I 'm not offering you financial advice .
Do your own research on this and make informed financial decisions using the help of financial professionals .
My information here is offered as - is , with honest intent but no promise of accuracy .
You 'll have to decide for yourself what 's really ahead in terms of a bankrupt nation and a depressed economy .
It 's not all bad news , by the way ... The good news in all this is that the U.S. government simply wo n't be able to afford its campaign of imperialism and war mongering against the nations of the world .
Troops will eventually have to come home for one good reason :
The government will no longer be able to afford to pay them !
( What ?
No Pay ?
Watch all those soldiers turn around and head directly home when the money stops .
The proper term for such employees is " mercenaries , " by the way ... ) Much the same will happen to Big Pharma and the massive medical scam right now masquerading as health care in the United States .
When the U.S. government can no longer acquire easy debt money , the monopoly - priced spending on pharmaceuticals through Medicare and Medicaid will have to be halted or significantly reformed .
Somewhere along the line , somebody might get the idea that we could halt health care spending by 90 % in a single decade by simply investing in disease prevention and health education rather than pushing pills and disease .
So the good news is that a bankrupt nation will eventually be forced to just say no to Big Pharma 's monopoly - priced drugs .
So far , not bad , huh ?
Ending stupid wars and dangerous health care practices is definitely a step in the right direction , and it's all coming our way soon thanks to the inevitably bankruptcy of the U.S. government and the downfall of the U.S. economy .
There 's nothing like a sobering economic wake - up call to force nations to either reform their ways or face extinction .
From there , lots of possibilities exist .
The centralized U.S. government might become so weak that regions of the country would declare their independence and begin self - rule .
( Happens all the time : See the history of the Balkans , the former Soviet Union , post - Spanish rule in South America , etc. ) .
Each region might then invent its own currency to replace the disastrous dollar .
Tip :
Only those currencies backed by gold reserves will ever work in the long term .
Paper money simply does n't hold value ( as we 're all seeing quite clearly right now ... ) I see 2008 - 2012 as being very tumultuous years for the United States of America .
This nation is technically bankrupt right now .
And do you know where the spending is going ?
Check this out :
The top three things that the U.S. government spends money on are : ( figures from 2006 ) 1 ) WAR : Department of Defense + Veterans ' benefits ( $ 580.5 billion ) 2 ) DISEASE : Medicare + Medicaid ( $ 614.1 billion ) 3 ) DEBT : Debt to the people ( Social Security + Welfare ) and to debt holders ( interest on national debt ) ( $ 1,115.4 billion ) What 's fascinating about all this is that ( Total 2006 federal budget was $ 2.7 trillion . )
Yes : 85 % of the federal budget goes to pay for war , disease and debt .
Need I say more ?
That fact right there should tell you all you need to know about the future of this nation :
The U.S. is about to become history .
In the history of the world , no nation that spends 85 % of its budget on war , disease and debt has ever survived for more than a few years .
( Rome spent far less on war and still could n't keep its republic together ... )
For all those readers who agree with me on my anti-war stance , do n't worry :
We 'll all get our wish soon !
The U.S. is so bankrupt that waging war will soon no longer be an option .
President Bush has done what the terrorists could have only dreamed of doing : destroying the future of an entire nation and watching it implode under the weight of its own debt .
( If you thought the collapse if the Twin Towers was something , just wait until you see the fall of Wall Street ... ) I tend to be a little early in taking precautions against financial disasters .
I warned the public about the dot - com crash several years before 2001 , and my warning about the housing crash was , as you can see , two years early as well .
I 've learned several things about making public predictions based on economic reality : 1. Nobody wants to believe your prediction when the bubble is hot and people are operating under the illusion that " We 're all getting rich ! "
In offering sobering predictions of economic fallout stemming from the blatantly obvious financial disasters being pursued in this country , I 've been called a doomsayer , a pessimist and someone who fails to understand the " new economics " ( a fictitious branch of economics that 's used to hype every new market boom to a gullible public ) .
2 . The public is n't interested in financial reality .
The public wants to believe whatever fictions support their current investments .
If they 're invested in houses , they will dismiss any news ( no matter how factual ) that goes against the decision they 've made to hold those investments .
It 's a common type of investing myopia :
Once an investor places his ( or her ) faith in a stock , an option or a house , they will selectively filter out all information that runs counter to their currently - held position .
( It 's sort of like the way doctors see the world of conventional medicine vs. natural medicine ... ) 3 . Few Americans can even imagine the collapse of America .
( Most Romans could n't imagine the fall of Rome , either . )
They think America is so strong and dominant on the world stage that it can weather any storm .
Do you know why these people hold such myopic views ?
Because they watch the U.S. media , of course !
There is no nation with a mainstream media capable of reporting the truth about that nation 's own political or economic policies .
In truth , America is just one experiment in a history of failed debtor nations spanning millennia .
The number of empires in world history that have risen and fallen due to uncontrolled spending or war mongering is truly staggering ( something like 100 + ) .
Like any other nation , the U.S. is not immune to the effects of stupid management ( although it has achieved numerous historical milestones such as being the nation with the largest national debt in the history of the world ... ) 4 .
Being ahead of the masses in your observations of economic trends is no way to win a popularity contest .
If you 're 30 days ahead of the masses , you 're considered a genius ; but if you 're two years ahead , you 're considered insane .
It makes me wonder about the experiences of historical geniuses like Nikola Tesla , since they were at least a hundred years ahead in their understanding of science .
5 .
The mainstream never agrees with you until it's all over , and then they blame you for causing it by " scaring everybody . "
Hilarious .
This financial situation wo n't head straight down .
The Plunge Protection Team in Washington ( and at the Fed ) will do their best to keep propping up this economy like a Weekend At Bernie's .
So you 'll see short - term recoveries and stock prices jumping up and down probably all year .
The markets may even reach new highs as the Fed hyperinflates the currency by injecting easy money into the system .
As usual , it 's all a scam .
The unavoidable trend is the ultimate downfall of the debt - ridden U.S. economy and a massive recalibration of this nation 's economic behavior , which may or may not include the dissolution of the nation itself .
American may somehow survive this unprecedented debt crisis .
Then again , it may not .

Andy Gregg may not have reinvented the wheel , but he has reinterpreted it .
Gregg , 40 , owns Bike Furniture Designs , which transforms recycled bicycle parts into sleek , eco-friendly furniture .
Combining skills developed in art school -- he is fascinated by early - 20th - century furniture design -- with mechanical chops he began polishing at age 10 , Gregg sells his pieces on bikefurniture.com and through a smattering of retailers .
Creations such as the Milano lounge chair ( pictured ) , $ 400 , blend steel hardware and rubber upholstery -- made from inner tubes -- with swooping , organic curves .
Gregg has been making the furniture since 1991 , but it was n't until 2004 that revenue picked up enough to allow him to quit his carpentry job and focus on his business , based in Marquette , Mich .
( Last year , he says , revenue hit the " low five figures . " )
While the growing demand has spurred him to explore new designs and materials , he maintains that his favorite piece is his first and simplest barstool .
" It 's so pure , " he says .
" Just made from a wheel . "

WASHINGTON , Oct. 17 — President Bush warned today that Iran would be raising the risk of a “ World War III ” if it came to possess nuclear weapons .
And he said he believed that Russia still wanted to stop Iran from developing such weapons .
Those comments , made during a far - ranging 45 - minute news conference , came as reporters sought the president ’s reaction to a warning on Tuesday by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia against any military strikes on Iran to halt the nuclear work that it has continued in defiance of much of the world .
Iran contends that its nuclear program is purely peaceful .
“ If Iran had a nuclear weapon , it ’d be a dangerous threat to world peace , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ So I told people that if you ’re interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . ”
“ I take the threat of Iran with a nuclear weapon very seriously , ” he said .
The United States has said it is pursuing a diplomatic approach to Iran , including the threat of a new round of United Nations sanctions , but it has refused to rule out military action to halt Iran ’s nuclear program .
Everyone has had it happen to them : a " friend " sends you a link in IM or over IRC that purports to be something like a cat in an awkward position with a hilarious caption .
Soon , however , you discover that the link was n't to a lolcat at all ; instead , you 've been Rick Rolled — or even worse , sent to 2 girls1 cup ( find it on your own , but be warned : it may scar you for life ) .
These pranks are commonplace now , but be careful of what you click on and from whom .
If that link points to anything even pretending to be child porn , that 's enough evidence for the FBI of intent to download it .
The authorities could then raid your home and possibly throw you in jail .
No joke , it just takes one click and you 're under intense suspicion .
Such is the case with Temple University doctoral student Roderick Vosburgh , who apparently clicked on an FBI - planted hyperlink somewhere on the Internet .
The link pointed to a file on an FBI server that contained no porn , but logged the IP addresses of everyone attempting to access it .
Vosburgh 's IP was one of those , and the FBI came knockin ' on his door early one morning , arrested him , and searched his home .
In fact , this did n't just happen to Vosburgh — the FBI has been using this click - and - be - owned tactic for a few years now , using logged IP addresses as a way to get warrants and charge people with intent to download child porn ( a federal crime ) .
The FBI has been planting links to these bogus files on message boards that are known to attract child predators , but even the log files do n't take into account the referrer — any IP address that shows up is automatically assumed to be guilty , and assumed to be coming in from one of the FBI 's planted links .
This means that if your drunk friends think it 's funny to IM you a link to something that turns out to be to the FBI 's planted link , you could be in trouble .
Do n't believe that 's all it takes ?
The FBI admitted that there was apparently no evidence that Vosburgh had ever accessed the forum where the links were originally planted , according to court documents seen by Ars Technica .
Vosburgh 's attorney also pointed out that the affidavit that was used to charge Vosburgh provided no probable cause to believe that any criminal activity had taken place , that he was home at the time that the file was allegedly accessed , or even that there was a computer with an Internet connection in Vosburgh 's apartment .
Vosburgh eventually went to trial and was convicted of clicking on an illegal link and possession of child porn due to two tiny thumbnails that the FBI believes depict underage females — this is despite the testimony from multiple computer experts saying that the cache was created automatically and Vosburgh had no idea how or where to find these thumbnails on his machine .
He now faces sentencing on April 22 while his attorney attempts to have the verdict overturned .
Vosburgh was caught trying to destroy a hard drive and a flash drive , however , and this surely did n't help his case .
Brilliant honey pot scheme or horribly flawed perversion of justice ?
The lack of other evidence pointing to this man 's guilt places the onus of this man 's conviction on the FBI 's phishing practices , which from our point of view leave much to be desired .

Overthink FizzBuzz .
I gave the best programming interview answer I may have ever given last Friday .
The interviewer hauled out FizzBuzz and asked me to solve it .
It took me a minute to stop laughing .
FizzBuzz is a brain - dead simple programming problem , used pretty much to tell if a developer has a pulse at all .
It is simply this : print the numbers from 1 to 100 , but print " Fizz " instead of the number if it is divisible by 3 , " Buzz " if it is divisible by 5 , and " FizzBuzz " if it is divisible by both .
It can be a good question to spend 5 - 10 minutes on at the start of a technical interview , because apparently a large number of interview candidates who claim to be expert programmers turn out to be unable to solve even this simple problem .
For the rest of us , Reg Braithewaite reminds you that it is an interview question , and has some good advice for you : Do n't Overthink FizzBuzz .
In my case however ...
I thought about it for a moment , then decided to break this rule .
See , I was n't given this problem at the beginning of an interview .
I was given this question at the end of two days of interviewing .
My interviewer , the CTO , had already satisfied himself that I was capable of doing the job .
Now he was just interested in the experience of exploring a solution with me .
I started by trying to write a single expression to transform the output as a function of the number , got tangled up in my logic , said " Okay , I 'm trying to be too clever .
Let me do this the stupid way first . "
And I wrote a stupid solution .
( if ( i%3 ) .zero ? puts " Fizz " etc. )
Elapsed time ?
Maybe 90 seconds .
I started talking about ways to clean it up and optimize the code , but then I stopped : " You know , the code I wrote is kind of ugly but it is immediately apparent to the reader what I am trying to do .
Anybody could read this and debug it .
Unless there 's a reason to keep going , such as a known performance bottleneck , I say we 're done . "
The CTO nodded and then confided in me :
He had been talking about FizzBuzz with a friend of his , and they had been exchanging solutions .
He had come up with four distinct solutions to the problem .
I put on my best interviewer face and said , " Show me . "
And we spent another 20 minutes exploring his solutions , and discussing their merits .
That 's when the light went on .
FizzBuzz is a well - studied problem , right ?
" Hang on a minute , let me drive for a second . "
I grabbed the keyboard and created a new file , and then wrote :
require ' fizzbuzz ' puts fizzbuzz The CTO chuckled .
" That would only work if you already had --"
But I was already typing again :
# if this require fails , you need to gem install fizzbuzz require ' fizzbuzz ' puts fizzbuzz THIS caused the CTO to laugh out loud .
I got the job .
I start tomorrow with a great team doing mostly Ruby and a bit of Rails !
But it does n't end there .
I am , if anything , unable to tell when to stop telling a joke .
I registered the fizzbuzz project with RubyForge .
You can indeed now install the fizzbuzz gem and run it .
You 're welcome .
Contributions are invited .
Homepage : http://fizzbuzz.rubyforge.org
Project : http://rubyforge.org/projects/fizzbuzz/
And , of course , you can install the gem directly . :-)
Oh , and in it I included my own solution to FizzBuzz , one that I think is geniunely original .
It took me 2 hours to come up with this idea¹ :
( 1..100 ) .map { |i| srand ( 1781773465 ) if ( i%15 ) ==1 ; [ i , " Fizz " , " Buzz " , " FizzBuzz " ] [ rand ( 4 ) ] }
For the non-programmers , that makes a list of the four things you could display for each number , then picks one of them at random .
If you seed the random number generator appropriately , it will make the correct choice 15 times in a row , which is when the cycle of FizzBuzz repeats itself .
¹ and about 12 hours of processor time to find the magic number 1781773465 ² ³ .
² if you 're willing to reorder the array as [ " FizzBuzz " , " Buzz " , i , " Fizz " ] , you can seed the RNG with 46308667 .
I find this fascinating because 15 digits of fizzbuzz requires 30 bits of information , but 46308667 only requires 26 bits of storage .
It 's actually using rand 's vast store of deterministic sequences to hide information .
³ this works with Ruby 1.8's RNG .
I have tested this on Mac and Linux , but not on Win32 Ruby .
YMMV .

The Lloyd's of London insurance market has insured the nose of a leading wine maker and taster for 5 million euros ( $ 8.5 million ) , covering the Bordeaux producer against the loss of his nose and sense of smell .
Lloyd 's is famous for creating policies for giant corporations , but also for insuring celebrity limbs , from Fred Astaire 's legs to the hands of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards .
It said on Tuesday that Ilja Gort , the Dutch owner of Chateau de la Garde in Bordeaux , producer of Tulipe Wines , said his nose could distinguish millions of different scents and was essential to guarantee the quality of his wines .
" The nose and sense of smell of a winemaker are as important as the fingers of a chef , " Jonathan Thomas , lead underwriter at Watkins Syndicate who co-insured the policy .
Lloyds worked with Allianz Nederland and British reinsurance broker Benfield to create the policy , co-insured by Watkins .

They ’ve talked about it , they ’ve made prototypes and now finally here it is : a human - powered car ( The HumanCar ) that can reach speeds of up to 80 miles per hour .
Beyond just sounding like one , this invention bears an uncanny resemblance to the walkable vehicle from the Flintstones .
Love it , hate it , mock it or berate it this strange new vehicle is available for $ 15,000 as of Earth Day 2008 !
The human car is n’t just about energy efficiency or the environment , it is about group activity – making driving an actively participatory experience .
It is also about alternative uses for a vast global infrastructure designed and used almost exclusively by gas - guzzling vehicles .
The idea for the car has been around for almost five decades now but prototype models only began being built and seriously tested a few years back .
As compared to the bicycle , the HumanCar provides greater speeds and an impact - resistant exoskeleton provides material safety and shelter from the weather .
Also , power - assist from batteries can boost the car ’s performance in a pinch and help it keep up with regular vehicles on the streets and the built - in trunk , stereo and wi-fi blend in options people have come to expect from cars .
The above video dates back to early models of the car .
Try to ignore the music and simply enjoy the ride .
The makes say those who try it out keep coming back for more !
( CNN ) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on Thursday laid out their proposals to reinvigorate the economy as they attacked Sen. John McCain 's plan as ineffective .
Sen . Hillary Clinton proposed a job training program in her address Thursday .
Clinton said McCain 's plan " does virtually nothing to ease the credit crisis or the housing crisis .
" He 'd rather ignore the credit crisis and the mortgage crisis -- or blame middle - class families instead of offering solutions on their behalf , " Clinton said during campaigning in Raleigh , North Carolina .
Speaking from New York , Obama said Thursday the United States must address " the immediate crisis in the housing market " in order to recharge the economy .
" John McCain recently announced his own plan , and it amounts to little more than watching this crisis happen .
While this is consistent with Sen.
McCain 's determination to run for George Bush 's third term , it wo n't help families who are suffering , and it wo n't help lift our economy out of recession , " Obama said .
McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , outlined his plan to address the housing situation earlier this week .
His campaign released a statement Thursday calling the housing crisis a " complex problem that deserves a careful , balanced approach that helps the homeowners in trouble , not big banks and speculators that acted irresponsibly . "
" I believe the role of government is to help the truly needy , prevent systemic economic risk , and enact reforms that prevent the kind of crisis we are currently experiencing from ever happening again .
Those reforms should focus on improving transparency and accountability in our capital markets -- both of which were lacking in the lead - up to the current situation .
" However , what is not necessary is a multibillion dollar bailout for big banks and speculators , as Sens. Clinton and Obama have proposed .
There is a tendency for liberals to seek big government programs that sock it to American taxpayers while failing to solve the very real problems we face , " the statement said .
Obama said the government should play a role in improving Americans ' well - being " by providing stable macroeconomic and financial conditions for sustained growth ; by demanding transparency ; and by ensuring fair competition in the marketplace . "
Watch Obama explain his plan for the economy »
He called for immediate relief for those affected by the housing crisis , revamping the regulatory framework and boosting the economy with an additional $ 30 billion stimulus package .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- whom many had speculated was considering an independent run for the White House -- introduced Obama , but reiterated that he had not endorsed a candidate for president .
Obama also recognized Paul Volcker , former chairman of the Federal Reserve , and former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman William Donaldson .
Obama said the details of regulatory overhaul " should be developed through sound analysis and public debate , " and detailed six guiding principles .
Institutions that borrow from the government must be subject to federal oversight and supervision .
Regulations for those institutions need to be updated
The framework for overlapping and competing regulatory agencies needs to be streamlined
Institutions need to be regulated " for what they do , not what they are "
A crackdown on trading activity that manipulates the markets is necessary
A process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system is needed
Clinton 's campaign accused Obama of copying her plan , calling for an additional stimulus package one week after Clinton did .
" If Sen . Obama has to copy policy ideas when he's a candidate on the campaign trail , how is he going to solve people 's problems if he 's president ?
When it comes to fixing the economy , we need leadership , not followership , " Clinton policy director Neera Tanden said .
Obama 's senior economic adviser Daniel Tarullo said he thinks Obama has laid out a plan for financial regulation that is more comprehensive than any other candidate .
In Clinton 's address Thursday , she said the Bush economy is like a " trap door . "
" Too many people are one pink slip away , one missed mortgage payment away , one medical diagnosis away from falling through and losing everything , " she said .
Clinton proposed a five - year , $ 12.5 billion job training program .
" We may be competing in a new global economy , but our policies to equip American workers for the 21st century are stuck back in the 20th century , " she said .
" While we have been rightly focused on trying to help people who are out of work , there 's been too little thought and effort to help people gain new skills while they still have their existing jobs . "
Clinton highlighted state and local initiatives that work and stressed her belief that the federal government needs to be a stronger partner with local governments .
In McCain 's address on Tuesday , he blamed " rampant " speculation and " complacent " lenders for the mortgage crisis .
Watch McCain share his thoughts on the housing crisis »
Speaking in Santa Ana , California , he said : " Lenders ended up violating the basic rule of banking : Do n't lend people money who can't pay it back . "
Vowing not to " play election - year politics , " McCain called for more transparency in lending , and higher capital reserves for lenders .
Clinton said reluctance to bail out banks and borrowers in trouble sounded like Herbert Hoover , the Republican president in office at the start of the Great Depression .
Earlier this week , a Republican committee spokesman blasted the economic plans of both Democrats .
" Both Barack Obama and Sen .
Clinton 's plans to increase taxes would hurt hardworking families and take money out of their pockets to place it in the hands of government bureaucrats , " Danny Diaz said .
The economic slowdown caused by the credit crunch has become a top concern for voters .
Consumer confidence in March dropped to its lowest level in five years , according to The Conference Board .

Is MediaSentry violating a cease - and - desist order prohibiting it from conducting private investigations in the state of Massachusetts ?
That 's what it looks like at first glance .
On January 2 , 2008 , the Massachusetts State Police Certification Unit sent a letter to MediaSentry 's corporate parent SafeNet informing the company that an investigation revealed that it is " advertising and operating a Private Detective company " and that review of state records indicates that the company is " not licensed to conduct investigations " in the state .
Ray Beckerman over at Recording Industry vs. The People has unearthed an exhibit ( PDF ) in LaFace v. Does 1 - 17 that shows that MediaSentry has continued to catch Massachusetts residents in its investigatory driftnet .
The exhibit , which is a standard part of all of the file - sharing lawsuits filed by the RIAA , lists the IP addresses , dates , and times that the 17 Does were observed on a P2P network by MediaSentry employees .
Does 15 through 17 , who were on the GnutellaUS network , were spotted by MediaSentry on January 22 , January 31 , and February 4 , 2008 , respectively .
In the case of Doe 17 , that 's over a month after the cease - and - desist letter was sent .
Earlier this week , we noted an RIAA filing in another case in which it argued that MediaSentry should n't be subject to state laws in part because MediaSentry " can have no way of knowing ... the location from where [ the files ] are being distributed . "
That 's true ... to a certain extent .
But , as we have noted , there are ways to narrow it down .
Case in point for Does 15 - 17 , all of which had IP addresses from the 168.122 block :
192 :~ eric$ nslookup 168.122.177.xx
Server : 66.174.95.44
Address : 66.174.95.44#53
Non -authoritative answer :
43.177.122.168.in-addr.arpa name = buic010 - w1401 - dhcp043.bu.edu .
Authoritative answers can be found from :
122.168.in-addr.arpa nameserver = edns01.bu.edu .
122.168.in-addr.arpa nameserver = edns02.bu.edu .
122.168.in-addr.arpa nameserver = edns03.bu.edu .
That 's the output from running the nslookup command in the Mac OS X Terminal app .
As you can see by the results , that address block is assigned to Boston University , and you do n't need a degree in geography to know in which state that institute of higher learning is located .
Despite the presence of the cease - and - desist order , MediaSentry went ahead with its usual downloading .
Aside from demonstrating that BU students listen to Third Eye Blind , Nelly Furtado , U2 , Kanye West , and Avril Lavigne , what else does this prove ?
It may demonstrate that MediaSentry and the RIAA either do n't believe that the cease - and - desist order carries any weight , or that the RIAA 's counsel has made a determination that the order is n't legally binding on them for some reason .
The labels have also argued that even if the evidence was obtained illegally , it should still be admissible .
We asked the RIAA for clarification on the story , including whether MediaSentry is abiding by the order ( SafeNet consistently refers us to the RIAA for comment on matters pertaining to P2P litigation ) .
" We believe that the evidence obtained in this case — and in all our cases — is entirely legitimate and provides a strong and persuasive basis for our subpoena request , " RIAA spokesperson Jonathan Lamy told Ars , referring us back to SafeNet for comment on the cease - and - desist order .
LaFace v. Does 1 - 17 was very recently consolidated into another long - running case , with some of the defendants apparently dismissed .
Update :
This is a fake !
We were fooled because April 1 where they are ( in China ) was still March 31 .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices rebounded sharply on Tuesday to near $ 110 a barrel after the U.S. Federal Reserve deepened interest rate cuts to fend off a recession .

Oil jumped to a record above $ 111 a barrel on Monday , as a surprise weekend cut in the Federal Reserve discount rate and the fire sale of stricken investment bank Bear Stearns sent the dollar to all - time lows .

The surge reversed heavy losses Monday that had been triggered by financial woes at investment banks , including Bear Stearns , which analysts said reflected weakness in the overall economy of the world ’s largest energy consumer .
U.S. crude rose $ 3.82 to $ 109.50 a barrel by 2:30 p.m. EDT , after sliding more than 4 percent on Monday in the biggest one - day percentage drop in more than seven months .
London Brent gained $ 3.74 to $ 105.49 .
The Federal Reserve slashed a key U.S. interest rate by three - quarters of a percentage point on Tuesday , a substantial cut but smaller than many in financial markets had expected .
“ After the initial disappointment , I think it leaves the door open for more cuts down the road , ” said Mike Fitzpatrick , vice president of MF Global .
The Fed ’s action took the bellwether federal funds rate down to 2.25 percent , the lowest since February 2005 .
Aggressive interest rate cuts have contributed to a steep decline in the value of the U.S. dollar -- a factor that has supported gains across all commodities denominated in the currency in recent months .
Encouraging oil 's gains on Tuesday , Wall Street firms Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N reported better - than - expected earnings .
U.S. crude had hit a record high of $ 111.80 a barrel on Monday before selling off alongside other world financial bourses after JPMorgan Chase &
Co stepped in to rescue investment bank Bear Stearns for a bargain buy of $ 2 a share .
Oil could come under further pressure , analysts said , due in part to rising inventory levels and the risk that an economic downturn could damage underlying demand .
Gasoline stockpiles in the United States are at a 15 - year high and attention on Wednesday will focus on the latest snapshot of supplies from the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
Stocks of gasoline probably rose another 400,000 barrels last week while crude inventories probably gained 2.3 million barrels , a Reuters poll showed .
Tautology of the day
I just recently bought a new CD case .
Here it is :
The manufacturers helpfully describe its key feature on the packaging :
I just had to buy it , when I saw what it could do !
I 've noticed this same packaging label myself .
I wondered if anyone else in the blogosphere had also .
A quick Google indicates that this company 's camera case product packaging also says " holds all digital cameras small enough to fit " .

So I 'm thinking about getting my penis tattooed , though I 'm not entirely sure what I would like , or even if I 'm 100 % that I want to do it .
I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas of what might looks good .
So I guess I would probably be asking girls the most .
I had thought about a cruise ship with some funny or cool name ...
I was also thinking snake , dragon , ect .... but the snake and dragon are kinda common ....
I like wolves a lot , and I 'm a scorpio .
I dunno if that inspires any ideas .....
Oh another thought ... how about a key .... thoguht that might look kinda stupid ....
I dunno , anyone have any ideas ?
By the way , if your just going to give me stupid answers and not any actual ideas , then do n't bother , I 'm only going to give you a negative rating , so do n't waste your time .
『 Implementation Patterns』 はKent Beck待望の新刊。目次を見ると『ケント・ベックのSmalltalkベストプラクティス・パターン』(「 SBPP」と略すとツウっぽい) のJava版ような感じだが、実際にそうだった。 ひとことで言えば「21世紀のSBPP」。しかも『Extreme Programming Explaind 2nd Edtion』級の読みやすさ。21世紀のSBPPなので、当然だが薄い(実質150ページぐらい) 。Kent Beckの指示によれば 「 とりあえず5章( p.21)から最後まで斜め読みしたあとはコードを書いて、それから頭から読み返せ」とあったので、いま斜め読みを終えたところ。
後半に向かってだんだん粘っこくなってくるのがイイ。第8章のMethodと第9章のCollectionが(ここでも)目玉。最後の仕上げはMoneyではなくてフレームワークの拡張に本書の思考を当てはめるというもの。そして付録としてパフォーマンスをCollectionで実装を差し替えることを例に説明。参考文献は、いつも通りな感じ(ちなみに純粋なJavaの書籍は3冊だけ ) 。
KentBの言葉によれば、本書は :
コーディングスタイルの書籍ではない
設計の書籍ではな い
いわゆる 「 パターン」の書籍ではない
言 語( Java ) の書籍ではない
とのこと。本書は :
「 良いコードは重要だ」ということを語る書籍だ
そして、責 任( responsibility ) についての書籍 だ
だという。与えられた時間、能力、金額、機会。これら(" gifts " )
を使って、自分と自分以外の開発者、そして相棒たるCPUにとって良いコードを書くのはプログラマの責任なんだ。
偉大な書籍は偉大な一行からはじまるわけで、ここでも偉大な書籍の一行目を引いておきたい。
This is a book about programming — — specifically , about programming so other people can understand your code .
( 本書はプログラミングの書籍だ——具体的には、他人があなたのコードを理解できるようにプログラミングするための書籍だ。)
「 SBPP 」 がそうであったように、本書もJavaプログラマのためだけの書籍ではない。Rubyistも読むといいと思った。で、私の次なるステップは、本書の内容についてよく考えるためにコードを書かねばならぬわけだがーーおっと、こんな時間に誰かが来たみたいだ。

Finding High - Quality Income in a Zero- Rate Environment
After ten amazing years , Friends concludes one of the most successful sitcom runs of all time as the number - one comedy for the sixth season in a row , as the series finale marks the most - watched entertainment broadcast in nearly six years with an estimate of 65.9 million total viewers watching at least part of the episode and an overall average of 52.5 million viewers .
Now I know that there are only ten seasons to list from , but bear with me .
The following is a list counting down the not - so - good to the best .
Along with each season comes a small bloopers edit for your viewing pleasure .
10 Season Nine
When it began , Season Nine was going to be the final season of Friends but it soon became apparent that NBC did n’t want to bid a fond farewell to Friends just yet .
Season nine followed Rachel through her early days of motherhood , while sorting out her personal life right from the opening episode .
One of season nine ’s most winning episodes was “ The One With the Male Nanny ” which featured a hilariously sensitive turn by Freddie Prinze , Jr. Paul Rudd turned up as a last minute blind date for Phoebe and soon became a fixture .
Overall a good season , but logistically it failed when it came to the raw punchlines that Friends was so accustomed to nailing .
9 Season Six
This was the season where Friends went through maturation .
Not just for the characters , but the show itself .
Monica and Chandler grow more and more into a serious relationship .
Many guest stars made their way onto the Friends set , including Reese Witherspoon , Ralph Lauren , and Bruce Willis .
Still the emotional high point was the inspired season finale “ The One with the Proposal - Parts One and Two ” .
8 Season Three
In this season Ross and Rachel broke up in “ The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break , ” while the show kept things together rather well .
Friends was now an established hit - and the best episodes of the third season , including “ The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy , ” “ The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break , ” “ The One With The Flashback , ” and “ The One at the Beach , ” - show why .
This season explored emotional issues and can fairly easily be summed up into five words : we were on a break .
7 Season Seven
Everybody loves a wedding , right ?
First and foremost , Season Seven was a long drive to the altar for Monica and Chandler .
The season opener found the gang reacting to news of the impending nuptials , with Phoebe pitching to provide the wedding music and Rachel acting out .
Throughout the season , wedding bells rang , thanks in large part to the planning of control freak Monica .
Assorted wedding issues were hashed out in episodes like “ The One With Rachel ’s Book , ” and “ The One With The Engagement Pictures . ”
But hey , who can blame Monica ?
Who does n’t like to plan their own TV wedding ?
6 Season Ten
In the fall of 2003 , the time had come for Friends to face its not so long goodbye .
And inevitably , the need for some sort of comedic closure shaped an abbreviated season that consisted of only 18 new episodes .
As Season
Ten unfolded , our gang of six was n’t exactly breaking up , but rather moving on with their lives in various ways .
Monica and Chandler continued on their long and emotional path to parenthood and , yes , a home in the suburbs .
Ross and Rachel were busy bringing up Emma and at times reconsidering their long and famously complicated relationship .
Phoebe actually got married to her shockingly stable significant other , Mike , and settled down .
And finally , of course , Joey was busy , well , being Joey .
5 Season One
In the beginning there was a runaway bride .
By the end of the first season , Friends was a runaway smash .
In between , the show enjoyed what can only be described as a dream season , both on - screen and off .
While bringing to life some of the most classic Friends episodes ever .
4 Season Two
It was the best of seasons , it was the worst of seasons .
The second coming of Friends saw numerous strong episodes , but also the show ’s first reckoning with what shall now be known as The Backlash .
Season
Two featured the further adventures of Ross and Rachel , the tragic death of Mr Heckles , the shocking revelation of Chandler ’s third nipple , the comeback of Tom Selleck as Monica ’s older new squeeze , the rise and fall of Joey ’s soap opera stud Dr. Drake Ramoray , the lesbian wedding , Phoebe singing “ Smelly Cat ” , as well as the greatest prom video in the history of Western civilization .
3 Season Five
Unfortunately I could n’t find a season five gag reel .
Early in Season Five , Friends arrived in television ’s biggest winning circle with its 100th episode .
In television , reaching one hundred episodes means that a show now has enough of a backlog to provide many , many years of profitable syndicated fun .
For Friends , “ The One Hundredth ” episode also marked another significant passage when Phoebe gave birth to the triplets she had been carrying for her half - brother and his wife since Season Four .
“ Hi , I ’m Phoebe Buffay , and I have babies coming out of me , ” the multiple mother - to - be offered by way of a hospital introduction .
2 Season Four
What can one say about a season of Friends that starts with “ The One With the Jellyfish ” - in which Chandler pees on Monica to relieve the sting of the title sea creature - and ends with “ The One With Ross ’s Wedding - Part One and Two ” in which it ’s famously revealed that the same pair of friends have been under the covers together in the Motherland ?
Well , you can say this : Season Four is definitely one of the Friends ’ greatest ever .
1 Season Eight
At their best , sitcoms gave people a place to go once a week where they can laugh and forget about their troubles for 22 minutes or so .
Perhaps that helps explain why Season Eight of Friends - which began in the wake of the tragic events of September 11th , 2001 - turned out to be arguably the show ’s finest hour .
In Season Eight , Friends seemed infused with a renewed sense of purpose and viewers took note as ratings increased .
“ I think Friends was like comfort food for people at that time , ” says Producer Marta Kauffman .
“ And I was really honored to be comfort food .
We were n’t dealing with the larger issues .
We were just doing comedy , and I think people wanted to laugh more than they wanted to see all the images over and over and over again of the Towers coming down .
After a time , people really were ready to laugh , needed to laugh again .
That was just a special season , a strong season .
It ’s hard to look at all your children and wonder which one is strongest , but I really did love Season Eight . ”
For all the good work in Season Eight , Friends would finally win its first Best Comedy Emmy - a long delayed honor considering the show ’s overall quality and massive popularity success .

SEOUL , South Korea ( CNN ) --
An American orchestra performed a historic concert Tuesday in the communist state of North Korea -- one of the most secretive societies in the world .
A group of 105 musicians made the journey to Pyongyang , but for one of them this trip was not just about music .
It was about family history .
Michelle Kim , shown here at an earlier performance , performed Tuesday in North Korea .
Michelle Kim , 35 , is a violinist with the New York Philharmonic , which performed a nearly two - hour concert in Pyongyang .
Kim 's parents were born in the North and fled the country during the Korean War .
For Kim the concert was an opportunity to see the land where her parents were born and where they suffered before leaving the country forever .
Watch sights and sounds of concert »
Kim 's father , Chung - Kil Kim , was only 5 years old when the war broke out in 1950 , but what he experienced was so horrific that he said he would never forget it .
Watch highlights of today 's historic concert »
" I still clearly remember that so many people were dying around me , and I walked over dead bodies . "
Chung - Kil said .
Chung - Kil 's family was under tight supervision because his uncle was a minister , he said .
There is no organized religion in North Korea , other than the worship of the country 's founder and what they call their " Eternal President , " Kim Il Sung .
Chung - Kil remembers one day after the war started , his uncle went to his church to pray .
North Korean soldiers came to the church , locked everyone inside and set it on fire .
Everyone , including Chung - Kil 's uncle , died , he said .
After Chung - Kil 's uncle was killed , his family decided it was too dangerous to remain in the North .
So , they abandoned their home and fled to the South .
Kim 's mother , Kyung - Ja Kim , also fled with her family from the North during the war .
Kyung - Ja 's mother carried the then - 1 - year - old on her back the entire way .
Kim 's parents eventually met and married in Seoul , where Kim was born .
They moved to the United States and settled in California when she was 16 .
She already was gaining attention as a talented musician and won an international music competition , which led to an unusual invitation to perform in Pyongyang for President Kim Il Sung 's birthday .
At the time , Chung - Kil and Kyung - Ja were too scared to let her go .
They were afraid their daughter would be abducted and forced to stay in the North , her father said .
Their attitude changed , he said , because this time she would be traveling not only with the Philharmonic , but also with an American press corps .
Her father said in his heart , he felt it was time for her to go .
" I still have a grudge against the Korean War , however I understand the people in North Korea are not to blame , " Chung - Kil said .
" This is a really good opportunity for my Michelle to go to the North and give them an opportunity to open their door to our culture . "
Kim said her first emotion when she arrived in Pyongyang was a sense of awe .
Seeing the North Koreans makes her feel sad that the country has been divided , she said .
" North Koreans , South Koreans , we 're just Koreans .
They 're the exact same people as I am .
We have the exact same culture .
We have the exact same songs . "
Tuesday 's concert ended with the Korean folk song " Arirang , " which is a love song about reunion .
The song brought back memories of Michelle 's childhood in South Korea .
" A lot of us actually stood out on the stage and just waved to them .
Many people had tears in their eyes .
And , of course , all of us were crying , the Korean - Americans were crying . "
The New York Philharmonic leaves North Korea Wednesday , and Kim is taking a lot of pictures to show her family when she gets home .
She is the eyes and ears for her parents , she said , and hopes the pictures and her experiences will allow her parents to see North Korea in a new way -- a better way than they did when they fled more than 50 years ago .

Mark Cuban thinks he can save the dying business of movie theaters , which are steadily losing out to home entertainment options as televisions get bigger and video games and pay - per - view choices get better .
His plan ?
Enlist the help of two even more archaic forms of entertainment , the NBA and 3D glasses .
Advertisement
Tuesday night 's Dallas Mavericks game against the LA Clippers will be shown in 3D at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas .
Cuban believes that the set - up , which consists of the Fusion 3D camera system from Pace as well as two super serious Sony SXRD 4 K 10,000 lumens digital cinema projectors , will promote widespread 3D adoption since " watching sports , concerts and special events " in 3 - D will be something that " only theaters will be able to offer . "
( He does add that Samsung and others are bringing it to TVs , but somehow that does n't get in the way of his argument . )
Let 's get real here for a second , Mark .
There are about 25 people who still care about the NBA ( myself included ) , and probably 14 people who have worn a pair of 3D glasses in the last decade .
Finding a single person in Texas interested in doing both at the same time sounds next to impossible .
You 've already banned bloggers from your team 's locker room because they said some things you did n't like .
For a so - called technology pioneer , you sure seem out - of - touch .

As suspect energy investments go , Mr. Milby ’s offerings are pretty standard .
Through private placement offerings , he sold units in limited liability partnerships managed by two companies he owned , Mid-America Energy and Mid-America Oil and Gas , that would use the money for shallow drilling mostly in Kentucky .
Investors were told that they would receive monthly checks for as much as $ 4,800 for 30 to 50 years , according to the S.E.C. , which said Mr. Milby bragged to some investors that “ no one who has invested with me has ever lost money . ”
What Mr. Milby did n’t tell investors also spoke volumes .
He had filed for bankruptcy in 2003 , and in 2005 and 2006 several states had banned him from selling securities , the S.E.C. said .
The agency also said that Mr. Milby was barred from drilling in Texas and that the Kentucky counties where he was drilling had never produced enough oil to support his lofty claims .
And , while some individuals received modest dividends from partnerships managed by Mr. Milby and the Mid-America companies , no investors ever recouped their entire investments , the S.E.C. said .
Mr. Milby ’s story illustrates the limits of state securities regulators , who cannot keep a suspect operation from seeking investors in other states  and struggle to enforce bans even in their own states .
For months , Mr. Milby continued to seek out investors across the country , even though several states had filed cease - and - desist orders against him .
Regulators in Tennessee , where Mid-America Energy was registered , did not issue any public warnings against the company despite numerous complaints from investors .
Leslie A. Newman , the state ’s commissioner of commerce and insurance , said that issuing a cease - and - desist order would have prevented the state from aiding in other investigations , such as the S.E.C.’s .
“ There is still federal activity ongoing in this case , ” Ms. Newman said .
“ Other agencies with criminal authority are still actively pursuing this case . ”
She declined to say which agencies were involved .
To date , Mr. Milby faces just one criminal charge , a count of felony fraud in a Louisiana parish .
Some federal prosecutors say they lack the resources to chase after every allegation of an oil and gas scheme .

In a letter to prospective investors , Gary Milby sought to sell stakes in an oil venture in Kentucky .
“ These are complex cases that take a lot of investigative time , and there ’s just not a lot of investigative resources in this area right now , ” said David L. Huber , the United States attorney for the Western District of Kentucky .
Those of us in the reality - based community know that it's a myth created by the rightwing that liberals and anti-war protesters ran around attacking soldiers returning from Vietnam .
Nonetheless , liberals and progressives have learned that many soldiers returned from Vietnam confused and alienated , and did n't feel that people back home appreciated their sacrifices or sufficiently distinguished the warriors from the unjust war .
People who oppose the war in Iraq have learned some lessons from Vietnam .
We bend over backwards to avoid saying or doing anything that could be misrepresented as " not supporting the troops . "
We accept as a given that they are mis-led by the civilian leadership in the White House , the Pentagon and even by some of the uniformed office corps .
But we tend we talk about them as if we assume all soldiers , or at least most , are patriotic idealists who enlisted and serve with pride because they are committed to the nation , the military and their fellow sisters and brothers in arms .
Substituting insufficient attention to the perceptions of the troops with over - generalized veneration of the troops may have political value .
To better understand soldiers , however , it helps to have a more nuanced knowledge of the women and men who chose to wear an Army or Marine uniform .
Writer Michael Massing recognized this is an important question , so he set out to learn who fights , and why .
The Department of Defense surveys recruits on many issues , including their reasons for enlisting :
The number citing [ service to country ] as their main motivation went from 27.5 percent of all responses in 2002 to 38.1 percent in 2006 .
( It was followed by skills acquisition , cited by 20.2 percent , then by adventure , mentioned by 16.4 percent , then by money for education , benefits , travel , and pay . )
But Beth Asch of the RAND Corporation , who does research for the Pentagon , says that such figures should be handled with care , since new recruits , when asked , often like to give their decision an idealistic cast .
Furthermore , while patriotism has surged as an announced motive , it is also the case that the Army fell 8 percent short of its recruiting target of 80,000 in 2005 — its largest shortfall since 1979 .
Since then , the Army has managed to meet its targets , but only by adding more than a thousand new recruiters and increasing the size of enlistment bonuses .
Clearly , the patriotic sheen of September 11 has been dimmed by the ongoing bloodshed in Iraq .
To get beyond the aggregate survey data and hear the stories of individual soldiers , Massing traveled to Watertown , NY , near the eastern edge of Lake Ontario , and home of the Army 's 10th Mountain Division :
There are some 17,000 soldiers based at Drum ( four thousand of whom are currently deployed in Iraq ) , and they overwhelm Watertown .
I met them in bars , restaurants , and one of the area 's three Wal - Marts .
I also interviewed them in Bradley 's , a military - supply store located near Drum 's main gate ... I introduced myself to the owner and , with his blessing , began buttonholing customers .
While a few politely declined to talk , most were more than willing ( though some asked that their names be withheld ) .
Among the first I approached was Jason Thomas Adams , a slender young man dressed in a cook 's white uniform .
A twenty - five - year - old private from Brooklyn , Adams had joined the Army only nine months earlier .
He had never really expected to , he told me — he 'd wanted to be a police officer .
After graduating from high school , he had enrolled in the John Jay School of Criminal Justice .
To help pay the tuition , he worked at two jobs — Paragon Sports and a restaurant on Second Avenue — but quickly went into debt .
Meanwhile , he got married , his wife got pregnant , and he had no health care .
From a brother in the military , he had learned of the Army 's many benefits , and , visiting a recruiter , he heard about Tricare , the military 's generous health plan .
He also learned that the Army would repay his education loans .
And so he signed up .
When I asked about September 11 and service to the country , he said flatly that it had had nothing to do with his decision .
I heard similar accounts from several GIs I met that first afternoon in Bradley 's ...
That initial group of interviews at Bradley 's would mirror those I had throughout my stay .
In all , I would speak with about thirty soldiers , and roughly one of every four would tell me that he had joined the military mainly for idealistic reasons , for some larger cause .
Often , in describing those reasons , these soldiers would sound vague — " I 've wanted to be a soldier since I was young , " they would say , or " my family has always served in the Army . "
( A family history in the military features strongly in the decision of many enlistees . )
Even soldiers with sophisticated explanations of how their patriotism and devotion to protecting America led them to enlist often cited additional reasons connected to income , education , career and life - opportunities :
I was sixteen at the time .
I had always wanted to join the Army , but that moment — it influenced me here , in my heart .
I had job offers , but I wanted to fight for my country — for the red , white , and blue .
And to make my family proud .
It takes a select kind of person to join the military and risk his life for his country .
Of all the soldiers I met in Watertown , no other spoke with more conviction .
Yet as we talked , he acknowledged that there was another reason for his decision : he hoped to make a career in law enforcement , and joining the Army would , he felt , help .
So , even in this case , where patriotic concerns loomed large , considerations of self - improvement played a part as well .
Among most of the other soldiers I spoke with , such considerations overwhelmed everything else .
Over and over , I heard soldiers talk about being hard - pressed to pay the rent , of having a child and being without health care , of yearning to escape a depressing town or oppressive family , of wanting to get out and see the world .
This month the America Prospect published a supplement , prepared jointly with Demos , titled Mobilizing Millennials : Will their Economic Raw Deal Fuel the Next New Deal ?
One of the articles , by Demos ' Tamara Draut , lays out the grim data that describes what 's behind the economic distress that led many of Massing 's interviewees to enter the Army :
When Pell Grants were created , they were intended to cover three - quarters of the cost of attending a public university .
Today they only cover one third .
The average American between 25 and 34 years old spends 25 % of their income on debt payments .
Since few in this category have mortgages , the debt is mostly on student loans , credit cards and auto loans .
This percentage is double what Baby Boomers in the same age group were paying in 1989 .
Between 1995 and 2002 , rents in just about every metro area increased over 50 % .
Combined with their higher debt payment , this makes Mellennials less likely than their predecessors to be able to purchase a home , which for decades has been America 's biggest source of personal wealth creation .
Even when they can purchase a house , Mellennials pay on average one third higher monthly payments than young homeowners did in 1980 .
Finally , the experiences of Jason Thomas Adams , the first soldier mentioned by Massing , are hardly atypical .
Young families with both parents present pay on average 11 percent of their income for child care , and 7 percent on health care .
Unlike just about every other industrialized country in the world , the US has no national health care , students pay exorbitant college tuition , and we have few subsidies for child care .
That does n't mean , however , that government - provided health care , affordable housing , free education and subsidized child care are n't available to young Americans :
[ F ] rom the survey data , and from my interviews , it seems clear that the military does not consist of society 's " dregs . "
Rather , it consists mainly of young men and women who , raised in working - and lower - middle - class families , yearn to make it into the middle class .
Unable to achieve this in the hypercompetitive and expensive market economy , they have instead sought to achieve it in the Army .
With its guarantees of housing , employment , health insurance , and educational assistance , the US military today seems the last outpost of the welfare state in America .
What kind of country have we become when the only way for young Americans to be assured of the basic social safety net provided to citizens of just about every other advanced country requires them to risk death in a war that their fellow Millennials overwhelmingly oppose , and which many of the enlistees themselves view with ambivalence if not hostility ?
There are two problems here .
First , as a nation we need to change the government policies and expand the economic opportunities necessary to prevent the Millennials from becoming the first generation in American history to do worse economically than their parents .
This is not only a policy imperative , it 's also a major political opportunity for Democrats to lock in today 's young voters as a pillar of their electoral coalition for decades .
But if economic , career and life - opportunities are a primary reason driving most soldiers to enlist in the military , what will happen if women and men in their late teens and twenties no longer need to enlist to avail themselves of a just social welfare system comparable with what exists in other developed nations ?
The military is one of the most esteemed institutions in American society .
Like all institutions , it has problems .
But the military will always be appealing to many young Americans , who will seek to challenge themselves , find solidarity in a patriotic endeavor , and learn skills and experience adventure .
Recruitment need n't be aided by the increasingly huge cash bonuses being offered by the Army and Marines in order to meet quotas .
It will be relatively easy for the military to meet recruiting goals through one change in foreign and defense policy .
To repair its stature among young people , the Military needs to be viewed by young women and men as a institution prudently employed to protect America , and not a plaything abused by a reckless administration and it's Republican supporters .
The military can easily survive and thrive in the presence of a New Deal that ameliorates the economic and life pressures currently afflicting the age cohort targeted by military recruiters , but only if we end our disastrous war in Iraq .

The Lavon Affair is a spy story in Israel ’s early years that left a nasty mark on the young state , with reverberations for the following 20 years .
Its name derived from Israeli Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon , though it is also referred to as “ Esek HaBish ” or “ The Mishap ” .
Revolving around nearly a dozen young Egyptian Jews who agreed to spy for Israel against their home country , the affair taps into a story of idealism and self - sacrifice as well as abandonment and an unwillingness to take responsibility .
Due to strict censorship in Israel in the early 1950 ’s , few knew that in 1954 Israeli underground cells that had been operating in Egypt were uncovered by the Egyptian police .
Several young Jews were arrested and forced to undergo a show trial .
Two of them – Yosef Carmon and Max Binnet – committed suicide in prison due to the brutal interrogation methods of the Egyptian police .
Two more – Dr. Moshe Marzouk and Shmuel Azar – were sentenced to death and hanged in a Cairo prison .
Israel glorified them as martyrs .
Their memory was sanctified .
Neighborhoods and gardens were named after them in Israel , as were dozens of children born in the year 1955 .
At the same time , it was not publicly conceded that they died in the service of Israel .
The other six heroes of the “ Esek HaBish ” were far less prominently known .
They were sentenced to long jail terms , where they languished for years .
Two of them , Meir Meyuhas and Meir Za’afran , were released in 1962 , after having served seven - year jail sentences .
Shrouded in secrecy , they reached Israel where their arrival was not made public , and journalists were not allowed to interview them .
Sworn to silence , they reconstructed their lives to the best of their ability , far from the spotlight .
That left four more “ Zionist spies , ” as they came to be called in Egypt .
Marcelle Ninio , a woman , and Robert Dassa , both sentenced to 15 years ’ imprisonment , and Victor Levy and Philip Nathanson , who were sentenced for life .
Marcelle Ninio was kept on her own in the women ’s prison in Kanather .
The men were jailed together for fourteen years , mainly in the Tura prison .
Why would such young Jews risk their lives for an Arab country in which they were born , for a country – Israel – which until 1952 they had never seen ?
And why would Israel decide to open a cell of native Jews to spy for them ?
For Israel , sources of information were drying up in Egypt after the War of Independence of 1948 .
Perhaps more than half of Egypt ’s approximately 80,000 Jews had left for Israel by mid-1950 .
Egyptian Muslims were more openly hostile and distrustful of those Jews who remained , which led many Jews to sever any connection they had with Israel .
Israel thus needed sources of information .
More than that , by the early 1950 ’s Egyptian nationalist agitation against the British presence in Egypt and especially in the Suez Canal Zone was intensifying .
Britain was speaking openly about leaving Egypt as it had from Palestine in 1948 .
British troops in the Canal Zone were living in similar conditions to those in Palestine by the end of the Mandate – behind barbed wire in protected zones .
The Israelis , meanwhile , did not want the British to leave .
The British presence guaranteed a buffer of sorts to an attempted Egyptian invasion of Israel .
With the British gone , there would be nothing to stand between Egypt and Israel but the vast wastelands of the Sinai .
Thus , the Israelis approached several native Egyptian Jews , who recruited others , usually from among their own social circle .
These Egyptian Jews were ready to spy against Egypt because they never regarded themselves , nor did others regard them , as Egyptians .
They attended Jewish schools , their social contacts were limited almost exclusively to Jews , and most of them did not even hold Egyptian citizenship .
Unlike other Middle Eastern Jewish communities , the perhaps 80,000 pre-1948 Egyptian Jews had shallow roots .
Many Jews had arrived in Egypt only in the second half of the 19th century or the beginning of the 20th .
Some settled in Egypt while on the way to Palestine from Yemen or North Africa .
Others were former Ottoman Jews , hailing from all over the pre-World War I Ottoman Middle Eastern Empire .
Egypt even became somewhat of a haven for Jews expelled from Palestine by the Turks during World War I. David Ben-Gurion was one of the many Palestinian Jews who spent time in Egypt during the war years of 1914 - 18 .
After the war , some Jews even came from Eastern Europe , fleeing from the Communist revolution .
While many of them would have preferred to go to America or Palestine , they were unable to , so they remained in Egypt .
Like other foreign colonies , such as the Italians and Greeks , the Jews lived in Egypt without really striking roots .
They lived mainly in their own neighborhoods in Cairo and Alexandria ( as well as in a few cities close to the Suez Canal ) , they attended their own schools , and spoke their own languages .
As many of them were fairly well educated , they spoke French , the language of culture , and English , the language of Government .
( The British remained in Egypt from 1882 - 1956 and ruled for much of that period ) .
Many of them could not even read or write in Arabic and spoke only a very basic Arabic .
Moshe Marzouk , an extremely bright young man studying to be a doctor when he entered the spy ring , was born in Cairo to the Karaite sect .
The Karaites in Egypt regarded themselves as Jews , as did the Egyptian Jewish community .
The Karaite quarter bordered the Jewish Quarter of Cairo ’s Old City and was part of it .
Like other Jews , the Karaites dreamed of Israel and took part in Zionist activity , whether legal or illegal ( as it often was in Egypt by the 1940’s ) .
At the same time , the Karaites mixed more with the Egyptian population , and Arabic was their first language .
They were thus more integrated than other Jews .
Some even bore Arabic names .
Moshe Marzouk ’s family came to Egypt from Tunisia at the beginning of the 20th century .
His family retained their French citizenship , which was very common practice for Jews living in North African countries in the 19th and 20th centuries .
In 1948 , during Israel ’s War of Independence , there were attacks and even bombings by Egyptians on the Jewish sections of Egyptian cities .
Moshe Marzouk was approached about organizing Jewish self - defense in Cairo in 1948 , which he agreed to .
Later , he worked helping Egyptian Jews emigrate to Israel .
Shmuel Azar , Victor Levy and Robert Dassa were born in Alexandria , a much more cosmopolitan city than Cairo .
One could hear French , Italian , and Greek as much as Arabic in Alexandria ’s broad , straight thoroughfares lined by French style buildings .
All three boys were born in Egypt .
Robert Dassa ’s family was one of those that settled in Egypt on the way from Yemen to Palestine .
In his pictures in prison , Robert , with his jet - black hair , dark complexion and mustache looked the most Egyptian of all .
Victor , Robert , and Philip Nathanson ( another member of the spy ring ) were all 16 in 1948 , and all involved in Zionist activity .
Shmuel Azar was four years older and not really part of their social group until later .
The espionage story began in the very early 1950 ’s when the Israelis sent an undercover agent to Egypt by the name of Avraham Dar .
He went by the name John Darling , posing as a British citizen of the island of Gibraltar .
He taught the Egyptian Jewish spy ring about underground organizations and conspiratorial tactics .
They learned how to make delayed action devices , letter bombs , and the intricacies of photography .
In early 1952 , most of them secretly came to Israel to learn sabotage and underground techniques .
Most of them fell in love with Israel and vowed to do whatever they could to help .
At a farewell party for the small number of Egyptian Jews who participated in the course , they decided to call what they would be called upon to do “ Operation Susannah . ”
It was partly in jest , named after Victor Levy ’s fiancée , whose name was Susan Kauffman .
She went with him to Israel and stayed .
The spies were to return to Egypt , and they would know when to go into action when they would hear an Israel radio broadcast of the American song “ Oh! Susannah . ”
Victor Levy left for Egypt in August 1952 .
On the way back to Egypt he first stopped off in Paris and then other locations in France to learn more about manufacturing explosives and some photography .
An Israeli agent by the name of Avraham Seidenberg was sent to take over the organization of the spy ring from his predecessor , Avraham Dar .
Seidenberg was a good choice for such a dangerous mission - considering that he was an Israeli unlike the Egyptian Jews , and thus had more of a chance of his cover being blown .
Yet he had little to lose .
He had been caught looting Arab property during Israel ’s War of Independence and had never been able to rehabilitate himself in public life .
His marriage , too , was on the rocks , and thus he was quite happy to be offered something that could lead to new vistas and opportunities .
Seidenberg was first sent to Germany to establish a false identity as a former SS officer by the name of Paul Frank .
He successfully infiltrated the ranks of the underground former Nazi network .
He set out for Egypt in early 1954 , his new identity established .
“ He chalked up a number of successes , uncovering the underground route by which wanted Nazi war criminals slipped through to the Arab states , as well as supplying the first reports about Egyptian efforts to establish an arms industry with the help of German experts . ”
Once he arrived in Egypt , he began recruiting other members of the Egyptian Jewish community .
Marcelle Ninio was one of those who were captivated by his show of confidence and by the fact that he was an Israeli .
The other members of the cell – who all knew each other , which was an unfortunate portent and a major mistake in terms of organizing espionage operations – agreed to work for him as well .
On July 2 , 1954 , they went into action .
They first blew up some post offices and a few days later , the American libraries in Cairo and Alexandria .
These operations were to “ make it clear to the whole world that Egypt ’s new rulers were nothing but a group of foolhardy extremists , unreliable and unworthy of taking charge of an asset as important as the Suez Canal .
Furthermore , it was to be demonstrated that their grasp on power was uncertain , that they faced powerful internal opposition , and , consequently , they were unworthy of being counted upon as a dependable ally . ”
Robert Dassa was one of the first of the spies to be caught .
Philip Nathanson was caught soon after when , on the way to blow up a cinema in Alexandria , the bomb he was carrying in his pocket ignited and then exploded .
What was a particularly alarming factor was that outside of the theater a fire engine was waiting , as if expecting them .
Philip had the distinct feeling he was being watched .
It turned out that he had been .
As Philip lay on the ground , he saw startled and frightened faces looking down at him .
While somebody shouted “ Take care !
He may have another bomb ! ”
Philip heard a police sergeant say “ Do n’t worry , do n’t worry .
We were waiting for them .
These are the people who set fire to the American library . ”
He was taken by ambulance to a hospital .
After being lightly treated , he was interrogated by members of Egypt ’s military intelligence , the Mukhabarat .
The others – Shmuel Azar , Philip Nathanson , Robert Dassa , and Marcelle Ninio – were caught soon after .
None of them had been prepared by their Israeli handlers for this eventuality .
They refused to implicate one another .
At first , they did not even admit to the bombings .
When the police brought Nathanson to his house with incriminating material , Philip continued to maintain that he was innocent of all charges .
“ ‘ The house was overflowing with policemen and detectives in and out of uniform , ’ ” he recalled .
“ ‘ They took me straight to the garden , and to the workshop in the garden hut .
This too was so crowded there was no room for me , and I remained standing on the threshold …
The policemen had piled the table with Vim cans , chemicals , and the fine scales I used for weighing them .
With each item they found , they asked me : ‘ What ’s this ?
What ’s it for ? ’
‘ I told them I was manufacturing dyes . ’
‘ Sure , ’ said the governor sarcastically .
‘ There ’s a good market for them , praise be to Allah . ’ ”
The police took everything they could from his house , even a fork and a spoon , to be used as evidence against them .
Levy , Dassa and Nathanson held up to the persistent questioning , threats , and occasional beatings .
They maintained that they were Communists who wanted the British imperialists out of Egypt .
This even earned them the admiration and respect from the Egyptians , who also wanted the British out ; that is , until Azar , who was constitutionally incapable of telling a lie , admitted that they were Jews and Zionists working on behalf of Israel .
Seidenberg managed to escape on August 5 , 1954 , but the rest of the network , except for Ninio , was arrested .
In Israel , Seidenberg got a hero ’s welcome as the only member of the network who had gotten away .
Meanwhile , Ninio waited nervously , not knowing what to do , wishing to leave , but unable to do so .
Seidenberg never got back in contact with her and appeared to be very relaxed about the whole ordeal .
He had even encouraged the Egyptian Jews to stay put before they were arrested .
It was only years later that they began to question Seidenberg ’s role in the affair though Israeli intelligence began to suspect him much earlier .
The “ Zionist spies , ” as they came to be called , had not been well treated before they admitted they had been working on behalf of Israel .
But it was bearable .
That all changed after their association with Israel became known .
Ninio , who had eventually been arrested , was beaten mercilessly on the soles of her feet and was threatened with sexual abuse .
Her torture became so unbearable that at one point she threw herself out of a window and nearly died .
She was taken to a hospital where she could heal .
The men were transferred from Alexandria to Cairo , where the prison guards were known to be even more savage than their Alexandrian counterparts .
They were taken to the Sigan Harbi , a prison notorious for its cruelty – a reputation the guards there very much wanted to maintain .
When they were marched down the stinking and decrepit hallways , in chains , they could hear cries coming out of the other cells .
Soon those cries would sometimes be of their friends .
This went on day and night .
Treatment was something akin to a medieval torture chamber .
Moreover , there were rivalries between the police and prison guards on the one side , and the Mukhabarat ( military intelligence ) on the other .
Both sides wanted to prove that they could extract more information than the other .
The prison guards would sometimes hang the prisoners up with their arms tied behind their heads , and beat the prisoners savagely until they fainted , and sometimes even died .
The truth is that this treatment was not only meted out to the Jewish spies – Egyptian members of the Muslim Brotherhood , who were fierce opponents of Nasser ’s secular , socialist , military regime - received exactly the same treatment , and sometimes even worse .
At one point one of the higher - level prison guards , after savagely beating a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , called in Robert Dassa .
The guard told him to beat the Muslim Brother .
“ Now , I am going to let a Jew beat you . ”
Robert refused .
The Muslim Brotherhood member ’s eyes , cringing with fear , softened a little .
The guards turned on Robbie savagely and told him to beat the prisoner or else .
He would not .
A gang of guards then set upon Robbie , savagely beating him , while the Moslem Brother pleaded with the guards to stop beating Robbie .
As long as he could , Robbie stoically refused to cry out and give the guards any kind of satisfaction .
After months of this kind of treatment they were finally brought to trial .
The verdict was predetermined from the start , a fact which was known as long ago as 1956 .
The sentences were a compromise between the extremists of the new government , who wanted all of the spies put to death , and those more moderate members of the government , who preferred to win the world ’s sympathy for their regime by a more humane approach .
This was confirmed by the court ’s presiding judge , Gen . Fuad el Digwi , when he fell into Israeli captivity during the 1956 campaign .
At the time he was the military governor of the Gaza Strip .
He told his interrogators , “ The verdict was dictated to me by my supervisors , who decided how many were to be sentenced to death , how many to imprisonment , and for what terms . ”
The trial went on for two weeks .
As a show trial , it was staged for two purposes .
“ Abroad , it was to stress the story that ‘ Israel tried to undermine Egyptian - American friendship ’ ; at home , it would show that the regime ’s severity was not confined to the Muslim Brotherhood alone . ”
The trial was given “ unusual publicity . ”
The press emphasized again and again how dangerous the Israeli spies were to Egypt and demanded severe punishment .
Naturally , the press pronounced the Jews guilty before the court did .
Such intensive and ongoing press coverage had a deeply demoralizing effect on the families of the imprisoned Jewish spies .
In court , however , they showed smiles of encouragement from the spectators ’ gallery , as did the spies themselves .
Ninio was completely healed by then – it is unlikely they would have permitted her to be shown to the outside world in any other way .
Marzouk publicly took responsibility for the group and everything that they had done .
The presiding Military Judge , General Digwi was taken aback by the admission .
On only one point did Moshe concede to his companions ’ pleas not to reveal more about their activities , and that was not to admit that they had undergone military training in Israel .
After the trial , the men were transferred to Tura Prison .
Marzouk and Azar were sentenced to be hanged .
Massive world pressure was applied on the Egyptian Government not to hang the condemned men .
President Eisenhower intervened , as did the Indian President Nehru – and even the Pope .
The Egyptians , aware that the United States had hung the Rosenbergs , American Jews who had spied on behalf of the Soviet Union , responded ; “ Egypt ( will ) treat its spies in precisely the same manner adopted by the United States . ” Marzouk and Azar were hung in early 1955 .
Ninio was sentenced to 15 years in the women ’s prison of Kanather – the longest sentence ever for a female political prisoner in Egypt .
The previous high had been 8 years .
After the hangings of Marzouk and Azar , relations between Egypt and Israel considerably worsened .
Palestinian infiltration from Gaza into Israel , with Egyptian connivance , considerably increased , as did Israeli retaliatory raids .
Border tensions were reflected in the prison .
The Egyptian guards frequently incited the Muslim prisoners against their fellow Jewish prisoners .
When the prisoners were sent out to the quarries to undergo grueling , back - breaking labor cutting and hauling rocks , the “ Zionist spies ” were under constant threat of falling rocks loosened by ill - intentioned fellow prisoners .
The Jews did have an advantage , however ; Robbie was known in their old prison ( the Sigan Harbi ) , as someone who had helped the Muslim Brothers who had been tortured by the prison authorities .
They saw that he refused to beat a fellow prisoner and had been beaten in return .
He also helped many other prisoners beaten so badly that they could hardly walk to get back and forth to the bathroom when they needed to .
When he was transferred to Tura , word was passed that Robert had helped the Brotherhood , and that henceforth he was to be treated as one of them .
In fact , Robert and the other Jewish prisoners formed friendships with men whom , on the outside , they would have been bitter enemies with .
Although tensions heated up during the 1956 war , after it many Muslim guards and prisoners told the Jewish prisoners that they had every reason to be released in a prisoner exchange , and wished them the best .
It seemed logical that they would be released ; Israel held 5,000 Egyptian prisoners after the conquest of the Sinai .
Israel traded them all , however , for one Israeli pilot .
Israel did not even ask for the spies .
It is not clear why this was the case .
Either Israel did not want to ask , and thereby admit their involvement in the affair ( which could have endangered Israel ’s relations with the United States ) , or the Israelis simply did not want to get involved .
Many of the Israelis originally involved in the “ Lavon Affair ” or “ Esek HaBish ” had been forced out of office and no longer wanted anything to do with it .
They did not raise their voices in protest over the abandonment of the spies ; they simply did not bring the subject up .
Whatever the case , the spies continued to languish in prison , long after the last of the Egyptian prisoners returned home .
* One person who became convinced that something had gone amiss , and that people in Israel were to blame - was David Ben-Gurion .
In a Commission of Inquiry into the Affair published in December 1960 , Pinhas Lavon , ( the Defense Minister at the time of the capture of the spies in 1954 ) was declared not guilty of authorizing the operation .
All the ministers accepted this ruling except Ben-Gurion .
A bitter debate ensued which subsequently went on for years .
But by then most of those involved in the affair had been removed from their posts .
Motke Ben - Tzur , head of a section of Military Intelligence in 1954 , had been dismissed in October of that year .
Pinhas Lavon resigned from the post of Defense Minister on January 2 , 1955 .
Binyamin Gibli , the Director of military Intelligence , was replaced as well .
The only man to emerge unscathed was Avraham Seidenberg who was subsequently referred to in Israel as “ the Third Man . ”
He had given the order to the cell to act and he was the only one who escaped .
Israeli Intelligence even sent him on another mission to Germany .
Isser Harel , head of the Shin Bet and the Mossad from 1952 - 1963 , became suspicious of Seidenberg and ordered him back from Germany .
In October 1956 , Harel removed him from intelligence , but Seidenberg was not accused of anything at the time .
To soften the blow , Seidenberg was asked to write reports on his activities in Egypt and Germany .
He was given access to archives , and years later , it was discovered that he took some top - secret documents .
He served a short prison term .
After his discharge , he was forbidden from entering Germany but went anyway and contacted an Egyptian named Nuri Otman .
Seidenberg let it be known that he was prepared to sell important information to Egypt for a sizable payment .
Harel confirmed that Seidenberg was not authorized to go to Germany or to contact a foreign agent .
It was particularly concerning that he had met with the Otman who , as deputy commander of military intelligence and head of the Egyptian Army ’s security services , had overseen investigating the “ Zionist network ” in 1954 .
This led Harel to suspect that Seidenberg might have been a double agent working for Egypt as well as Israel .
By implication this meant that he might have turned over the Jewish spy network to his Egyptian handlers and permitted them to be caught and then jailed while he got away .
Harel offered Seidenberg a job that would allow him to maintain a connection with intelligence .
A senior intelligence officer interviewed Seidenberg about the position while other officers listened to the conversation .
The first question was , “ Tell me , Avry , could you swear by everything holy that you have never spied against the state of Israel ? ”
Unsurprisingly , Seidenberg denied spying for Egypt .
An investigation concluded he had committed perjury .
A search of his home turned up bundles of illegal , highly sensitive intelligence material which resulted in his conviction and imprisonment for ten years .
There was , however , insufficient evidence to try Seidenberg for betraying his colleagues to the Egyptian police in 1954 .
After serving his ten years as an exemplary prisoner , he was released , and briefly sold television sets in Tel Aviv before emigrating to California in 1972 , still denying everything .
Meanwhile , the spies who had been caught remained in prison .
After Israel ’s victory in the Six - Day War , Israel negotiated for their release .
Although it took months , they were finally allowed to go to Israel in February 1968 .
They quietly built new lives and did tell their stories until after Nasser ’s death .
The Israeli public only learned about the affair in 1971 when Golda Meir announced she would attend Ninio ’s wedding .
In March 2005 , nearly 40 years after their release from Egyptian prisons , the last surviving members of Operation Susannah – Ninio , Dassa , and Zafran – were given military ranks in the IDF in recognition of their service to Israel .
Dassa considered this the culmination of the wishes of his deceased comrades , who wanted the survivors not to rest “ until the State of Israel recognizes all of us . ”
A document released in 2015 excerpted the diary of Nehemiah Argov , Ben-Gurion ’s military secretary .
On October 18 , 1954 , he wrote , “ We set up a unit … that could have been a terror unit and a commando unit behind enemy lines , in the deepest heart of enemy [ territory ] , and who knows what crucial and decisive missions those guys could have fulfilled during an emergency . ”
Argo said Lavon made a mistake by having the operatives “ attack some British objectives to create the impression that the Muslim Brotherhood [ was responsible ] . ”
He added the decision should have been “ a political question , not a security one . ”

American students ’ math achievement is “ at a mediocre level ” compared with that of their peers worldwide , according to a new report by a federal panel , which recommended that schools focus on key skills that prepare students to learn algebra .
“ The sharp falloff in mathematics achievement in the U.S. begins as students reach late middle school , where , for more and more students , algebra course work begins , ” said the report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel , appointed two years ago by President Bush .
“ Students who complete Algebra II are more than twice as likely to graduate from college compared to students with less mathematical preparation . ”
The report , adopted unanimously by the panel on Thursday and presented to Education Secretary Margaret Spellings , said that prekindergarten - to - eighth - grade math curriculums should be streamlined and put focused attention on skills like the handling of whole numbers and fractions and certain aspects of geometry and measurement .
It offers specific goals for students in different grades .
For example , it said that by the end of the third grade , students should be proficient in adding and subtracting whole numbers .
Two years later , they should be proficient in multiplying and dividing them .
By the end of the sixth grade , the report said , students should have mastered the multiplication and division of fractions and decimals .
Palestinian medics carry a wounded child after an Israeli missile destroyed the labor union headquarters in Gaza , 28 February 2008 .
( Wissam Nassar / MaanImages )
The comments came a day after Israeli occupation forces killed 31 Palestinians , nine of them children , one a six - month - old baby , in a series of air raids across the Gaza Strip .
Israel claimed that the attacks were in retaliation for a barrage of rockets fired by resistance fighters in the Gaza Strip which killed one Israeli in the town of Sderot on Wednesday , 27 February .
Palestinian resistance groups , including Hamas , said the rockets were in retaliation for the extrajudicial execution of five Hamas members carried out by Israel on Wednesday morning .
Israeli occupation forces have killed more than 200 Palestinians since the US - sponsored Annapolis peace summit last November .
In the same period , five Israelis have been killed by Palestinians .
Speaking to Israeli army radio today , Vilnai said , “ the more Qassam [ rocket ] fire intensifies and the rockets reach a longer range , [ the Palestinians ] will bring upon themselves a bigger shoah because we will use all our might to defend ourselves . ”
A report on the BBC News website headlined “ Israel warns of Gaza ‘ holocaust ’ ” noted that the word “ holocaust ” — shoah in Hebrew — is “ a term rarely used in Israel outside discussions of the Nazi genocide during World War II . ”
The BBC later reported that “ many of Mr. Vilnai ’s colleagues have quickly distanced themselves from his comments and also tried to downplay them saying he did not mean genocide . ”
An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman , Arye Mekel , claimed that Vilnai used the word “ in the sense of a disaster or a catastrophe , and not in the sense of a holocaust . ”
The attempt to limit the damage of Vilnai ’s comments is not surprising .
It was recently revealed how another Israeli official , Major - General Doron Almog , narrowly escaped arrest at London ’s Heathrow airport in September 2005 , in connection with allegations of war crimes committed against Palestinians in the occupied territories .
British police feared a gunfight if they attempted to board the El Al civilian aircraft on which Almog had arrived and on which he hid until he fled the United Kingdom back to Israel as a fugitive from justice .
Incitement to genocide is a punishable crime under the international Genocide Convention , adopted in 1948 after the Nazi holocaust .
“ The 8 Stages of Genocide , ” written by Greg Stanton , President of Genocide Watch , sets out a number of warning signs of an impending genocide , which include “ dehumanization ” of potential victim groups and preparation , whereby potential victims “ are often segregated into ghettoes , deported into concentration camps , or confined to a famine - struck region and starved . ” [ 1 ]
Vilnai ’s holocaust threat , however much Israeli officials attempt to qualify it , fits into a consistent pattern of belligerent statements and actions by Israeli officials .
Israel has attempted to isolate the population of Gaza , deliberately restricting essential supplies , such as food , medicines and energy , a policy endorsed by the Israeli high court but condemned by international officials as illegal collective punishment .
As The Electronic Intifada has previously reported , dehumanizing statements by Israeli political and religious leaders directed at Palestinians are common ( see “ Top Israeli rabbis advocate genocide , ” The Electronic Intifada , 31 May 2007 and “ Dehumanizing the Palestinians , ” Ali Abunimah , The Electronic Intifada , 21 September 2007 )
On 28 February , Vilnai ’s colleagues added their own inflammatory statements .
Cabinet minister Meir Sheetrit stated that Israel should “ hit everything that moves ” in Gaza “ with weapons and ammunition , ” adding , “ I do n’t think we have to show pity for anyone who wants to kill us . ”
And today , Tzachi Hanegbi , a senior member of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s Kadima party said that Israel should invade Gaza to “ topple the Hamas terror regime ” and that Israeli forces , which now enforce the occupation of Gaza from the periphery and air , should prepare to remain in the interior of the territory “ for years . ”
While Israeli leaders escalate the violence and threats , some other top officials and a vast majority of the Israeli public support direct talks with Hamas to achieve a mutual ceasefire , something Hamas has repeatedly offered for months .
“ Sixty - four percent of Israelis say the government must hold direct talks with
the Hamas government in Gaza toward a cease - fire and the release of captive
soldier Gilad Shalit , ” the Israeli daily Haaretz reported on 27 February citing a Tel Aviv University poll .
The report noted that half of Likud supporters and large majorities of Kadima and Labor party voters support such talks and only 28 percent of Israelis still oppose them .
Knesset Member Yossi Beilin , leader of the left - Zionist Meretz - Yahad party , called for an agreed ceasefire with Hamas , noting that “ there have been at least two requests from Hamas , via a third party , to accept a cease - fire , ” Haaretz reported on 29 February .
Israel ’s public security minister , Avi Dichter , visiting Sderot the previous day , criticized Israel ’s military escalation , saying , “ Whoever talks about entering and occupying the Gaza Strip , these are populist ideas which I do n’t connect to , and in my opinion , no intelligent person does either . ”
And , in an interview with the American magazine Mother Jones , published on 19 February , the former head of Israel ’s Mossad intelligence agency , Efraim Halevy , repeated calls for Israel and the US to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas .
Dismissing lurid rhetoric about the group ,
Halevy stated that “ Hamas is not al - Qaida , ” and “ is not subservient to Tehran . ”
The question remains as to why when the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians , some senior Israeli officials , and Hamas leaders are all talking about a ceasefire , the Israeli government refuses to accept one and the US refuses to call for one .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has blamed the escalating bloodshed entirely on Hamas , and has failed to call for a ceasefire .
This echoes her support for Israel ’s merciless 2006 bombardment of Lebanon which she notoriously celebrated as being “ the birth pangs of a new Middle East . ”
The Palestinian and Israeli populations are exhausted by the relentless bloodshed , however unequal its toll .
They are paying the price of a failed policy , pushed by Washington and its local clients , which attempts to demonize , isolate and destroy any movement that resists the order that the United States seeks to impose on the region .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Craigslist is not liable for discriminatory housing ads posted on its
Web site , a federal appeals court has ruled .

The decision is a victory for the Internet bulletin board where every month more than 30 million people post offers to buy , sell or rent goods and services , including housing , free of charge .
A group of Chicago lawyers sued the Web site in 2006 because some of its housing notices illegally discriminate on the basis of race , gender , religion and ethnicity .
Various ads say “ no minorities ” or “ no children . ”
Declaring such preferences violates the U.S. Fair Housing
Act and would be illegal in a newspaper .
But a three - judge panel of the Seventh Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals on Friday found that Craigslist www.craigslist.org) is not the publisher of these ads , as a newspaper would be .
Instead , the Web site is more like an intermediary carrying information from one person to another and , therefore , not liable for its content , the panel said in a ruling that upholds a lower court decision .
The attorneys “ cannot sue the messenger just because the message reveals a third party ’s plan to engage in unlawful discrimination , ” Judge Frank Easterbrook concluded .
He suggested the attorneys instead use Craigslist to find landlords with discriminatory ads , then forward their names to the state ’s attorney general for prosecution .
Craigslist spokeswoman Susan
Best said she was pleased with the court ’s decision on the issue , which is percolating in other courts seeking to determine the responsibility that Internet sites assume for their content .
For example , Viacom Inc. has brought a $ 1 billion lawsuit against Google Inc. for the copyrighted content that appears on the search engine ’s YouTube site .
Roommates.com is another housing site facing a legal challenge for discriminatory ads .
As of Saturday , searches for housing listings on Craigslist were posted with this warning : “ Stating a discriminatory preference in a housing post is illegal .
Please flag discriminatory posts as prohibited . ”
The San Francisco - based company is run by fewer than 30 people but offers classified ads and forums for more than 300 cities in the United States alone .
In 2004 , online auction site eBay bought 25 percent of the firm ’s equity .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush left on Monday for his farewell NATO summit and a final heads - of - state meeting with Russia ’s Vladimir Putin as he tries to salvage a foreign policy legacy frayed by the Iraq war .

Seeking to reassert himself on the world stage in the twilight of his term , Bush will press NATO for more troops in Afghanistan , try to keep up momentum in the alliance ’s eastward expansion and attempt to ease strains with Russia .
But with Bush even more unpopular overseas than at home , he could have a hard time swaying world leaders at this week ’s Bucharest summit as they look to whomever will succeed him in January 2009 .
“ Many of them are looking forward now to the next president in Washington and are already thinking about what the 2009 summit will bring , ” said Julianne Smith , a Europe analyst at Washington ’s Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Lame - duck status will not be Bush ’s only obstacle as he ventures abroad for the first in a series of international conferences marking his final year in office .
Overhanging his travels will be the 5 - year - old Iraq war , which has damaged America ’s credibility with friends and foes alike .
The latest spike in fighting has increased doubts of further drawdowns of U.S. forces before Bush leaves office .
He will also be trailed by a financial crisis at home that has roiled global markets and sharpened criticism of his economic record , once seen as a bright spot of his legacy .
REASSURANCE FOR UKRAINE ?
Bush ’s first stop will be Ukraine , where he will try to reassure Kiev ’s reform - minded government over its aspirations for NATO membership but offer no firm guarantees .
European partners are wary of letting Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance because of opposition from Moscow , which sees it as encroachment on the former Soviet sphere of influence .
Bush backs their bids for a roadmap for membership but may not have enough clout to overcome French and German misgivings at the April 2 - 4 summit in Bucharest .
Another source of friction is NATO ’s role in the war in Afghanistan , which has led to transatlantic finger - pointing .
Bush wants a greater commitment from NATO partners reluctant to send troops to areas of heavy combat against a resurgent Taliban .
A French offer of more forces has helped ease the dispute but it remains unresolved .
Bush ’s national security adviser , Stephen Hadley , speaking to reporters aboard Air Force
One en route to Ukraine on Monday , said it was “ pretty clear ” the NATO summit would produce a strong statement about Afghanistan .
“ All of us need to do more in Afghanistan , and I think you ’re going to see countries coming up and doing more , ” Hadley said .
He declined to say which countries would be doing more , saying the leaders should explain their own decisions .
Bush will share the summit spotlight with Putin , an unusual guest of the Western alliance .
How the two leaders interact may signal whether the West ’s relations with Russia will improve or deteriorate further .
Afterward , Bush will fly to Russia for a final round of one - on - one talks with Putin before he steps down as Russian president in May .

The visit to Putin ’s Black Sea villa in Sochi is aimed at using their personal chemistry to repair relations strained over missile defense , Kosovo independence and NATO expansion .
There has been speculation the two leaders will try to seal a compromise on a planned U.S. missile shield in Eastern Europe that Russia sees as a threat but which Washington insists is to deter countries like Iran that it considers “ rogue states . ”
Hadley said Bush and Putin might resolve some differences over missile defense as they work on a “ strategic framework ” for U.S. - Russian relations to bequeath to their successors .
“ This is a complicated relationship , ” he said .
There were areas in which the two sides were trying to increase cooperation but also “ areas where we disagree and we ’re trying to manage those disagreements .
That ’s the framework in which we are moving forward . ”
The talks could help Bush gauge how much power Putin will wield behind the scenes after Dmitry Medvedev , his protege , takes over as president and Putin becomes prime minister .
Bush famously said after his first meeting with Putin in 2001 that he trusted him after gaining a “ sense of his soul . ”
Critics say Bush was naive to believe Putin was committed to lasting democratic reform .
Aides acknowledge Bush has become more realistic about Putin , who has grown more strident in his criticism of U.S. policies and more assertive of the former superpower ’s place in world affairs .

It was genuinely alarming to encounter Ziauddin Sardar 's whitewash of Islam in the pages of your journal ( ' Beyond the troubled relationship ' Nature 448 , 131–133 ; 2007 ) .
Here , as elsewhere , Nature 's coverage of religion has been unfailingly tactful — to the point of obscurantism .
In his Commentary , Sardar seems to accept , at face value , the claim that Islam constitutes an “ intrinsically rational world view ” .
Perhaps there are occasions where public intellectuals must proclaim the teachings of Islam to be perfectly in harmony with scientific naturalism .
But let us not do so , just yet , in the world 's foremost scientific journal .
Under the basic teachings of Islam , the Koran cannot be challenged or contradicted , being the perfect word of the creator of the Universe .
To speak of the compatibility of science and Islam in 2007 is rather like speaking of the compatibility of science and Christianity in the year 1633 , just as Galileo was being forced , under threat of death , to recant his understanding of the Earth 's motion .
An Editorial announcing the publication of Francis Collins 's book , The Language of God ( ' Building bridges ' Nature 442 , 110 ; doi:10.1038/442110 a 2006 ) represents another instance of high - minded squeamishness in addressing the incompatibility of faith and reason .
Nature praises Collins , a devout Christian , for engaging “ with people of faith to explore how science — both in its mode of thought and its results — is consistent with their religious beliefs ” .
But here is Collins on how he , as a scientist , finally became convinced of the divinity of Jesus Christ : “ On a beautiful fall day , as I was hiking in the Cascade Mountains ... the majesty and beauty of God 's creation overwhelmed my resistance .
As I rounded a corner and saw a beautiful and unexpected frozen waterfall , hundreds of feet high , I knew the search was over .
The next morning , I knelt in the dewy grass as the sun rose and surrendered to Jesus Christ . ”
What does the “ mode of thought ” displayed by Collins have in common with science ?
The Language of God should have sparked gasping outrage from the editors at Nature .
Instead , they deemed Collins 's efforts “ moving ” and “ laudable ” , commending him for building a “ bridge across the social and intellectual divide that exists between most of US academia and the so - called heartlands . ”
At a time when Muslim doctors and engineers stand accused of attempting atrocities in the expectation of supernatural reward , when the Catholic Church still preaches the sinfulness of condom use in villages devastated by AIDS , when the president of the United States repeatedly vetoes the most promising medical research for religious reasons , much depends on the scientific community presenting a united front against the forces of unreason .
There are bridges and there are gangplanks , and it is the business of journals such as Nature to know the difference .

Worlds collided on Sunday and I found myself actually agreeing with George Will .
Apparently , EVERYONE on the This Week with George Stephanopoulos agreed with George Will when he posited Will 's Law :
WILL : Can I propose Will ’s Law ?
We can all agree on this .
Three liberals and Will .
Will ’s Law is that no company , such as JPMorgan now , or BearStearns , that is getting substantial subvention from the federal government shall be allowed to pay any of its executives for than the GS - 15 , that ’s $ 124,000 .
That would stop the run to Washington .
REICH : That sounds pretty good to me .
[ crosstalk ]
REICH : Let me say one other thing .
I think the Will ’s Law ought to be expanded to include oil companies should not get extra money from the government , pharmaceutical companies should not have their research and development subsidized by the government .
We should have no corporate welfare , at all in this country .
WILL : For it .
REICH : Well , good .
Well , let ’s go forward .
I think we have a great deal of agreement .
Sony has told Eurogamer that it is unaware of any issues regarding the mysterious PS3 error codes supposedly popping up around the world .
The allegedly cursed number is 80010514 .
It relates to a faulty sector on the hard drive and faulty installation of firmware updates , according to GameRevolver .
There 's advice to avoid this by following the correct procedure when installing updates , using a stable Internet connection to download and dust your machine to stop heat issues and other glitches occurring .
Despite the problem being unrelated to the hardware , your system will apparently still need replacing if the error occurs .
So is this a serious problem , or just Internet bunkum ?
An SCE UK spokesperson told us , " I 've spoken to our Customer Services department and they are n't aware of this issue with the PS3 . "
Make of that what you will .
And many of you probably will .
By now , you have probably heard that Obama 's retired former pastor had some radical views and said some outlandish things .
While it is shocking that an elderly African American clergy person might harbor some resentment after suffering decades of harsh discrimination , thorough research by the Clinton campaign with copious help from myself and other members of Democratic Underground have unearthed a plethora of unsavory characters and additional nefarious activities going on around Barack Obama and his campaign .
It turns out that Obama 's barber is a Communist .
http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=132x5071326
An unnamed Clinton campaign source is quoted as saying " He better explain his 20 + year association with his barber .
Obviously , during the one hour every two weeks he spent with his barber , he listened to the subversive things the barber was saying .
He must have agreed with the barber because he kept going there to get his hair cut .
Obama needs to distance himself from his barber or lose the election . "
Also , as shocking as it might seem , anonymous sources have learned that the Obama 's pool boy is a closet Nazi .
It 's hard to see how the Obama 's missed it .
I 've never before seen a pool guy that insists on wearing thigh high shiny black boots and has a proclivity for goose - stepping from one end of the pool to another .
How can we trust the oval office to someone who would miss this ?
Those are some of the reports that we have confirmed .
There are additional rumours to the effect that the Obama 's cat is a Castro supporter .
Despite our normal vigorous efforts to find out the entire truth , we have not been able to ascertain whether the feline is a supporter of Raul or Fidel Castro .
Additionally , this reporter can confirm that the Obama 's dog has connections to the Taliban and has been working with them and the Russian mafia to import Afghan heroin into the US .
There is more , and Obama supporters are just going to have to steel themselves to the truth here .
A Democratic Underground member under the pseudonym " Thurston Howell III " was able to uncover a nearly 1000 year old mystery and tie it to Obama .
According to this post , http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=132x5071867
Obama was responsible for the 1066 invasion of England by William the Conqueror .
In that same thread , a decendant of William I , who is recognized as England 's first monarch , refused to deny the allegations .
Calls to Buckingham Palace as well as Ten Downing street ( Not to mention 221B Baker street ) for additional verification went unanswered .
The Clinton campaign has promised that additional scrutiny of the people who surround Barack Obama 's life will continue .
Another unnamed Clinton staffer was quoted as saying " We have to know everything there is to know about Barack Obama .
The people deserve to know who they are considering for the Democratic Nomination .
If that means we have to dig into everything there is to know about the Obama family Veterinarian , Michele 's manicurist and the guy who normally helps them out at Home Depot , we are going to do that . "

It really was not until 1721 , when the printer James Franklin launched the New England Courant , that any of Britain ’s North American colonies saw what we might recognize today as a real newspaper .
Franklin , Benjamin ’s older brother , refused to adhere to customary licensing arrangements and constantly attacked the ruling powers of New England , thereby achieving both editorial independence and commercial success .
He filled his paper with crusades ( on everything from pirates to the power of Cotton and Increase Mather ) , literary essays by Addison and Steele , character sketches , and assorted philosophical ruminations .
Three centuries after the appearance of Franklin ’s Courant , it no longer requires a dystopic imagination to wonder who will have the dubious distinction of publishing America ’s last genuine newspaper .
Few believe that newspapers in their current printed form will survive .
Newspaper companies are losing advertisers , readers , market value , and , in some cases , their sense of mission at a pace that would have been barely imaginable just four years ago .
Bill Keller , the executive editor of the Times , said recently in a speech in London , “ At places where editors and publishers gather , the mood these days is funereal .
Editors ask one another , ‘ How are you ? , ’ in that sober tone one employs with friends who have just emerged from rehab or a messy divorce . ”
Keller ’s speech appeared on the Web site of its sponsor , the Guardian , under the headline “ NOT DEAD YET . ”
Perhaps not , but trends in circulation and advertising – – the rise of the Internet , which has made the daily newspaper look slow and unresponsive ; the advent of Craigslist , which is wiping out classified advertising – –have created a palpable sense of doom .
Independent , publicly traded American newspapers have lost forty - two per cent of their market value in the past three years , according to the media entrepreneur Alan Mutter .
Few corporations have been punished on Wall Street the way those who dare to invest in the newspaper business have .
The McClatchy Company , which was the only company to bid on the Knight Ridder chain when , in 2005 , it was put on the auction block , has surrendered more than eighty per cent of its stock value since making the $ 6.5 - billion purchase .
Lee Enterprises ’ stock is down by three - quarters since it bought out the Pulitzer chain , the same year .
America ’s most prized journalistic possessions are suddenly looking like corporate millstones .
Rather than compete in an era of merciless transformation , the families that owned the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal sold off the majority of their holdings .
The New York Times Company has seen its stock decline by fifty - four per cent since the end of 2004 , with much of the loss coming in the past year ; in late February , an analyst at Deutsche Bank recommended that clients sell off their Times stock .
The Washington Post Company has avoided a similar fate only by rebranding itself an “ education and media company ” ; its testing and prep company , Kaplan , now brings in at least half the company ’s revenue .
Until recently , newspapers were accustomed to operating as high - margin monopolies .
To own the dominant , or only , newspaper in a mid-sized American city was , for many decades , a kind of license to print money .
In the Internet age , however , no one has figured out how to rescue the newspaper in the United States or abroad .
Newspapers have created Web sites that benefit from the growth of online advertising , but the sums are not nearly enough to replace the loss in revenue from circulation and print ads .
Most managers in the industry have reacted to the collapse of their business model with a spiral of budget cuts , bureau closings , buyouts , layoffs , and reductions in page size and column inches .
Since 1990 , a quarter of all American newspaper jobs have disappeared .
The columnist Molly Ivins complained , shortly before her death , that the newspaper companies ’ solution to their problem was to make “ our product smaller and less helpful and less interesting . ”
That may help explain why the dwindling number of Americans who buy and read a daily paper are spending less time with it ; the average is down to less than fifteen hours a month .
Only nineteen per cent of Americans between the ages of eighteen and thirty - four claim even to look at a daily newspaper .
The average age of the American newspaper reader is fifty - five and rising .
Philip Meyer , in his book “ The Vanishing Newspaper ” ( 2004 ) , predicts that the final copy of the final newspaper will appear on somebody ’s doorstep one day in 2043 .
It may be unkind to point out that all these parlous trends coincide with the opening , this spring , of the $ 450 - million Newseum , in Washington , D.C. , but , more and more , what Bill Keller calls “ that lovable old - fashioned bundle of ink and cellulose ” is starting to feel like an artifact ready for display under glass .
Taking its place , of course , is the Internet , which is about to pass newspapers as a source of political news for American readers .
For young people , and for the most politically engaged , it has already done so .
As early as May , 2004 , newspapers had become the least preferred source for news among younger people .
According to “ Abandoning the News , ” published by the Carnegie Corporation , thirty - nine per cent of respondents under the age of thirty - five told researchers that they expected to use the Internet in the future for news purposes ; just eight per cent said that they would rely on a newspaper .
It is a point of ironic injustice , perhaps , that when a reader surfs the Web in search of political news he frequently ends up at a site that is merely aggregating journalistic work that originated in a newspaper , but that fact is not likely to save any newspaper jobs or increase papers ’ stock valuation .
Among the most significant aspects of the transition from “ dead tree ” newspapers to a world of digital information lies in the nature of “ news ” itself .
The American newspaper ( and the nightly newscast ) is designed to appeal to a broad audience , with conflicting values and opinions , by virtue of its commitment to the goal of objectivity .
Many newspapers , in their eagerness to demonstrate a sense of balance and impartiality , do not allow reporters to voice their opinions publicly , march in demonstrations , volunteer in political campaigns , wear political buttons , or attach bumper stickers to their cars .
In private conversation , reporters and editors concede that objectivity is an ideal , an unreachable horizon , but journalists belong to a remarkably thin - skinned fraternity , and few of them will publicly admit to betraying in print even a trace of bias .
They discount the notion that their beliefs could interfere with their ability to report a story with perfect balance .
As the venerable “ dean ” of the Washington press corps , David Broder , of the Post , puts it , “ There just is n’t enough ideology in the average reporter to fill a thimble . ”
Meanwhile , public trust in newspapers has been slipping at least as quickly as the bottom line .
A recent study published by Sacred Heart University found that fewer than twenty per cent of Americans said they could believe “ all or most ” media reporting , a figure that has fallen from more than twenty - seven per cent just five years ago .
“ Less than one in five believe what they read in print , ” the 2007 “ State of the News Media ” report , issued by the Project for Excellence in Journalism , concluded .
“ CNN is not really more trusted than Fox , or ABC than NBC .
The local paper is not viewed much differently than the New York Times . ”
Vastly more Americans believe in flying saucers and 9/11 conspiracy theories than believe in the notion of balanced — much less “ objective ” — mainstream news media .
Nearly nine in ten Americans , according to the Sacred Heart study , say that the media consciously seek to influence public policies , though they disagree about whether the bias is liberal or conservative .
No less challenging is the rapid transformation that has taken place in the public ’s understanding of , and demand for , “ news ” itself .
Rupert Murdoch , in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors , in April , 2005 — two years before his five - billion - dollar takeover of Dow Jones & Co. and the _Wall Street Journal — _warned the industry ’s top editors and publishers that the days when “ news and information were tightly controlled by a few editors , who deigned to tell us what we could and should know , ” were over .
No longer would people accept “ a godlike figure from above ” presenting the news as “ gospel . ”
Today ’s consumers “ want news on demand , continuously updated .
They want a point of view about not just what happened but why it happened .
. . .
And finally , they want to be able to use the information in a larger community — to talk about , to debate , to question , and even to meet people who think about the world in similar or different ways . ”
One month after Murdoch ’s speech , a thirty - one - year - old computer whiz , Jonah Peretti , and a former A.O.L. executive , Kenneth Lerer , joined the ubiquitous commentator - candidate - activist Arianna Huffington to launch a new Web site , which they called the Huffington Post .
First envisaged as a liberal alternative to the Drudge Report , the Huffington Post started out by aggregating political news and gossip ; it also organized a group blog , with writers drawn largely from Huffington ’s alarmingly vast array of friends and connections .
Huffington had accumulated that network during years as a writer on topics from Greek philosophy to the life of Picasso , as the spouse of a wealthy Republican congressman in California , and now , after a divorce and an ideological conversion , as a Los Angeles - based liberal commentator and failed gubernatorial candidate .
“ Look , if we never went to bed angry we ’d never sleep . ”

Almost by accident , however , the owners of the Huffington Post had discovered a formula that capitalized on the problems confronting newspapers in the Internet era , and they are convinced that they are ready to reinvent the American newspaper .
“ Early on , we saw that the key to this enterprise was not aping Drudge , ” Lerer recalls .
“ It was taking advantage of our community .
And the key was to think of what we were doing through the community ’s eyes . ”
On the Huffington Post , Peretti explains , news is not something handed down from above but “ a shared enterprise between its producer and its consumer . ”
Echoing Murdoch , he says that the Internet offers editors “ immediate information ” about which stories interest readers , provoke comments , are shared with friends , and generate the greatest number of Web searches .
An Internet - based news site , Peretti contends , is therefore “ alive in a way that is impossible for paper and ink . ”
Though Huffington has a news staff ( it is tiny , but the hope is to expand in the future ) , the vast majority of the stories that it features originate elsewhere , whether in print , on television , or on someone ’s video camera or cell phone .
The editors link to whatever they believe to be the best story on a given topic .
Then they repurpose it with a catchy , often liberal - leaning headline and provide a comment section beneath it , where readers can chime in .
Surrounding the news articles are the highly opinionated posts of an apparently endless army of both celebrity ( Nora Ephron , Larry David ) and non-celebrity bloggers — more than eighteen hundred so far .
The bloggers are not paid .
The over - all effect may appear chaotic and confusing , but , Lerer argues , “ this new way of thinking about , and presenting , the news , is transforming news as much as CNN did thirty years ago . ”
Arianna Huffington and her partners believe that their model points to where the news business is heading .
“ People love to talk about the death of newspapers , as if it ’s a foregone conclusion .
I think that ’s ridiculous , ” she says .
“ Traditional media just need to realize that the online world is n’t the enemy .
In fact , it ’s the thing that will save them , if they fully embrace it . ”
It ’s an almost comically audacious ambition for an operation with only forty - six full - time employees — many of whom are barely old enough to rent a car .
But , with about eleven million dollars at its disposal , the site is poised to break even on advertising revenue of somewhere between six and ten million dollars annually .
What most impresses advertisers — and depresses newspaper - company executives — is the site ’s growth numbers .
In the past thirty days , thanks in large measure to the excitement of the Democratic primaries , the site ’s “ unique visitors ” — that is , individual computers that clicked on one of its pages––jumped to more than eleven million , according to the company .
And , according to estimates from Nielsen NetRatings and comScore , the Huffington Post is more popular than all but eight newspaper sites , rising from sixteenth place in December .
Arthur Miller once described a good newspaper as “ a nation talking to itself . ”
If only in this respect , the Huffington Post is a great newspaper .
It is not unusual for a short blog post to inspire a thousand posts from readers — posts that go off in their own directions and lead to arguments and conversations unrelated to the topic that inspired them .
Occasionally , these comments present original perspectives and arguments , but many resemble the graffiti on a bathroom wall .
The notion that the Huffington Post is somehow going to compete with , much less displace , the best traditional newspapers is arguable on other grounds as well .
The site ’s original - reporting resources are minuscule .
The site has no regular sports or book coverage , and its entertainment section is a trashy grab bag of unverified Internet gossip .
And , while the Huffington Post has successfully positioned itself as the place where progressive politicians and Hollywood liberal luminaries post their anti-Bush Administration sentiments , many of the original blog posts that it publishes do not merit the effort of even a mouse click .
Additional oddities abound .
Whereas a newspaper tends to stand by its story on the basis of an editorial process in which professional reporters and editors attempt to vet their sources and check their accuracy before publishing , the blogosphere relies on its readership — its community — for quality control .
At the Huffington Post , Jonah Peretti explains , the editors “ stand behind our front page ” and do their best to insure that only trusted bloggers and reliable news sources are posted there .
Most posts inside the site , however , go up before an editor sees them .
Only if a post is deemed by a reader to be false , defamatory , or offensive does an editor get involved .
The Huffington Post ’s editorial processes are based on what Peretti has named the “ mullet strategy . ”
( “ Business up front , party in the back ” is how his trend - spotting site BuzzFeed glosses it . )
“ User - generated content is all the rage , but most of it totally sucks , ” Peretti says .
The mullet strategy invites users to “ argue and vent on the secondary pages , but professional editors keep the front page looking sharp .
The mullet strategy is here to stay , because the best way for Web companies to increase traffic is to let users have control , but the best way to sell advertising is a slick , pretty front page where corporate sponsors can admire their brands . ”
This policy is hardly without its pitfalls .
During the Hurricane Katrina crisis , the activist Randall Robinson referred , in a post , to reports from New Orleans that some people there were “ eating corpses to survive . ”
When Arianna Huffington heard about the post , she got in touch with Robinson and found that he could not support his musings ; she asked Robinson to post a retraction .
The alacrity with which the correction took place was admirable , but it was not fast enough to prevent the false information from being repeated elsewhere .
The tensions between the leaders of the mainstream media and the challengers from the Web were presaged by one of the most instructive and heated intellectual debates of the American twentieth century .
Between 1920 and 1925 , the young Walter Lippmann published three books investigating the theoretical relationship between democracy and the press , including “ Public Opinion ” ( 1922 ) , which is credited with inspiring both the public - relations profession and the academic field of media studies .
Lippmann identified a fundamental gap between what we naturally expect from democracy and what we know to be true about people .
Democratic theory demands that citizens be knowledgeable about issues and familiar with the individuals put forward to lead them .
And , while these assumptions may have been reasonable for the white , male , property - owning classes of James Franklin ’s Colonial Boston , contemporary capitalist society had , in Lippmann ’s view , grown too big and complex for crucial events to be mastered by the average citizen .
Journalism works well , Lippmann wrote , when “ it can report the score of a game or a transatlantic flight , or the death of a monarch . ”
But where the situation is more complicated , “ as for example , in the matter of the success of a policy , or the social conditions among a foreign people — that is to say , where the real answer is neither yes or no , but subtle , and a matter of balanced evidence , ” journalism “ causes no end of derangement , misunderstanding , and even misrepresentation . ”
Lippmann likened the average American — or “ outsider , ” as he tellingly named him — to a “ deaf spectator in the back row ” at a sporting event :
“ He does not know what is happening , why it is happening , what ought to happen , ” and “ he lives in a world which he cannot see , does not understand and is unable to direct . ”
In a description that may strike a familiar chord with anyone who watches cable news or listens to talk radio today , Lippmann assumed a public that “ is slow to be aroused and quickly diverted . . . and is interested only when events have been melodramatized as a conflict . ”
A committed élitist , Lippmann did not see why anyone should find these conclusions shocking .
Average citizens are hardly expected to master particle physics or post - structuralism .
Why should we expect them to understand the politics of Congress , much less that of the Middle East ?
Lippmann ’s preferred solution was , in essence , to junk democracy entirely .
He justified this by arguing that the results were what mattered .
Even “ if there were a prospect ” that people could become sufficiently well - informed to govern themselves wisely , he wrote , “ it is extremely doubtful whether many of us would wish to be bothered . ”
In his first attempt to consider the issue , in “ Liberty and the News ” ( 1920 ) , Lippmann suggested addressing the problem by raising the status of journalism to that of more respected professions .
Two years later , in “ Public Opinion , ” he concluded that journalism could never solve the problem merely by “ acting upon everybody for thirty minutes in twenty - four hours . ”
Instead , in one of the oddest formulations of his long career , Lippmann proposed the creation of “ intelligence bureaus , ” which would be given access to all the information they needed to judge the government ’s actions without concerning themselves much with democratic preferences or public debate .
Just what , if any , role the public would play in this process Lippmann never explained .
Katherine Heigl & Josh Kelley Hot Couple
andare still in newlywed mode if this picture is any indication .
The pair were in Arizona this weekend for what else - the Super Bowl .
They took in a party on Friday night at Taste Ultra Lounge .
Heigl was recently named the world 's most desirable woman to have as a girlfriend or wife by AskMen magazine .
The actress was also named to Barbara Walter 's 10 Most Fascinating People of 2007 .
This hot pair are looking tan , toned and content .
Marriage must agree with the couple who tied the knot about a month ago .
Their holiday wedding took place on December 23 , 2007 in Park City , Utah .
They then jetted off to Cabo San Lucas for a honeymoon .

The onetime Democratic vice presidential running mate who became an independent to fend off a liberal challenger in Connecticut stumped for waterboarding in a conference call with reporters late Thursday , saying it was n't as bad as burning people with hot coals .
" We are at war , " Lieberman said .
" I know enough from public statements made by Osama bin Laden and others as well as classified information I see to know the terrorists are actively planning , plotting to attack us again .
I want our government to be able to gather information again within both the law and Geneva Convention . "
Lieberman asserted that waterboarding is n't torture because it leaves no " permanent damage . "
" It is not like putting burning coals on people 's bodies .
The person is in no real danger .
The impact is psychological , " Lieberman said .
" We have to allow the president to allow the toughest measures to be used when there is an imminent threat to our country , " Lieberman added .
" If we 've got somebody that we think can tell us where a nuclear bomb is planted in an American city , then I want the president to be able to authorize that to be used . "

SANTA YNEZ , Calif. , March 21 --
It was n't the way he envisioned it , but Thomas Denny came out the victor over Sasiprapa Malaipet Friday night in the main event of Showtime 's ShoXC card at the Chumash Casino .
After being on the wrong end of illegal elbows from the muay Thai specialist , Denny won by disqualification .
Denny seemed to be well on his way to winning the fight in conventional fashion , as he came out and immediately went after Malaipet , backing him up with a series punches before putting him on his back .
Denny then went to work and managed to take Malaipet 's back .
With little effort he sunk in a deep rear - naked choke .
Malaipet , his face visibly turning red , refused to tap out and miraculously managed escape the submission .
Ending up in full - mount , " The Wildman " took advantage of Malaipet 's inexperience on the ground and worked on an arm - triangle choke .
Malaipet escaped that choke attempt also , so Denny gave up on submissions and began dropping elbows .
Malaipet received serious damage to his face , but the Thai fighter never stopped working to escape .
Back on the feet , Malaipet looked to stand and trade against the Victorville fighter but Denny was n't having any of that and immediately shot for a takedown .
With his back pinned to the fence as Denny fought for a takedown , Malaipet unleashed three elbow shots that connected perfectly to the back of Denny 's head .
The veteran Californian immediately crumpled to the canvas in agonizing pain .
After taking a few minutes to recover , Denny told the cage - side doctor that he could not safely continue .
The 160 - pound contest was called at 4:51 of the first round .
" I 'm sorry because I came here to fight , but this is MMA and you have to follow the rules , '' Denny said .
" I may have been dazed but I was n't knocked out .
One thing I could not do , however , was move my neck .
'' In the crowd 's eyes Conor Huen lost to Marlon Mathias .
However , he won it where it mattered -- with the judges .
It was as close as a unanimous decision could get .
Mathias , who fights under the Chute Boxe banner , represented the gym 's flag well .
He practically sprinted towards
Huen off the opening bell , unleashing an overhand left that caught Huen 's attention .
For a moment it seemed like Huen was willing to trade with Mathias .
He soon paid the price , however , eating a straight left that covered his nose with blood .
Scrapping that plan , Huen decided to put his jiu - jitsu skills to work .
He controlled the second period by securing takedowns and working over Mathias on the floor .
Mathias boxed in the third , at one point landing a straight left that snapped Huen 's head backwards .
Huen , who suffered a broken jaw during the bout according to EliteXC , took the fight to the ground again .
Mathias scrambled around , got another sweep but almost got caught in an armbar , which he easily escaped .
Huen took Mathias down one more time before the final bell .
Mathias looked like the busier fighter of the two , and was clearly the crowd favorite .
When the scores were announced the crowd booed mercilessly .
" I am very disappointed in the decision , '' Mathias said .
" I inflicted the most damage and landed the most punches .
I definitely won two of the three rounds .
"
In the third round of their light heavyweight fight , Jamie Fletcher landed an overhand right that sent Aaron Rosa crashing down to the canvas .
Fletcher was unable to finish Rosa , but the psychological damage was done and Fletcher applied pressure the rest of the fight .
Scores were 30 - 27 twice and 29 - 28 .
Shane Del Rosario pounded out Analu Brash at 3:18 of the first round .
After exchanging on their feet to start the fight , Del Rosario dropped Brash with a perfectly placed low kick .
Del Rosario followed Brash down and began punishing him from inside his guard .
Upon a series of punches and elbows , Del Rosario leaned on his right hand and began throwing lefts with all his might to a covered up Brash .
After landing a few shots , Del Rosario briefly looked up to the referee .
Realizing the referee had not yet decided to stop the fight , Del Rosario continued his left hand assault before the fight was called .
Hawaiian Mark Oshiro knocked out the undefeated Chris Cariaso with an short right hook that landed flush to his chin .
Cariaso landed on his back , where Oshiro pounced on him until the referee jumped in and stopped the fight .
Time of the stop was 2:38 of the first round .
Brandon Tarn ruined Jason Williams ' debut by choking him out at 1:05 of the second round .
In his professional debut , Devin Howard submitted Mark Kempthorne with a rear - naked choke at 2:53 of the first round .
Lyle ‘ Fancy Pants '
Beerbohm remained undefeated by submitting Vince Guzman with a rear - naked choke at 3:26 of the second round .
Kenny ‘ The Poet ' Johnson took home a unanimous decision victory over Michael Penafiel .
Johnson used his explosive takedowns and superior wrestling to control Penafiel on the ground .
Steve Gable pounded out Eric Jones at 2:47 of the first round .

The teacher imprisoned in the Sudan for naming a teddy bear Mohammed has told how she feared being raped by her guards during her incarceration .
Gillian Gibbons , who was arrested when a school secretary complained to the authorities two months after the stuffed toy was named by pupils at Unity High School in Khartoum , said her greatest worry was that her guards would " teach the blaspheming white woman a lesson " .
" That was my worst terror - that they would come in and teach me a lesson by raping me or that they would hit me , " she said .
Scroll down for more ...
Recalling the eight days she was held in custody , Ms Gibbons described her shock immediately after her arrest on November 25 .
She was thrown into an open - air cell with grey - tiled walls , a squat toilet and bars across one side of the room and the ceiling .
" It was filthy , there were ants all over the floor and in the corner there were rat droppings , " she said .
" There was a light shining into my yard that attracted all the mosquitoes , so I stood there and got bitten to death . "
She added : " I was panicking and I was crying .
I did n't actually sleep all night .
I was so distressed , so uncomfortable and so cold that at four in the morning I just paced round and round trying to keep warm .
" It felt like this was happening to someone else .
It was just mad , just surreal . "
The 54 - year - old mother of two also told how she felt like she had been " run over by ten juggernauts " when a sharia court convicted her of insulting the prophet and sentenced her to 15 days in jail .
Scroll down for more ...
But displaying a wry sense of humour , Ms Gibbons , from Liverpool , recounted a farcical moment in court when the teddy was introduced as evidence .
" This clerk of the court got this carrier bag and produced this bear with a flourish like a rabbit out of a hat , " she said .
" He put it down on the table in front of us and it flopped over and the prosecution sat him up ...
It made me laugh but it was n't funny , you know what I mean ? "
Ms Gibbons was pardoned by Sudanese president Omar al - Bashir last Monday following lobbying by Muslim peers Baroness Warsi and Lord Ahmed .
She was driven to the airport and boarded a plane to Dubai with the two British politicians .
Sitting amid the splendour of the first class cabin , she was finally able to relax and toast her freedom with a vodka and orange on top of a meal of lobster tails and potatoes .
" I 'm not a drinker but I felt obliged to have an alcoholic drink even though I was with Lord Ahmed and Baroness Warsi , who are Muslims .
I was a bit embarrassed about it but I thought I 'd earned that vodka . "
Despite her ordeal , Ms Gibbons harbours no hostility or regrets , describing her time in the Sudan as " wonderful " and blaming herself for the " misunderstanding " .

I have been looking for a programming language to practice dependent type with .
During the WG 2.1 meeting , my attention was brought to Agda ( in fact , Adga 2 ) .
The word Agda may refer to both the proof assistant and its input language .
It has been under long development , is relatively matured , has good library support .
It supports real dependent type , and , pardon me for my personal preference , it is Haskell - like .
So far it seems like a perfect choice .
So , here is my first Agda program .
I am merely repeating some simple exercises on lists , which I tried using Haskell in a previous entry Developing Programs and Proofs Spontaneously using GADT .
> open import Logic .
Identity > open import Data .
Bool > open import Data .
Nat > open import Data .
Nat .
Properties > module Main where
List Concatenation
Adga has natural numbers defined in Data .
Nat .
With Nat , one can define lists indexed by their lengths as :
> data List ( a : Set ) : Nat ->
Set where > [ ] :
List a zero > _::_ : {n : Nat} -> a ->
List a n ->
List a ( suc n )
The definition of append naturally follows :
> append : {a : Set} -> {m , n : Nat} -> >
List a m ->
List a n ->
List a ( m + n ) > append [ ] ys = ys > append ( x :: xs ) ys = x :: append xs ys
List Reversal
Unlike in Haskell , identifiers in Adga have to be defined earlier in the file before they can be referred to .
In the usual definition of linear - time list reversal using an accumulating parameter , the recursive call yields a list of length m + suc n .
I have got to somehow provide a proof that it equals suc m + n .
How does one provide such a proof ?
In Omega , one would make a list of all lemmas needed in a where clause and the compiler would mysteriously figure out a way to use them .
( Well , I am sure it is well documented .
I just have not understood its algorithm . )
I would like to have more control over what is happening , and therefore would prefer to present the proof as a type cast from f ( m + suc n ) to f ( suc m + n ) for arbitrary type functor f .
This is what one would do in Epigram and Adga .
psuc : {m : Nat} -> {n : Nat} -> {f : Nat -> Set} -> f ( m + suc n ) -> f ( suc m + n ) psuc {zero} {n} {f} xs = xs psuc {suc m} {n} {f} xs = psuc {m} {n} {f'} xs where f ' : Nat ->
Set f' n = f ( suc n )
At this point I did not yet know that I could use the lemmas defined in Data .
Nat .
Properties instead of rolling my own .
The function revcat can then be defined as below :
revcat : {a : Set} -> {m n : Nat} ->
List a m ->
List a n ->
List a ( m + n ) revcat {a} {zero} {n} [ ] ys = ys revcat {a} {suc m} {n} ( x :: xs ) ys = psuc {m} {n} { List a} ( revcat xs ( x :: ys ) )
One thing I have yet to figure out is how much of the type information can be inferred .
The first clause can be simplified to revcat [ ] ys = ys .
If I omit the type information in the right - hand side of the second clause :
revcat {a} {suc m} {n} ( x :: xs ) ys = psuc ( revcat xs ( x :: ys ) )
I would expect Agda to tell me that it cannot infer the types .
However , the program still appears to typecheck .
When I try to execute revcat ( 1 :: ( 3 :: [ ] ) ) ( 2 :: ( 4 :: [ ] ) ) in the interpreter , I get _ 86 1 1 ( 3 :: [ ] ) ( 2 :: ( 4 :: [ ] ) ) , which seems to be an unevaluated expression .
Does it not violate the slogan that “ well - typed programs do n’t go wrong ? ”
Using the predefined lemma in Data .
Nat .
Properties :
+suc : ( n m : Nat ) -> n + suc m ≡ suc ( n + m ) + suc zero m = refl +suc ( suc n ) m = cong suc ( + suc n m )
The type cast in revcat can be performed using subst :
> revcat : {a : Set} -> {m n : Nat} -> >
List a m ->
List a n ->
List a ( m + n ) > revcat {a} {zero} {n} [ ] ys = ys > revcat {a} {suc m} {n} ( x :: xs ) ys = > subst ( List a ) ( sym ( + suc m n ) ) ( revcat xs ( x :: ys ) )
Merging
Once I got revcat working , merge is not too difficult .
> merge : {m n : Nat} -> > List Nat m ->
List Nat n ->
List Nat ( m + n ) > merge [ ] ys = ys > merge {suc m} {zero} ( x :: xs ) Nil = > subst ( List Nat ) ( + zero ( suc m ) ) ( x :: xs ) > merge {suc m} {suc n} ( x :: xs ) ( y :: ys ) = > if x < y then > x :: merge xs ( y :: ys ) > else ( y :: > subst ( List Nat ) ( + suc m n ) ( merge ( x :: xs ) ys ) )
Curiously , the parentheses around the else branch can not be omitted .
Without them the expression would be parsed as ( if ... then .. else y ) :: subst ... .
The precedence for _::_ , which is not declared , is assumed to be higher than if_then_else_ .
Balanced Trees
I tried to go on to define balanced trees , like in Altenkirch , McBride , and McKinna ’s introduction to Epigram :
data Parity : Set where Even : Parity Odd : Parity parity : Parity ->
Nat parity Even = 0 parity Odd = 1 data Tree ( a : Set ) : Nat ->
Set where Nul :
Tree a zero Tip : a ->
Tree a ( suc zero ) Bin : {m n : Nat} -> ( p : Parity ) ->
Tree a ( parity p + n ) ->
Tree a n ->
Tree a ( parity p + ( n + n ) )
The Bin constructor needs a parity bit .
If the parity bit is Even , the two subtrees have the same size .
Otherwise they differ by one .

THE Democrats are in the midst of making an historic choice between nominating their first female presidential candidate or their first black presidential candidate .
And who is everybody talking about ?
A certain 61 - year - old white male with a habit of waffling on about the old days , falling asleep in public and turning puce when crossed .
For most ex-presidents retirement is a golden time .
They top up their personal fortunes , polish their reputations , perform good works and indulge in their hobbies ( skydiving , in the case of George Bush senior ) .
Richard Nixon turned himself into a foreign - policy sage .
Jimmy Carter builds houses for the poor .
Ronald Reagan wrote movingly about Alzheimer 's before the disease silenced him .
For years Bill Clinton trod the same path .
The Clinton Global Initiative is widely regarded as a model of its kind .
Mr Clinton teamed up with Mr Bush senior to raise money for the victims of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina .
The mere mention of his name was enough to put the devotees of Davos and other such gatherings into a swoon .
But over the past few months Mr Clinton has downgraded himself from global statesman to political hatchet - man .
No former president has inserted himself so wholeheartedly into a presidential race .
( Mr Bush senior stayed in the background of his son 's campaign , and declined to get stuck in even after John McCain won in New Hampshire . )
Mr Clinton has not only dismissed Barack Obama as a roll of the dice and a purveyor of fairy tales .
He has also ripped into awkward reporters and wandered into the Nevada caucuses to canvass for his wife .
He is spending more time campaigning in South Carolina than the candidate herself .
Mr Clinton seems intent on playing Spiro Agnew to his wife 's Nixon , but with one important difference : Agnew went after the other side .
Mr Clinton 's behaviour has caused consternation in the upper ranks of his party .
Jonathan
Alter reports in Newsweek that two leading party figures who are neutral in the race , Ted Kennedy and Rahm Emanuel , have told Mr Clinton to change his tone .
Several black leaders have publicly upbraided him .
Some of Mrs Clinton 's confidants are also worried that their attack - dog has a touch of the mange .
Mr Clinton 's stump speeches tend to narcissism — particularly when he is reflecting on his glory years in the White House .
He claims that he never supported the Iraq war , a statement that does not stand up to a couple of minutes ' research on the internet .
He fell asleep during a service in honour of Martin Luther King at a church in Harlem ( “ Bill has a dream ” , quipped the New York Post ) .
Is Mr Clinton damaging his wife 's presidential chances as well as his own reputation ?
This seems unlikely in the short - term battle against Mr Obama .
The former president is armed with the biggest megaphone in the business .
This could prove particularly important in the battle for mega-states such as California and New York , where advertising is prohibitively expensive and free press is manna from heaven .
The Clintons ' double - barrelled attack has put Mr Obama on the defensive — not a position that brings out the best in him .
It has also succeeded in its chief aim : defining him as a black candidate , and an inexperienced one at that .
But the longer - term effect could be more harmful .
The more Mrs Clinton relies on her husband , the more she undermines the most compelling arguments for her candidacy .
Take the notion that she is a feminist pioneer .
Mr Clinton 's omnipresence not only reminds us that his wife made her political career by attaching herself to his coat - tails .
Only a spouse could have survived the debacle of “ Hillarycare ” .
It also reminds voters that her first instinct when the going gets tough is to turn to her husband .
Or take her claim that she stands for “ smart change ” or “ real change ” or whatever the latest slogan is .
This was always going to be a difficult pose for Mrs Clinton to maintain .
But her hip - and - thigh relationship with her husband underlines her two biggest weaknesses — her scandal - ridden past in the White House ( remember Marc Rich ?
Or the free - loading Rodham brothers ? ) and the dynastification of American politics .
When he retired from the presidency , Mr Clinton left the customary letter to his successor alongside the letter Mr Bush senior had left for him eight years before .
Does the world 's greatest democracy really want to give Mr Bush a chance to make a similar gesture ?
Another rolling disaster ?
The biggest damage is to Mrs Clinton 's claim that she will be an effective chief executive .
Mr Clinton 's frenetic role in the campaign surely prefigures the role he will play in the White House , advising here , meddling there , and using the access to top - secret information that his position as an ex-president affords him to second - guess the most sensitive decisions .
Who will hold Mr Clinton accountable for his actions ?
How will the White House function with an ex-president and a vice - president vying for influence ?
( One insider once termed the “ three - headed ” relationship between the Clintons and Al Gore a “ rolling disaster ” . )
The Clintonians like to describe their bosses as complementary figures who act as “ force multipliers ” .
But in the 1990s what actually got multiplied was confusion .
All this will be material for the Republican attack machine .
By most reckonings the Republicans should be doomed .
But the Clintons ' tactics are alienating blacks and young people .
The Clintons are in the process of doing the impossible : making the 2008 election a referendum on them , rather than on the Republicans .
And the Republicans are inching towards nominating their one candidate , Mr McCain , who has broad popular appeal .
If what ought to be a stroll in the park in November becomes a real fight , then the Democrats will know who to blame .
Easter is almost here , and it ’s a time to put aside any differences , celebrate with chocolate eggs , and cuddly bunnies , and start your life over .
At least that ’s the idea , all wrapped up in the form of a religious festival where someone supposedly came back to life a couple of thousand years ago .
But there ’s a darker to it all , and Easter is n’t the lovely , happy holiday we all may think it is .
Here are five videos that show why we should be scared …
The Evil Easter Bunny In Action
The Easter bunny is a cute symbol for the holiday , doling out chocolate eggs to kids everywhere .
Except he is n’t .
In fact , he is an evil presence in the the world who spends the rest of the year beating up innocent people .
You have been warned .
Easter Eggsposed
The consumerism aspects of Easter have kind of overshadowed the religious ones in the last few decades , and this is why : The Easter bunny is a chain - smoking , alcoholic , porn - addicted whore of the egg industry !
It ’s true , this fake new report says so .
Easter Bunny Prank – Scaring Young Children
What happens when you put the Easter bunny up against that most evil character , Death ?
Well , according to this video , a chase ensues , and the bunny ends up getting killed in front of small children .
Scarred for life ?
Jesus Vs. The Easter Bunny
Jesus , the main man of Easter , is n’t very happy to see that stupid bunny getting all of the attention , and tells him in no uncertain terms to get a day of his own .
Unfortunately for the Easter bunny , he picks December 25th , and has Santa to answer to .
Happy Tree Friends – Easter Smoochie
In this Happy Tree Friends Special to celebrate Easter , Toothy finds out to his cost that not all eggs are the treats they appear to be .
Kids , remember this when you ’re tucking in to your own chocolate ( or are they ? ) eggs …
Whatever your plans are , be they religious or chocolate centred , just remember to look behind you at all times , as an ass kicking Easter bunny may be waiting to pounce .
The Virgo and LIGO gravitational - wave detectors combine forces .
Résumé
Un réseau mondial à l’écoute des vagues de l’espace–temps
Les ondes gravitationnelles sont des vaguelettes formées dans l’espace–temps qui pourraient résulter d’événements catastrophiques survenus dans le cosmos , tels que des explosions de supernovas .
Toutefois , ces vaguelettes presque imperceptibles sont très difficiles à détecter .
Des expériences situées en Europe et aux États - Unis se sont regroupées pour détecter ces ondes et , peut - être , trouver leur source .
La première prise de données commune effectuée par le projet franco–italien Virgo et le projet étasunien LIGO , qui s’est achevée le 1er octobre , a montré l’efficacité du travail en réseau .
Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves , faint ripples in space–time , in his general theory of relativity .
They are generated by catastrophic events of astronomical objects that typically have the mass of stars .
The most predictable generators of such waves are likely to be binary systems , black holes and neutron stars that spiral inwards and coalesce .
However , there are many other possible sources , such as : stellar collapses that result in neutron stars and black holes ( supernova explosions ) ; rotating asymmetric neutron stars , such as pulsars ; black - hole inter-actions ; and the violent physics at the birth of the early universe .
In a similar way that a modulated radio signal can carry the sound of a song , these gravitational - wave ripples precisely reproduce the movement of the colliding masses that generated them .
Therefore , a gravitational - wave observatory that senses the space–time ripples is actually transducing the motion of faraway stars .
The great challenge is that these ripples are a strain of space ( a change in length for each unit length ) of the order of 10 – 22 to 10 – 23 – tremors so small that they are buried by the natural vibrations of everyday objects .
As inconspicuous as a rain drop in a waterfall , they are difficult to detect .
During the past few years , a handful of gravitational - wave projects have dared to make a determined attempt to detect these ripples .
The Italian–French Virgo project ( figure 1 ) , the Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory ( LIGO ) in the US , the British–German GEO600 project and the TAMA project in Japan have all constructed gravitational - wave observatories of impressive size and ambition .
Several years ago , the GEO team joined the LIGO Scientific Collaboration ( LSC ) to analyse the data collected from the two interferometers .
Recently the Virgo Collaboration has been reinforced by a Dutch group , from Nikhef , Amsterdam .
The gravitational - wave observatories are based on kilometre - length , L - shaped Michelson interferometers in which powerful and stable laser beams precisely measure this differential distance using heavy suspended mirrors that act as test masses ( see figure 2 ) .
The space–time waves " drag " the test masses in the interferometer , in effect transducing ( at a greatly reduced scale ) the movement of the dying stars millions of parsecs away , much in the way that ears transduce sound waves into nerve impulses .
The main problem in gravitational - wave detection is that the largest expected waves from astrophysical objects will strain space–time by a factor of 10 – 22 , resulting in movements of 10 – 18 to 10 – 19 m of the test masses on the kilometre - length interfer - ometer arms .
This is smaller than a thousandth of a proton diameter , and this signal is so small that Einstein , after predicting the existence of gravitational waves , also predicted that they would never be susceptible to detection .
To surmount this challenge requires seismic isolators with enormous rejection factors to ensure that the suspended mirrors are more " quiet " than the predicted signal that they lie in wait to perceive ( the typical motion of the Earth ’s crust , in the absence of earthquakes , is of the order of a micrometre at 1 Hz ) .
The instruments use extremely stable and powerful laser beams to measure the mirror separations with the required precision , but without " kicking " them with a radiation pressure exceeding the sought - after signal .
The mirrors being used are marvellous , state - of - the - art constructions , and the thermal motion on their surface is more hushed than the signal amplitude .
All of this is housed in large diameter ( 1.2 m for Virgo and LIGO ) ultra - high vacuum ( UHV ) tubes that bisect the countryside .
In fact , the vacuum pipes represent the largest UHV systems on Earth , and their volume dwarfs the volume of the longest particle - collider pipes .
The detectors are extremely complex and difficult to tune .
The installation of the LIGO interferometers finished in 2000 and complete installation of Virgo followed in 2003 .
Both instruments then went through several years of tuning , with LIGO reaching its design sensitivity about a year ago and Virgo fast approaching its own design target ( figure 3 ) .
On 22 May , a press conference in Cascina , Pisa , announced the first Virgo science run , as well as the first joint Virgo–LIGO data collection .
That week also saw the first meeting of Virgo and the LSC in Europe .
It was a momentous occasion for the entire field of gravitational - wave detection .
Although the LIGO network was already into its fifth science run , which had started in November 2005 , many in the community saw the announcement as marking the birth of a global gravitational - wave detector network .
The collaborative first and fifth science runs of Virgo and LIGO , respectively , ended on 1 October .
The effort proved to be a tremendous success , demonstrating that it is possible to operate gravitational - wave observatories with excellent sensitivity and solid reliability for prolonged periods .
The accumulated LIGO data amount to an effective full - year of observation at design sensitivity with all three LIGO interferometers in coincident operation , and the four - month - long joint run produced coincidence data between the two observatories with high efficiency .
Although no gravitational waves were detected , the collected data are being analysed and will produce upper limits and other astrophysically significant results .
Running gravitational - wave detectors in a network has a fundamental importance related to the goal of opening up the field of gravitational - wave astronomy .
Gravitational waves are best thought of as fluctuating , transversal strains in space–time .
In an oversimplified analogy , they can be likened to sound waves , that is , as pressure waves of space–time travelling in vacuum at the speed of light .
Like sound waves , gravitational waves come in the acoustic frequency band and , since gravitational - wave interferometers act essentially as microphones and lack directional specificity , the waves can be " heard " rather than " seen " ,
This means that a single observatory may detect a gravitational - wave burst but would have difficulty pinpointing its source .
Just as two ears at opposite sides of the head are necessary to locate the origin of a sound , a network of several detectors at distant points around the Earth can triangulate the sources of gravitational waves in space .
This requires a global network and is critical for pinpointing the location of the source in the sky so that other instruments , such as optical telescopes , can provide additional information about the source .
In addition , signals as weak as gravitational waves require coincidence detection in several distant locations to confirm their validity by rejecting spurious events generated by local noise .
Before Virgo joined , the LSC already consisted of two major gravitational - wave observatories in the US – one in Livingston , Louisiana , and the other in Hanford , Washington – as well as the smaller European GEO600 observatory in Germany .
The addition of the Virgo interferometer to this network has greatly reinforced its detection and pointing capabilities .
The Livingston observatory hosts a single interferometer with a pair of 4 km arms .
Hanford has two instruments : a 4 + 4 km interferometer like that at Livingston and a smaller 2 + 2 km one .
GEO has a single 0.6 + 0.6 km interferometer , while Virgo operates a 3 + 3 km one .
The introduction of Fabry –Perot cavities in the arms boosts the sensitivity of the three larger interferometers , extending the effective lengths of the arms to hundreds of kilometres .
GEO600 increases its effective arm length to 1.2 km by using a folded beam .
Japan has a somewhat smaller ( 0.3 + 0.3 km ) interferometer , known as TAMA , located in Mitaka , near Tokyo .
It is currently being refurbished with advanced seismic isolators and should soon join the growing gravitational - wave network .
Japan is also considering the construction of the Large - scale Cryogenic Gravitational - Wave Telescope ( LCGT ) .
This would be a 3 + 3 km , underground interferometer with cryogenic mirrors , which would later become part of the global array of gravitational - wave interferometers .
Australia is also developing technologies for gravitational - wave instruments and is planning to build an interferometer .
The effectiveness of gravitational - wave observatories is characterized both by their " reach " and by their duty cycle .
The reach is conventionally defined as the maximum distance at which the inspiral signal of two neutron stars ( each 1.4 solar masses ) would be detectable with the available sensitivity .
In gravitational - wave astronomy , improvements in sensitivity achieve more than they do in optical astronomy .
Doubled sensitivity equals double reach , resulting in an eightfold increase in the observed cosmic volume and in the expected event rate .
Similarly , because of the coincidence requirements between multiple interferometers , the duty cycle of a gravitational - wave observatory is more important than in a stand - alone optical instrument .
During the fifth science run , the two larger LIGO interferometers showed a detection range for the inspiral of two neutron stars of 15 – 16 Mpc , while the half - length interferometer had a reach of 6 – 7 Mpc. Virgo , with its partial commissioning , achieved a reach of 4.5 Mpc during the recent first joint run with LIGO .
Virgo did not yet reach its design sensitivity in this run .
However , its seismic isolation system helped it to achieve a superior seismic event immunity , resulting in longer " locks " ( with a record of 95 hours ) and an excellent observational duty factor .
( The interferometer can only take data when it is " locked " – when all of the mirrors are controlled and held in place to a small fraction of a wavelength of light . )
LIGO reached a duty cycle of 85 – 88 % at the end of its fifth science run , while Virgo reached the same level on its first run .
The duty cycle of the triple coincidence of Virgo , LIGO–Hanford and LIGO–Livingston exceeded 58 % ( or 54 % when including the smaller , second Hanford interferometer ) and 40 % in conjunction with GEO600 .
This was an amazing achievement given the tremendous technical finesse required to maintain all of these complex instruments in simultaneous operation .
The gold - plated gravitational - wave event would be the detection of a neutron star ( NS ) or black hole ( BH ) inspiral .
However , even at the present design sensitivity , the Virgo–LIGO network has a relatively small chance of detecting such events .
Currently , LIGO could expect a probability of a few per cent each year of ever detecting NS–NS inspirals , with perhaps a larger probability of detecting NS–BH and BH–BH inspirals , and an unknown probability of detecting supernova explosions ( only if asymmetric and in nearby galaxies ) and rotating neutron stars ( only if a mass distribution asymmetry is present ) .
As scientists analyse the valuable data just acquired from the successful science run , the three main interferometers will now undergo a one - to two - year period of moderate enhancements and final tuning , and then resume operation for another year of joint data acquisition with greater sensitivity and an order of magnitude better odds of detection .
At the end of that period , the interferometers will undergo a more drastic overhaul to boost their sensitivity by an order of magnitude with respect to the present value .
A tenfold increase in sensitivity will result in a thousandfold increase of the listened - to cosmic volume , and correspondingly , up to a thousand times improvement in detection probability .
At that point ( expected in 2015 – 16 ) , the network will be sensitive to inspiral events within at least 200 Mpc and we can expect to detect and map several such events a year , based on our current understanding of populations of astrophysical objects .
This will mark the beginning of gravitational - wave astronomy , a new window to explore the universe in conjunction with the established electromagnetic - wave observatories and the neutrino detectors .
Beyond this already ambitious programme , the gravitational - wave community has begun tracing a roadmap to design even more powerful observatories for the future .
Interferometers based on the surface of the Earth can operate with high sensitivity only above 10 Hz , as they are limited by the seismically activated fluctuations of Earth ’s Newtonian attraction .
This limits detection to the ripples generated by relatively small objects ( tens to hundreds of solar masses ) and to " modest " distances ( redshift Z = 1 ) .
Third - generation observatories built deep underground , far from the perturbations of the Earth ’s surface , would be able to detect gravitational waves down to 1 Hz , and be sensitive enough to detect the lower - frequency signals coming from more massive objects , such as intermediate - mass black holes .
Finally , space - based gravitational - wave detection interferometers such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ( LISA ) are being designed to listen at an even lower frequency band .
LISA would detect millihertz signals coming from the supermassive black holes lurking at the centre of galaxies .
The aim is to launch the interferometer around 10 years from now , as a collaboration between ESA and NASA .
Although gravitational waves have not yet been detected , the gravitational - wave community is poised to prove Einstein right and wrong : right in his prediction that gravitational waves exist , wrong in his prediction that we will never be able to detect them .
I bought my first espresso machine in the 1990s .
It was a La Pavoni Europiccola , a small , retro-looking chrome job with a big lever you yanked down to express the coffee .
It looked great on the counter but made vile coffee , was a bugger to clean and constantly threatened to explode in a shower of steam and shrapnel .
When , one glorious day , it blew a gasket , I seized the opportunity to upgrade , but I needed advice .
A reasonable person might assume that coffee obsessives would gather in coffee shops , but these days they lurk in the labyrinthine OCD souks of internet chatrooms .
In pursuit of the perfect home espresso - what they call " the God shot " - I gleefully joined their ranks , kicking off the most expensive and pointless addiction of my life .
The ideal espresso ( according to the Instituto Nazionale Espresso Italiano ) is a 25 ml beverage extracted from around 7g of finely ground coffee , using water at a temperature of 88C , passing through the grains at a pressure of 9 bar .
See , dead easy .
It should be thick - textured , having emulsified many of the oils , retain most of the volatile aromas and flavours of the bean and be capped with a thick colloidal foam layer - " crema " - reddish , creamy and flecked .
Each one of those factors is minutely variable , potentially causing thinness , bitterness , under - or overextraction or - the ultimate humiliation - a thin or patchy crema .
My first mistake , according to my online coffee - nerd chums , had been to buy a manual machine - they are spectacularly inconsistent .
So I invested in the legendary Rancilio Miss Silvia ( £ 310 ) , the cheapest acceptable electrical - pump machine and , for a few blissful weeks , I chucked in a couple of scoops of ground Illy every morning and got out a nice little espresso .
Then , one day , the crema failed to appear .
I returned despairingly to the chatrooms , where it was suggested that my problem was with the grind of my beans .
Who knew ?
After much debate and guidance , I purchased a Rancilio Rocky ( £ 180 ) , one of the cheapest grinders operating with " burrs " rather than blades , which give a consistent grind without compromising the volatile oils .
It was still expensive and took up as much counter space as a small shed .
The fresh - ground beans definitely improved the flavour , but now the texture of my " shot " was inconsistent .
Millions of people probably get great coffee every morning with a standard home machine and ground coffee from a supermarket .
I was starting to worry that , with a process that has as many variables as pulling an espresso , once you 're daft enough to go off piste , things get monumentally messy in a way only explicable with chaos theory .
Emails flew , recommendations were exchanged and argued .
I could , they suggested , work on my " tamp pressure " - that bit where the barista scrunches down the grounds into the " basket " on the machine is crucial to the brew .
I was , they said , going to need a tamper , custom - made for my machine and tamping hand by Reg Barber in Vancouver .
After shelling out £ 75 , and hours of practice with my new tamper on the bathroom scales , I got the hang of applying consistent pressure when packing the grounds , but still the perfect crema eluded me .
" Temperature , " , suggested the Nerds .
" The mechanical thermostats on the boiler of your machine can be inaccurate to at least 10 degrees either side - you need to " Pid " your machine , " wrote one .
A Pid is a small computer used in labs and industrial - process control to manage temperature .
To fit it , you need to find secret instructions written by obsessed academics , hidden deep in websites .
You need to ignore all the disclaimers about blowing up yourself and your coffee machine , you need to persuade obscure component suppliers that you are not a bomb - maker , and then you have to take your machine apart and rewire it , thus invalidating any manufacturer 's warranty .
" It 's like a Jedi building his own light sabre , " the Nerds said .
Which , in truth , is how it felt , until I switched the damn thing on and watched the entire PID unit quietly melt .
Obviously Darth Vader never confused the blue and the brown wires .
Another hundred quid and a fortnight later , my machine was Pidded , accurate to within a hundredth of a degree and still turning out crap coffee , which was when they recommended I take an angle grinder to it .
This is a fashionable new modification where you chop off the bottom of the portafilter ( the bit you put the coffee in that attaches to the machine ) so there is nothing between the bottom of the basket and the top of the cup .
This allows you to examine obsessively the flow for the characteristic " tiger stripes " of the perfect shot , but shoots half the coffee up the front of your shirt when you hit the " brew " button .
Things were getting out of hand .
In the following months , though I tried 18 different types of coffee , rebuilt the brew head and fitted an electronic timer to allow the machine to get up to temperature before I woke up , the God shot eluded me .
Today , my kitchen bench looks like a Bond villain 's lair .
I have invested hundreds of pounds and countless hours only to produce average coffee inconsistently .
And what do the Nerds have to say ?
Apparently , the real pros are drifting away from espressos to experiment with syphon pots , those things resembling two spherical glass vases stuck together that put so many 1950s hostesses into the burns unit .
I 've learned a painful lesson .
When Giovanni Gaggia filed a patent for an espresso machine in Milan in 1947 , it was designed to make coffee in industrial quantities at serious speed .
Professional baristas get results because they use huge machines that deliver a thousand shots a day .
The hand processes like tamping become consistent after the first hundred .
To become barely competent could take me years .
The boys in the chatrooms will denounce me as a heretic , but I now know that , for me , the best espresso will always come from an Italian standing coolly behind a big machine , not an obsessive Englishman throwing money at a small one .
Teachers will get increased powers to search pupils for alcohol , drugs and stolen goods under plans unveiled by the Children 's Secretary , Ed Balls .
Insisting that the existing system , which limits staff to knife and gun checks , were insufficient to curb antisocial and criminal behaviour , Mr Balls said he would ask Sir Alan Steer , the Government 's adviser on behaviour and discipline on schools , to look at extending their surveillance regime .
Mr Balls added : " I 'm not saying that teachers need to use these powers , should be using these powers , but I think the right thing for me is to make sure schools and heads and governing bodies have all the powers they need . "

Meanwhile , he condemned as " wrong - headed and misguided " teachers who called at the weekend for the Army to be banned from schools if they use " misleading propaganda " .
He added : " It 's good to have more people from business , from public sector professions but also from the armed forces in schools talking to people .
The idea we should have less of that is misconceived and wrong - headed and we are taking forward a number of different initiatives to strengthen the role that the armed forces can play in our schools .
Mr Balls said he wanted to see state schools setting up branches of the Combined Cadet Force .
" At the moment school - based Combined Cadet Forces are pretty much universally in the independent sector .
I have been discussing with the Ministry of Defence how we can get more CCF in state schools . "
John Dunford , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , welcomed the extra search powers .
He said heads feared they would be accused of assault if they searched pupils .
" Parents have to be assured that their children are completely safe at school and heads need maximum powers to search , " he added .
Hulu , NBC and Fox 's new streaming service , is indeed opening to the public tomorrow as we reported rumors of yesterday .
What 's news to us is that Hulu will be adding Warner Brothers shows and sports as well .
The sports will come as game recaps from the NBA and NHL ( finger on the pulse ! ) as well as full NCAA games .
Now , I do n't want to be a Debbie downer here , and you can't argue with free , but with the copious advertising , spotty selection of episodes and lack of downloads you 've gotta wonder just how much this is going to catch on .

I mean , you can't have it both ways , studios .
If you 're going to restrict it to streaming and keep people from downloading to watch on their media extenders and portable devices , you can't try to protect your DVD sales by only tossing out a handful of episodes .

Just the other night I tried to watch an episode of Battlestar Galactica on there as I misplaced one of my DVDs and found that there were only a few episodes available , none of which from season 2 , which I was looking for .
I then poked around and tried to check out SNL and found that they only had four sketches and none of the musical performances from the most recent broadcast .
And away to Bittorrent I went .
People can tell the difference between something designed only to tease and promote broadcast TV and DVD sales and something designed to be an actual entertainment destination .
If you keep it gimped it 's only ever going to be seen as the former , studios .
Do n't blow it .

This is a list of the greatest female warriors through history .
In order to be selected for this list , the woman has had to be someone who fought in battle herself , not just commanding from a distance , and she had to be real – for this reason people like Hua Mulan are not included as there is a lot of doubt about their historical existence .
10 Gudit 960 AD
Gudit ( also known as Judit ) was a non-Christian queen who ruled D?mt around 960 AD .
She laid waste to Axum ( the then - Sacred capital of Ethiopia – image above ) and its countryside .
She destroyed monuments and churches and attempted to wipe out all of the members of the ruling dynasty ( descendants of the Queen of Sheba ) .
Her activities are recorded in oral tradition and in various historical records .
It is believed that she killed the emperor and took over his throne where she reigned for 40 years .
Tales of her violence and history are still told by peasants in the North Ethiopian communities .
It is traditionally believed that she sacked and destroyed Debre Damo , the treasury and prison for male relatives of the King of Ethiopia .
9 Trieu Thi Trinh 225 AD
Trieu Thi Trinh was a Vietnamese warrior from the 3rd century who successfully resisted the occupying forces of the Wu Kingdom during their time in Vietnam .
She was born in the Trieu Son district of Thanh Hoa province ( now in Northern Vietnam ) .
At the time of her birth , the area was controlled by the Eastern Wu Kingdom , one of China ’s three Kingdoms .
She was orphaned at a young age and was raised by her brother and his wife as a slave until the age of 20 .
She escaped from her brother ’s home and fled to the jungle where she built up an army of at least 1,000 men and women soldiers .
Trieu Trinh managed to liberate an area of Vietnam which she then claimed as her own .
By the age of 23 she had defeated at least 30 Wu advances .
It was said that she rode in to battle on the back of an elephant whilst wearing golden armor and carrying two swords .
8 Boudicca 1st Century AD
Boudicca was a Queen of the people of Norfolk who lead an uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire .
Her husband had left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the Roman Emperor when he died , but the Romans did not acknowledge the joint rule – they simply took full control .
It was reported that Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped .
She was eventually chosen as the leader of her people and their neighbors to lead an assault on the Romans .
Her army had great success in their battles – and in fact completely demolished the city of Camulodunum ( Colchester ) .
Tacitus said that the Britons had no desire to take prisoners – they simply slaughtered everyone in their path .
Dio said that the noble Roman women were beheaded and had their breasts cut off and sewn to their mouths .
Ironically , the great anti-imperialist rebel is now identified with the head of the British Empire , and her statue stands guard over the city she razed to the ground .
7 Trung Sisters 1st Century AD
The Trung Sisters were Vietnamese military leaders who managed to repel Chinese invasions for over three years .
They are regarded as national heroines of Vietnam .
They were born during the thousand - year Chinese occupation .
After fighting off a small Chinese unit from their village , they assembled an army mostly consisting of women .
Within months they had taken back many regions from the Chinese and had liberated Nam Viet .
They became Queens of the country and resisted all further attacks from the Chinese for two years .
Eventually the Chinese formed a large army to crush the sisters and their army .
Legend has it that the Chinese army went in to battle totally naked in order to shame the women soldiers in to defeat .
Despite a heroic effort on the part of the sisters , the Chinese overcame their army .
To protect their honor and to avoid ridicule at the hands of the Chinese , the two queens committed suicide by drowning themselves in the Hát river .
6 Artemisia I of Caria 5th Century BC
Artemisia I of Caria became the ruler of Ionia as a client of the Persians .
She is best remembered for her participation in the Battle of Salamis ( image above ) .
She alone counseled the King of Persia ( Xerxes ) not to meet the Greeks at sea and do battle .
Nevertheless he did not heed her advice and she participated in the battle in September 480 BC as the commander of five ships .
At one point in the battle the Greeks were close to capturing her trireme when she devised a cunning plan to escape .
She had her own ship bear down on another Persian ship causing the Greeks to think that she was fighting on their side .
When she sank the ship the Greeks left her alone .
Xerxes watching from a nearby hill also assumed that she had defeated an enemy ship and praised her for her bravery .
Xerxes was so full of praise for her that he said : “ My men have turned into women and my women into men ! ” .
Artemisia tried to convince Xerxes to retreat to Asia Minor against the advice of his other generals .
Ultimately the Persians suffered a great defeat .
5 Fu Hao 1200 BC
Fu Hao was a consort of King Wu Ding of the Shang dynasty .
She also ( unusually for that time ) served as a high priestess and military general .
Her tomb ( image above ) was discovered in Yinxu ( the ruins of the Shang Capital , Yin ) full intact with her treasures .
She is known to modern scholars mainly from inscriptions on Shang dynasty oracle bone artifacts .
In the inscriptions she is shown to have lead many military campaigns .
The Tu fought again the Shang for many generations until Fu Hao finally defeated them in a single battle .
Further campaigns against the neighbouring Yi , Qiang , and Ba were to follow – with the latter being particularly well known as the earliest recorded large scale ambush in Chinese history .
With over 13,000 troops , she was the most powerful military leader of her time .
4 Ahhotep I 16th Century BC
Ahhotep I was such an important figure in the early New Kingdom that she is considered to have been a pivotal figure in the founding of the eighteenth dynasty .
She had a long and influential life and ruled as regent after the death of her father .
She enabled her two sons ( Kamose and Ahmose I ) to unite Egypt after the Hyskos occupation .
She was instrumental in driving the Hyskos invaders out of Egypt .
She lived until the age of ninety and was buried beside Kamose at Thebes .
She is the one who has accomplished the rites and taken care of Egypt …
She has looked after her soldiers , she has guarded her , she has brought back her fugitives and collected together her deserters , she has pacified Upper Egypt and expelled her rebels .
Weapons and jewelry found in the tomb of Ahhotep I include an axe depicting Ahmose I striking down a Hyskos soldier , and flies in honor for the queen in her role against the Hyskos .
She was considered a warrior Queen and was presented with the Order of Valor .
She was honored with a stela , commissioned by Ahmose I in the temple of Amun - Re that praises her military accomplishments .
3 St Joan of Arc 15th Century AD
Saint Joan of Arc appeared before the Crown Prince of France after receiving visions she claimed were from God telling her to fight to take France back from the English late in the Hundred Years ’
War .
The uncrowned King Charles VII sent her to the siege at Orléans .
She gained great recognition after she was able to lift the siege in only nine days .
After several more swift victories , she led Charles VII to his coronation at Rheims .
She is the only person ever recorded to have commanded the entire army of a nation at the age of seventeen .
Despite sustaining wounds to the neck and head , she continued to lead the country to victory repeatedly .
She was tried for heresy in a false court and burnt at the stake .
Her trial was declared invalid by the Pope and she was canonized as a saint many years later .
2 Zenobia 3rd Century AD
Septima Zenobia governed Syria from about 250 to 275 AD .
She led her armies on horseback wearing full armor and during Claudius ’ reign defeated the Roman legions so decisively that they retreated from much of Asia Minor .
Arabia , Armenia and Persia allied themselves with her and she declared herself Queen of Egypt by right of ancestry .
Claudius ’ successor Aurelian sent his most experienced legions to conquer Zenobia but it took almost 4 years of battles and sieges before her capital city of Palmyra fell and Zenobia along with nine other martial queens of allied provinces were paraded through the streets of Rome in chains .
Aurelian exiled Zenobia to Tibur .
Her daughters married into influential Roman families and her line continued to be important in Roman politics for almost three centuries .
Mavia , was Queen of the Bedouin Saracens from 370 to 380 AD .
She led her troops in defeating a Roman army then made a favorable peace and married her daughter to the Roman commander in chief of the eastern Emperor Valens .
1 Tamar of Georgia 13th Century AD
Tamar ( sometimes known as Tamara ) was the daughter of the Georgian King Giorgi III .
Her father declared her co-ruler and heir apparent to prevent dispute after his death .
After the death of her father , Tamar gained a reputation as an outstanding ruler and was dubbed “ King of Kings and Queen of Queens ” by her people .
Her reign saw the bringing to heel of almost every neighboring Muslim state .
Tamar played an active military role as the commander of her army .
During her reign the kingdom reached the apex of its political , economic and cultural might .
In 1201 - 1203 , Georgians took and annexed the Armenian capitals of Ani and Dvin .
In 1204 , Tamar ’s army occupied the city of Kars .
In 1204 , Tamar helped to found the Empire of Trebizond on the southern shore of the Black Sea ( whose capital is now the Turkish city of Trabzon ) .
Queen Tamar died in 1213 .

Some of the people who likely know the most about the role politics has played in the Bush Justice Department have defied Congressional subpoenas to testify .
Joshua Bolten , the White House chief of staff , and Harriet Miers , the former White House counsel , contend that they are protected from testifying by executive privilege .
That is not enough .
They have a legal obligation to appear before Congress and plead that privilege to specific questions .
The House Judiciary Committee voted in July to hold Mr. Bolten and Ms. Miers in contempt .
The House ’s Democratic leadership has been trying to figure out the pros and cons ever since .
The public needs to hear the testimony of these officials ( along with Karl Rove , who is also refusing to appear ) , and the full House should vote as quickly as possible to hold them in contempt .
The House should also approve a resolution authorizing the Judiciary Committee to go to court to enforce the contempt citations if the current attorney general , Michael Mukasey , as expected , refuses to do so .
The stakes are high .
There are people in jail today , including a former governor of Alabama , who have raised credible charges that they were put there for political reasons .
Congress ’s constitutionally guaranteed powers are also at risk .
If Congress fails to enforce its own subpoenas , it would effectively be ceding its subpoena power .
It would also be giving its tacit consent to the dangerous idea of an imperial president  above the law and beyond the reach of checks and balances .
The founders did not want that when they wrote the Constitution , and the voters who elected this Congress do not want it today .
Letter calls official Spitzer story into question RAW STORY

This GOP operative wrote investigators in November
In the 1970s , he was on the payroll of Richard Nixon 's now - infamous Committee to Reelect the President .
In the 1980s , he helped George Bush Sr. trounce Michael Dukakis by floating a racially charged ad about the Democratic governor 's role in furloughing a black inmate .
And in 2000 , he organized the so - called " Brooks Brothers " riot , forcing the shutdown of a recount in Miami - Dade County , Florida , that may have turned the election to George W. Bush .
Last November , his lawyer wrote a letter to the FBI .
In it , GOP political operative Roger Stone 's attorney , Paul Rolf alleged that New York Governor Eliot Spitzer " used the services of high - priced call girls " while in Florida , basing his information on a " social contact . "
The letter , dated Nov. 19 , said Stone gleaned the information from " a social contact in an adult themed club . "
" The governor has paid literally tens of thousands of dollars for these services , " Rolf wrote .
" It is Mr. Stone 's understanding that the governor paid not with credit cards or cash but through some pre-arranged transfer . "
It continued , including particular detail -- Stone 's lawyer wrote that the governor had n't taken off his calf - length socks " during the sex act . "
It 's unclear whether Stone 's letter sparked the investigation : court papers say the investigation began " in or about October 2007 . "
The New York Times reported that law enforcement officials " stumbled upon " the prostitution ring after they 'd begun an investigation of Spitzer for potential corruption , after a bank flagged " suspicious transfers . "
The missive 's timing -- in November -- was preceded by contact from the FBI .
The Miami Herald , which first reported on Stone 's lawyer 's letter , said the letter was written in response to contact from federal investigators .
" His lawyer wrote the letter containing the call - girl allegations after FBI agents had asked to speak to Stone , though he says the FBI did not specify why he was contacted , " Herald reporter Amy Driscoll wrote Friday .
Subsequent reports shed little light on why the FBI sought to speak to Stone before the letter was sent .
The Times speculated that the bureau might have wanted to talk to Stone about a threatening message he allegedly left for Spitzer 's father , which resulted in his being fired by New York 's top Senate Republican .
Stone chose his words carefully when speaking to the Times : " He said that he was never interviewed by federal officials and that he was not sure his lawyers were contacted because of the reported call to Bernard Spitzer . "
He did say , however , " in a series of e-mail messages on Sunday , " that " his lawyers were contacted by federal investigators three weeks after the allegations about the call surfaced . "
The FBI has declined to comment , either on whether they received Rolf 's letter or if they contacted Stone directly .
Novak Conservative columnist Robert Novak hinted at a possible Stone role in a column earlier this month .
" Republican political operative Roger Stone , Eliot Spitzer 's longtime antagonist , predicted his political demise more than three months in advance , " Novak wrote .
" Spitzer 's entrapment by federal authorities investigating a prostitution ring raised speculation that Stone , with a 40 - year record as a political hit man , somehow was behind it . "
" Eliot Spitzer will not serve out his term as governor of the state of New York , '' Stone said Dec. 6 on Michael Smerconish 's radio talk show , " Novak added .
" He gave no details . "
Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz , in the Wall Street Journal , avers that the Times ' explanation of Spitzer 's ' capture ' after a bank flagged his transactions does n't entirely ring true to career prosecutors .
" There is no hard evidence that Eliot Spitzer was targeted for investigation , but the story of how he was caught does not ring entirely true to many experienced former prosecutors and current criminal lawyers , " Dershowitz wrote .
" The New York Times reported that the revelations began with a routine tax inquiry by revenue agents ' conducting a routine examination of suspicious financial transactions reported to them by banks . '
This investigation allegedly found ' several unusual movements of cash involving the Governor of New York . '
But the movement of the amounts of cash required to pay prostitutes , even high - priced prostitutes over a long period of time , does not commonly generate a full - scale investigation . "
" We are talking about thousands , not millions , of dollars .
We are also talking about a man who is a multimillionaire with numerous investments and purchases , " he added .
" The idea that federal investigators would focus on a few transactions to corporations -- that were not themselves under investigation -- raises as many questions as answers . "
In a nod to his beginnings , Stone has a tattoo of Richard Nixon on the back of his neck .
You see , because we 're winning if casualties go down , and we 're winning if they go up .
Got that ?
We can't lose !
Times of London :
President Bush gave warning yesterday that Iraq ’s “ fragile situation ” required the US to maintain a strong military presence there , even as he defended the withdrawal of British troops from Basra , the scene of heavy fighting in recent days .
In an interview with The Times , he backed the Iraqi Government ’s decision to “ respond forcefully ” to the spiralling violence by “ criminal elements ” and Shia extremists in Basra .
“ It was a very positive moment in the development of a sovereign nation that is willing to take on elements that believe they are beyond the law , ” the President said .
A mullah 's sombre voice echoed through a sunlit room in Kandahar Sunday as Canadians and Afghans closed their eyes together in prayer .
One week after a deadly bombing in Arghandab district claimed more than 100 Afghan lives , the Canadian military wanted to pay tribute to their families and invited them to a condolence ceremony and to lunch outside the Provincial Reconstruction Team base .
" Just like back home in Canada , when something of this magnitude happens , of such tragedy , it 's normal that when we have a connection with people we want to share their tragedy , " said Maj .
James Allen , the officer commanding the Canadian Forces ' Civil Military Co-operation Team in Kandahar .
" We want to show them that we feel their pain and we understand . "
The invitations were delivered door - to - door , after staff at the reconstruction team told soldiers about all the families they knew who had been affected by the explosion .
The region has seen its share of chaos over the last six months .
After the revered leader of the Arghandab district , Mullah Naqib , died of a heart attack , his legacy was threatened by a re-emergence of the Taliban .
Canadian and Afghan forces fought back and declared a victory in their campaign to clear the region of insurgents .
But nothing had prepared the residents for the horrors of the blast and the uncertainties that follow .
Gul Mohammad , 70 , was at home with his wife when they heard of the explosion .
They raced to the scene and found their son Hayat , 20 , dead .
Hayat supported his parents and four siblings by his work as a labourer .
" I am worried , " Mohammad said .
" Now I am thinking I will have to find a job , maybe as a security guard to support my family . "
Thirty - six men and boys attended the ceremony after listening to the Qur'an being recited in a nearby mosque , a tradition that is said to hasten the forgiveness of the dead by Allah .
It is only Allah who can make sense of the tragedy for Mohammad .
" I wish peace would come in our country , " he said , his voice breaking .
" I just will pray . "

The blast happened at a dog- fighting competition , one of the only forms of recreation in southern Afghanistan .
Jan Mohammad , 45 , said he never would have let his 15 - year - old son Raz go had he known where he was off to .
" Now my family members are afraid to go these crowded areas , " he said .
" I was not thinking there would be a blast in these types of crowded areas . "
Though the competition is a weekly affair , this Sunday 's match was cancelled .
The attack was believed to be targeted at an influential local police commander who held great sway against the Taliban .
Observers have commented that the incident , in such a crowded gathering of civilians , also heralds a new kind of insurgency in Kandahar , one that bears little regard for civilian life .
Others have suggested it was a ploy to undermine support for local leaders and security officials , especially the police , who are often targets themselves .
On Sunday , four police officers were injured and two wounded by a land mine that exploded in the district of Maywand near a convoy carrying the Governor of Kandahar , Asadullah Khalid .
The governor and his staff were unhurt .
Civilians killed in attack on Canadian convoy
One day after the attack in the Arghandab , a suicide attack on a Canadian convoy killed 38 civilians and wounded four Canadian soldiers on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Khalid suggested at the time the carnage could have been avoided if Canadians had heeded advice to stay away from Spin Boldak because a bomber was known to be present .
The suggestion the attacks could weaken Afghan support for both their own government and coalition forces was dismissed by Allen .
" Although we are helping with the security situation with the Afghan national forces and the police force , we can't be there 24 and seven every day of the week , " he said .
" I think it is having a very negative effect with regards to how the population would view the insurgency and how they view us .
They know we 're there to help . "
Ten men have been arrested in connection with the blasts , and they were paraded in front of local media earlier this week .
The investigation into all three bombings is ongoing .
Kata and practice
What 's a Kata ?
Emily is doing Code Kata , in the context of a Coding Dojo .
There are several such dojos , including one in Finland and another in Paris .
Quoting the Finnish site :
A Coding Dojo is a coding session centered around a programming challenge .
The challenge is small in scope and often patterned after pragmatic Dave Thomas ' idea of Coding Kata .
This event is based on Laurent Bossavit 's monthly Coding Dojo in Paris where it has been running on a weekly basis since January 2005 .
It has been a weekly programming class where programmers of varying skill levels meet as equals .
The terms come out of Japanese martial arts .
The dojo is the practice hall and a kata is a set of exercises where the student follows the teacher in repeating well - defined motions .
Emily is part of a group which works together to implement the challenge problem .
They might do the same problem multiple times in different sessions , in order to explore solution and implementation space .
For example , trying different algorithms , or using Python one time and Ruby another .
I do n't have a martial arts background .
I take that back .
I did almost three years of fencing in college and grad school .
Okay , I do n't have an Asian martial arts background .
The hierarchical teacher / disciple relationship bothers me .
So I use different idioms to think about this problem .
I also used to play piano .
Once upon a time I ranked second in Florida in my age group and experience level , and I got a special honor award at the county youth fair .
I was about 8 or 10 or so .
But piano did not have a strong draw for me and I did n't practice anywhere near as much as I would have to keep along with others .
Part of practice was to focus on techniques .
My ex-roommate in grad school tells of a famous musician who was asked about the hardest piece to play .
He responded " scales , slowly . "
One of the technique books was by Carl Czerny .
He wrote a series of etudes for the piano , étude being French for " study . "
They were meant for students to practice different techniques .
A kata is rather like an etude .
You practice them and practice them .
The goal is to get the moves down so you do n't need to think about them , which lets you work on the more complicated task of making it all go together .
If that 's the case then the idea does n't translate that directly into a coding kata .
While Emily 's group works might work on the same problem multiple times , they do n't implement the same solution each time .
They try and contrast different approaches .
This is more like a " practice piece " or a " study . "
Dave Thomas himself expands on the idea and talks about other components of skills acquisition , which he calls kumite and koan and relates to the " Dreyfus model of skills acquisition " ; which does not have a Wikipedia page .
The Dreyfus model
The model comes from the 1980 [ 1 ] work of Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus , and was applied to nursing by Patricia Benner [ 2 ] .
Andy Hunt * imported this idea into programming in his talk titled " Herding Racehorses and Racing Sheep . "
( I can only find PPT copy from RTP - Spin ; Google 's HTML cache . )
By far the best page giving context for this is by Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror , including the comments .
The idea is that skills aquisition is a continum , which can usefully be categorized into the levels : beginner , advanced beginner , competent , proficient , and expert .
I originally used the list from Jeff Atwood 's page , which is extracted from the PPT presentation , but I disagreed with the " Does n't want to learn " characteristic of a beginner .
There 's a less contentious example of applying the Dreyfus model to learning Ruby on Rails and compare also to a medical page describing the Dreyfus model .
I 've merged them here :
Level 1 , Novice - Focus is on immediate skill , getting it right Little or no previous experience .
Basic understanding of what to do .
Working from a small set of rules .
No clear idea of what is important .
Need step - by - step instructions .
Each step has to be thought through .
Need a controlled environment and close guidance .
Level 2 , Advanced Beginner - starting to relate to other skills and situations Putting the task into perspective .
Still works through the instructions and has difficulty troubleshooting problems .
Focus remains on the task in hand .
Picking up more subtle cues .
Still requires close guidance .
Level 3 , Competent - able to do the skill and relate it to the wider picture Begin to develop long - term plans and goals .
Has developed a systematic approach which differs to suit the situation .
Knows how the skill fits into the larger context .
Information is generally reliable but may miss / misinterpret unexpected / complex issues .
Still likely to do unneeded work .
Supervision more towards what to do with the skills .
Level 4 , Proficient - Accountable & intuitive .
Immediately sees WHAT Skill is an integral part of the repertoire .
Wants to understand the larger conceptual framework .
Still refers to guidelines for where to go from here .
Focuses on points that matter , little extraneous materials and information put in context .
Working through implications of information whilst collecting it .
The skill is embedded in other related skills ( eg communications , physical examination ) forming part of a wider picture .
Learn from the experience of and guidelines developed by others .
Level 5 , Expert - Immediately sees HOW Rapidly and accurately sums up the situation and seamless move to how to deal with it .
Primary source of knowledge and information .
Able to deal with far more complex cases than someone who is proficient .
Little reference to guidelines ( these are the people who write them ) so they are applied automatically .
Following the rules degrades performance .
Exceptions to the rule are a challenge to be met requiring more conscious thought .
Applying the model to hard skills
I think the comparison to learning Ruby on Rails is kinda stupid .
Skills come in different difficulties .
Learning the binary search algorithm is a skill , but it 's different than learning automata theory .
RoRs is somewhere in between those two .
I 'll go with the idea that it takes more than 5 years to master a field , spending more than 20 hours a week on the topic .
Rough guideline and there are plenty of other , perhaps better ones .
Some say 10 years , and my advisor said " thinking about the problem every waking moment . "
I 've also come across phrases like " rage to master " and " deliberate practice " .
My point is that some skills are a lot harder than others .
The two new and complicated skills I 've started learning in the last 10 years are dancing and Swedish .
I 've danced salsa for 7 years and tango for 3 .
For about a year I was dancing more than 20 hours a week , with salsa , tango , swing , and Scottish country dancing , including going to clubs 3 or 4 times a week .
I am a good dancer .
Watching clips from " You Think You Can Dance ? "
I realize that I am not an expert dancer , by a long shot .
But put me in almost any salsa or tango club and I 'll be one of the top 10 - 20 % of the people there .
At that point it depends on what " best " means .
There are some people who dance a different style than mine and we can't dance with each other .
These seem to be mostly people who learned to dance competitively , as there are a set of expectations there which are n't in club - style dancing .
Hmm , but " expert " is not the same as " best . "
In the domain of " dance " I am perhaps " competent " .
I know nothing about modern dance , or Bollywood - style dancing , or African dance .
In the domain of " salsa dance " I am perhaps " proficient . "
But in the context of " people you 're likely to meet at a salsa club " I 'm an expert .
This confusion is n't giving me a warm , fuzzy feeling about the applicability of the Dreyfus model to dance , as defined previously .
Here 's another example .
In college I worked at the math help center .
I was the local expert on how to do and explain the sorts of calculus problems found in undergraduate math courses .
This was because I had taken a year of real analysis ( a 4th year , or 1st year graduate level , course which works through the mathematical underpinnings of calculus .
But I was not an expert at math .
On the other hand , only a few of the top scientists in the world in the late 1600s could do basic calculus , now taught in many high schools .
Language is also hard to fit to the Dreyfus model .
I 've known foreigners who lived in the US for years , went to college and grad school there , but because they did n't live through the 70s and 80s they did n't get cultural references which were part of " expert " speech .
But I would n't be able to explain the linguistic or esthetic reasons for why English structures things one way and not another .
For example , why do most European languages use grammatical structure like " I slept not yesterday " while English uses " I did n't sleep yesterday . "
The theory I 've learned about recently which tickles my fancy the most is that it 's a Celtic influence on English .
Am I an expert in English ?
What 's the domain of applicability to the Dreyfus model ?
Perhaps these really big domains are too much for it ?
I question the usefulness of having 5 different levels .
One analogy I like is that programming is a craft .
I am far from being the first to suggest this .
We already have language for describing levels of skill acquisition in a trade : apprentice , journeyman and master .
Only three levels there .
Four if I add n00 b :) .
Some poking around on Wikipedia , starting with " skills " and " learning " brought me to The Four Stages of competence : unconscious incompetence , conscious incompetence , conscious competence , and unconscious competence .
That 's four levels .
But as far as I can tell the term " four stages of competence " is a purely a business / pop - psychology term .
Just reading the definitions makes me want to gag .
" We management consultants sometimes talk of four stages of competence ... " * gag* .
While the Dreyfus references do n't toggle that reflex .
If I could somehow say those things with a straight face and in an entertaining presentation , just think of all the money I could get as a management consultant .
" Deliberate practice "
The music , art , and crafts learning models are all built around practice .
Lots and lots and lots of practice .
Reflective practice , and with input from others in the field , including critical experts .
When doing the research for this write - up I came across the work of K. Anders Ericsson , known for his theory of " deliberate practice . "
It 's theory I agree with .
And cool - he 's Swedish and is a professor at my alma mater , FSU .
The best page I found describing Ericsson 's theory was a summary by David Zach Hambrick :
Expertise is commonly attributed to talent .
According to Ericsson and Charness ( 1994 ) , Vasari first articulated this view in his book The Lives of the Artist ( 1568 ) .
Much later , Galton argued that exceptional performance emerges from a confluence of innate ability and motivation .
... Ericsson and colleagues reject the talent view .
...
The central claim of the deliberate practice framework is that exceptional performance reflects extended periods of intense training and preparation .
... Ericsson et al. make a distinction between three types of domain - relevant experience : work , play , and deliberate practice .
Only the latter activity provides optimal opportunities for performance improvement through feedback .
In addition , unlike work and play , deliberate practice requires effort and does not lead to immediate reward .
There 's also an article from CNN on Ericsson 's " deliberate practice " theory .
" What 's the secret of success ? " it asks .
" Painful and demanding practice and hard work " .
Mmm , not sure about the " painful " part .
How do I get better in Swedish ?
I need to start practicing again .
Deliberate practice , and not just talking to people during dancing .
Oh , and yes , it can be quite painful .
Mentally and emotionally trying .
Katas are practice
I think the idea of doing coding katas is a good thing .
Practice helps .
The kata examples Dave Thomas lists are pretty simple for me .
In many cases I can remember doing the problem before , or know the answers from other elsewhere :
KataOne - in college talking with an accountant friend about inventories , and reading the discussions about Python 's decimal module
KataTwo - there 's a reason I use Python 's bisect module .
I never want to code a binary search again
KataThree - need to know division and logs
KataFour - parsing like that I can do in my sleep
KataFive - interesting .
Bloom filters are basically the same technique as folding hash - based fingerprints in chemical informatics
You get the idea .
Or take this example based on bowling .
We implemented that in my high school programming class .
But I 'm a much better coder now , and using a much better language and toolset than BASIC on an IBM PC .
When I was in school I participated in programming competitions .
The most famous of these is the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest , for universities .
My high school came in first in the county but only sixth in the state .
( First was a team we beat in the country . )
In college we did okay , but the best team in Florida was from the University of Central Florida .
They would regularly win or place in the regional competitions .
Why ?
They practiced .
They worked through problems from previous competitions .
They practiced working in a team .
And it helped .
A lot .
Perhaps ( and other have suggested this ) , some of the programming competition problems would make good kata problems .
I wonder if I can come up with some good bio- or chemical - informatics ones .
Corrections
Changed 22 August 2007 : I attributed the " Herding Racehorses and Racing Sheep " idea to Dave Thomas when it 's actually by Andy Hunt , who has an upcoming book on the topic .
Andrew Dalke is an independent consultant focusing on software development for computational chemistry and biology .

Tonight at the Marriott Marquis Times Square , I attended a dinner at which Hillary Clinton spoke to several hundred members of AIPAC ( America Israel Public Affairs Committee ) about how , if elected President of the United States , she would help advance U.S. interests in the Middle East and support our ally Israel .
Hillary ’s no dope , and she knows her audience .
She did not downplay the existential threat Israel faces , speaking at some length about Ahmadinejad ’s Holocaust denial conference and threats to wipe Israel off the map .
She spoke of the need to combat Islamist extremism .
She even offered the following , “ We cannot , should not , must not permit Iran to acquire nuclear weapons and , in dealing with this threat , no option should be taken off the table . ”
She went on to speak about being a strong supporter of Israel ’s right to build its security barrier , having spoken out against the International Court of Justice for its attempts to criminalize Israel for this life - saving measure .
Listening to this , I started feeling warm and fuzzy .
Although I am a diehard advocate of Giuliani for President , it feels reassuring to know ( to sound an extremely AIPAC - ian note ) that support for the U.S. - Israel bond is rock solid on both sides of the aisle .
It ’s sort of like having a second insurance policy .
Or is it ?
After the requisite statements about Israel ’s right to security , Hillary started talking about “ new tactics ” for engaging “ our enemies and Israel ’s enemies . ”
Was it an accident that at this point in the speech , she seemed to falter , her words meandering in circles as if she was n’t quite sure where they were leading her ?
Here I quote her verbatim , with ellipses to mark any phrases I missed :
“ I have advocated engagement with our enemies and Israel ’s enemies because I want to understand better what we can do to defeat those who are aiming their weapons at us .
This is a worthy debate .
There are many , including our President , who reject any engagement with Iran and Syria .
I believe that is a good faith position to take , but I ’m not sure it ’s the smart strategy that ’ll take us to the goal we share .
“ What do I mean by engagement or some kind of process ?
I ’m not sure anything positive would come out of it , but there are a number of factors that argue for doing what I ’m suggesting . ”
And what was it she was suggesting , exactly ?
Well , she never said .
Then she continued , “ I do n’t think we know enough about how the Iranian government functions .
If we are having to pursue potential action against Iran , then I want to know more about the adversary we face .
I want to get a better sense of what the real power centers are . ”
And um , why would our enemy tell us that ?
( Is n’t that , like , what spies are for ? )
She continued , “ I also want to send a message to the rest of the world if [ force ] becomes necessary that we have exhausted all measures , because we will need friends to stand by us as we stand with Israel as we approach this long war . ”
Okay , maybe there ’s something to this last part .
Then again , look how well the world remembers , respects , and stands by America for our efforts to exhaust all other measures ( to the tune of 19 UN resolutions and an embargo for which we were excoriated ) to contain Saddam Hussein , prior to the time force became necessary .
One hint of substance came near the end of her speech .
She spoke about sending America ’s enemies a message about what could happen if they do n’t change , while using leverage to promote change .
It ’s tough to know what Hillary would do were she elected President .
On the one hand , some of her rhetoric sounds tough and realistic .
But at the same time , there is her fundamental illogic , and that of all foreign policy liberals in the age of global terrorism and terror - sponsoring regimes : if the enemies of the U.S. and Israel were fundamentally reasonable , do they really believe we would n’t be talking with them already ?
Hillary says she is a staunch supporter of Israel , yet tonight she tried to sell America ’s most diehard Israel - supporters on the idea of diplomacy with Iran , a country whose stated objective is Israel ’s destruction .
The amazing and chilling thing is , many if not most of those in attendance at the dinner tonight seemed to buy it , or at least to be lulled enough by her rhetoric about the need to “ stand by Israel ” to miss the dangerous illogic here .
“ It was thoughtful , introspective , almost as if she was reaching out and including us in her thinking process , ” one woman told me after the dinner .
“ She was almost pleading with this group of people to consider different options , more strategic , intelligent , smart solutions . ”
My new friend continued , “ It was n’t naive , not just ‘ We ’re pro peace .
We ’re living happily ever after . ’
She was representing a serious appraisal of how hazardous the world is today . ”
Of course , the idea of employing leverage short of war may have merit .
And her mention of the threat of force combined with such measures as an alternative to war is worth noting .
But while Hillary ’s rhetoric of “ engagement ” may sound good , the community of anti-terror activists and Israel - supporters must realize that , at the most basic level , engaging with people who wish your destruction–and are actively working to achieve it–means strengthening a pernicious enemy .
Remember : Hillary ’s husband gave us 10 years of Olso ; 1000 dead Jews later , liberals woke up to the reality that Israel had no partner for peace .
Similarly , Bill Clinton ’s “ engagement ” with North Korea amounted to providing Kim Jong
Il goodies in exchange for “ agreement ” to stop his nuclear program .
He took the money , turned around , and poured it into his nuclear program .
So in fact , “ engagement ” can do a great deal of harm , when what that word actually means is appeasing –and thereby strengthening –the world ’s worst human rights violators .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sudden , tremendous gushes of water from underground most likely carved out unusual fan - shaped geological formations with steps like a staircase long ago on the surface of Mars , scientists said on Wednesday .
A handout of the European Space Agency ESA shows a visualisation of Mars , created from spacecraft imagery .
Sudden , tremendous gushes of water from underground most likely carved out unusual fan - shaped geological formations with steps like a staircase long ago on the surface of Mars , scientists said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Ho/ European Space Agency
The Martian surface boasts perhaps 200 large basins that have formations resembling fans .
About 10 of them are terraced , with what looks like steps into the basin .
Since they were first seen three years ago , scientists have debated how these formations , some of them 9 miles wide , were created .
Dutch and U.S. researchers simulated on Earth on a vastly smaller scale the conditions that might have led to these formations on Mars that resemble dry river deltas with steps .
At a facility at Utrecht University in the Netherlands , they dug a crater in sand in a room - sized tub , then started water flowing into the crater .
As the water flowed in through a channel , it eroded the sediment , then fanned out and deposited sediment as deltas , building steps down into the basin , very much like the Martian formations .
Erin Kraal , a researcher at Virginia Tech University who led the study published in the journal Nature , said these Martian formations probably formed quickly -- in a period of decades not hundreds , thousands or millions of years .
And they involved a lot of water .
“ What you could imagine is something like the Mississippi River flowing for 10 years and then turning off , or the Rhine River flowing for 100 years and then turning off , ” Kraal said in a telephone interview .
“ It ’s hard to image being able to get that much water to start so suddenly and stop so suddenly , ” Kraal added .
Kraal said the large volume of water needed to carve out these formations billions of years ago most likely burst from beneath the surface of the planet .
“ It does n’t look like it came from precipitation , or from rain .
It looks like it came from a hydrothermal source or from melting ice , ” Kraal said .
Scientists want to understand the history of water on Mars because water is fundamental to the question of whether the planet has ever harbored microbial or some other life .
Liquid water is a necessity for life as we know it .
While Mars is now arid and dusty , there is evidence it once was much wetter .
For example , scientists think that long , undulating features seen on the northern plains of Mars may be remnants of shorelines of an ocean that covered a third of the planet ’s surface at least 2 billion years ago .
Currently , there are huge deposits of frozen water at the poles .
And images taken by a NASA spacecraft suggest the presence of a small amount of liquid water on the surface .
The images showed changes in the walls of two craters apparently caused by the downhill flow of water in the past few years .
The deal should lead to better protection for tropical forests Delegates at the UN summit in Bali have agreed a deal on curbing climate change after days of bitter wrangling .
Agreement was reached after a U - turn from the US , which had wanted firmer commitments from developing countries .
Environment groups said they were disappointed by the lack of firm targets for reducing emissions .
The " Bali roadmap " initiates a two - year process of negotiations designed to agree a new set of emissions targets to replace those in the Kyoto Protocol .
We said we needed a roadmap , but this conference has failed to give us a clear destination
Tony Juniper , Friends of the Earth
Small presents for everyone Bali deal : Reaction in quotes
Send us your comments
The EU had pressed for a commitment that industrialised nations should commit to cuts of 25 - 40 % by 2020 , a bid that was implacably opposed by a bloc containing the US , Canada and Japan .
The final text does not mention specific emissions targets , but does acknowledge that " deep cuts in global emissions will be required to achieve the ultimate objective " of avoiding dangerous climate change .
It also says that a delay in reducing emissions will make severe climate impacts more likely .
' Spirit of flexibility ' " This is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said Indonesian Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar , who served as conference president , at the conclusion of the talks .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he appreciated " the spirit of flexibility " shown by key delegations - and was aware that " there is divide of position between and among countries " .
The US was the principal focus of opposition from activists " But as this global warming is an issue which affects the whole humanity , whole planet earth , we must have co-ordinated and concerted efforts to address this issue , " Mr Ban said .
In London , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown declared : " This agreement is a vital step forward for the whole world .
" The Bali roadmap agreed today is just the first step .
Now begins the hardest work , as all nations work towards a deal in Copenhagen in 2009 to address the defining challenge of our time . "
Environmental groups and some delegates have criticised the draft as being weak and a missed opportunity .
" This deal is very disappointing , " said Tony Juniper of Friends of the Earth .
" We said we needed a roadmap , but this conference has failed to give us a clear destination . "
Emotional times
As talks overran their scheduled close by more than a day , delegates from the EU , US and G - 77 / China embarked with UN officials on a series of behind - the - scenes consultations aiming to break the remaining deadlock .
Bali deal :
At a glance The EU and US agreed to drop binding targets ; then the EU and China agreed to soften language on commitments from developing countries .
With delegates anxious to make a deal and catch aeroplanes home , the US delegation announced it could not support the amended text .
A chorus of boos rang out .
And a member of Papua New Guinea 's delegation told the US : " If you 're not willing to lead , please get out of the way . "
Shortly after , the US delegation announced it would support the revised text after all .
There were a number of emotional moments in the conference hall - the UN 's top climate official Yvo de Boer in tears after being accused by China of procedural irregularities , and cheers and hugs when the US indicated its acceptance .
On the road
The document coming out of the meeting , the " Bali roadmap " , contains text on emissions cuts , the transfer of clean technology to developing countries , halting deforestation and helping poorer nations protect their economies and societies against impacts of climate change such as rising sea levels and falling crop yields .
The roadmap sets the parameters and aims for a further set of negotiations to be finalised by the 2009 UN climate conference , to be held in Denmark .
By that stage , parties should have agreed on a comprehensive plan for curbing global warming and adapting to its impacts .
This will include : emissions targets for industrialised countries , possibly but not necessarily binding
some softer form of targets or ambitions for major developing countries
mechanisms for leveraging funds from carbon trading to fund adaptation projects Earlier , consensus was reached on the principle of rewarding poorer countries to protect their forests .
This is widely acknowledged as the cheapest single way of curbing climate change , and brings benefits in other environmental areas such as biodiversity and fresh water conservation .
Delegates agreed on a framework that could allow richer nations and companies to earn " carbon credits " by paying for forest protection in developing countries .
" We need to find a new mechanism that values standing forests , " said Andrew Mitchell , executive director of the Global Canopy Programme , an alliance of research institutions .
" Ultimately , if this does its job , [ deforestation ] goes down to nothing . "
Mr Mitchell said the only feasible source of sufficient funds was a global carbon market .
But many economists believe mandatory emissions targets are needed to create a meaningful global market .

What are these ?

Highlands and Islands reporter , BBC Scotland news website
The LHC is a vast and complicated feat of engineering Scotland has been playing a key role in an ambitious effort to reveal how the Universe works .
Built 100 m beneath the French - Swiss border , the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is due to start work later this year .
The LHC will recreate conditions moments after the Big Bang , by colliding particles at super - fast speeds .
Scientists from the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow are closely involved with the LHC .
But even Lewis on the Western Isles and the Cairngorms could boast links .
A myriad of experiments aimed at answering complex scientific questions and theories will be run during the collisions .
Among of the most important will be to find the most sought - after particle in physics .
It is an exciting time .
Either you will see the Higgs boson or frustratingly you do n't , but that will mean more questions and theories
Alan Walker
University of Edinburgh
The hypothetical Higgs boson , dubbed by some as the " God particle " , is fundamental to understanding the Universe but has yet to be detected .
It takes its name from Professor Peter Higgs , a retired University of Edinburgh scientist .
Following a weekend walking in the Cairngorms in 1964 , he returned to his laboratory and told colleagues he had just experienced his " one big idea " and now had an answer to the mystery of how matter in the Universe got its mass .
If LHC finds the Higgs boson , it could earn the Scottish scientist a nomination for the Nobel Prize .
Staff from the University of Edinburgh will be carrying out studies on matter and antimatter at two of the collider 's four detectors , but they will not be actively involved in the hunt for the Higgs boson .
However , their colleagues from Glasgow will be .
Alan Walker , of the Particle Physics Experiments Group at Edinburgh 's School of Physics , said it would be a win - win situation even if the Higgs boson was not found .
He said : " It is an exciting time .
Either you will see the Higgs boson or frustratingly you do n't , but that will mean more questions and theories . "
On the face of it , the brain - aching complexity of the LCH and what it has been built at huge costs to do offer little benefits to people outside the scientific community .
However , Scottish - based scientists involved said the technology that had to be invented for it could have wide - reaching impacts in the future .
Alison Bates , one of the University of Glasgow team involved Breakthroughs in physics have previously made possible the invention of MRI scanners .
The construction of the huge tunnel needed for the collider has also led to advances in civil engineering .
But Mr Walker said the gains in answering big questions should not be dismissed .
He said : " This is important to our culture .
" I do n't know how true if this story is , but on a visit to a particle collider President George Bush asked : ' What will this do for the defence of this country ? '
" The scientist said : ' It will make it worth defending ' . "
Dr Chris Parkes is among the University of Glasgow LHC team and regularly works from the European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) laboratory near Geneva .
With a mission to find out how the Universe works , Cern is responsible for the LHC .
It features in Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown 's detective novel Angels and Demons , in which a secret society bent on destroying the Vatican using an antimatter bomb .
In the story , the antimatter is stolen from Cern .
The Glasgow scientists are gearing up for detective investigations of their own and will help monitor the Atlas detector which in turn will assist in the search for the Higgs boson .
Dr Parkes said : " Atlas is the largest detector .
It is enormous , nothing like it has ever been built .
" The theory is that without the Higgs boson all particles would be without mass .
It is one final piece of the puzzle , the missing item that has never been discovered . "
The main reason most people come into this subject is curiosity
Dr Chris Parkes
University of Glasgow Another of the Glasgow team , Caitriana Nicholson , from Lewis on the Western Isles , worked on the Grid - a network of computer bases scattered all over the world but linked together to process the vast volume of data from the experiments .
She said : " I guess it is kind of pushing the boundaries of what has been done before .
" There are a whole lot of things people are just figuring out as they go along , one being how to handle security with people all over the world logging on to someone else 's computer to access the data . "
The Grid could eventually be put to use for medical research purposes .
And there is a precedent for Cern leading the way in IT .
In 1989 , computer consultant Tim Berners - Lee invented the World Wide Web while working there .
But like Mr Walker , Dr Parkes was keen to highlight the value to physics of the work that will be done at LHC .
He said : " The main reason most people come into this subject is curiosity .
" The LHC is important from the point of view of pushing knowledge of mankind forward and trying to find out what the Universe is made of and what its building blocks are . "

What are these ?
HILLSBORO --
The petite 24 - year - old Beaverton woman got out of the shower wrapped in a towel , stopped to watch a couple minutes of TV and then sat down on her bed .
While putting lotion on her legs , she realized a man was standing in her closet , staring at her with bright blue eyes .
He was wearing a lacy negligee with fishnet stockings open at the crotch , a woman 's miniskirt , sheer white blouse and long , brown wig .
For a second , time stood still .
The woman stared back .
The man hid his face in the crook of his arm .
Then she screamed twice , ran to another room and called police .
The man fled without saying a word , hurrying from the ground - floor apartment in the 15200 block of Southwest Teal Boulevard to his nearby van .
" She had no idea what was going on , what was going to happen , how much risk she was at , " prosecutor Gina Williamson Skinner said .
" But what she thought at that moment was that she was going to be raped .
" It is every woman 's greatest nightmare . "
Nine months later , Beaverton police arrested Eric Triton Kincaid , 29 , of Aloha after tracing DNA on a meth pipe the man left in the woman 's closet .
He was charged with two counts of first - degree burglary and one count each of attempted first - degree sexual abuse and invasion of personal privacy .
Last week , Kincaid sat in the witness chair , facing a jury of five women and seven men , ready to tell his side of the story , one laced with drug - induced demons .
He was high on methamphetamine , he said , and went to the Beaverton apartment complex on March 3 , 2007 because he was invited to have sex by a woman he barely knew .
But when he saw the woman sitting on the bed half naked , he realized she was the wrong woman and that he was in the wrong apartment .
Basically , he was as surprised as she was , he said .
Kincaid told jurors he is n't proud of his drug - induced behavior , but at the time he was having sex with a lot a people he did n't know .
That 's why he was dressed like he was , Kincaid said , and had a tube of sexual lubricant that he inadvertently left on a shelf in the woman 's bedroom closet .
Kincaid said the woman he was going to meet was staying with friends and gave him directions that neither of them were too sure about .
He arrived at what he thought was the right apartment , and when he turned the doorknob , it opened .
Kincaid said he heard the shower running and thought it was the woman who invited him .
He sat down on the bed , then decided to hide in the closet because he felt like somebody was watching him , that demons were after him .
When the apartment occupant came out of the shower , both she and Kincaid froze , public defender Ethan Levi described to jurors in his closing argument .
" They looked at each other like a couple of scared rabbits .
He was confused ; she testified he looked confused . "
Police tracked Kincaid down because his DNA was on file from a robbery conviction as a juvenile .
When officers arrested him in December , Kincaid immediately told them , " This was a complete accident , " Levi said .
The prosecutor told jurors it was more likely that Kincaid tried every basement apartment door until he found one that was unlocked .
Investigators could n't find the mysterious friend Kincaid knew only as " Kate , " Skinner noted .
Kincaid says he was only in the apartment a couple minutes at the most ; the woman said she was out of the shower for about 61/ 2 minutes before she realized a man was in her closet .
" It is the worst nightmare of a person , " Levi agreed .
" It 's an odd case , it 's not a case you see every day , it 's a weird case , " Levi told jurors .
" It 's a scary case to a lot of people .
But I do n't want you to be scared by the facts .
You have to make a decision about the specific intent in his mind . "
After nearly six hours of deliberations on Friday , the jury decided to believe Kincaid and found him not guilty of all charges .

The U.S. - led effort to choke off financing for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is foundering because setbacks at home and abroad have undermined the Bush administration ’s highly touted counter - terrorism weapon , according to current and former officials and independent experts .
In some cases , extremist groups have blunted financial anti-terrorism tools by finding new ways to raise , transfer and spend their money .
In other cases , the administration has stumbled over legal difficulties and interagency fighting , officials and experts say .
But the most serious problems are fractures and mistrust within the coalition of nations that the United States admits it needs to target financiers of terrorism and to stanch the flow of funding from wealthy donors to extremist causes .
“ The international cooperation and focus is dropping , the farther we get from 9/11 , ” said Michael Jacobson , who was a senior advisor in the Treasury Department ’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence until March 2007 .
“ Some countries lack political will .
Others just do n’t have the basic capacity to govern their countries , much less create a viable financial intelligence unit . ”

Many current and former officials and experts say that because of political , legal , cultural and technical problems , the administration - led coalition is deteriorating .
“ Al Qaeda , the Taliban and other terrorist groups continue to have access to the funds they need for active and expanded indoctrination , recruitment , maintenance , armament and operations , ” said Victor D. Comras , a former United Nations terrorism finance official .
Internationally , the sense of urgency over terrorism financing has waned since the 2001 attacks .
As political climates have changed and negative perceptions of the United States have risen , key allies are cooperating less , current and former officials say .
In the Middle East and elsewhere , many countries have resisted U.S. pressure to investigate and identify financiers .

Saudi Arabia , Pakistan and other key nations have not taken the necessary steps to crack down on terrorist financing or suspect money flowing across their borders .
Other countries , including Afghanistan and some African nations , lack the financial infrastructure to cooperate meaningfully .
Also , the most deadly terrorist attacks since Sept. 11 , 2001 , have cost so little -- often less than $ 10,000 -- that they are virtually impossible to detect by following a money trail .
Terrorist networks need larger sums to travel , train operatives , bribe government officials , evade capture and expand support bases .
Increasingly , however , they are moving funds below the radar of U.S. - led enforcement and intelligence - gathering efforts , officials and experts said .
Cash couriers use donkeys and camels in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan , for instance , and private jets are used in oil - rich Persian Gulf kingdoms to move cash , gold and jewels .
The networks continue to rely on a centuries - old informal banking system known as hawala , which leaves virtually no trail .
Advertisement
Overall , it is nearly impossible to distinguish funds meant for potential terrorism from legitimate transactions , said a senior State Department official , who , like some of the those interviewed , spoke on condition of anonymity because of prohibitions against commenting on the record on counter - terrorism .
Current and former U.S. officials acknowledge they are struggling , especially because much - needed allies are unwilling or unable to assist .
“ It ’s not as much that we ’re not properly executing our strategy , ” said Robert Grenier , a former senior CIA official .
“ It ’s that the strategy is of limited utility in countering terrorism financing given the mechanisms that terrorists use . ”

The effort begins
Thirteen days after the attacks on New York and the Pentagon , President Bush announced “ a major thrust of our war on terrorism . . . a strike on the financial foundation of the global terror network . ”
“ We will starve the terrorists of funding , turn them against each other , rout them out of their safe hiding places and bring them to justice , ” Bush said in a Rose Garden speech , flanked by his secretaries of Treasury and State .
Over the next six years , that effort stretched across the federal government , including the CIA , the FBI and the Justice and Homeland Security departments .
Advertisement
The administration also enlisted allies and international organizations such as the United Nations .
In the first years , scores of alleged terrorists and their financiers were identified , and their banks and associates were targeted by officials worldwide .
The intelligence - gathering helped catch several important Al Qaeda figures , including Hambali , Southeast Asia chieftain .
Stuart Levey , the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence , said in an interview last week that the campaign had deterred would - be financiers and helped uncover terrorism funding sources .
The intelligence - gathering has exerted serious financial stress on Al Qaeda networks , Levey said .
As a result of Treasury and U.N. efforts , terrorists have been forced out of the international banking system and into riskier ventures that could ultimately trip them up , Levey said .
Advertisement
“ I ’m generally very pleased with the overall counter - terrorist financing enterprise , especially with the worldwide pressure we have put on Al Qaeda , ” he said .
“ No doubt , there are problems we have n’t solved , but we continue to treat them with the urgency they deserve . ”
Levey , who has made 75 foreign trips since 2004 , is widely credited for enlisting help from many governments .
But like other current and former officials at Treasury and elsewhere , Levey acknowledged that significant challenges remain , especially on the international front .
A January report by the Paris - based Financial Action Task Force said that the international effort has had only limited success in detecting terrorism financing activities .
The United States and other participating countries must reexamine how terrorists raise and move money and devise techniques to combat them , said the task force , an international body that sets standards for fighting money - laundering and terrorist financing .
Last June , the Defense Department issued its first report on financial counter - terrorism , and found many shortcomings first cited by a 2002 independent task force of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Both recommended establishment of a czar or agency to coordinate all U.S. agencies and report directly to the White House .
Both also called for a U.S. - led international organization dedicated to investigating terrorist financing .

“ To be successful , the U.S. must address the problem . . . under the guidance and leadership of one overarching organization , ” said the report by the Pentagon ’s School of Advanced Military Studies at Ft. Leavenworth , Kan .
In the absence of such reforms , many say , the U.S. agencies involved remain mired in infighting over who should lead the effort .
“ There is not a lot of talking , ” said one recently departed senior Treasury official .
“ There is a lot of elbowing . . . and there is n’t any cooperation . ”
Levey and other agency representatives dispute that characterization .
But the Government Accountability Office and other watchdog organizations have reached similar conclusions , regarding domestic and international issues .

Bush ’s vow ‘ oversold ’
Some experts said that the financial war on terrorism simply can’t deliver on what the Bush administration promised .
“ It ’s been way oversold , ” said Grenier , who heads global security consulting for Kroll , a company that advises governments .
Grenier , who retired from the CIA in 2006 after 27 years , most recently as director of the agency ’s Counterterrorism Center , said the government had exaggerated the successes of financial enforcement while downplaying obstacles : “ There ’s been a lot of work done on it , a lot of focus .
But as a method for identifying and capturing terrorists , it has not been significant . ”

The results of the campaign are difficult to quantify .
But in recent years , few terrorist financiers of significance have been arrested .
Al Qaeda ’s resurgence in the tribal belt of Pakistan and elsewhere in the world has been fueled by various methods of financing and moving money .
Immediately after Sept. 11 , the Treasury Department began freezing the assets of many individuals and entities with suspected links to Al Qaeda , the Taliban and affiliates , barring them from doing business in the United States .
Advertisement
In many cases , the United Nations issued its own financial blocking orders , which require member states to enforce them in an attempt to deny terrorists access to the international financial system .
But in recent years , U.S. and U.N. designations have slowed to a trickle , records show .
Last year , only nine individuals accused of Al Qaeda - related activities were designated by Treasury .
And some of those designations describe older acts that occurred as far back as the mid-1990s , mostly by low - level operatives .
Moreover , even when blocking orders are issued by U.N. officials , giving an international stamp to U.S. efforts , many countries are unable or reluctant to act .
Despite hesitance to criticize a key U.S. ally , many current and former officials said that vast contributions from Saudi Arabia and other wealthy gulf donors have continued .
Advertisement
Saudi Arabia has promised since 2003 to enact major financial reforms , but has yet to implement many of them , several senior U.S. officials said .
The Saudis have not established an accredited financial intelligence unit to detect suspicious transactions or an oversight group to prevent donations to extremist causes , current and former officials said .
Other countries lack even the most basic financial infrastructure to participate .
One African government official told a visiting counter - terrorism delegation that his nation had not disseminated U.N. - mandated blocking orders for hundreds of suspected Al Qaeda operatives and entities because its various agencies lacked Internet connectivity .
Asked why the government had n’t distributed printed copies , he said his office was allowed only one printer cartridge a month and did n’t want to waste it .
“ When you hear problems like that , you almost want to give up , ” said one former U.S. counter - terrorism official .

“ We ’re spending billions of dollars , and a toner cartridge can affect whether a whole country implements the list . ”

The Kormoran was disguised as a Dutch merchant ship
An Australian team searching for a lost World War II cruiser have located the wreck of the German merchant raider that sank it .
HMAS Sydney went down off the west coast of Australia in November 1941 after being attacked by DKM Kormoran .
The Sydney was the largest vessel from any country to have been lost with no survivors during the war .
By finding the Kormoran , the team is " halfway to solving where the Sydney is , " project leader Ted Graham said .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said : " We are one step closer as a nation to hopefully finding Sydney . "
The Australian government has given A$ 4 m ( £ 1.9 m ; 2.5 m euros ) to the search team - the Finding Sydney Foundation - to fund their efforts to locate the cruiser .
' Major mystery '
The Sydney was sailing back to Australia from Sumatra on 19 November 1941 when the Kormoran - disguised as a Dutch merchant vessel - launched its attack .
Both ships sank as a result of the battle .
All 645 of those on board the Sydney were lost , but 317 of the Kormoran 's 397 - strong crew managed to escape by rowing to the Australian coast , where they became prisoners of war .
The loss of the Sydney was described by Australian Navy chief Vice - Adm Russ Shalders as " Australia 's major maritime mystery " .
The team found the wreck of the Kormoran amid a large field of debris , some of which could be pieces of the Sydney itself .
They will now use a remote - controlled vehicle to search the wreck and look for clues as to the Sydney 's whereabouts .
Overexpressing a protein involved in the uptake of fat in muscle of mice can improve their tolerance to cold temperatures , researchers find in a new study that showcases the over - looked role muscle may play in the cold response .
When temperatures drop , mammals respond by generating heat ( thermogenesis ) , through mechanisms like shivering and breaking down ‘ brown fat ’ ( high energy fat cells that are especially prominent in newborns and hibernating animals ) .
Considering that muscle accounts for over one - third of body mass and muscle activity regulates fat metabolism , Dalan Jensen and colleagues found that increasing the muscle ’s ability to use fat for energy had a profound impact on its contribution to thermogenesis .
LPL - overexpressing mice ( right ) produce more fat - burning type IIa muscle fibers ( in green ) than their normal counterparts ( left ) ; type IIb fibers ( in red ) predominantly use sugar for energy .
Credit : Journal of Lipid Research
They generated mice overexpressing lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) , an enzyme that extracts fat from the blood so that it can be used to produce energy instead of sugar .
They placed LPL mice in a chamber set to 4 °C ( 39 °F ) and found that they were far more cold tolerant than regular mice ; LPL mice could withstand 4 °C for several hours and still maintain normal body temperatures .
This tolerance came from LPL ’s ability to increase the muscle ’s ability to oxidize fat , which allow LPL mice to produce more heat than regular animals without increasing their physical activity .
Interestingly , this enhanced muscular thermogenesis is akin to how birds – which lack brown fat — produce heat and suggests that mammals , too , have multiple avenues to try and stay warm .

Mr Zapatero 's cabinet boasts more women than men
Spain's Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has unveiled his new cabinet , which for the first time includes more women than men .
The former housing minister , Carme Chacon , one of the rising stars of Spain 's Socialist party , becomes its first ever female defence minister .
While there are five new faces overall , several key members of his last cabinet remain in place .
Mr Zapatero's Socialist party won re-election last month .
" I feel very proud that there are more women ministers than men , " Mr Zapatero said , after being sworn in by King Juan Carlos .
Slumping economy
Nine of the ministers are women , and eight are men ; when the prime minister is included , the cabinet is equally divided by gender .
Spain 's prime minister is once again without a majority mandate
Although Mr Zapatero opted for continuity in several key portfolios - including foreign affairs , the economy and the interior - he also created an equality ministry , headed by a woman , Bibiana Aido , 31 .
At his inaugural news conference , Mr Zapatero said she was the youngest minister Spain had had .
Mr Zapatero also reappointed Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega , a mainstay of his previous government , as deputy prime minister .
Lawmakers had approved his reappointment as government leader on Friday , formally handing him the challenges of a slumping economy and resurgent Basque militants .
He also will have to continue to govern without an absolute majority in parliament .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President and Mrs. George W. Bush reported taxable income of $ 719 , 274 for the tax year 2007 and paid $ 221,635 in federal income taxes , the White House said Friday .
The White House opened the door to Bush not attending the Olympic opening ceremonies this summer .
They contributed a total of $ 165,660 to churches and charitable organizations .
Some of the donations went to the following : the Crawford , Texas , Volunteer Fire Department , Susan G. Komen for the Cure , Malaria No More Fund , Martha 's Table and a St. John 's Church , most likely St. John 's Episcopal Church in the District of Columbia , where the Bushes sometimes attend services .
Vice President Cheney and his wife earned $ 2,528,068 , the White House said , and owe taxes of $ 602,651 .
The Cheneys paid $ 466,165 in taxes through withholding and estimated tax payments , and will pay the remaining $ 136,486 upon filing their tax return .
Bush 's income included salary earned as president and investment income from the trusts in which his and his wife 's assets are held .
The tax return also reports a $ 150,000 advance received by Laura Bush for the children 's book she co-authored with daughter Jenna .
Laura Bush donated all net proceeds from the advance to Teach for America and the New Teacher Project , the White House statement said .
Cheney 's income included his government salary of $ 212 , 208 and a pension of $ 32,500 from Union Pacific Corporation , of which he is a former director .
His wife , Lynne , earned a salary from the American Enterprise Institute , a think - tank , and reported book royalty income and a pension of $ 32,000 from Reader 's Digest , of which she formerly was a director .
She listed her occupation as " writer . "
Cheney listed his as " vice president . "
The Cheneys donated $ 166,547 to charity last year , the White House said , bringing their total charitable contributions during his vice presidency to just under $ 8 million .

Certain aspects of human life are simultaneously private and universal -- everyone experiences the same stuff privately and almost no one talks about it .
Pretty much everything that happens in the bathroom falls into this category , which is why I was amazed to discover that serious thought has gone into the challenges presented by toilet paper .
Here are a few examples .
The Toilet Paper Algorithm
Design guru Don Norman decided to confront a common toilet paper crisis : the problem of the roll running out just when you need it most .
When remodeling his home , Norman installed a dual - roll toilet paper dispenser , under the theory that there 'd always be a second roll available for just such emergencies .
But he quickly found that , for some reason , both rolls seemed to run out at the same time !
Norman applied some logical thinking to his problem , resulting in the article Toilet Paper Algorithms : I did n't know you had to be a computer scientist to use toilet paper .
The gist of it is that Norman and his wife were subconsciously selecting whatever roll was larger at any given time , leading them both to become roughly the same size , thus running out at the same time .
( Read the article for more details on the various available toilet paper algorithms ... it 's neat . )
For the record , Norman determined that the optimal strategy for using toilet paper in a dual - roll holder is to always use the smaller roll .
This will tend to drive one roll to become empty , but will leave a full roll available .
Norman is n't alone in his analysis of toilet paper roll consumption -- Donald E. Knuth published a mathematics paper entitled The Toilet Paper Problem in The American Mathematical Monthly in 1984 , including equations for analysis of toilet paper usage .
The Fold Versus Crumple Debate
I 'll try to put this as delicately as I can .
Apparently there 's a significant debate about whether it's better to fold several sheets of paper , or crumple them together in a bunch .
One major argument in favor of the " fold " method is that depending on the quality of your paper and your folding technique , you can refold ( and thus reuse ) a single set of sheets .
The counter - argument is that this is super - gross .
I have my own opinions on this issue , but let 's just say I 've tried multiple methodologies over the years and feel that I 've perfected my technique .
So what 's the distribution of crumplers versus folders in the wild ?
An online toilet paper usage survey has received almost 5,000 responses .
At the moment , the folders are slightly in the lead ( 52 % ) , but tend to be a little older than crumplers .
Also , far more crumplers are male than female ( 70 % of crumplers in the survey are male ) .
You can take the survey or just hit the ' View ' button to see the results without contributing your own .
Toilet Paper Requisition Denied
Here 's some fun WWII trivia .
Lieutenant Commander J. W. Coe of the submarine USS Skipjack requested 150 rolls of toilet paper from the supply officer at Mare Island Naval Base in July of 1941 .
The request was denied in November of 1941 with a notation saying , " Cancelled -- cannot identify . "
By June 1942 the situation onboard USS Skipjack was dire , and Coe sent another request , reading in part :
During the 11 - 3/4 months elapsing from the time of ordering the toilet paper and the present date , USS SKIPJACK personnel , despite their best efforts to await delivery of the subject material , have been unable to wait on numerous occasions , and the situation is now quite acute , particularly during depth - charge attacks by the " back stabbers . " ... SKIPJACK personnel during this period have become accustomed to the use of " crests , " i.e. , the vast amount of incoming non-essential paper work , and in so doing feel that the wish of the Bureau of Ships for reduction of paper work is being complied with , thus killing two birds with one stone .

WASHINGTON .
Sept. 15 — A rally on Saturday to protest the war in Iraq , which began with a peaceful march of several thousand people to the Capitol , ended with dozens of arrests in a raucous demonstration that evoked the angry spirit of the Vietnam era protests of more than three decades ago .
The police , including some officers dressed in riot gear , tried to halt demonstrators as they sought to climb over a low wall near the Capitol after a march that had begun near the White House in a festive atmosphere .
The protest grew tense as the chanting , placard - carrying demonstrators gathered near the Capitol for a planned “ die-in . ”
Officers struggled to keep demonstrators from breaking through their ranks and began arresting those who tried .
Demonstrators were pushed to the ground , placed in plastic handcuffs and led away to the Capitol .
Sgt. Kimberly Schneider , a spokeswoman for the Capitol Police , said that the authorities had arrested 189 people and that they would be charged with illegally crossing a police line .
Two protesters and two police officers received minor injuries , Sergeant Schneider said .
This is part three of the text of a talk delivered to the Yale Computer Science department on November 28 .
Part one and part two already appeared .
I despaired of finding a company to work for where programmers were treated like talent and not like typists , and decided I would have to start my own .
In those days , I was seeing lots of really dumb people with really dumb business plans making internet companies , and I thought , hey , if I can be , say , 10 % less dumb than them , that should be easy , maybe I can make a company too , and in my company , we ’d do things right for a change .
We ’d treat programmers with respect , we ’d make high quality products , we would n’t take any shit from VCs or 24 - year - olds playing President , we ’d care about our customers and solve their problems when they called , instead of blaming everything on Microsoft , and we ’d let our customers decide whether or not to pay us .
At Fog Creek we ’ll give anyone their money back with no questions asked under any circumstances whatsoever .
Keeps us honest .
So , it was the summer of 2000 , and I had taken some time off from work while I hatched the plans for Fog Creek Software and went to the beach a lot .
During that period I started writing up some of the things I had learned over the course of my career on a website called Joel on Software .
In those early days before blogs were invented , a programmer named Dave Winer had set up a system called EditThisPage.com where anyone could post things to the web in a sort - of blog like format .
Joel on Software grew quickly and gave me a pulpit where I could write about software development and actually get some people to pay attention to what I was saying .
The site consists of fairly unoriginal thoughts , combined with jokes .
It was successful because I used a slightly larger font than the average website , making it easy to read .
It ’s always hard to figure out how many people read the site , especially when you do n’t bother counting them , but typical articles on that site get read by somewhere between 100,000 and a million people , depending on how popular the topic is .
What I do on Joel on Software — writing articles about somewhat technical topics — is something I learned here in the CS department , too .
Here ’s the story behind that .
In 1989 Yale was pretty good at AI , and one of the big name professors , Roger Schank , came and gave a little talk at Hillel about some of his AI theories about scripts and schemas and slots and all that kind of stuff .
Now essentially , I suspect from reading his work that it was the same speech he ’d been giving for twenty years , and he had spent twenty years of his career writing little programs using these theories , presumably to test them , and they did n’t work , but somehow the theories never got discarded .
He did seem like a brilliant man , and I wanted to take a course with him , but he was well known for hating undergraduates , so the only option was to take this course called Algorithmic Thinking — CS115 — basically , a watered - down gut group IV class designed for poets .
It was technically in the CS department , but the faculty was so completely unimpressed that you were not allowed to count it towards a CS major .
Although it was the largest class by enrollment in the CS department , I cringed every time I heard my history - major friends referring to the class as “ computer science . ”
A typical assignment was to write an essay on whether machines can think or not .
You can see why we were n’t allowed to count it towards a CS degree .
In fact , I would not be entirely surprised if you revoke my degree today , retroactively , upon learning that I took this class .
The best thing about Algorithmic Thinking was that you had to write a lot .
There were 13 papers — one every week .
You did n’t get grades .
Well , you did .
Well , ok , there ’s a story there .
One of the reasons Schank hated undergrads so much was that they were obsessed with grades .
He wanted to talk about whether computers could think and all undergrads wanted to talk about was why their paper got a B instead of an A .
At the beginning of the term , he made a big speech about how grades are evil , and decided that the only grade you could get on a paper was a little check mark to signify that some grad student read it .
Over time , he wanted to recognize the really good papers , so he added check - PLUS , and then there were some really lame papers , so he started giving out check - minuses , and I think I got a check - plus - plus once .
But grades : never .
And despite the fact that CS115 did n’t count towards the major , all this experience writing about slightly technical topics turned out to be the most useful thing I got out of the CS department .
Being able to write clearly on technical topics is the difference between being a grunt individual contributor programmer and being a leader .
My first job at Microsoft was as a program manager on the Excel team , writing the technical specification for this huge programming system called Visual Basic for Applications .
This document was something like 500 pages long , and every morning literally hundreds of people came into work and read my spec to figure out what to do next .
That included programmers , testers , marketing people , documentation writers , and localizers around the world .
I noticed that the really good program managers at Microsoft were the ones who could write really well .
Microsoft flipped its corporate strategy 180 degrees based on a single compelling email that Steve Sinofsky wrote called Cornell is Wired .
The people who get to decide the terms of the debate are the ones who can write .
The C programming language took over because The C Programming Language was such a great book .
So anyway , those were the highlights of CS .
CS 115 , in which I learned to write , one lecture in Dynamic Logic , in which I learned not to go to graduate school , and CS 322 , in which I learned the rites and rituals of the Unix church and had a good time writing a lot of code .
The main thing you do n’t learn with a CS degree is how to develop software , although you will probably build up certain muscles in your brain that may help you later if you decide that developing software is what you want to do .
The other thing you can do , if you want to learn how to develop software , is send your resume to jobs@fogcreek.com , and apply for a summer internship , and we ’ll teach you a thing or two about the subject .
Thank you very much for your time .
Watching George W. Bush address the New York financial community Friday brought back many memories .
Unfortunately , they were about his speech right after Hurricane Katrina , the one when he said : “ America will be a stronger place for it . ”
“ You ’ve helped make our country really in many ways the economic envy of the world , ” he told the Economic Club of New York .
You could almost see the thought - bubble forming over the audience :
Not this week , kiddo .
The president squinched his face and bit his lip and seemed too antsy to stand still .
As he searched for the name of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia ( “ the king , uh , the king of Saudi ” ) and made guy - fun of one of the questioners ( “ Who picked Gigot ? ” ) , you had to wonder what the international financial community makes of a country whose president could show up to talk economics in the middle of a liquidity crisis and kind of flop around the stage as if he was emcee at the Iowa Republican Pig Roast .
We ’re really past expecting anything much , but in times of crisis you would like to at least believe your leader has the capacity to pretend he ’s in control .
Suddenly , I recalled a day long ago when my husband worked for a struggling paper full of worried employees and the publisher walked into the newsroom wearing a gorilla suit .
Health is More Important than Wealth
Have you noticed that people without health or wealth only wish for better health , however people with health only wish for wealth ?
I believe this is because health is often taken for granted .
Only when someone has become serious ill do people realize the true importance of their health and the health of their friends and family .
This is why my new motto for the year is :
Health >
Wealth
To better illustrate my point , think about this .
People who are ill are also unhappy .
However , people who are not wealthy are not necessarily unhappy .
Even extremely poor people can be happy , yet extremely unhealthy are seldom happy .
Thus , it stands to reason that health leads to happiness much more than wealth .
Therefore , health is more important than wealth .

Comcast has taken a lot of crap from everyone from the FCC to consumers , and they 've been listening .
In fact , they 've decided to stop all the fussin ' and the fuedin ' and actually team up with BitTorrent for the sake of net neutrality .
But of course , dear readers , there 's a catch .
There 's always a catch .

First , the good news : Comcast and BitTorrent are joining forces to " run BitTorrent 's technology more smoothly on Comcast 's broadband network , and allow Comcast to transport video files more effectively over its own network in the future . "
Yes , Comcast is going to embrace net neutrality completely by the end of the year , allowing all sites and programs equal access to bandwidth .
Hey , that 's a change of policy , right ?
Ca n't complain about that .
That does n't mean Comcast is now the ISP of choice for heavy BT users , however .

Comcast CTO
Tony Warner says that " Rather than slow traffic by certain types of applications - such as file - sharing software or companies like BitTorrent - Comcast will slow traffic for those users who consume the most bandwidth . "
So feel free to use BitTorrent , just do n't use it too much or your speeds will dip down to nothing .
This will probably lead to the end of all - you - can - eat broadband plans and force heavy downloaders to pay extra for all their bandwidth in the near future .
But hey , at least everything is on the level now , right ?
At least we think so .

Navigating the Collapse of Civilization : a Spiritual Map
by Carolyn Baker , Ph.D
Civilization is a mental / material world of culturally transmitted illusion .
- William Kötke
Recently , I seem to have been bombarded from every direction with the theme of collapse .
Whether in the writings of Mike Ruppert , Richard Heinberg , William Kötke , Jason Godesky , James Howard Kunstler , or Jared Diamond , the theme of collapse keeps reverberating , unsettling me , relentlessly reminding me that the demise of human civilization is in process and will not go away .
As I share my awareness of collapse with others , I meet a variety of responses .
Many , especially those folks in academia , and the history profession in particular , view the idea of collapse with bemused scorn , asserting that while civilization might appear to be collapsing , current events are not really new and are merely variations on prior historical occurrences .
At the opposite end of the spectrum , fundamentalist Christians read current events through the tea leaves of biblical prophecies — some putting their own and the planet 's life on hold as they await “ the rapture ” — and still others , like the LaHaye - Jenkins crowd , bankroll millions from the profits of their “ end times ” prognostications .
But in the spirit of one of the wisest teachers of all time , psychologist Carl Jung , I find bone - marrow truth , not in the cerebral disengagement of academia nor in the apocalyptic madness of literal interpretations of the Book of Revelation , but somewhere in the middle , holding , as Jung would say , the “ tension of the opposites . ”
In holding that tension , Jung taught , lies the potential for transforming our inner and outer worlds .
For most Americans marinated in materialism , heads anchored firmly in the sand , never having heard the words “ Peak Oil , ” still driving their gas - gulping SUVs , reveling in suburban sprawl , and gullibly counting on their pensions and 401Ks to be there when they need them , the notion of civilization 's collapse is ludicrous and merely the latest obsession of the lunatic fringe .
For other Americans of the rapidly - vanishing middle class who are only one paycheck or one catastrophic illness away from financial oblivion — who between mortgage , car payments , monthly bills , medical expenses , gas prices , and doubling monthly credit card bills , realize that not only will they not be able to pay for their kids ’ college education but that every day they are now walking over an economic tightrope across a gaping precipice with a thousand - foot drop .
Those folks know in their bones the reality of collapse — they feel it , smell it , taste it , but may not yet be able to allow the words to pass from their lips .
Others , such as the individuals I 've named above , are the prophets and John the Baptists of our time who get in our faces and scream “ Repent ! ” or in less biblical language : “ Wake the hell up ! ”
For the first and second group of Americans , collapse is very bad news .
It will mean the end of lifestyles they cannot imagine living without .
They have become their lifestyle , and in its absence , they believe they will have no identity — that literally , they will cease to exist .
For these folks , collapse will be extremely painful , and worse .
Since they have isolated themselves in their hermetically - sealed suburban “ dormitories , ” they are not likely to survive unless they are willing to radically alter their behavior , and by the time they are , if they are , it may be far too late to do so .
Unquestionably , collapse will be brutal and agonizing .
It is , in fact , the cessation of life based on fossil fuels .
It will be physically , economically , emotionally , and spiritually excruciating .
It will test human beings , particularly those individuals who are not members of the ruling elite but who enjoy privileged , comfortable lifestyles devoid of sacrifice and inconvenience , beyond anything they could imagine in their worst nightmares .
Some will endure ; others will perish ; in fact , some experts speculate that at least one - third of humans on planet Earth will not survive .
Whether collapse occurs slowly or quickly , it will be torturous .
Collapse is a form of death , and Americans do not like the word “ death . ”
We go to extraordinary lengths to dress it up , pretty - fy it , deny it , and as my favorite of all meaningless anti-death clichés goes , “ put it behind us . ”
Like banshees , we drive ourselves heroically in the first half of life as if there were no death .
It will engulf others but not us .
We are the “ exception , ” and whether as individual Americans or as a nation , we are addicted to our exceptionalism — others will die ; not us .
Other civilizations will collapse ; not ours .
Yet it was Jung who said that , “ There is a great obligation laid upon the American people — that it shall face itself — that it shall admit its moment of tragedy in the present — admit that it has a great future only if it has the courage to face itself . ”
( Report on America , International Psychoanalytic Congress , Nuremberg , 1910 ) America the nation is not likely to “ face itself , ” but as individual Americans , we must , if we intend to successfully navigate collapse .
I too resist collapse , but at the same time that I resist it for similar or different reasons from those around me , I am also consciously working to embrace it .
To embrace something or someone is not necessarily to throw one 's arms wildly around that event or person , but to slowly , intentionally open to the gifts inherent in what we most dread .
I do not say this lightly .
I am a survivor of breast cancer .
My world “ collapsed ” twelve years ago when I was diagnosed with it .
But as is frequently the case , my world was also transformed by a terminal illness , and I became a different person as a result of it .
As the Buddhist teacher , Pema Chödrön writes , “ Openness does n't come from resisting our fears , but from getting to know them well . ” ( Comfortable With Uncertainty , P. 47 )
So what might be some of the gifts of collapse ?
First , collapse strips us of who we think we are so that who we really are may be revealed .
Civilization 's toxicity has fostered the illusion that one is , for example , a professional person with money in the bank , a secure mortgage , a good credit rating , a healthy body and mind , raising healthy children who will grow up to become successful like oneself , and that when one retires , one will be well - taken - care of .
If that has become your identity , and if you do n't look deeper , you wo n't discover who you really are ; and when collapse happens , you will be shattered because you have failed to notice the strengths , resources , and gifts that abide in your essence which transcend and supersede your ego-identity .
In a post - collapse world , academic degrees and stock portfolios matter little .
The real question , as Richard Heinberg so succinctly puts it is :
Do you know how to make shoes ?
Just ask Mike Ruppert , Catherine Austin Fitts , Celerino Castillo , or countless others who have had everything stripped away as a result of speaking truth to power .
One day they were “ solid citizens ” with sterling careers ; the next day , they were “ enemies of the state ” fearing for their very lives .
We can learn much from their journeys about preparing for life after collapse .
One way to prepare is to explore the issue of identity apart from one 's social roles .
For me , a spiritual path has been crucial in assessing who I am apart from what I do .
Secondly , collapse will decimate our anti-tribal , individualistic , Anglo - American programming by forcing us to join with others for survival .
You may own a home outright with ample acreage on which you have produced a stunning organic garden , have a ten - year cache of food and water , drive a hybrid car , and live a completely solarized life , but if you think you will survive in isolation , you are tragically deluded .
Collapse dictates that we will depend on each other , or we will die .
I have been an activist for over thirty years .
Without exception , every time I have been involved with other activists in promoting change , personalities clash , egos become bruised , people tantrum , become disillusioned , and walk away from the group .
We all seem to have Ph.D. ’s in “ self - sufficiency ” but remain tragically ignorant of genuine cooperation .
We will transform this pattern as civilization collapses , or we will perish , and the process of that transformation probably wo n't be a pretty picture .
However , we can begin preparing in present time for the collective thinking and action that collapse will necessitate by , for example , starting “ Solari Investor Circles ” , which join small groups of people together to research the resources in their community and how they can use those to prepare for the consequences of Peak Oil .
A particularly useful tool in the Solari model is the concept of “ Coming Clean ” by Catherine Austin Fitts , which offers individual and group guidelines for working harmoniously to transform our communities from the inside out .
Not only will we be compelled to relate differently to humans , but to all beings in the non -human world as well .
Only as we begin to read the survival manuals that trees , stars , insects , and birds have written for us , will our species be spared .
The very “ pests ” that we resent as unhygienic or annoying may , in fact , save our lives .
Moreover , collapse may bring meaning and purpose to our lives which might otherwise have eluded us .
In our linear , progress - based existence , we rarely contemplate words like “ purpose . ”
With civilization 's collapse , we may be forced to evaluate daily , perhaps moment to moment , why we are here , if we want to remain here , if life is worth living , if there is something greater than ourselves for which we are willing to remain alive and to which we choose to contribute energy .
These decisions probably will not be made in the cozy comfort of our homes , but in the streets , the fields , the deserts , the forests , and beside forgotten rivers and trails .
Purpose will rapidly cease being about what we can accomplish and will increasingly become more about who we are .
In a collapsing world , the so - called “ purpose - driven life ” will no longer exist .
Humans will be “ driven ” by only one issue : the determination to survive and assist loved ones in surviving .
From that quest for survival will emerge authentic purpose , which will undoubtedly not resemble anything we can imagine today .
Lest the reader infer that I 'm portraying collapse as some exercise in airy - fairy spirituality devoid of practicalities , I hasten to add that collapse will require humans to attend to the most pragmatic realities of existence — food , water , shelter , health care , and a host of other survival issues .
As centralized systems such as federal , state , and local governments are eviscerated , communities will be compelled to unite in order to solve these issues — to grow gardens , make clothing and other items , create community currencies , and rebuild infrastructures on an intensely local level .
The quality of spirituality that may emerge from attending to such fundamentals may be a genuine “ fundamentalism ” in the truest sense of the word .
In a post - collapse world , “ fundamental ” spirituality will be about caring for the basic needs of loved ones , becoming nurturing stewards of the ecosystems in whatever condition they may be at that time , noticing what one now values as opposed to what was most important prior to collapse — seeing , hearing , smelling , tasting , feeling all aspects of existence to which we were oblivious , or only mildly attentive , before the distractions were stripped away .
Certainly , this is not likely to be the comfortable , privileged , indulgent spirituality of the New Age workshop circuit , but may more closely resemble the earth - based honoring of the sacred that our tribal ancestors so dearly revered .
Spiritually , we can now begin preparing for the collapse of civilization as we have known it by opening ourselves each day to the “ lesser collapses ” of civilization that we see around us , such as the loss of a viable , uncorrupted electoral process , the demise of centralized systems , the decay of infrastructure , and the deterioration of institutions such as education , religion , health care , and the legal system .
Human beings have had several thousand years to create functional societies , and in many cases , they have .
Those civilizations have also collapsed because all civilizations ultimately do .
The United States has had 230 years to fashion a sustainable nation .
With the death of Abraham Lincoln at the end of the Civil War , corporations and centralized systems triumphed in controlling every aspect of American life , and they have been doing so until the present moment .
Thus , not surprisingly , in the 1970s when corporate America knew very well that U.S. oil production had peaked and that within three decades , the nation and the world would be confronting a catastrophic energy crisis , it did absolutely nothing , choosing rather to wallow in the profits of hydrocarbon energy and suppress alternative technology rather than assist the nation in building lifeboats .
For millennia , many indigenous people have described the demise of civilization we are now witnessing as a purification process — a time of rebirth and transformation .
Their ancient wisdom challenges us to face with equanimity the collapse that is in process ; that is , to hold as much as humanly possible in our hearts and minds , the reality of the pain the collapse will entail , alongside the unimaginable opportunities it offers .
As Pema Chödrön would say , “ Get to know collapse well . ”
Some people tell me that they would rather not know what 's going on because they prefer to live their lives from day to day doing the best they can to make a better world , enjoy their loved ones , and earn their bread .
I certainly understand their desire to protect themselves from the pain of awareness , but I also know that they are exchanging long - term preparedness for temporary comfort and that the pain of awareness in present time is far less than the pain they will incur as a result of ignoring it .
I do not claim to be an expert on collapse or spirituality , but I leave you now with these words from wise women and men who are :
O nly with this kind of equanimity can we realize that no matter what comes along , we 're always standing in the middle of sacred space .
Only with equanimity can we see that everything that comes into our circle has come to teach us what we need to know .
- Pema Chödrön
We are clearly destroying ourselves .
And yet , in this act of self - destruction , something is being revealed to us .
From this point of view , the endless self - destruction that we are perpetrating on each other is the atemporal footprint of this revelation , expressed in symbolic form , projected in time , as it is the medium through which we can recognize what is being revealed .
- Paul Levy , Spiritually Informed Political Activism
It is a scary time to be alive , but it is a wonderful time to be alive .
It is good to know that there is so much accumulated intelligence and compassion among us .
- Richard Heinberg , Beyond The Peak
Never underestimate the power of compassionately recognizing what 's going on .

Fortunately for Mr. Thomas , his mother was flipping through his mail last August and noticed the envelope , which could easily have been mistaken for junk .
It contained an equally flimsy letter , possibly mimeographed , informing Mr. Thomas that he was the proud winner of a relatively obscure government - subsidized housing lottery to which he had applied four years earlier .
The letter from Maxwell - Kates , which manages the building , did n’t exactly sound like Ed McMahon celebrating the sweepstakes  it warned him he ’d have to be approved , file forms and so on  but Mr. Thomas knew he was on the brink of victory .
Sure enough , by December , he was the proud owner of a studio apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan .
With a little help from family , Mr. Thomas , who ’s been working as a teacher in a Manhattan private school , had saved just enough to buy it outright : $ 14,000 cash .
His monthly maintenance is a whopping $ 295 .
For Virginia
Woolf , creative freedom arrived when her aunt , out for some fresh air in Bombay , fell off a horse and left her niece an annual income “ forever , ” as Woolf writes with gratitude in “ A Room of One ’s Own . ”
For Matthew Thomas , that precious freedom arrived when the faceless bureaucracy of New York ’s Mitchell - Lama Housing Program churned out his name , guaranteeing him not just any room of his own , but a miraculously inexpensive room he could have , if he liked , forever .
What some of his East Side neighbors might pay for a two - week rental in Southampton , he paid for a lifetime ’s worth of liberation .
“ I feel less whipped by the demon of fear that I have to get my novel done overnight in order to make life possible , ” said Mr. Thomas , surrounded by the last of the boxes of the books he ’d brought to the studio on 88th Street between Second and Third Avenues .
Olympic flame arrives in S.F. under tight security

The Olympic flame arrived in San Francisco from Paris early today under cover of darkness amid security typically reserved for head - of - state visits .
No protesters were evident at San Francisco International Airport , which was largely deserted except for a heavy police and media presence when the jet carrying the flame touched down about 3:40 a.m .
A contingent of prominent San Franciscans , including City Administrator Ed Lee and business consultant Rose Pak , and Bay Area Olympic athletes welcomed Chinese Olympic officials bearing the flame in a rectangular gilt and crystal lantern at Gate 94 .
" I was giggling like a teenager , " Pak said .
" I felt immense pride and excitement . "
The arriving Olympic officials got off the specially modified Airbus A330 jet designated " Air China 2008 , " paused briefly for photographs , went through customs and left the airport through a side entrance .
They were then whisked into the city , where the torch will remain overnight in an undisclosed location before Wednesday 's scheduled 6 - mile torch run along the central waterfront and around Fisherman 's Wharf .
The flame was flown from Paris , where chaotic protests Monday prompted officials to extinguish torches several times and carry the flame for part of the relay on a bus .
San Francisco officials say they monitored those protests , and similar incidents at the torch relay Sunday in London , and are hopeful Wednesday 's events will run smoothly .
San Francisco is the only North American stop for the Olympic flame , and activists upset with a range of Chinese policies are expected to protest along the route .
Seven protesters were arrested Monday in San Francisco after three of them scaled suspension cables on the Golden Gate Bridge and unfurled banners supporting Tibetan independence 150 feet over the roadway .
That incident is prompting increased security on the bridge today , with officers searching walkers ' and bicyclists ' bags .
Several San Francisco police officers guarded every entrance to the airport 's international terminal this morning and patrolled heavily outside .
Initially some officers wore riot helmets , then later took them off .
Agents with the U.S. State Department , Secret Service and the Customs and Border Protection agency were also part of the security contingent , airport spokesman Michael McCarron said .
He declined to comment on how many officers were on hand , saying simply , " A lot . "
Mayor Gavin Newsom said Monday that the protests in Paris and London would result in changes in San Francisco 's plans for the flame when 80 runners carry it through the city 's streets .
The route could change even during Wednesday 's run , he said .
Police said security plans would include having officers run alongside torchbearers to protect them and the flame from any protesters who might try to disrupt the run .
Scenes in Paris and London of demonstrators trying to grab torches from runners and put out the flame with fire extinguishers " obviously play a part in our security approach and will play a part in terms of our making any final decisions , " Newsom said .
One scheduled San Francisco torchbearer , Jaclyn Kimball , a 14 - year - old cross - country runner , has bowed out because of concern about the run .
David Perry , a spokesman for the city 's Olympic torch preparations , said he understood why " anyone who might feel that they do n't want to expose themselves to something more than protests " would decide not to run .
" I 'm concerned when anyone would fear that here in San Francisco that someone who might disagree with them might cause them harm , " Perry said .
" That makes me sad . "
The Federal Aviation Administration has announced it will restrict air space over much of San Francisco during the torch relay Wednesday , which is attracting protesters from around the country who want to advocate for a range of causes , most notably China 's human rights record toward Tibet and Falun Gong practitioners and Beijing 's policies toward Burma and the Darfur region of Sudan .
City officials were concerned with both the rights of protesters to voice their position and for supporters of the Beijing games to carry out a successful torch run , Perry said .
" I like to think in San Francisco we know how to do a protest , " Perry said .
" Here in San Francisco , we 're not the type to jump on people in a wheelchair to try to snuff out the flame . "
We have no idea how this did n't pop up when researching France 's Aérotrain but during the 1960's , New York Central was up to its own gee - whiz tricks in the form of the M - 497 experimental .
Searching for ways to attract passengers in the post - freeway era of dwindling train ridership , Central was investing in several projects , including high speed rail .
One of the questions that hung over the prospect was the whether or not the existing rails could handle high speeds .
To answer that question , they built a high speed train - on the cheap .
Advertisement
The build came in the form of a US Air Force surplus General Electric J47- 19 jet engines in a B36 - H bomber engine pod planted on the roof of a modified Budd commuter car with a custom made , fitted cowling .
On a high speed test run between in 1966 between Butler , IN and Stryker , OH , the M - 497 reached a top speed of 183.681 mph - still the current high speed record for light rail in the United States .
With the rails proven capable of high speed transit , the experimental was dismantled and the M497 returned to civilian duty as an NYC commuter car , running the route between Poughkeepsie and Harmon for Metro North where it live until its sale to Conrail in May 1976 .
In an undignified end , the car was cannibalized for parts in Dec. 1977 and scrapped by Metro - North in 1984 .
We can't help but think the fate of this historical car draws a certain parallel to the past and future history of rail travel in the United States .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush acknowledged on Monday that the economy is going through “ challenging times ” and said he supported actions taken by the Federal Reserve to restore order to roiled financial markets .
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with top economic advisers , Bush said his message to the country and the world is that “ the United States is on top of the situation . ”
“ We ’re in challenging times , ” Bush said after the Fed on Sunday announced emergency measures to stem a fast - spreading global financial crisis .
“ We ’ve taken strong and decisive action , ” Bush added .
“ The Federal Reserve has moved quickly to bring order to the financial market .
Secretary Paulson is supportive of that action as am I , ” he said .
The Federal Reserve on Sunday lowered the discount rate it charges on direct loans to banks and announced a new lending program to provide credit to other big Wall Street firms , the latest in a series of moves to try to stabilize financial markets .
The Fed also agreed to fund up to $ 30 billion of Bear Stearns ’ less liquid assets as part of JP Morgan ’s proposed acquisition of the troubled investment banking firm .
“ Our financial institutions are strong and ... our capital markets are functioning efficiently and effectively , ” Bush said .
“ We obviously will continue to monitor the situation and when need be we ’ll act decisively in a way that continues to bring order to the financial markets . ”
“ In the long run our economy ’s going to be fine .
Right now we ’re dealing with a difficult situation . ”
The good folks at the Future of Freedom Foundation kindly forwardedÂ some of the lively responses they receivedÂ after sending outÂ my op - ed , “ Are Presidents Entitled to Kill Foreigners ? ”
I ’m not certain , but I ’m pretty sure all these editors decided not to publish the article .
Here ’s a response from Bob Weir , Â the executive editor of the News Connection ( Texas ) :
Were we right to kill “ foreigners ” in other wars ?
Were the Germans , Italians and Japanese not foreigners ?
Adhering to your definition , the only wars we ’d be able to engage in would be civil wars .
By the way , do you have anything good to say about the United States ?
Your support of Iran , a dictatorship that has been proven to be responsible for the deaths of countless American soldiers , tells me all I need to know about your hatred of your own country .
I will never understand people like you who live the American lifestyle with all its bounty , while taking every opportunity to trash it .
Â
If you have so much affection for Iran and its ayatollah - style government , why do you stay here ?
Could it be because you have freedom here ?
Could it be because if you lived in that tyrannical state and opened your mouth against the government you ’d be stoned to death in the public square ?
You ’re like the spoiled brat who has all the comforts of life , yet hates the parents who provide it for him .
Sadly , your parents must have done a lousy job of
raising you because you bear all the signs of a child that was never taught to appreciate his good fortune .
Â Â Â ****
The Guthrie Center Newspapers sent an indignant one line response to the piece :
It ’s not Bush — it ’ President Bush , just like President Clinton , President
Bush , President Reagan , President Carter , etc .
Well , Â maybe that ’s why Mr. Editor did n’t like the piece .
Â ( That particular email did not include a name ) .
*****
The Addison Eagle News and Reporter in Middlebury , Vermont , replied :
What a stupid , naive premise here .
Presidents do n’t kill foreigners ( unless
they are secret agents although I never heard of one stalking a foreigner
and shooting them . )
The real question you should really care about as an American citizen
is : Should foreigners be entitled to kill Americans ?
Thankfully we have a
President who does n’t think so , after 9/11.*****
If George W.Â is ever indicted for war crimes , he should certainly try to stack the jury with editors from this paper .
Bill Johnston , the editor of the Collinsville News , also successfully resisted the article ’s allure :
Did n’t have to read very far in your “ op-ed ” to know that you obviously
do n’t have a clue as to what you ’re talking about … .
“ Seems to be the attitude ” . . . what a comment .
You do n’t have a clue what
the attitude of President Bush and his advisors is or ever will be .
Needless to say , your ridiculous effort at some sort of anti-Bush rhetoric

By the way , if you ’ve got evidence of President Bush breaking the law , file
the proper motion in court … .
My hunch is that Bill Johnston has not spent a lot of time reading about the State Secrets doctrine and how the Bush administration continually invokes it to sway judges to throw out court cases involving brazen and proven government wrongdoing …
New types of stars are n’t found very often but last year , Patrick Dufour and pals discovered several white dwarfs with carbon atmospheres .
Before then white dwarfs were thought to come in two flavours : with atmopsheres dominated by either hydrogen or helium .
Astronomers suddenly had a new toy to play with .
Dufour found nine examples of his carbon dwarfs in the data regurgitated by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and more are likely to be found as the skies continue to be searched .
So what are white dwarfs with carbon atmospheres like ?
Dufour and some theorists have been working out the details and today publish their results .
Carbon dwarfs should be great throbbing balls of fire .
Yep , pulsating stars .
They ’ve had a bit of luck here .
Turns out that Gilles Fontaine at the University of Montreal produced a theoretical study of carbon - based white dwarfs for his phd thesis 35 years ago , long before they were even discovered .
A quick look through his notes has revealed that these stars should pulsate as carbon is cycled through the atmosphere by convection ( although the exact details depend on the amount of carbon in the stellar atmosphere ) .
Now the hunt is on to find more of these rare white dwars and to measure the amount of light they produce .
“ We are eagerly awaiting the results , ” say Fontaine and Dufour .
Ref : arxiv.org/abs/0803.2255 : Might Carbon - Atmosphere White Dwarfs Harbour a New Type of Pulsating Star ?
UPDATE
Having eagerly waited all of one day , Dufour and a few buddies have announced the discovery of a pulsating carbon - rich white dwarf .
Congratualtions to them but there is a potential fly in the ointment : what looks like a pulsating dwarf could actually be a binary system of two white dwarfs .
Dufour is unfazed .
He points out that the characteristics of the system are unique so either way , they ’ve found a new class of something or other .
He finishes with this : “ We will continue the search for other objects of this exciting and enigmatic class . ”
The world expects !

Following a crusade on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America by News.com journalist Greg Sandoval , the Washington Post posted a correction to a column about a file sharing lawsuit which was misleading headlined " Download Uproar : Record Industry Goes After Personal Use . "
Unfortunately , the correction is actually wrong :
A Dec. 30 Style & Arts column incorrectly said that the recording industry " maintains that it is illegal for someone who has legally purchased a CD to transfer that music into his computer . " [...]
In fact , the RIAA does not recognize that you have a legal right under the Fair Use doctrine to rip your CDs into MP3s to listen to them on your computer or digital audio player .
When asked point blank today if the RIAA believes it is legal to make MP3s , spokeswoman Liz Kennedy refused to answer the question and instead sent this boilerplate text from the RIAA 's anti-piracy website :
[ T] here 's no legal " right " to copy the copyrighted music on a CD onto a CD - R .
However , burning a copy of CD onto a CD-R , or transferring a copy onto your computer hard drive or your portable music player , wo n't usually raise concerns so long as :
The copy is made from an authorized original CD that you legitimately own
The copy is just for your personal use .
The RIAA has not and will not say that ripping MP3s for personal use from a lawfully purchased CD is legal , despite Sandoval 's lobbying for the group .
UPDATE : Sandoval disagrees strongly with Threat Level .
We 're going to have to disagree .
I do n't want to get into a blow - by - blow with you , but the Post story was wrong .
I was hardly the only reporter to write that .
As we 've noted here at Threat Level , the RIAA 's court statements and along with statements on its own web site make it clear , the trade organization does not believe that individuals have the legal right to make digital audio files for their own use from copyrighted media they legally purchased .
And as David Kravets pointed out here , the RIAA 's lawyer used that argument – that individuals do n't even have the right to make MP3s - to persuade a jury to levy exorbitant fines on file sharer Jammie Thomas .
The judge told the jury to consider that simply offering files for download constituted copyright infringement – the RIAA did n't have to prove anyone actually downloaded the files .
But it was n't clear until after the testimony whether the judge would require proof that someone actually downloaded the songs she made available on Kazaa .
So the RIAA ''s lawyer engaged in a scorched earth campaign , argumentatively asking Thomas if she had gotten permission to simply rip the songs .
Before knowing whether the judge would enforce a burden of proof the
RIAA could n't meet – they had no proof anyone actually downloaded songs from Thomas , the RIAA 's lawyer was building a case to have Thomas found liable for simply ripping songs without permission .
That 's why the Sony executive said ripping a song was the same as stealing one , though now the RIAA finds it convenient to say she did n't understand the question .
Sandoval , whose reporting I usually respect , should be embarrassed for carrying the water ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for the organization that crippled Digital Audio Tape recorders and tried to sue digital audio players out of existence .
In the latter case , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that a MP3 player that moved music from a hard drive to the player was space - shifting - a " paradigmnatic non-commercial personal use entirely consistent with the the purposes of the [ Audio Home Recording ] Act . "
The problem with Marc Fisher 's column was that it unfortunately left the impression that the RIAA was suing a guy in Arizona for ripping
MP3s of music he bought , when the suit is actually about him distributing the MP3s .
But the filing at issue in the suit was characterized fairly and accurately by Fisher .
Any correction to it should have simply noted that while the RIAA
does believe that it is illegal for Americans to make digital music files from legally purchased CDs , they have not sued anyone for doing so in absence of a belief that person shared such files on the internet .
So , to sum up , the RIAA does believe that a majority of American music buyers are thieving criminals , but it's not going to sue anyone over ripping MP3s because ) a ) it's not really a big deal to them anymore b ) there 's no real way to find out and / or c ) it would be terrible publicity to sue someone for using an iPod .

One way to identify gifted individuals is their style of thinking .
They usually employ divergent thinking .
Their style is original and they tend to come up with crazy ideas , which other people find strange .
But sometimes it is these crazy ideas that go on to become the most recognized ones of our time .
Gifted individuals face many challenges , with one of biggest being the inability to be correctly identified by the individuals who should be helping them realize their true potential .
As with any other student , it would be a shame if parents , teachers and peers did not recognize the strengths of gifted students and allow them to reach their true potential .
But what must educators and parents do in order to make sure this does not happen ?
However until more help is readily available , what are the gifted to do ?
Sadly , not enough is known about giftedness .
More time and energy need to be spent identifying traits among the gifted , especially since it is these students who go on to contribute much to improving the state of our world .
Acknowledge the possibilities , identify your capabilities and allow yourself to be different .

CAMP PENDLETON , Calif . ( AP ) 
The military 's case against Marines accused of killing 24 Iraqis in Haditha was whittled down Friday to one man accused of giving the orders .
Four enlisted men were originally charged with murder ; those counts are long gone .
With the Marine Corps ' decision to drop involuntary manslaughter charges against Lance Cpl. Stephen Tatum , only squad leader Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich remains charged with anything .
Counts also remain against two of the four Marine officers originally accused of failing to investigate the deaths , but a lawyer for one of them said the decision not to court - martial Tatum bolsters his client 's claim that there had been no reason for him to believe the wartime deaths were a crime .
" This is a house of cards , and it 's all falling apart now , " said Brian Rooney , attorney for Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani .
The case against Tatum , 26 , of Edmond , Okla . , was dismissed as jury selection was about to begin for his court - martial .
The government gave him full immunity so he can testify against Wuterich , of Meriden , Conn .
Prosecutors say Wuterich directed the 2005 assault immediately after a roadside bomb killed one Marine and wounded two others in a convoy .
Wuterich and another Marine shot five men nearby before the squad leader ordered his men to clear homes with grenades and gunfire , killing unarmed civilians .
In February , Tatum received an order to testify against Wuterich and an unrequested immunity order that said anything to which he testified would not be used against him in his court - martial .
On Friday , a new immunity order was issued , along with the dismissal of charges .
" Lance Cpl .
Tatum will testify truthfully if called as a witness , " said his attorney , Jack Zimmerman .
Tatum was relieved by the news and considered it an affirmation of his contention that he and his squadmates responded to a perceived threat as they had been trained to do , Zimmerman said .
" It has been a very happy morning , " he said .
In addition to two counts of involuntary manslaughter , Tatum had been charged with reckless endangerment and aggravated assault .
Zimmerman said there was no agreement with the government before the dismissal .
" Absolutely , there is no deal , " he said .
Tatum , who has been assigned to administrative duties , has extended his enlistment for an additional six months in order to remain available as a witness for the remaining scheduled courts - martial , Zimmerman said .
Camp Pendleton spokesman Lt. Col. Sean Gibson said the dismissal was signed by Lt. Gen. Samuel Helland , who currently oversees the Haditha prosecutions .
The decision to refer Tatum 's case to court - martial was made by Helland 's predecessor , Lt. Gen.
James Mattis , who overrode a finding that prosecutors did n't present enough evidence to prosecute Tatum .
Wuterich is the only enlisted man still facing prosecution .
He faces nine counts of voluntary manslaughter , aggravated assault , reckless endangerment and obstruction of justice .
There is no date set for his court - martial .
Wuterich 's civilian defense attorney , Neal Puckett , contended that the Tatum dismissal showed the government has a poor case against his client .
" I think it 's a further demonstration of how weak the government 's case has become , " Puckett said .
Chessani of Rangely , Colo. , is the highest - ranking defendant and was commander of the Camp Pendleton - based 3rd Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment at the time of the Nov. 19 , 2005 , Haditha killings .
He is the highest - ranking officer to face a combat - related court - martial since the Vietnam War and is scheduled to face court - martial in April .
Chessani , accused of dereliction of duty and violation of a lawful order , has said he did n't order a formal investigation because he believed the deaths resulted from lawful combat .
A judge has set an April court - martial date for 1st Lt. Andrew Grayson , of Springboro , Ohio , the second officer still facing charges .
He is accused of making false official statements , obstruction of justice and attempting to fraudulently separate from the Marine Corps .

Islamist leader Hassan Turki is wanted by the US
Three missiles hit Dhoble town early on Monday , reportedly killing four people and wounding 20 .
People are fleeing the town , fearing more strikes .
Residents say planes could still be seen flying overhead on Monday morning .
Islamist insurgents seized the town last week and reports said a leader , Hassan Turki , had been in the area .
Mr Turki is on the US list of " financers of terrorism " .
US Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman refused to give the identity of the target , whether the strike had achieved its goal or how the strike had been carried out .
The planes keep flying over us .
They are so low that we 're deafened by their engines
Dhoble resident
A US military official , who refused to be named , told the AFP news agency that at least one cruise missile had been fired .
Meanwhile , Islamists have attacked the town of Bur Hakaba , leaving the local police chief and four others dead .
The BBC's Mohammed Olad Hassan in Mogadishu says the Islamists have adopted a new strategy of launching attacks outside the capital .
' Hideouts '
Dhoble resident Fatuma Abdullahi told the BBC they were woken up by " a loud and big bang " .
" When we came out we found our neighbour 's house completely obliterated as if no house existed here , " he said .
Another resident said : " Right now - in full daylight - the planes keep flying over us .
They are so low that we 're deafened by their engines . "
" We are poor civilians living in a simple town - what have we done to deserve this bombing ? "
Local official Ali Hussein told the BBC that many people were fleeing the town .
The border with Kenya has been closed for the past year .
Islamist spokesman Sheikh Mukhtar Robow said the US was trying to hit Islamist hideouts in the area .
" The Americans bombed the town and hit civilian targets , thinking that they were Islamist hideouts .
They used an AC - 130 plane , " he told the AFP news agency .
Regrouping
The US bombed the area a year ago and residents said the same plane was again involved .
There have been reports that the Islamists have been regrouping in the area around Dhoble in recent weeks .
Somalia is the world 's worst place for children , the UN says
They were ousted from the capital , Mogadishu in December 2006 by government forces , backed up by Ethiopia , with some intelligence from the US .
Dhoble was the last town they held .
The US has an anti-terror task force based in neighbouring Djibouti .
The US accused the Somali Islamists of harbouring those responsible for the 1998 attacks on its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
The Islamists denied this , as well as reports they had links to al - Qaeda .
Somalia has not had an effective national government since 1991 .
Last month , a senior UN official told the BBC that Somalia was the worst place in the world for children .

From the department of unintended consequences , we now have a bill before Congress that would address one of the biggest problems with electric cars :
They 're too quiet .
It 's not just blind pedestrians who have to worry .
An ongoing study from the University of California at Riverside has found that even slow - moving hybrids can get 40 percent closer to any pedestrian than a combustion - engine car before they are detected .
This is also a problem for bicyclists , who rely on their hearing to place traffic around them – far more than many realize .
The bill before Congress would require the Transportation Department to establish safety standards for hybrids and other vehicles that make little discernible noise , including an audible alert .
There 's got to be a better way .

The US Department of Energy today said it would dole out almost $ 21 million for a total of 13 projects aimed at advancing solid - state lighting ( SSL ) research and product development .
The agency said it wants to accelerate solid - state lighting technology from the lab to the marketplace because it has the potential to more than double the efficiency of lighting systems , significantly reduce its carbon footprint and transform the environment .
SSL lighting is an advanced technology that creates light with considerably less heat than incandescent and fluorescent lamps , allowing for increased energy efficiency .
Unlike incandescent and fluorescent bulbs , SSL uses a semi-conducting material to convert electricity directly into light , which maximizes the light ’s energy efficiency , the DOE said in a release .
Solid - state lighting encompasses a variety of light - producing semi-conductor devices , including light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) and organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) .
Once used only for indicator lights to illuminate the numbers on digital clocks and light up watches , LEDs are now found in a variety of applications including brake lights , flashlights , traffic signals , and more recently , streetlights .
OLED technology is more commonly used commercially , such as in small screens for mobile phones , portable digital music players , digital cameras , and now televisions .

Condoleezza Rice criticised Israel after a Nato meeting in Brussels
" This does n't help build confidence , " Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said after meeting Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni in Brussels .
Israel said on Tuesday it had invited bids to build 300 new homes in Har Homa , a settlement in East Jerusalem .
The Palestinians asked the US for help .
Israel says it annexed the area in 1967 and so does not regard it as occupied .
We are in a time when the goal is to build maximum confidence
Condoleezza Rice
US Secretary of State
However , the Palestinians say Israel is trying to encircle the capital of a future Palestinian state .
Ms Rice recalled last week 's Middle East peace conference in Annapolis - a planned step towards relaunching the long - dormant Middle East peace process .
" We are in a time when the goal is to build maximum confidence with the parties , and this does n't help to build confidence , " she told journalists .
She added : " It 's even more important now that we are on the eve of the beginning of the negotiations .
I made that position clear . "
The UN secretary - general , Ban Ki-Moon , also criticised the project , and a top Palestinian official , Nabil Abu Rdainah , had urged Washington to act now .
Israel says the Har Homa building plans break no agreements
" Asking them to explain is not enough , " he said .
" The Americans must pressure the Israeli government to stop settlement activities . "
Israel argues that the homes are part of plans drawn up seven years ago , and that the area - known in Arabic as Abu Ghneim - is in any case not covered by the United States ' roadmap to peace .
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are due to meet on Wednesday for the first time since the Annapolis meeting .
Correspondents say the US administration wants the Middle East peace talks to conclude before President Bush steps down in 13 months .
" Tell me how this ends , " Gen . David Petraeus , then commander of the 101st Airborne Division , asked a Washington Post reporter during the " liberation " of Iraq almost exactly five years ago .
That neither Petraeus , now commander of all US forces in Iraq , nor his civilian counterpart , Washington ’s ambassador to Baghdad , Ryan Crocker , was able to offer even the slightest clue as to " how this ends " in Congressional testimony this week added yet one more layer of irony to a war which has systematically defied every prediction of its architects .
" We ’ll know when we get there and we do n’t know when we ’re going to get there , " said Democratic Sen .
Evan Bayh , an early supporter of the war , after patiently listening to Petraeus and Crocker ’s repeated efforts to evade questions about how and when Washington could withdraw substantial numbers of its combat troops below the 140,000 level that is supposed to be reached in July .
There are currently somewhat more than US 160,000 troops in Iraq .
" I think people want a sense of what the end is going to look like , " said Sen .
Bob Corker , a Republican hawk , whose comments reflected growing frustration within President George W. Bush ’s own party with the lack of any sense that the administration has any clear " exit strategy " for Iraq .
As Bush himself made clear Thursday when he pledged that Petraeus will , " have all the time he needs " to decide whether he could afford to further reduce US military presence in Iraq after July without jeopardizing what security gains have been achieved over the past year , an exit strategy that will almost certainly not materialize between now and Jan. 20 next year when the Bush administration comes to an end .
On the contrary , Bush ’s remarks suggested that Washington ’s vital interests in Iraq  at least in his mind  may somehow have actually expanded in recent weeks to include rolling back Iranian influence , in addition to ensuring that the country not become a base for al - Qaeda or other radical Sunni Islamist groups .
" Iraq is the convergence point for two of the greatest threats to America in this century : al - Qaeda and Iran , " he declared .
" If we fail there , al - Qaeda would claim a propaganda victory of colossal proportions , and they could gain safe havens in Iraq from which to attack the United States , our friends and our allies , " he said .
" Iran would work to fill the vacuum in Iraq , and our failure would embolden its radical leaders and fuel their ambitions to dominate the region . "
As the New York Times reported , Bush ’s focus on Iran was not entirely new , but the implications of a commitment to prevent Iran from influencing events in its neighbor  particularly given Tehran ’s historic support for Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s Da’wa Party and the other Shi ’a factions that make up his government  seemed remarkably ambitious at a time when even Republican lawmakers are beseeching the White House to offer some light at the end of the tunnel .
Of course , Petraeus ’ and Crocker ’s depiction of Iran ’s role was somewhat more nuanced .
Petraeus , for example , conceded that Tehran ’s Revolutionary Guard played a decisive role in negotiating a ceasefire in last month ’s bloody conflict in Basra and Baghdad between Moqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army and US - and British - backed Iraqi Army and police forces which are themselves dominated by other Shi’a factions , notably the Badr Brigades of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council ( SIIC ) .
But their testimony also bolstered the notion that , five years into the US occupation , Washington was finding new threats to its interests in Iraq , and hence new reasons to keep large numbers of its troops there .
Indeed , Petraeus asserted several times that Iran ’s support for so - called " special groups " 
Shi ’a militia units allegedly associated with the Mahdi Army but supplied and directed by the Revolutionary Guards ’ Quds Force  had become Public Enemy Number One in Iraq , effectively displacing al - Qaeda .
" Unchecked , the special groups pose the greatest long - term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq , " Petraeus declared , essentially laying the groundwork for continuing military action throughout southern Iraq , in addition to Baghdad , al - Anbar , and the northern provinces where al - Qaeda has been the primary target of the 30,000 US " surge " forces sent to Iraq a year ago .
And , as much as Petraeus and Crocker sought to distinguish between the special groups and the Sadr ’s Mahdi Army , it appears from last month ’s fighting , as well as continuing violence in Sadr City and elsewhere over the past week , that the government ’s security forces have not been inclined to make such distinctions , suggesting that US forces may well become increasingly involved in an intra-Shi ’a conflict between the various Iranian - supported factions .
That conflict is likely to become much more intense  and violent  with the approach of regional elections in October , according to Iraq specialists here , making it even less likely that Washington will withdraw more troops before Bush leaves office .
" It ’s abundantly clear that President Bush is simply trying to ‘ run out the clock ’ and hand off the mess to the next president , " observed Sen. Edward Kennedy .
As grim  and as widely accepted  as that conclusion appeared to be by the end of the week , some observers noted that the administration ’s focus on Iran and its " nefarious " role in Iraq raised anew the specter of a much larger " mess " that Bush might yet leave to his successor .
Speculation that Bush might yet attack Iran before the end of his term , which had been mostly silenced after the publication last December of the intelligence community ’s assessment that Iran had suspended a key part of a nuclear - weapons program in 2003 , was raised anew this week by the Petraeus - Crocker testimony and Bush ’s equation of the threats posed by al - Qaeda and Iran .
In addition , Vice President Dick Cheney , the leader of the administration ’s Iran hawks , came out of his usual seclusion this week to describe President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in an interview this week as " a very dangerous man… who believes … that the highest honor that can befall a man is that he should die a martyr in facilitating the return of the 12th imam . "
Ahmadinejad has repeatedly threatened to " destroy Israel , " he noted , adding that the deterrence strategy used by Washington against Moscow would not work with Tehran .
" Mutual assured destruction with Ahmadinejad is an incentive , " he said .
" You have to be concerned about that . "
( Inter Press Service )
I ’m going to do two things in this post .
First , I will explain the likely legislative process on FISA in the Senate and House .
Second , I will discuss Chris Dodd ’s course of actions regarding a filibuster and where that stands now .
Tomorrow looks to be the big day for FISA votes in the Senate .
Senator Dodd ’s amendment to strip retroactive immunity from the underlying SSCI bill will be given a vote – it will need 51 votes to pass .
Other amendments pertaining to retroactive immunity will also be given votes – Whitehouse ’s substitution amendment and Feinstein ’s “ good faith ” amendment .
The bad news is that these amendments are all likely to fail , though Feinstein ’s might have the best chances of passing , even with a 60 vote threshold .
Following the votes on all remaining amendments – a number are still out there on Title I of the SSCI bill and would succeed in improving congressional oversight of domestic surveillance – there will be a cloture vote on the bill .
If we have any hope to stopping retroactive immunity and a bad Intel bill in the Senate , this is it .
Most likely , though , the Republican caucus will be joined by a significant number of conservative Democrats and cloture will pass .
After cloture , Senator Dodd will have up to four hours to speak in opposition to the bill .
He may share some of that time with Senators Feingold , Leahy , and Kennedy .
No more than 30 hours after cloture passes , there will be a vote on final passage of the SSCI bill .
That will probably pass and the Senate – thanks in large part to the diligent work of Jay Rockefeller and the decision - making of Harry Reid – will have given George Bush , Dick Cheney , and the big telecom companies what they wanted .
As the Senate version of FISA reform legislation is dramatically different from the RESTORE Act , passed by the House last November , there will be a conference committee to sort out the legislation .
Unless both chambers quickly pass another 15 day extension to the Protect America Act , the conference committee will have to finish their work and send it along for votes by this Friday , when the PAA is set to expire .
Once it ’s out of conference , no amendments will be allowed to the legislation , so the bill will only be voted on by the two chambers and not modified any further .
Now , here ’s where things get worse .
It ’s possible that during the conference committee , Blue Dog Democrats in the House will side with the GOP and lobby hard for retroactive immunity .
If the conference report strips retroactive immunity ( that is , if Title II of the RESTORE Act prevails over the SSCI version ) , then the conference report will most likely fail to pass in the Senate .
Jay Rockefeller and somewhere between 14 - 16 Blue Dogs in the Senate will join the Republicans to oppose the bill .
When the Senate voted on the Protect America Act last August , sixteen Democrats voted with the Republicans in favor of the bill ; that roster is a good starting place for potential aisle - crossers this time around .
We ’re clearly up against real obstacles in both the House and Senate Democratic caucuses .
To finish up the process side of this , the conference report will be introduced in the Senate ( and House ) , cloture will be filed , cloture will ripen , there will be a cloture vote , there will be up to 30 hours for debate ( though no guarantee it will all be used ) , and then there will be a vote on the conference report .
Again , it ’s my understanding that the goal of the Senate leadership would be to have all of this take place by Friday if no extension is passed .
Without an extension , the telecoms will likely have retroactive immunity by the end of this week .
Now , I think there ’s a need to look back at this process and answer some questions about what brought us here and what , if anything , could still be done by someone like Chris Dodd to stop the bill from moving forward .
I ’ve previously been highly critical of the unanimous consent agreement brokered by the Democratic and Republican leadership in the Senate , but will be offering a defense of Dodd ’s vote in support of the agreement in the context of the course of events and what alternatives existed in this legislative fight .
The short version is that the unanimous consent agreement which negotiations between Democratic and Republican leadership produced about two weeks ago included a cloture vote ( which will be taking place tomorrow ) and that limits the ability of Senator Dodd to draw out debate beyond what is currently taking place .
Cloture was filed on the underlying SSCI bill on Friday , so today ’s debate has been taking place while it is ripening .
The question at hand is : Has Dodd done all he can ?
Has he filibustered ?
Is he breaking his promise to filibuster any bill that includes retroactive immunity ?
There are a number of levels at which I can try to answer these questions .
The short view is the UC agreement that ’s governing the debate , which Dodd consented to , does not allow him to draw out debate beyond tomorrow ’s cloture vote .
Did not objecting to UC constitute a failure to uphold his promise to filibuster ?
I do n’t think so , and here ’s why :
The negotiations had been very slow going and hinged in part on the vote totals required to pass each amendment .
While some Senators were willing to raise their vote total to 60 ( Feinstein , Cardin & Whitehouse ) , Dodd refused .
As a result of standing firm , he was able to get consent from people like Rockefeller who did n’t want Dodd ’s amendment to require a simple majority .
But the tradeoff was that he had to consent to the UC agreement as well .
That included cloture .
Now , the reality is that had Dodd sought to extend debate following his amendment ’s failure , someone would have filed cloture at some point on him .
There ’s no way to reasonably argue that cloture would not have been filed to stop Dodd from talking and move to vote on final passage .
In that regard , I do n’t think consenting to cloture in the UC agreement constitutes him breaking his word on the filibuster .
The other main feature to note in the negotiation of the UC agreement was that it was taking place under duress .
Senator Rockefeller was threatening the Democratic leadership that if they did n’t sort out a UC agreement that would allow debate to move forward , he and a block of Blue Dog Democrats would support Republican efforts to pass cloture on the SSCI bill before any amendments could be voted on .
Recall that Rockefeller and the Blue Dogs had previously voted with the rest of the Democratic caucus to stop the Republican efforts to have cloture on the SSCI bill earlier in the fight .
The threat Rockefeller was levying was simple : agree on how we ’re going to proceed or you wo n’t get to put any amendments onto the SSCI bill .
The UC agreement included a simple majority vote to strip retroactive immunity from the underlying bill .
Dodd had long said that he sought a majority vote on his amendment – that ’s why he stopped the SSCI bill cold last December , by refusing UC on the motion to have all amendments require 60 votes .
Agreeing to the UC agreement allowed him to have that .
Disagreeing would have likely prevented from their being any vote to strip RI from the SSCI bill .
Though it ’s unlikely that any Democratic amendments receiving roll call votes under this UC agreement will pass , it ’s also worth noting that the agreement did include updates to Title I to make it technically somewhat better through the manager ’s package .
I ’m not going to sit here and tell you it went all the way to turning it into a good bill – it did n’t .
But it is more than we would have gotten had Rockefeller and the Blue Dogs sided with the GOP and steamrolled the process .
If Dodd had objected to UC , we would not have a chance to amend the underlying bill .
We would not have gotten the improvements agreed to in the manager ’s package .
Rockefeller and the Blue Dogs would have flipped , and we ’d end up with the SSCI bill moving forward in worse shape .
I ’ll grant that we ’re going to end up fairly close to that point anyway , but I do not think that objecting to UC because the option was open to him would have been the best course for Chris Dodd .
This way , his amendment to strip RI will get a vote tomorrow .
It needs a majority to pass and there are 50 Democrats in the caucus .
We ’re not going to get closer to defeating retroactive immunity in the Senate than that and it ’s simply a shame that so many Democrats support immunity .
It ’s also a shame that Harry Reid does not have the same control over the Democratic caucus as Mitch McConnell has on the Republican one .
Lastly , the rules of the Senate are n’t what they used to be .
The rules do n’t allow Dodd do to a stand up , “ Mr Smith Goes to Washington ” - style filibuster like Strom Thurmond did on civil rights legislation .
From a practical standpoint and in my assessment , Dodd has been filibustering the SSCI bill since December 17 , 2007 .
His filibuster has allowed us time to organize grassroots pressure on the Senate .
It has allowed us to get get votes on amendments that will improve the underlying bill .
It has kept the Republican Party ’s efforts to destroy the rule of law in the spotlight for all to see .
It has taken an issue that Bush , Reid , and Rockefeller wanted done in a matter of hours so the Senate could go on Christmas vacation and stretched the process out over eight weeks .
At a certain point , we have to recognize that we simply do not have the 41 votes needed to defeat cloture and uphold Dodd ’s filibuster .
I know that Dodd ’s course of action may not be what some people expected .
Given the reality of the situation and given the rules of the Senate , I can honestly say that I do not know what else Dodd could have done to ensure a different outcome .
That may not be what some others think , but please note that I make this judgment this as someone who desperately wanted to see the Senate kill retroactive immunity and has been as thoroughly invested in the fight as just about anyone else out there .
In my eyes , the blame for retroactive immunity passing in the Senate will lie with two people : Jay Rockefeller , for holding a gun to his Democratic colleagues while trying to ensure his buddies at Verizon and AT&T get their “ Get Out of Jail Free ” card , and Harry Reid , for inexplicably choosing to make the SSCI bill the underlying bill before the Senate and not the better alternatives provided by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House of Representatives .
Reid also circumvented Dodd ’s hold on the SSCI bill ; under normal circumstances , the hold would have been the most powerful weapon Dodd had it his disposal .
Reid ’s decisions , more than anything else , made it impossible for us to pass a bill without retroactive immunity in it .
At the end of the day , to defeat retroactive immunity and to uphold a filibuster , Chris Dodd needed more support for his efforts than exists in the Senate .
He needs 40 other Democrats and the sad reality is that there are not 40 other Democrats who are opposed to retroactive immunity .
Dodd was our strongest ally in the fight , but he could n’t win it on his own .
I respect and appreciate the work he has done and though I wish the outcome were different , though I wish he could have done something to else to stop this legislation from moving forward , the obstacles set by Harry Reid , Jay Rockefeller , and an all - too spineless Democratic caucus were too much for him to overcome .
***
It should be worth noting that I no longer have any connection to Senator Dodd ’s campaign , nor his Senate office , and I am speaking solely for myself here .

The New Resistance Real History
There is an invisible power which secretly rules .
Dirty Tricks , Inc. :
The DynCorp - Government Connection
by Uri Dowbenko
Organized White - Collar Crime is the absolute essence of Mega - Corporate - Government Business .
As Jim Hougan wrote in his landmark book , Spooks : The Haunting of America - The Private Use of Secret Agents , " With their cultural and career investments in upholding the stereotype of the Mafia as the vehicle of organized crime , the public and the press have generally failed to grasp the felonious nature of the outfit 's WASP counterparts on the Big Board .
Whereas some petty hoodlums put out contracts on individuals , the multinationals have begun to place contracts on entire countries ( for example , ITT versus Chile ) .
With that difference , their operational styles are similar : offshore laundries used to wash bribes paid in clandestine support of a sales effort designed to create and satisfy the potentially lethal addictions of their would be customers .
Whether the product is heroin or Starfighter jets , the result is often the same : profits that corrupt and impoverish …
In short it appears that some multinationals had evolved into genuinely criminal enterprises . " ( p. 441 )
Likewise , outsourcing State Terrorism is the fastest growing segment of the US Government market .
In fact , white - collar criminal activities , like Federal IT , or Information Technology , which involves " privatizing " the financial database management of government agencies , accounts for some of the most lucrative contracts available anywhere on earth .
The practice of privatizing ( using private companies for government work ) has been long exploited by the CIA and the Pentagon , who like to use proxies , like contractors or mercenaries , to fight their covert wars .
The benefits for federal agencies include " plausible deniability " with respect to assassination and drug trafficking , as well as the ability to bypass the Military Code of Honor and the accords of the Geneva Convention , which hold " official " combatants to a different standard .
In other words , by privatizing " dirty tricks , " a federal agency cannot be held liable to the standards one would expect of , well , the US Government .
Acting as one of the US Government 's primary privatized Dirty Tricks Divisions , DynCorp has become one of the leading prime federal contractors , reaping a global harvest of shame and disgrace .
The Murky Origins of DynCorp
And where did DynCorp come from ?
In the apocryphal story , DynCorp began as an Air Force contractor in 1954 .
Since then , however it has garnered a reputation as a shadowy company with a spooky pedigree , rumored to be a CIA " cutout , " or front company , for the Agency 's dirty tricks .
Using high - level government insider connections , DynCorp provides a range of " services " one would expect to facilitate fraud and money laundry activities , acting like a virtual conduit between the corporate ( private ) and government ( public ) worlds .
According to DynCorp , the US Government is its biggest client , accounting for more than 95 % of its revenues .
After it gobbled up GTE Information Services LLC in 1999 , DynCorp has become one of the nation 's largest Federal contractors for IT , or Information Technology , services .
Along with Lockheed Martin , SAIC , AMS , and others , DynCorp contracts with federal government agencies to " manage " federal databases .
Dyncorp 's clients include the Drug Enforcement Agency , the Department of Defense , Department of State , Department of Justice , Internal Revenue Service , Securities and Exchange Commission , FBI , CIA , and HUD -- all government agencies notorious for rampant , unchecked and egregious fraud .
For example , the Pentagon cannot account for a mind - boggling $ 2.3 trillion .
In fact , at Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 's confirmation hearing in January 2001 , Sen. Robert Byrd wondered aloud , " How can we seriously consider a $ 50 billion dollar increase in the Defense Department 's budget when the DoD 's own auditors cannot account for $ 2.3 trillion in transactions ? "
After September 11 , of course , fresh fraud at DoD will become virtually limitless because of the new " War on Terrorism , " a black hole of a boondoggle that may surpass even the " Cold War " in Pentagon corruption , waste and malfeasance .
Meanwhile , HUD cannot account for $ 59 billion , according to the testimony of former HUD Inspector General Susan Gaffney .
( See " Why Is $ 59 Billion Missing from HUD ? " by Kelly O'Meara , Insight Magazine )
Coincidentally , that was the year that " HUD Taps DynCorp for Services , " according to a Washington Post headline from August 2 , 1999 , describing a new $ 51 million contract to provide desktop services to the Office of Inspector General at Housing and Urban Development .
Even more sinister is the fact that DynCorp manages email and information systems for many federal investigation agencies like FBI , DOJ and SEC .
What does that mean ?
Whenever criminal behavior is detected , DynCorp controls the information , giving it defacto power to subvert the process of law and cover - up corporate - government criminal activities .
And guess who 's DynCorp 's auditor of record ?
It 's none other than Arthur Andersen , the best Corporate Cooking - the - Books - and - Shredding - Documents firm money can buy .
If this Big Eight Firm did it for Enron , you can bet they 're doing it for most of their other clients .
Corporate Insiders at the Government Trough
So who 's minding the store at DynCorp ?
The sordid cast of characters includes Herbert S. ( Pug ) Winokur , member of the Council on Foreign Relations , as well as a director of DynCorp since 1988 , according to a May 9 , 2001 Proxy Statement .
By the way , the Council on Foreign Relations , which has been liberally described as a think tank , is actually " a clearinghouse for the really choice frauds , " according to whistleblower Al Martin , author of The Conspirators : Secrets of an Iran Contra Insider . ( almartinraw.com )
In fact , Winokur was the also Chairman of the Board of DynCorp from 1988 to 1997 .
So here is the connection between criminal corporate and government networks .
Winokur is also on the Board of Directors of the notorious Enron -- the notorious slush fund / money laundry disguised as a corporation .
It should be noted that Enron has declared bankruptcy after paying corporate insiders hundreds of millions of dollars for their " services . "
As the chair of Enron 's Finance Committee , Winokur approved the creation of more than 3000 offshore limited partnerships and subsidiaries , used by the corporation to hide losses from derivative trading , other bogus transactions and money laundering .
Winokur is also a director of Harvard Management Company and a member of Harvard Corporation .
Harvard , of course , has all the trademarks of a highly successful money laundry , but is cleverly disguised as a prestigious " educational institution . "
Its endowment fund rose remarkably from $ 5 billion to $ 19 billion in just 6 years .
( Imagine if you could get that kind of return . )
Winokur also has the ability and the means to coordinate money flows in and out of offshore slush funds with little or no public supervision -- as Chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings , Inc. , a " private investment company " and Managing General Partner of three Capricorn Investors Limited Partnerships " concentrating on investments in restructure situations . "
That 's code for " bottom feeding " on so - called " distressed " properties .
As far as DynCorp is concerned , though , there 's Winokur 's pal , Dudley Mecum , DynCorp Director since 1988 , who just happens to also be the managing director of Winokur 's Capricorn Holdings Inc. , as well as CitiGroup , the New York banking conglomerate , convicted of serial money laundering and other criminal offenses .
The DynCorp Board itself is filled with so many shadowy characters that the company could be rightly considered a retirement / slush fund for former spooks and military honchos .
They include General P.C. Carns , a retired General US Air Force who served as Vice Chief of Staff and as Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
According the DynCorp Proxy statement , Carns is also a member of the Defense Science Board and the Board of Advisors , National Security Agency .
Then there 's General Russell E. Dougherty , Director since 1989 , whose term as director expired in 2001 .
He was an attorney with the law firm of McGuire , Woods , as well as a retired General US Air Force , who served as Commander in Chief , Strategic Air Command and Chief of Staff , Allied Command , Europe .
Who needs a pension when you have the coffers of the government open to you ?
Dirty Business , Dirty Clients
One of the DynCorp 's biggest clients is the US Department of Justice .
The ironically named JCON ( Justice Consolidated Office Network ) also awarded DynCorp a $ 500 million contract to design , implement and manage and integrated hardware and software program as early as 1996 .
Reliable inside sources claim that a new improved PROMIS software with increase real - time tracking capabilities has also been used by DynCorp in recent times .
By all accounts , it comes in very handy when you 're trying to coordinate government interagency fraud .
JCON after all is available to Executive Attorneys ( USA ) , Executive Office for US Marshals , Executive Office for Immigration Justice Management Division , Office of the Solicitor General and the six litigating divisions including Civil , Civil Rights , Environmental , Tax Criminal , and Anti Trust Divisions of the US Department of Justice .
Between its DoJ contracts ( PROMIS ) and HUD contracts , it 's not unlikely that DynCorp may have had the ability to falsify evidence of HUD system e-mail and offshore accounts .
After all , DynCorp is also in charge of so - called asset seizure ( forfeiture ) programs for HUD and Treasury .
DynCorp 's sweet contract deal with JCON is the ultimate insider scam .
The fed - speak for it is " a single - vendor indefinite delivery , indefinite quantity contract . "
Another major client of DynCorp is the FBI .
DynCorp will do a $ 51 million upgrade of the FBI network for the information technology and transport network components of its Trilogy program , a $ 300 million , three - year initiative to update the FBI backbone network .
By the way , the notorious Andersen will be doing the audit .
Imagine how many documents will be shred in that deal …
DynCorp's RICO Problems
According to Washington Technology Magazine ( April 2 , 2001 ) , DynCorp 's revenue for 2000 was more than $ 1.8 billion , up from $ 1.4 billion in 1999 .
Its contract backlog at the time was $ 6 billion , and about half of DynCorp 's revenue comes from the Department of Defense .
With little or no public scrutiny , DynCorp has acted like a white - collar organized crime outfit .
Besides being a federal contractor with insider deals for rigging computer systems to facilitate government fraud and malfeasance , whistleblowers working in Bosnia have revealed that DynCorp supervisors are engaging in sex slavery and prostitution of local 12 - year old girls .
[ See " DynCorp 's Disgrace " By Kelly O'Meara , Insight Magazine .
In Johnson v. DynCorp Inc. , et al , DynCorp employee Ben Johnston alleges that his former employer breached his three - year contract , firing him without cause in June 2000 because of Johnson 's whistleblower activities .
The lawsuit alleges that DynCorp engaged in racketeering activities in violation of the RICO , the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act , and that Johnson was fired because he refuse to commit an illegal act .
The suit alleges that DynCorp engaged in peonage and slavery , sexually exploiting children , dealing in obscene material and procuring fraudulent identification documents for the underage victims .
When Johnston told his DynCorp supervisor that co-workers were buying women from the mafia , he was told to mind his own business .
Johnston is not the only DynCorp employee to blow the whistle on Dirty Works , Inc. , otherwise known as DynCorp .
A UN International Police Force monitor called Kathryn Bolkovac has also filed a lawsuit in Great Britain against DynCorp for wrongful termination .
Bolkovac discovered that DynCorp , whose $ 15 million contract to train police officers in Bosnia , had officers who were also participating in sex- trafficking .
And you 'd think that government fraud would be enough ?
DynCorp Drug Trafficking and Cover - Up ?
" The Resister , " a US military whistleblower publication , has claimed that DynCorp was also contracted by the CIA to " observe " activities against the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) on the part of the Serbs .
For the record , the KLA was a drug - financed army of gangsters , murderous thugs and terrorists , trained by the CIA , and used to undermine attempts at peace between Kosovars , Albanians and Serbs .
DynCorp 's contracted employees are typically ex-military , probably " sheep dipped " ( moved into a new cover ) into DynCorp , standard operating procedure for black ops and other covert activities by US military and intelligence organizations .
Most recently , DynCorp 's use of military veterans and retired spooks to do the dirty work for the phony War on Drugs in Colombia , known as " Plan Colombia , " is no exception .
In June 2001 , DynCorp 's unsavory presence in the War on Drugs in Colombia was exposed when an American missionary plane was shot down in Peru , leaving a mother and her baby daughter dead .
DynCorp Technical Services had been paid hundreds of millions of dollars by the CIA , Customs Service , Defense Department and State Department for " missions " like these , everywhere from Bosnia , Rwanda , Haiti , Colombia and Peru .
According to an AP story ( " Peru incident shines spotlight on shadowy practice , " by Lisa Hoffman , April 24 , 2001 ) , " DynCorp has supplied dozens of mechanics , trainers , maintenance and administrative workers , logistics experts , rescuers and pilots " for a price tag of $ 600 million .
The UK Guardian describes DynCorp 's role in the five - year $ 200 million contract as providing " crop dusting pilots for eradication of coca plantations [ could they be CIA competitors ? ] and helicopter pilots to ferry Colombian troops and DynCorp 's own security personnel . "
Another DynCorp Aerospace Technology subcontractor in the so - called War on Drugs ( Plan Colombia ) called EAST ( Eagle Aviation Service and Technology , Inc. has an equally notorious .
EAST " helped Oliver North run guns to Nicaraguan rebels in what would be known as the Iran Contra affair , " wrote AP reporter Ken Guggenheim on June 5 , 2001 .
Founded in the 1980s by Richard Gadd , EAST helped North secretly supply weapons and ammunition to the Nicaraguans .
General Richard Secord hired Gadd in 1985 to oversee weapons deliveries , and it's a good bet that drugs would have been flown north on the return trip in Oliver North 's infamous " Guns - For - Drugs " operation .
Bid Rigging De Rigueur
Here 's another example of insider government contract shenanigans .
According to a General Accounting Office report of Feb. 28 , 2001 , " the Department of State awarded two contracts to DynCorp Aerospace technology for aviation services to support the Bureau 's counter narcotics aviation program . "
One five - year contract for $ 99 million was awarded by State in 1991 .
Then in 1996 , State awarded DynCorp another sole - source contract for another $ 170 million without competitive bidding .
Rigged deals can't get much sweeter , can they ?
At the time , DynCorp 's Jim McCoy got new contracts from the State , Treasury , and Commerce Departments , as well as the CIA and NASA .
It became common knowledge that DynCorp acted as a front - company on behalf of the CIA , hiring mercenaries and " assets " in order to distance itself from the manipulation of US foreign policy from behind the scenes .
According to an article in The Nation ( " DynCorp 's Drug Problem , " by Jason Vest ) , DynCorp employees have also been implicated in narcotics trafficking .
It must be remembered that US involvement in Colombia is ultimately a gambit to control the lucrative drug trade , as well as the oil fields , explored by Bush Family connected Harken Energy .
DynCorp Charged with Terrorism
Most recently DynCorp has been charged with terrorism .
According to NarcoNews.com reporter Al Giordano ( www.narconews.com), a class - action lawsuit has been filed in Washington , DC , on behalf of 10,000 farmers in Ecuador and the AFL - CIO - related International Labor Rights Fund .
Why ?
DynCorp has US Government contracts to spray toxic herbicides over 14 percent of Colombia , supposedly to eliminate coca in the phony War on Drugs .
Giordano writes , " Although DynCorp 's taxpayer - sponsored bio - warfare has not made a dent in the cocaine trade , it has caused more than 1,100 documented cases of illness among citizens , destroyed untold acres of food crops , displaced tens of thousands of peasant farmers , and harmed the fragile Amazon ecosystem , all in the name of the ' war on drugs . ' "
" DynCorp may be about to get its comeuppance in federal court , " continues Giordano , " where Justice Richard W. Roberts is presiding over a lawsuit brought by labor , environmental and indigenous groups against the aerial herbicide program .
The text of the legal complaint is available online for all to read : www.usfumigation.org/compliant.htm.
In addition , NarcoNews.com writes that DynCorp 's top corporate director , Paul Lombardi , attempted to intimidate the International Labor Rights Fund , one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit .
According to documents obtained by NarcoNews.com , on October 25 , 2001 , " Lombardi wrote to each of the board members of the AFL - CIO allied Rights Fund in an unsuccessful attempt to scare them off the lawsuit .
In that letter , Lombardi accused the group , without offering evidence , of fronting for illicit ' drug cartels . '
Lombardi also attempted , bombastically , to portray the Rights Fund as an enemy in the war on terrorism .
He wrote : ' Considering the major international issues with which we are all dealing as a consequence of the events of September 11th , none of us need to be sidetracked with frivolous litigation the aim of which is to fulfill a political agenda . '
And DynCorp 's Lombardi attempted to cause the Rights Fund to drop the lawsuit , saying , ' Clearly it is not in our mutual best interests to continue politically charged litigation . '
Bishop Jesse DeWitt , president of the International Human Rights Fund , responded in a November 5 , 2001 letter to DynCorp 's Lombardi , suggesting that it is DynCorp that engages in terrorist actions . "
In this letter , Bishop DeWitt called DynCorp 's actions in South America " terrorism . "
He wrote " we found your reference to September 11 particularly apt , but for a very different reason .
Based on what appear to be uncontested facts , a group of at least 10,000 Ecuadoran subsistence farmers have been poisoned from aerial assault by your company . "
" Imagine that scene for a moment .
You are an Ecuadoran farmer , and suddenly , without notice or warning , a large helicopter approaches , and the frightening noise of the chopper blades invades the quiet , " he continues .
" The helicopter comes closer and sprays a toxic poison on you , your children , your livestock and your food crops .
You see your children get sick , your crops die .
Mr. Lombardi , we at the International Labor Rights Fund , and most civilized people , consider such an attack on innocent people terrorism .
Your effort to hide behind September 11 is shameful and breathtakingly cynical . "
" Bishop DeWitt put Lombardi on notice that he and other DynCorp officials may be added as defendants in the lawsuit , now having been officially informed of the harm done by their fumigation program :
' If there is any further spraying done that causes similar harm , we will amend the legal complaint and name you and other DynCorp decision - makers as defendants in your personal capacities , and will charge you with knowingly conducting aerial attacks on innocent people .
Again , based on well - established principles of international law , that would be terrorism . ' "
Lombardi has shown that Homegrown White - Collar Terrorism is alive and well at DynCorp .
Translating the " Drug War " into Dollars : How Much Pop Per Dead Colombian ?
So how much does DynCorp really make on the notorious War on Drugs Scam ?
According to Catherine Austin Fitts , former FHA Commissioner in the Bush I Administration and former CEO of Hamilton Securities , an investment banking / software company , the creation of Stock Value , also referred to as Capital Gains , is called " Pop " in Wall Street jargon .
She explains the money dynamics of DynCorp 's business model with regard to its War on Drugs activities .
" If DynCorp has a $ 60 million per year contract supporting knowledge management for asset seizures in the United States , " she says .
" The current proxy shows that they value their stock , which they buy and sell internally , at approximately 30 times earnings . "
" So , if a contract has a 5 - 10 % profit , then per $ 100 million of contracts , DynCorp makes about $ 5 - $ 10 million , which translates into $ 150 million to $ 300 million of stock value . "
" That means that for a $ 200 million contract , with average earnings of 5 - 10 % ( $ 10 million to $ 20 million ) , DynCorp is generating $ 300 million to $ 600 million of stock value .
Pug Winokur of Capricorn Holdings appears to have about 5 % ownership , which means that his partnerships ' stock value increase $ 15 - $ 30 million from the War in Colombia . "
" If the DynCorp team kills 100 people , as an example , then that means they make $ 1.5 - $ 3 million per death .
That way the Pop per Dead Colombian can be estimated , or , how much capital gains can be made from killing one Colombian .
Since DynCorp was also in the Gulf and in Kosovo , we should be able to calculate the relative value of killing people in various cultures and nationalities .
Pug Winokur 's partnership , under these assumptions , makes $ 75,000 to $ 250,000 of Pop per Dead Colombian . "
" Since the stock of prison companies trades on a per bed basis , my guess is that defense stocks are going to evolve towards a per person expenditure and other similar performance rules - of - thumb for profit - making opportunities . "
" One of my expectations is that the numbers for the Colombian war will yield a very high per death cost , " Fitts continues .
" That means lots of shareholders ' profits , but probably very few American Jobs Created per Dead Colombian .
That 's because the big money is not made on labor intensive contracts , but on switching ownership of land , natural resources and other resources , including control of the drug markets and their reinvestment in our stock market and university endowments like Harvard , as opposed to local Colombian investments .
This insider trading cabal is where the real money goes . "
" That 's why DynCorp 's role as a knowledge manager ( managing federal agency databases ) is so important , " she concludes .
" It 's worth far more money than the straight - up government contract .
The profit will not show up for insider trading on DynCorp 's portfolio , but in other capital gains that flow to the players of the Chase and Council on Foreign Relations syndicates and their private and institutional portfolios . "
Outsourcing State Terrorism
This analysis of Catherine Austin Fitts , current CEO of Solari , Inc. ( www.solari.com) is probably the best model available for calculating the cost - benefit numbers in this egregious corporate - government scam .
The implications are ominous .
By subcontracting ( outsourcing ) State Terrorism to so - called " private " entities like DynCorp , the US Government abdicates any moral / ethical high ground in future confrontations .
The proverbial " Iron Fist in the Velvet Glove " of the US Military in a Global Imperial Rampage is all that 's left .
It was Executive Order 12333 that precipitated the shift during the Reagan - Bush Regime - a policy change in which so - called " national security " and " intelligence " functions were " privatized . "
Likewise the DOJ - CIA Memorandum of Understanding allowed the outsourcing of illicit drug trafficking and weapons sales to private firms and individuals .
( Regarding CIA Inspector General Fred Hitz 's cover -up of CIA drug trafficking , see " The Curious Case of the Spooky Professor " )
According to Washington Technology Magazine , this is the future .
" The global market for outsourcing of government services is growing faster than outsourcing in any commercial segment , and is likely to more than double over the next five years , according to a new study by Accenture Ltd. , " writes Patience Wait in her article " Government outsourcing grows fastest of all sectors " ( March 4 , 2002 ) .
In this outsourcing market , DynCorp has an estimated 5 % market share , while Lockheed Martin leads the proverbial pack with 30 % .
However there 's a bigger question .
When a handful of federal contracting firms with lucrative insider deals control federal accounting and computer systems , does US Government sovereignty even exist anymore ?
In other words , if the US Government and its agencies do not control their proprietary accounting , payment and information systems , it becomes even questionable whether we have a sovereign government at all .
The outsourcing of these systems , then , in essence has become a silent coup d'etat by Corporate - Government Insiders .
According to Washington Technology Magazine ( March 4 , 2002 ) , top outsourcing vendors to the US Government in fiscal 2000 are Lockheed Martin Corp ( 30 % market share ) , CSC ( 13 % ) , EDS ( 7 % ) , DynCorp ( 5 % ) , TRW ( 5 % ) , Raytheon ( 4 % ) SAIC 4 % ) Northrop Grumman ( 3 % ) and Unisys ( 2 % ) .
This is America 's Corporate / Public Enemy # 1 -- the parasitic constituents of the so - called Military - Industrial - Pharmaceutical Complex .
Now that the parasites have literally overwhelmed the host , the question remains -- how long will companies like DynCorp continue to give America the finger ?
And , more importantly , how long will America put up with the Enemy Within ?
