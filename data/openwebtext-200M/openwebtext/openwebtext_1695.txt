The “ Blind Side ” Oscar winner was at the MTV gala to pick up the Generation Award .
“ Is that an award for old people who have extended their welcome and we should make nice and leave so someone new could come in ? ” the 45 - year - old beauty quipped .
“ That ’s not going to happen .
No matter what you might have seen or heard or read lately , I love what I do , and I ’m not going anywhere . ”

Johansson , 25 — who presented the award with Betty White and Bradley Cooper — joked that she wanted to be at the show because her hubby , Ryan Reynolds , and Bullock were up for the Best Kiss award .
That ’s when Bullock walked over and delivered the playful smooch .
“ Now that we ’ve done that , can we please go back to normal ? ” asked Bullock , who made a surprise visit Saturday at the Spike TV Guys Choice Awards .
Mr Spoerri , now 80 , and several of his original picnic guests were present this week to oversee the excavation of their gargantuan meal .
He discovered that the bottles and plates were still intact but the tables had all but vanished .
He also swore that they had not used plastic cups , but these re-surfaced almost as good as new .
" It 's frightening , " he exclaimed .

What happens to child soldiers when the army they are fighting for loses the war ?
In Sri Lanka , some teenagers who fought for the Tamil Tigers have gone back to school , to be rehabilitated by an officer from the victorious government forces .
Just before 7.30 in the morning a steady stream of teenagers heads across a courtyard in Colombo 's Hindu College .
A different sort of morning parade takes place at the college
The boys have neat haircuts and crisp white shirts .
Some are sporting the sort of fluff on their upper lips that reminds me of my own 15 - year - old son .
A group of half a dozen girls pass me in a cloud of pigtails and whispers .
They line up in front of a flagpole next to a temple .
A stocky boy in a scout 's uniform raises the Sri Lankan flag , which hangs limp in the sticky heat .
Upon an unseen command the assembled youngsters deliver a tuneless , mumble of a song .
It is the Sri Lankan national anthem .
Sung in Sinhalese .
It comes to a merciful conclusion , they bow their heads and file off to the surrounding classrooms .
This is how nearly 200 former child soldiers of the Tamil Tigers start their day .
Cyanide pill
As this daily ritual unfolds in the grounds of the Hindu College my head is full of images from a different time and place ... grainy footage shot in a Tamil Tiger military camp in the 1990s .
These children mean everything to me
Bernardine Anderson , teacher Rows of girls , in their mid-teens and even younger wearing the distinctive striped fatigues of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eeelam ( LTTE ) .
They too paid their respects to a flag , the flag of a Tamil homeland .
Then each girl in turn approached a commander and was handed a cyanide pill .
This was how the Tigers prepared their children for war .
But the war is over , and when it ended hundreds of child fighters were found among the remnants of the defeated Tiger army .
What was to be done with them ?
The answer is this rehabilitation effort at Hindu College , led by Brigadier Sudantha Ranasinghe .
Resplendent in his officer 's uniform he is sitting in the school principal 's office .
" These children are victims , " he insists .
" We are giving them the chance to start again . "
He invites me to wander round the school and talk to staff and pupils .
Coping with aggression I begin in the English class being taught by Bernardine Anderson .
She is leading a group of 15 - year - olds in a sing - a - along .
" If you 're happy and you know it , clap your hands ... "
Her enthusiasm is not quite matched by her audience but there is an unmistakeable bond between teacher and class .
The shells were exploding all around us ...
I saw bodies without heads , some without limbs
Suresh , former child soldier Afterwards she tells me : " These children mean everything to me .
" I 'm Sinhalese , maybe I 'm the first Sinhalese person many of these children have ever really talked to . "
Some children , she tells me , arrived at the school angry , even aggressive .
" There was one boy , " she continues .
" He scared some of the teachers .
But a couple of months ago it was as if he just switched .
Now he 's the most caring and he wants to carry my books .
In fact you saw him this morning .
He 's the one who raised the flag . "
I ask the brigadier if I can speak to a handful of the children .
Half a dozen of the older ones - now 16 and 17 - are brought into an empty classroom .
None looks comfortable .
I hear a succession of similar stories .
' Blood everywhere '
About one third of the children recruited by the LTTE were girls The Tigers demanded one child from each family .
Training lasted for two months and then it was off to war .
One was trained to work in a medical unit , another was a driver .
Suresh was fighting on the front line .
" The shells were exploding all around us , " he says quietly .
I saw bodies without heads , some without limbs .
" There was blood everywhere . "
It is difficult talking to children about these things .
Especially when the brigadier sits , listening intently , in the corner of the room .
Later I ask him whether it is appropriate that the Sri Lankan army - the victors in a brutal war - should be in charge of the rehabilitation of these vulnerable children .
He seems affronted .
" We work with civilian teachers and psychologists .
The uniformed soldiers you see here are just to ensure the children 's security , " he says .
Beyond the college
The former child soldiers have swapped their guns for cricket bats
This summer almost all of these children will leave the Hindu College and return to their home villages in the north - east to help build a Sri Lanka freed from sectarian hatred .
But the villages and towns these students return to have barely begun to recover from the devastating war .
Many will find their families living in tents and tin shacks .
Job prospects are bleak even for those who now proudly boast O - levels after their summer exams .
And of course , there is the Sri Lankan army .
Tens of thousands of Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldiers are still deployed in the Tamil north .
The return of former LTTE child soldiers is unlikely to go unnoticed or unmonitored .
Before I leave the Hindu College , I am persuaded to join a group of boys in a game of cricket .
There is something almost surreal about the sight of boys who used to wield guns , in their whites , doing battle with bat and ball .
They are full of energy and ambition .
They have hope in their hearts .
But will it last when the Hindu College seems like a distant dream ?
All next week on HARDtalk , Stephen Sackur reports from Sri Lanka and interviews the Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa .

Apple is hyping HTML5 again , this time with a new website purporting to show open web development in action .
But the company 's standards - following rivals have pointed out the Jobsian site is peddling nonsense .
Today , Apple posted an HTML 5 Showcase demonstrating video , graphics , and typography built with HTML5 , the related CSS3 spec , and the evergreen Javascript .
The headline reads " HTML5 and web standards . "
" These web standards are open , reliable , highly secure , and efficient , " the site says .
" The demos below show how the latest version of Apple ’s Safari web browser , new Macs , and new Apple mobile devices all support the capabilities of HTML5 , CSS3 , and JavaScript .
Not all browsers offer this support .
But soon other modern browsers will take advantage of these same web standards — and the amazing things they enable web designers to do . "
That may be a reference to Microsoft .
But Mozilla , Opera , and Google support Javascript and parts of HTML5 and CSS3 in newer versions of their browsers .
And Apple 's demos only work with Safari :
Apple will show you how to build standards - compliant apps , but only in Safari
Opera Software man Haavard Moen is not amused .
" When the page does n't work in Opera or other browsers it is n't because these browsers do n't support HTML5 , " he blogged .
" It 's because Apple uses browser sniffing and vendor prefixes , and in addition to that they are n't really testing a lot of HTML5 at all .
Most of their demos seem to have got nothing to do with HTML5 , as a matter of fact . "
According to Moen , it seems that the only parts of HTML5 in the showcase are the spec 's < audio > and < video > tags .
Mike Shaver , vice president of engineering with Mozilla , the open - source operation that builds Safari-rival Firefox , was less diplomatic on Twitter .
" Having difficulty suppressing my contempt for Apple 's arrogant and ridiculous HTML5 positioning today , " he said .
While Safari implements open standards , Apple 's browser plays HTML5 video using its own CSS3 code prefixes — all vendors use their own code prefixes — and it uses the patent - backed H.264 video codec .
Thus , its video demos wo n't work in Opera or Firefox because its two rivals refuse to use H.264 , preferring open and royalty - free coding instead .
Apple , along with Microsoft and others , is part of the patent pool that licenses H.264 to the rest of the world .
Meanwhile .
Adobe Software was quick to pick up on the ballsy irony of it all .
John Nack , Photoshop product manager , Tweeted : " A Web standards demo that does n't work across browsers reminds me of lame , counterproductive Flash Player demos . "
Apple 's chief executive has been busy of late hammering as many nails as possible in to the coffin of Adobe 's prized Flash Player .
He has banned Flash from the iPhone and iPad , and at the D8 conference this week , he called it an old technology .
Apple , Jobs said , is betting on the future : HTML5 .
" The video looks better and it works better and you do n't need a plug - in to run it .
And while 75 percent of the video on the web may be available in Flash , a lot of it is available in HTML5 as well , " Jobs said .
Jobs ' D8 appearance and the HTML5 showcase are the latest chapter in Steve Jobs ' very public bashing of Flash and hyping of HTML5 .
Hardcore Javascripters
Ext JS last week complained about Apple hammering on about HTML5 video as an alternative to Flash , saying it 's starting to confuse people over what HTML5 is and what it does .
Products vice president Michael Mullany said HTML5 is becoming " unhinged from reality " because a lot of what people think is HTML5 is actually CSS .
CSS is a member of a family of related HMTL5 technologies that includes Web Workers to run tasks in the background of a browser , Web Storage to store string data in a key - value pair database , and Web Sockets for server communications .
The core HTML spec is mostly invisible to end users and cleans up the code while allowing what is currently done with styling , Javascript , or server workarounds to be done in HTML .
Also , after four years , HTML5 is still a work in progress and debate is still underway on some of the finer points , such as meter tags and semantic elements . ®

The late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd rose from West Virginia poverty to become a master of pork barrel politics .
Senate loses ' venerable institution '
Sen. Robert C. Byrd died in a Virginia hospital early Monday morning , ending an extraordinary Senate career that began two years before President Barack Obama was born .
Byrd was 92 — the longest - serving senator in U.S. history — and his career produced a kaleidoscope of images that reflect his unique place in American history .
Advertisement
He belonged to the Klan in the 1940s and filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , but he went on to endorse the nation 's first black president .
An orphan child who rose from West Virginia poverty , he became a master of pork - barrel politics , and his name graces federal buildings throughout his home state .
Byrd was first elected to the House in 1952 — the same year Gen .
Dwight Eisenhower was elected president .
He arrived in the Senate in 1959 ; Hawaii and Alaska had just been admitted to the Union .
Lyndon B. Johnson was the majority leader .
And if LBJ was the master of the Senate , Byrd would become the keeper of its rules and traditions — a guardian of a realm that few understood .
It 's not a stretch to say that he wrote the book on the Senate — he authored a four - volume history of the upper chamber — which is why so many of his younger , more energetic colleagues continued to defer to him when it came to Senate rules and procedures .
" We will remember him for his fighter 's spirit , his abiding faith , and for the many times he recalled the Senate to its purposes , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) said Monday morning .
" Generations of Americans will read the masterful history of the Senate he leaves behind , and they will also read about the remarkable life of Robert Carlyle Byrd . "
Byrd 's desk on the Senate floor was draped in black Monday morning — a final sign of respect for the man who made the chamber his home for more than a half century .
White flowers , like those that adorned the late Kennedy 's desk when he passed nearly a year ago , were expected to be delivered later Monday .
Flags flew at half mast across the Capitol .
As the Senate opened Monday afternoon , the tributes flowed from several senators .
The president ’s statement Monday morning seemed to acknowledge Byrd ’s evolution in his views on race .
“ Senator Byrd ’s story was uniquely American .
He was born into wrenching poverty , but educated himself to become an authoritative scholar , respected leader , and unparalleled champion of our Constitution , ” Obama said .
“ He scaled the summit of power , but his mind never strayed from the people of his beloved West Virginia .
He had the courage to stand firm in his principles , but also the courage to change over time . ”
“… The people of West Virginia have lost a true champion , the United States Senate has lost a venerable institution , and America has lost a voice of principle , ” Obama said .
Byrd was hospitalized last week for dehydration , but his condition deteriorated quickly .
Doctors said Sunday that he was seriously ill , and his office announced his death at about 5:15 a.m. Monday .
" I am saddened that the family of U.S. Sen. Robert C. Byrd , D - W.Va. , tearfully announces the passing of the longest serving member of Congress in U.S. history , " Jesse Jacobs wrote in a message to reporters .
Byrd had been in the hospital frequently over the past two years , including an extended stay back in March .
He was rarely seen in the Senate in recent months , but he made it to several key floor votes over the past year .
His death follows by nearly a year that of his friend , Sen .
Ted Kennedy , to whom he delivered a tearful tribute on the floor .
Sen . John Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) remembered his colleague Monday as a man who never forgot his roots .
" Sen .
Byrd came from humble beginnings in the southern coal fields , was raised by hardworking West Virginians , and triumphantly rose to the heights of power in America , " said Rockefeller .
" But he never forgot where he came from nor who he represented , and he never abused that power for his own gain . "
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tried to capture Byrd ’s place in American history : “ Robert Byrd ’s was one of the greatest minds the world has ever seen .
From his graduation as valedictorian of his high school class at the age of 16 to his chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee until the age of 91 , he mastered everything he touched with great thoughtfulness and skill . ”
Byrd held virtually every major leadership post in the Senate , but he is perhaps best known for running the Appropriations Committee , which helped him build a reputation for funneling federal money to projects in his economically depressed home state .
Anyone who has driven the scenic byways of West Virginia , visited the state 's national parks or stopped by the federal courthouse in
Charleston , W.Va. , has borne witness to his power — Byrd 's name is everywhere .
Last January , Senate Democratic leaders gently nudged Byrd out of the Appropriations chairmanship , realizing he did not have the stamina to run the high energy , powerful committee .
Byrd 's 50 years in the Senate broke the record previously held by another legend , Strom Thurmond of South Carolina .
Byrd had grown frail in recent years .
But when he was able to muster the energy and keep his shaking hand at bay , he could still deliver the type of stemwinder speech that made him a hero to the impoverished coal country voters who first put him in office more than half - century ago .
While younger senators — meaning those in their 60s — relied on staff - written speeches and colorful pie charts on the Senate floor , Byrd could quote Thoreau , Madison and Paul 's Letter to the Corinthians virtually by memory .
When he got going , it was not unusual to see staff , journalists and tourists in the gallery stop what they were doing and lean in to listen to his speeches , realizing that his voice represented a soon - to - be - lost era in American politics .
In the previous administration , he would criticize President George W. Bush 's war policies , bellowing " Shame ! Shame ! " in a way that recalled the Roman Senate .
Byrd always carried a pocket edition of the U.S. Constitution in his suit pocket and liberally quoted the Bible .
In an increasingly technology - driven political world , Byrd was seen by some as an anachronism .
He often apologized for his early views on race and , in recent years , became one of the most reliably liberal votes in the Senate .
He was one of the sharpest critics of the war in Iraq , and in 2003 warned his colleagues that the anger over the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks was being misdirected into an unnecessary war .
Byrd was born Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. in 1917 in North Wilkesboro , N.C.
When his mother died , his father handed over custody to his aunt and uncle , Vlurma and Titus Byrd , who adopted him and raised Robert Byrd in Southern West Virginia .
Byrd graduated first in his class in high school in 1935 and later married his high school sweetheart , Erma , according to Congressional Quarterly 's " Politics in America . "
They remained married for 68 years until her death in 2006 — and Byrd often boasted that he 'd married a real - life " coal miner 's daughter . "
As a widower , Byrd remained in mourning for some time , visiting his wife 's grave nearly daily .
He openly wept for her on the Senate floor last year .
And even though Byrd was a master of the Senate , the people of West Virginia never turned against him as a Washington insider .
He never lost an election — he first ran for the West Virginia statehouse in 1946 , and in his first campaign he lured voters to his speeches by playing bluegrass tunes on his fiddle .
In nine Senate elections , he never received less than 64 percent of the vote .
" There are four things people believe in in West Virginia , " Byrd once said .
" God Almighty , Sears Roebuck , Carter 's Little Liver Pills and Robert C. Byrd . "

The best policy remains " Improved and Expanded Medicare for All " : a single universal " All America " insurance pool .
There should be no issues of adverse selection .
Everybody - in and Nobody - out .
It would be paid for by the same progressive taxation we pay for other federal government goods and services including social security , military security and payment on the interest of the national debt .
There would guaranteed and automatic enrollment .
In addition to getting rid of the problem of adverse selection there would be the savings from getting rid of the private insurance companies as a wasteful unnecessary intermediary .
There would be the additional cost savings benefit from monospony ( single buyer , multiple sellers ) in paying for services , equipment and drugs .
There would be added benefits of global budgeting and strategic planning .
So that is the policy that we are still fighting for .
As single - issue advocates , it is the role of PNHP and others to advocate for what we believe is the best policy .
It is not our role to engage in short - term mediocre compromise ( there are plenty of well - funded folks out there doing that ) .
Now as to what our tactics and strategy should be to get from here to there is another question ...?
Before the Clinton 's in 1994 , we were there fighting for real universal health care , including the modern single payer proposal dating back to at least 1989 .
After their defeat , not by us , but by the predicted double - dealing of the corporate forces that they thought they had on board ( while rejecting even having us in the room ) , we were still there .
During the interregnum , from 1994 to 2008 , when nobody else was fighting for real universal health care , we were still there building the grass roots , doing the research and developing policy .
Thanks to us , between 2003 and 2009 national independent polls from the Washington Post / ABC , AP / Yahoo , NY Times / CBS , and others show 60 - 70 % for single payer ( essentially all the 2009 - 2010 polls claiming to show 70 % support for public option were support for single payer ; but never mind ) .
Since the 2008 election , during the recent health care reform fight , we have been there pulling the debate from the left , while the forces of greed and reaction were fighting against change .
Whether we were welcome to the table or not , we were there .
Even while the candidate that had promised a public option and no mandates , and full transparency with no back room deals or rule by corporate lobbyists , had become the president cutting secret deals with Pharma and giving up on public option while pushing for mandates to buying knowingly defective over - priced for - profit private insurance .
And while acknowledging that there are some benefits in the reform that did pass , we will still be there fighting for real reform forward :
We still believe that the " reform " will not control individual costs ; you will still be paying too much , with out of pockets costs acting as a barrier to seeking and getting the care you need , while still being subject to medical bankruptcy if you get sick .
It will not control total system costs with more being paid individuals , families , businesses , local and state government , as well as the federal government over time .
It will not result in universal insurance coverage nor universal health care access .
And yes , too much of the reform is still de facto support for the insurance companies .
And you still cannot make a profit insuring sick people .
But there is a legitimate debate to be had about what the tactics and strategy should be moving forward .
What should we keep doing the same as before ?
What should be doing new or differently ?
Just some examples :
How should we go about grass roots organizing ?
We have been creating local and state organizations , and working with progressives .
PNHP specifically targets medical students , residents and physicians , working with their education system , conducting grand rounds , meeting with medical societies , writing letters and editorials , trying to get into the media .
On a separate track has been getting statements and resolutions endorsing single payer in general and the HR - 676 bill proposal by various organizations such as ( but not limited to ) unions , health professional organizations and even state and local legislatures .
What else should we doing in America outside in of the beltway ?
How should we play the Washington game ?
So far , it has consisted primarily of having a bill ( e.g. , HR - 676 ) and getting congress - critter to sign on as co-sponsors .
One specific apparent mistake was having the lead sponsor ( Conyers ) be chair of the wrong committee ( Judiciary ) .
Clearly to help get a bill actually moved , to say nothing of OMB analysis , it needs to have stronger targeted sponsorship within the appropriate committee .
What else should we be doing inside the beltway ?
Who do we reach out and ally with ?
Who will have us on mutually agreeable terms ?
Who , in addition to the insurance companies , do we criticize ?
Should there be a separate PAC spun - off to funnel money to candidates who support single payer ?
Should we oppose , endorse , or be neutral or silent about limited expansion of Medicare say to those between the ages of 50 - 65 , especially when it is based on a " purchase as insurance " model and not paid for by universal taxation model , as in the Grayson proposal ?
Should we oppose , endorse , or be neutral or silent about " all - Payer " as a step - wise interim reform , such as already exists in Maryland , wherein all insurers ( private , Medicare , etc ) pay the same reimbursement rates for the same services rendered at any hospital ?
Should we oppose , endorse , or be neutral or silent about other suggested reforms around payment mechanisms , such as limitations and reform around physician fee - for - service .
The ability , or not , of the so - called Accountable Care Organization model ( Kaiser , Mayo Clinic , Cleveland Clinic , Geisinger , etc. ) to deliver comprehensive care at lower cost and higher quality ?
Is it valid ?
Does it have much relative importance ?
Even if valid , can they be expanded and spread around enough to become a large enough part of the American system to make a real difference .
Is this something for single payer advocates to oppose , endorse , or be neutral or silent about ?
The validity , relative importance , and other issues around the Dartmouth Atlas and " over - treated " and controlling unnecessary or counterproductive specialty care and hospital services .
Is this something for single payer advocates to oppose , endorse , or be neutral or silent about ?
What is the utility of other reforms , that are happening to a limited degree to increase access to services , such as the expansion of NHSC and Community Health Centers .
Can they be expanded and spread around enough to become a large enough part of the American system to make a real difference ?
Is this something for single payer advocates to oppose , endorse , or be neutral or silent about ?
Another reform out there is to better control the number of number doctors going into different specialties ( e.g. , more into primary care ; less plastic surgeons ) .
This could involve more active control over the absolute and relative number of residency and fellowship training positions , as well as changing reimbursement rates so that primary care pays better and some specialty and procedure - based care and hospital care get less than they do now .
Is this something for single payer advocates to oppose , endorse , or be neutral or silent about ?
Within any given practice or service , there could be higher reimbursement rates for practicing in inner city ghetto and rural and other " undesirable " places with high unmet need ; and similarly lower reimbursement for practicing in Bel Air and Park Avenue .
Is this something for single payer advocates to oppose , endorse , or be neutral or silent about ?
Similarly , the wider use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants and other health care workers related to changes in state - practice acts and what is a reimbursable service .
Is this something for single payer advocates to oppose , endorse , or be neutral or silent about ?

Peace & Health
The politician 's delight
THE trouble with water is that it is all politics , no economics .
The costs of poor management are large : groundwater depletion takes 2.1 % off Jordan 's GDP ; water pollution and scarcity knock 2.3 % off China 's ; 11 % of Kenya 's was lost to flooding in 1997 - 98 , and 16 % to drought in the next two years .
Rich countries build sewers , drains , dams , reservoirs , flood defences , irrigation canals and barrages to avoid such problems .
Poor countries , with some exceptions , notably China , find large projects much more difficult .
But at least large projects give politicians a monument to boast about .
Small projects — weirs and wells and waterworks — have no allure for big - headed politicians .
That is a pity .
A small dam is relatively cheap to construct : modest reservoirs known in India as tanks used to be built and maintained by local villagers .
For a millennium they provided water in times of need and helped make rulers like the nizams of Hyderabad some of the richest men in the world .
Now they are often silted up , polluted with pesticides , metals and phosphorus , or built on .
In Kenya , by contrast , small dams are coming into fashion .
Rainwater is channelled into sand catchments , which serve both to filter it and to protect it from evaporation .
Some goes into nearby soil , for crops , some into groundwater from which it can later be recovered .
In Niger a 15 - year project involving dams and reclamation has restored nearly 20,000 hectares of unproductive land to forestry or agricultural use .
Everyone loves projects like these , especially if they can be given a romantic name like water harvesting .
Some , perhaps , may simply be intercepting water for one user that would otherwise have gone to another , but almost every country could reduce its evaporation losses by capturing water and delivering it more effectively to the farmer , bather , drinker or manufacturer — and then , ideally , using it again .
The harder question is whether that is enough .
Many believe it is not .
Throughout history , man has made efforts to control water , divert it by means of canals , carry it via aqueducts , store it in reservoirs , harness it with water wheels and so on .
The costs of these endeavours have been huge : valleys flooded , villages and habitats destroyed , wetlands drained and inland seas reduced to mere puddles .
But the benefits have also been enormous .
The Aswan high dam , for example , is often cited as a cautionary example , a quixotic construction that now reduces the mighty Nile to a dribble before it trickles to the sea , leaving behind an explosion of water hyacinth , outbreaks of bilharzia , polluted irrigation channels and a build - up of sediment inland that would otherwise compensate for coastal erosion from Egypt to Lebanon .
Yet , according to the World Bank , it has provided a bulwark against flooding for buildings and crops , a huge expansion of farming and Nile navigation ( lots of tourism ) and enough electricity for the whole of Egypt — all of which amounts to the equivalent each year of 2 % of GDP in net benefits .
So would the World Bank today lend money for an Aswan dam if it did not already exist ?
The bank has been involved in few of the 200 or so large dams built in the past five years , but that is mainly because dam - builders — of which China is much the biggest — do not care for the bank 's time - and money - consuming regulations , designed to ensure decent technical , social and environmental standards .
Their strictness partly reflects greater knowledge about the consequences of building dams , partly the related political controversies of the 1980s .
Even so , the bank was involved in 101 dam and hydro projects in 2007 , up from 89 in 1997 and 76 in 2003 ; and it approved over $ 800 m in hydro lending in 2008 , up from $ 250 m in 2002 .
Suspicions of big dams still run high — and with some reason .
Mr Thakkar , scrutineer of the Indian water scene , says that although the installed capacity of India 's hydro projects increased at a compound rate of 4.4 % a year between 1991 and 2005 , the amount of energy generated actually fell .
Some of the projects , poorly sited or poorly designed , were doomed to be uneconomic from the start .
Others have been badly maintained or have simply silted up .
But though 89 % of the country 's hydro projects operate below design capacity , the building continues wastefully apace .
Mr Thakkar argues that small projects offer much better returns , even for the crucial task of refilling aquifers by capturing monsoon rainfall .
He points to the success of micro-irrigation in semi-arid Gujarat , whose agriculture has grown at an average of 9.6 % a year since the turn of the century , partly thanks to the creation of 500,000 small ponds , dams and suchlike .
But India , says Mr Thakkar , is still obsessed with big projects like the Bhakhra dam that the country 's first prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , saw as one of the “ temples ” of Indian modernity .
Only when the small temples can no longer provide solutions does he see a need for big ones .
Not all the big temples are dams .
India has a dormant but not dead $ 120 billion scheme to bring “ surplus ” water from north to south by linking up the country 's main rivers .
China has its south - north equivalent , which , if it comes to pass , may involve spending $ 62 billion and shifting 250,000 people .
Spain had its Ebro scheme , involving 830 km of waterways , now abandoned , though some Spaniards remain wistful .
Each of these has , or had , beguiling attractions , but vast costs .
Big can also be beautiful
Dams and reservoirs certainly need constant repairs and careful maintenance and do not always get them , usually because the necessary institutions are not in place .
But when they are , a well - sited dam or embankment can transform lives for the better .
In the late 1970s John Briscoe , an old water hand at the World Bank who is now at Harvard , spent a year in a Bangladeshi village and predicted terrible consequences if a proposed flood - control and irrigation scheme were to go ahead .
It did , but on his return 22 years later he found the new embankment had vastly improved every aspect of the villagers ' lives .
He became an advocate of large projects .
In the rich world these are now largely unnecessary ; the damage has been done and the benefits are being reaped .
Southern California is an example , a region that gets all its water expensively from either the north of the state or the Colorado , a river so dammed and drained that it dies long before it reaches its delta — 7,500 square kilometres of wetlands formerly crammed with wildlife , now invaded by the salty Pacific .
But Hollywood survives , and in it such environmentalists as James Cameron , the director of “ Avatar ” and new champion of the Amazonian opponents of the planned Belo Monte dam in Brazil .
Overdammed Colorado
Many Ethiopians would be happy to have a few dams .
Their GDP rises and falls in near synch with their rainfall , which varies wildly from year to year .
If they had more storage , they could use it to get through the country 's frequent droughts , but their man-made storage amounts to only 30 cubic metres per person , compared with 6,000 in the United States .
Ethiopia 's electricity consumption per person is among the lowest in the world , whereas its potential for hydro power is one of the highest .
Indeed , electricity could be a valuable export .
Africa as a whole stands to benefit from more hydro projects , large and small .
Climate change seems likely to shorten the rainy seasons and intensify variability , making storage even more important .
Moreover , Africa seems likely to suffer more from climate change than other continents .
As it is , it contains 35 of the 45 most “ water - stressed ” countries .
Hydro generation uses a known and tested technology that neither adds directly to greenhouse gases nor produces nuclear waste .
Last month the World Bank announced a controversial $ 3.75 billion loan for a coal - fired plant in South Africa .
Some hydro projects might be no more unpopular .
Congo's Inga dams , for example , have the potential to provide the equivalent of South Africa 's existing capacity .
The South African authorities would be pleased to have it today .
Their fingers are crossed that the hydro power from Mozambique will not cut out during the football World Cup next month .
May 16 , 2010  --
A pair of boats stolen and then abandoned and a burglary may be the latest escapades in the on - going crime spree of a teenager who has alternately terrorized a group of small islands in the Pacific Northwest and won an international fanbase as an anti-hero .
Colton Harris - Moore , 18 , is suspected in dozens of burglaries of homes and businesses and the thefts of four planes , each of which he crashed .
Police , aided by federal agents , closed in on him in March in San Juan County , but he evaded capture yet again , sneaking off into the woods he has become so adept at disappearing into .
After the San Juan County Sheriff 's Office received a report early today of a sport fishing boat stolen from a private marina on Lopez Island , and at the same time learned from the Coast Guard that the same boat had been found abandoned and floating off Camano Island in neighboring Island County , they put two and two together .
" This incident is being investigated as another possible criminal event involving Colton Harris - Moore , " Sheriff William Cumming said in a statement released today .
The sheriff said the theft today may be linked a recent boat theft and burglary that occurred on San Juan Island .
Investigators from the two counties are working together on the cases , Cumming said .
Harris - Moore has been a thorn in the side of police in Washington 's San Juan Islands for years , and officials have told ABC's Seattle affiliate KOMO - TV that his haul may total $ 1.5 million .
He 's done most of his damage in Orcas and Camano islands , frustrating and exhausting the bare bones police force that have also had to contend with persistent questions about why they can't keep up with an 18 - year - old kid .
" It 's changed , and not in a good way , our life style , " Orcas Island resident Bob Friel said of Harris - Moore 's capers .
" The crime level is extremely low and then suddenly you 've got kind of this boogeyman who moves around in the woods at night and breaks into people 's houses . "
Friel is a writer whose article on Harris - Moore was featured in Outside Magazine .
He told ABCNews.com in April that he was close to inking a book deal with Hyperion Books and was in talks with 20th Century Fox and Hollywood director David Gordon Green about a movie based on his book proposal .
Harris - Moore is suspected in the Feb. 11 break - in at Kyle Ater 's Homegrown Market & Gourmet Delicatessen on Orcas Island where he allegedly left a drawing of bare feet in an apparent homage to his nickname the " Barefoot Bandit . "
Ater said Harris - Moore caused a $ 6,500 loss at his store , including the destruction of his security system .
Ater said that when the intruder was unable to remove the hard drive from the security system , he simply put the monitor in the sink and drowned it .
Colton Harris - Moore : the Next John Dillinger ?
Friel compared Harris - Moore 's escapades to those of famed bank robber John Dillinger .
who earned the ire of police but a cult - like following from everyday Americans during the Depression .
But the difference , Friel said , is that Harris - Moore is n't robbing banks , he 's robbing hard - working Americans .
He hopes his book will clear up a lot of the fantasy brewing about the young man who grew up with his single mother in a beat - up single - wide trailer on Camano Island .
" One of the worst misconceptions is he 's only hurting rich people , " he said .
" These are small business owners . "
Die -hard fans are hoping the teen never gets caught .
There are online fan clubs and tributes posted on YouTube .
A Seattle printing company last year began printing T - shirts with his name and likeness .
A Facebook page in his honor boasts more than 27,000 fans .
There are some comments denouncing his alleged crimes and pleading with him to turn himself in , but most encourage Harris - Moore .
" Keep going , Colton .
The world is your oyster , " one poster wrote .
" So long as you do n't hurt anybody kiddo you 're OK in my book , " another wrote .
" Property 's just property and it's all insured .
We 're all rooting for you and stay free ! "
Bold Burglar Makes Off With Cash , Croissants
Ater said he believes Harris - Moore has broken into his store twice , though he has no evidence of the first hit two years ago .
When police were investigating a string of burglaries that could possibly be tied to the teen over the summer , Ater said he slept in his store with his gun and 70 - pound dogs .
He did n't expect to be burglarized in February , the off - season in the mostly tourist town .
The attack on his store in February came the same night a stolen plane came down on Orcas Island .
Ater said he 's heard Harris - Moore allegedly kills the engine and glides in as to not alert anyone to his presence .
Officials have said the planes were all damaged from hard landings and that it appears Harris - Moore 's only training comes from a flight instruction manual that he allegedly bought with a stolen credit card .
In addition to $ 1,200 from the cash register , Ater 's burglar also made off with a blueberry cheesecake , water , organic produce , meat and a baker 's tray of uncooked croissants filled with meat and cheese .
" How do you carry that ? "
Ater wondered .
Ater said he has since installed an upgraded security system to replace the one that Harris - Moore allegedly drowned .
The store owner said that put a serious crimp in his budget .
" But that does n't mean anything , " Ater said , " when dealing with him . "
Roy Keane has launched a passionate defence of Fabio Capello and believes the blame for England 's World Cup exit lies solely at the door of the players .
The Ipswich Town manager said England 's players " get away with murder " for a series of poor performances .
" To keep criticising and questioning the manager is crazy .
He did n't do anything wrong in the qualifying campaign and now , all of a sudden , he 's not the top man any more , " Keane said .
" The goals they conceded against Germany , particularly the first couple , had nothing to do with Capello 's choice of system or tactics .
It was n't a case of getting overrun in midfield .
It was just very bad defending . "
" They should just leave him to get on with the job .
He is absolutely brilliant and England are lucky to have him . "
Keane , who walked out of the Republic of Ireland 's 2002 World Cup camp after a spat with his manager , Mick McCarthy , believes the majority of England 's players are overhyped .
" They have to take a long hard look at themselves .
They get away with murder , " he said .
" I was n't really surprised by the Germany defeat .
I keep saying it – good players do n't necessarily make good teams .
People keep talking about world class players but who are they ? " he added .
" There 's probably only Wayne Rooney , who had a brilliant season .
But look at the goalkeepers .
David James was relegated with Portsmouth and Robert Green just about stayed up with West Ham .
Glen Johnson did okay at Liverpool but they had a poor enough season .
" John Terry ?
He had his issues and I do n't think he had a great season .
Chelsea may have won the Premiership and FA Cup double but that was more down to some world class attacking players .
" Matthew Upson did n't have a great season at West Ham and Ashley Cole , to be fair to the boy , has just come back from injury .
" James Milner had a good season but Gareth Barry was very average for Manchester City .
Emile Heskey started the World Cup up front but he only scored three Premiership goals for Aston Villa . "
Apple is trying to go where Google failed by selling unlocked phones directly to customers in Canada through its website .
Customers can purchase the eight - gigabyte iPhone 3GS for its full cost of $ 549 , or the upcoming iPhone 4 , which does not yet have a price listed on Apple 's website .
The customer is then free to go shopping for the best monthly service deal they can find , the company said .
" When you purchase your iPhone from the Apple Online Store , you 'll get it commitment - free .
So you can sign up for service with the carrier of your choice and change your carrier at any time , " the website said .
In Canada , this means iPhone owners have considerable choice since Bell , Rogers and Telus all have networks that can accommodate Apple 's devices .
Bell 's and Rogers ' respective subsidiary brands , Virgin and Fido , also offer iPhone service plans .
All three carriers sell the iPhone in their own stores , typically at a discount in exchange for a multi - year service plan commitment .
The carriers also lock their iPhones so that they wo n't work on competitors ' networks .
Apple 's move , however , will force the carriers to compete for the business of customers with unlocked iPhones , possibly even on a monthly basis .
Customers will only need to buy a Subscriber Identity Module ( SIM ) or micro-SIM , which typically sell for about $ 10 , to switch to a different carrier .
Similarly , unlocked iPhones will also work internationally on any GSM network , Apple said .
Owners can therefore purchase a SIM or micro-SIM from a local carrier and avoid hefty international roaming charges from Bell , Rogers and Telus .
Apple 's effort mirrors a move by Google earlier this year to cut wireless carriers out of the equation .
The internet company began selling its unlocked Nexus One phone directly to customers online in the United States , then expanded the offer to Canadians in March .
In May , however , Google announced that it will eventually cease direct sales and instead adopt the traditional model of selling through carriers , complete with contracts and subsidies .
Analysts said the change in direction was because of poor sales , a result of Google 's lack of familiarity with selling retail products .
Apple , however , has a well - established online sales channel .
The issue of technological locks is bubbling in Canada with the government 's recent , controversial proposal to update copyright laws .
While Bill C - 32 , unveiled earlier in June , would outlaw the breaking of digital locks on hardware or media , it does provide an express exception on mobile phones , an act that is currently legal .
A number of countries have laws stipulating that carriers must unlock phones , usually after a certain period of time or sometimes right from the point of sale .
Consumer advocates have said similar laws are needed here , but carriers have said locks are needed in order to ensure that devices work properly on their networks .
Back to what really matters in Ohio .
College chicks and spring football .

RE : What you might see at Ohio State ’s Spring Game
I ’m sending this post in from the R Bar in Columbus , Ohio where the beloved ( by someone I ’m sure ) Columbus Blue Jackets are about to be swept out of the playoffs by our rivals to the north , the Detroit Red Wings .
I ’m not sure if Red Wings is one or two words .
I have n’t played “ NHL 96 ” in quite a while .
I built a juggernaut with the Winnipeg Jets .
I ’m at this bar because of its location to Nationwide Arena .
After the games , the Blue Jackets cheerleader girls are known to frequent the place .
I can console .
We have lots of experience with that in Ohio .
With hockey ending here in Ohio ’s capital city , tomorrow we can turn our attention back to the things that matter .
Hot chicks tailgating at Ohio State football games .
Tomorrow Ohio States ’s Scarlet plays the Gray in the Spring Game at Ohio Stadium .
Around 80,000 people will show up to watch the scrimmage and then spend the next two months discussing each play .
I have never been to a spring game .
I used to go to scrimmages when my uncles coached sixth - grade football when I was but a little tike .
I was the water boy but got to wear a jersey .
Already taking part in a scrimmage , per se , I have little desire to witness another .
We ’ll see plenty of girls in jerseys tomorrow at the Spring Game .
Spring games around the United States are a fantastic idea .
There ’s no preseason in college football ( no matter what SEC teams out - of - conference schedules tell you ) so these scrimmages give fans a chance to sit back and watch ( the hot chicks tailgating ) without caring about the outcome .
Unless you ’re one of the 80,000 people talking about the spring game for the next two months .

MenuMeters
MenuMeters cannot be used on 10.11 El Capitan , please see " System Requirements " below .
Introduction
MenuMeters is a set of CPU , memory , disk , and network monitoring tools for Mac OS X .
Although there are numerous other programs which do the same thing , none had quite the feature set I was looking for .
Most were windows that sat in a corner or on the desktop , which are inevitably obscured by document windows on a laptop 's small screen .
Those monitors which used the menubar mostly used the NSStatusItem API , which has the annoying tendency to totally reorder my menubar on every login .
The MenuMeters monitors are true SystemUIServer plugins ( also known as Menu Extras ) .
This means they can be reordered using command - drag and remember their positions in the menubar across logins and restarts .
The CPU Meter can display system load both as a total percentage , or broken out as user and system time .
It can also graph user and system load and display the load as a " thermometer " .
The menu for the CPU Meter contains several pieces of information I like to have a single click away .
The Disk Activity Meter displays disk activity to local disks on the system ( anything that is a IOKit BlockStorage driver ) .
It is hotplug aware , and will show activity on FireWire and USB disks as they are mounted .
The Disk Meter menu shows volume space details for local drives ( it does not display mounted network volumes for performance reasons ) .
The Memory Meter can display current memory usage as either a pie chart , thermometer , history graph , or as used / free totals .
The Memory Meter menu shows a breakdown of current memory usage and VM statistics .
The Memory Meter can optionally display a paging indicator light .
The Net Meter can display network throughput as arrows , bytes per second , and / or as a graph .
Both the arrows and the graph are scaled using a user - selected scaling factor and calculation .
Scaling can be done on the basis of actual link speed reported by the network interface or peak traffic and can use one of several scaling calculations .
The Net Meter menu shows current interfaces and their status .
Interface information is gathered from the SystemConfiguraton framework and thus is Mac OS X network location aware ( to prevent interfaces from appearing in this menu see the FAQ ) .
MenuMeters comes without warranty or support .
That said , if it causes you problems I 'd like to hear about it so that I may be able to track down the bug .
Even better , since this is open source , you can fix the bug yourself .
Patches are accepted .

System Requirements
Due to new Apple - enforced code signature restrictions , MenuMeters is not compatible with the OS X 10.11 " El Capitan " public beta .
Although the restriction is similar , this is not directly related to 10.11's " System Integrity Protection " ( SIP , aka " rootless " ) feature and disabling SIP has no effect on MenuMeters .
Unless Apple makes the signature restriction optional , it is not clear that MenuMeters in its present form can ever be made compatible with OS X 10.11 .
In the meantime I can only suggest that you do not install 10.11 if you wish to use MenuMeters .
Mac OS X 10.4 or later ( 10.10 supported , 10.11 incompatible )
PowerPC or Intel based Macintosh ( Universal Binary )

A man named Francisco Olvera found out what happens when he was arrested for " illegal photography " by an officer in Sealy , Texas :
Olvera says the trouble started when Alderete responded to a complaint of loud music coming from his home .
In front of the home , Alderete asked Olvera to show identification and as Olvera walked into his house to get it , Alderete followed him in .
" Olvera did not believe that Alderete had the authority to enter Olvera 's residence and , therefore , took a picture of Alderete using his cell phone , " the complaint states .
Olvera claims that Alderete saw a can of beer on a kitchen counter , next to Olvera 's wallet , and immediately handcuffed him .

The grounds for arrest were supposedly illegal photography , public intoxication , and loud music .
In the end though , Olvera was acquitted of all charges and is now even seeking punitive damages from the city over his ordeal .

Australian Border Force members have foiled a large - scale attempt to bring drugs into Australia hidden inside cans of coconut milk .
A consignment of 86 boxes sent from Thailand to an address in Western Sydney was deemed to be suspicious by the ABF .
Upon testing the substance inside the cans , it was found to be liquid methamphetamine .
Police sting operation nets two suspects
The ABF then referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police , who this week set up a sting operation and arranged a controlled delivery of the consignment to a warehouse in the suburb of Girraween , NSW .
When two people – a 29 - year - old woman and 20 - year - old man – arrived to take delivery of the goods , they were pounced on by AFP officers and arrested .
They were each charged with one count of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug , namely methamphetamine .

Maximum penalty is life imprisonment
A statement from the Federal Police says the maximum sentence for the offence is life imprisonment .
The total weight of the drugs is still being determined , but is estimated to be approximately 600 litres of liquid methamphetamine .
The street value of the consignment will only be known once the weight has been determined .
Further arrests have not been ruled out
AFP Detective Superintendent Geoffrey Turner said a dedicated team of officers is working on the investigation and further arrests have not been ruled out .
“ We are still investigating this matter to determine the role of everyone involved in this large - scale importation of liquid methamphetamine . ”
“ We will also liaise with our international partners to try and identify the organised crime syndicate behind this importation – only a well - resourced organised crime syndicate would be able to finance and facilitate an importation of this scale , ” Turner said .
‘ A clever concealment , ’ says ABF
A spokesperson for the Border Force , Acting NSW Regional Commander Matthew O’Connor , said : “ This is a clever concealment but our highly - trained officers come across tens of thousands of packages a week and they know if something is n’t right .

“ No matter how criminals try to conceal their drugs , ABF officers have the technology and skills to find them and the penalties can be severe . ”
The two arrested people were refused bail at Sydney Central Local Court .
Their next court date is 4 November .

The tiny fern was clinging to a precarious existence on a mountain ridge
In a small , noisy laboratory , tucked away in London 's Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew , a tiny plant is growing .
It looks just like a very small parsley bush , but it is actually a very special little plant indeed .
Clean air has to be constantly circulated in the lab to protect it from any bacteria .
This precious specimen is the Anogramma ascensionis fern , commonly known as the parsley fern .
Since the 1950s , botanists believed it to be extinct .
It is native to Ascension - an island in the South Atlantic , which is one of Britain 's overseas territories .
And a small project supported by Kew 's overseas territories programme has rediscovered and rescued it - a timely success story , as this year has been dubbed International Year of Biodiversity .
Plants are such an important component of our lives ... and extinction is forever Colin Club , Kew overseas territories programme leader
Kew botanist Phil Lamden and local conservation officer Stedson Stroud found the plucky little plant clinging to a precarious existence on a mountainside in the harsh volcanic landscape .
" We were down the back of Ascension 's Green Mountain , which has very , very steep slopes .
You have to be really careful because if you slip you 're a goner , " Mr Stroud recalled .
" And we came across this beautiful little fern and immediately knew it was the lost Anogramma that had been extinct for the last 60 years . "
Ascension is covered by bleak , forbidding lava flows , and only 10 plant species are known to be truly " endemic " - found nowhere else in the world .
Image caption Stedson Stroud ( left ) scrambled down the mountain to tend the plants
According to Kew scientists , goats that were released on to Ascension by Portuguese explorers in the 1500s , ate their way voraciously through the island 's greenery for 350 years before any of the flora was even described to science .
The introduction of more invasive herbivores - rabbits , sheep , rats and donkeys , together with over 200 species of invasive plants , further squeezed out the island 's original plant inhabitants .
The rediscovery of Anogramma boosts to seven the number of surviving endemic plant species on the island .
Mr Stroud said that , in the excitement , both of the researchers " forgot where they were " .
" We were scrambling around , looking to see if there were more , and then we realised , we should really have safety ropes and stuff around us , " he said .
24 - hour rescue
There were more plants - four in total .
But as far as the researchers knew , these were all that remained of Anogramma .
So with the help of his colleague , Olivia Renshaw , Mr Stroud mounted a rather perilous effort to protect them .

The tiny fern plants had to be drip - fed
" We had to keep the plants alive - they were on a bare rock face and it was a really dry period , so Olivia and I went down twice a week carrying water and we set up a drip feed , " said Stedson .
After a few weeks of tending the plants , the next part of their plan was even more risky .
They had to get pieces of the ferns back to Kew so that more plants could be grown in the safety and sterility of the lab .
Stedson climbed down the ridge one again - this time to collect a few small cuttings of the spore - forming or reproductive parts of the plants .
Once harvested , the spores were vulnerable to drying and contamination , and the team had just 24 hours to transfer the precious cargo to the laboratory in Kew 's Conservation Biotechnology Unit ( CBU ) .
Image caption Ascension island is a forbidding , volcanic landscape
The samples were placed in a sterile container and rushed to the nearby airfield .
From there , they were flown to a military airport in the UK , where a car was waiting to race them to Kew .
Fortunately , the dust - like fern spores survived the journey intact .
Dr Viswambharan Sarasan is head of the CBU .
He explained that their arrival was not the end of the challenge .
The spores had to be bleached to eliminate any bacteria , before the plants could be grown in culture .
" That is the really risky part , " he said .
" If you bleach them for too long , you could kill the spores , but if you do n't treat them for long enough , there could be remaining bacteria that will grow in culture and kill them . "
It 's so satisfying , bringing a plant back from the brink of extinction Stedson Stroud , Conservation officer , Ascension Island
And Dr Sarasan had only a 1 p - piece - sized clipping of fern to work with - the smallest sample he had ever cultured from .
After another nervous period of waiting , he was relieved to discover that the process had left the spores intact and viable .
He and his colleague Katie Baker , a botany undergraduate student working at Kew , have now succeeded in growing 60 new Anogramma plants in culture - all from four tiny plants on a cliff face in Ascension .
The team hope eventually to restore Anogramma to its former wild habitats on Ascension 's Green Mountain .
And Mr Stroud has even managed to grow some of the plants in a shade house on the island itself .
" Each and every day , you 're there , tending and looking , and hoping that something will happen , " he said .
" Then one day you see something and - watching the plants grow - you can't ask for anything more . "
Image caption Kew scientists have successfully grown more than 60 Anogramma plants
Colin Clubbe , who leads the UK overseas territories programme at Kew , says that this rescue effort was a small but vital part of a much wider goal to protect native plants in Britain 's overseas territories before they are lost forever .
Plants are such an important component of our lives , " he said .
" And if we lose them , we lose them - extinction is forever .
He says that " holding on to our natural environment " could help us protect many of the plants we depend on .
" We do exploit species - we 're reliant on plant products .
We use them as a source of genes and , in these extremely dry habitats , like Ascension , plants that are naturally adapted may hold some answers to things like plants ' responses to climate change . "
This is actually the third extinct plant that Mr Stroud has rediscovered and , for him , it is an ongoing and very personal mission .
" There 's never a time that I 'm not actually looking fort these species because , we say they 're extinct , but I believe they are there , " he said .
" It 's so satisfying , bringing a plant back from the brink of extinction . "

THE sudden breakup of Al and Tipper Gore ’s seemingly idyllic marriage was the latest and among the sharpest reminders that the only two people who know what ’s going on in a marriage are the two people who are in it .
The truth is that most marriages , even our own , are something of a mystery to outsiders .
Several years ago , a marriage researcher  Robert W. Levenson , director of the psychophysiology laboratory at the University of California , Berkeley  and his colleagues produced a video of 10 couples talking and bickering .
Dr. Levenson knew at the time that five of the couples had been in troubled relationships and eventually divorced .
He showed the video to 200 people , including pastors , marriage therapists and relationship scientists , asking them to spot the doomed marriages .
They guessed wrong half the time .
“ People on the outside are n’t very good at telling how marriages are really working , ” he said .
Even so , academic researchers have become increasingly fascinated with the inner workings of long - married couples , subjecting them to a battery of laboratory tests and even brain scans to unravel the mystery of lasting love .
Bianca Acevedo , a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California , Santa Barbara , studies the neuroscience of relationships and began a search for long - married couples who were still madly in love .
Through a phone survey , she collected data on 274 men and women in committed relationships , and used relationship scales to measure marital happiness and passionate love .
A lesbian couple and an agnostic couple in San Diego have legal standing to sue the Boy Scouts to force the group to stop using prime city land for camping and other scouting activities .
The US Supreme Court on Monday let stand an earlier ruling by the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals , which sided with the two couples .
The couples object to Boy Scout policies that exclude boys and adults who are atheists , agnostics , or homosexuals .
In refusing to take up the Boy Scouts ’ appeal , the high court action returns the case to the San Francisco - based Ninth Circuit .
The action follows last week ’s high court decision in a similar case involving objections to an eight - foot - tall cross on public land in the Mojave National Preserve .
In that case , the court found that a former National Park Service employee had a legal right to file a lawsuit challenging the presence of the cross on public land as an unconstitutional endorsement of religion by government .
But the court also ruled that a federal judge had been too quick to dismiss a congressional plan to convert the public land around the cross into a private parcel in exchange for similar land elsewhere .
The court went on to say that not every display of a religious symbol on public land violates the First Amendment ’s establishment clause .
The details of the case
In the San Diego case , a federal judge has ruled that a $ 1 - a - year lease arrangement between the City of San Diego and the Boy Scouts for a Boy Scout - run campground and aquatic center violated the establishment clause .
The judge ruled that the Boy Scouts were the equivalent of a religious group , in part because the Boy Scout oath urges its members to do their “ duty to God and [ their ] country . ”
The Boy Scouts have been the target of a series of similar lawsuits seeking to drive the organization from public lands and public facilities because of its anti-gay policies .
In 2000 , the Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts had a First Amendment right to associate with like - minded individuals in a group that promoted certain religious and moral views – including that homosexuality was immoral .
Personal injury or contrived claim ?
At issue in Boy Scouts v. Barnes - Wallace was whether the two couples had established a right to file their lawsuit by showing that the legal action was based on more than just a policy dispute .
Under federal court rules , a plaintiff in a lawsuit must show that he or she has suffered a concrete , personal injury rather that a mere difference of opinion .
The Boy Scout campsite and aquatic center were built by the scouting organization for an estimated $ 4.9 million .
In addition to providing scouts with a place to camp and participate in water activities , the facilities are also open to the public for a fee .
The couples said they would like to use those portions of the public parks , but that they were so offended by the exclusionary policies of the Boy Scouts that they avoid those sections of the parks .
Lawyers for the couples say their clients are personally affected by the Boy Scout leases because the required public access fees “ amount to a toll payable to a discriminatory , religious organization to use public property . ”
The families cannot visit those sections of the parks “ without gaining approval from and submitting themselves under dominion and control of an organization that openly rejects their beliefs and sexual orientation , ” Washington lawyer Seth Galanter wrote in his brief .
“ Even if they did access it , their enjoyment would be diminished by having to view symbols of the [ Boy Scouts ’ ] presence and dominion on the land . ”
Lawyers for the Boy Scouts said the families ’ claim is “ contrived . ”
The families choose not to visit certain sections of the city parks , the lawyers said , because they ’d have to “ interact with people they do n’t like . ”
The lawyers added that any alleged injury was of the families ’ own making .
Fireworks in the Ninth Circuit
Although the Supreme Court dismissed the case without comment , the issue sparked vigorous debate when it was decided earlier at the Ninth Circuit .
“ Today , our court promulgates an astonishing new rule of law for the nine Western states .
Henceforth , a plaintiff who claims to feel offended by the mere thought of associating with people who hold different views has suffered a legally cognizable injury - in - fact , ” wrote Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain in a dissent .
He added that the Ninth Circuit decision “ creates a new legal landscape in which almost anyone who is almost offended by almost anything has standing to air his or her displeasure in court . ”
In a concurrence to the Ninth Circuit opinion , Judge Marsha Berzon rejected suggestions that the dispute was a minor “ disagreement . ”
She wrote : “ There is not merely offense here but injury too .
To use Camp Balboa and the Mission Bay Park Youth Aquatic Center , the plaintiffs must not just observe the presence of the Boy Scouts , but also interact with , seek permission from , and quite significantly , pay fees to , this same organization that believes them inferior in both morals and citizenship . ”

SAN JOSE , Calif . -- Detroit Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom will not make a hasty decision on his future .
Lidstrom said after Saturday 's season - ending 2 - 1 loss to the San Jose Sharks that he does n't have a timetable on deciding whether he will return next season or retire .
“ So fresh coming off this loss I have n’t thought about it yet , '' Lidstrom said .
" I ’m sure I ’ll sit down with Kenny ( general manager Holland ) here in the next few weeks and just go over things .
Nothing is ( determined ) yet . ’’
Many in the organization believe Lidstrom , who turned 40 two weeks ago , will be back .
After a slow start , by his standards , he excelled the second half of the season and was strong in the playoffs as well .

Bitch tipster alert !
According to a trusted source ( one of our sharpy - sharp readers ) , OkCupid , the popular ( and free ) online dating site , has a semi- secret policy that favors those who have been deemed the most attractive .
Say what !?
Not OK , Cupid .
Our informant forwarded along an email s/he received from OkCupid , which I am re-posting here in full :
We are very pleased to report that you are in the top half of OkCupid ’s most attractive users .
The scales recently tipped in your favor , and we thought you ’d like to know .
How can we say this with confidence ?
We ’ve tracked click - thrus on your photo and analyzed other people ’s reactions to you in QuickMatch and Quiver .
Your new elite status comes with one important privilege :
You will now see more attractive people in your match results .
This new status wo n’t affect your actual match percentages , which are still based purely on your answers and desired match ’s answers .
But the people we recommend will be more attractive .
Also !
You ’ll be shown to more attractive people in their match results .
Suddenly , the world is your oyster .
Login now and reap the rewards .
And , no , we did n’t just send this email to everyone on OkCupid .
Go ask an ugly friend and see .
So basically , the users who get the best ratings from other users are granted admission into a special stable of hot people , while those who have n’t rated as well are doomed to mill around outside , hoping for a date with whoever ’s willing to put up with their grotesque physical appearance .
This is a problem on several levels .
1 . The policy discriminates against those deemed less attractive for whatever reason ( bad photo , profile misspelling , etc. ) .
Those in the dreaded bottom 50 % presumably do not have access to potential matches in the top 50 % , even if they match up in other areas beyond the physical ( which , let ’s remember , is rated based solely on online profile data ) .
OkCupid is segregating the groups , which seems counter - productive to , you know , DATING .
2 . The policy reinforces the notion that hot people deserve love and happiness and “ ugly ” people should just get used to being alone .
For evidence of this , just check out some of the offensive language in that email !
For those who have been granted “ attractive ” status , “ Suddenly , the world is your oyster . ”
What the hell kind of world were they in before ?
Oh , I know , the one where ugly people are barred from seeing pretty people .
3 . The policy makes dating decisions on the users ’ behalf without considering personal preferences .
Sure , I learned in my Sociology 101 class that people typically end up partnering with other similarly - attractive people ; I ’d bet many of you have read the same .
However , we ’ve all got different preferences when it comes to physical attractiveness , and just because someone has n’t gotten as many click - thrus as someone else does n’t mean that users wo n’t find that person attractive .
It ’s patronizing to think that OkCupid would decide who ’s hot and who ’s not , especially when hotness is completely subjective .
4 . The policy is kept secret ( unless you ’re attractive ! ) .
When you sign up for an OkCupid account , you are not tipped off to this segregating policy in any way , shape , or form .
Here is what they DO tell people about their matching process :
OkCupid is the fastest growing FREE online dating site .
Our advanced matching system is based on you , and what you find important .
Tell us about yourself and we ’ll help you find your perfect match .
With over a million quality singles from all around the world , you can make a new friend or set up a date — all for free !
Note the absence of any looks - related criteria .
Maybe they should change that line where they say “ Our advanced matching system is based on you ” to “ Our advanced matching system is based on how hot we think you are . ”
Assuming that this is all true ( and we trust our tipsters around here ) , this policy is a bunch of discriminatory , attractiveness - norm - reinforcing , bullshit .
Not to mention the fact that it just does n’t make sense .
Why limit the number of potential matches people can get ?
Because pretty people can’t have their pretty eyes scarred by regular people ?
No thanks .
Does anyone remember that episode of Seinfeld where George uses a photograph of a beautiful woman to get into that secret club full of models ?
Yeah , this is like that , except not as funny .
I have to admit , this is especially irritating to me because OkCupid markets itself as being sort of ironic and progressive and “ cooler ” than other online dating sites .
If they ’re so ironic and cool and alternative , why are they falling prey to the same arbitrary attractiveness standards as your local meat market -y douchebar ?
So help me out here , folks .
Is this for real ?
If you use OkCupid , have you heard of this policy ?
What do you think of it ?

HOSPITALIZATIONS HOSPITALIZATIONS
WASHINGTON

Mental health disorders caused more hospitalizations among U.S. troops in 2009 than any other reason , according to medical data released recently by the Pentagon .
This historic high reflects the growing toll of nearly nine years of war .
Last year was the first in which hospitalizations for mental disorders outpaced those for injuries or pregnancies in the 15 years of tracking by the Pentagon 's Medical Surveillance Monthly report .
Hospitalizations for mental disorders have increased significantly among troops since 2005 , said Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker , surgeon general for the Army .
" War is difficult .
It takes a toll , " he said .
Mental health treatment expenses are helping drive up the overall cost of military health care , USA TODAY reported last month .
Last week , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a speech that " health care costs are eating the Defense Department alive . "
Schoomaker said the Army 's increased attention to mental health issues is another reason for the rise in hospital admittances .
In 2009 , there were 17,538 hospitalizations for mental health issues throughout the military , the study shows .
That compares with 17,354 for pregnancy and childbirth reasons , and 11,156 for injuries and battle wounds .
MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH :

In 2007 , there were 18,201 pregnancy and childbirth hospitalizations , 13,703 for mental health and 12,531 for injury and battle wounds , statistics show .
In 2005 , mental health was the third leading cause with 11,335 .
Mental health care accounted for almost 40 % of all days spent in hospitals by servicemembers last year , the report said .
Of those hospitalizations , 5 % lasted longer than 33 days .
For most other conditions , fewer than 5 % of hospitalizations exceeded 12 days , the report said .
Psychological issues such as post - traumatic stress disorder exact a toll in lost manpower , the study said .
Four mental health issues — depression , substance abuse , anxiety and adjustment problems such as PTSD — cost the Pentagon 488 years of lost duty in 2009 .
That 's " the equivalent of 488 soldiers spending an entire year in the hospital for mental disorders , " said Army Col .
Robert DeFraites , director of the office which produced the study .
The Pentagon is learning that mental health issues can take months or years to develop , he said .
" Mental disorders are a trailing indicator of health issues to a prolonged period of war fighting , and these figures reflect that , " DeFraites said .
" Our troops are facing multiple deployments and experiencing psychological stress due to prolonged exposure to combat , " said Brig .
Gen. Loree Sutton , director of the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury .
The Army , which has 138,000 soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan , had 10,222 mental health hospitalizations last year .
They accounted for almost 19 % of all Army hospitalizations .
Ten percent of Marine hospitalizations were for mental health reasons , while they were about 8 % for the Navy and 7 % for the Air Force .
The costs of treating mental disorders will only grow , said Christine Eibner , an economist with the RAND Corp .
A night in a military hospital cost $ 3,000 in 2009 , said Austin Camacho , a spokesman for the military health care program .
When the Pentagon pays for private hospital care , the average daily cost is about $ 1,300 , he said .

SEIU is fighting the good fight here :
" These families are looking for leaders who are going to stand side - by - side with them and fight for their interests , " Lori Lodes , a SEIU spokeswoman , said in a statement .
" And that 's what this effort is about — giving North Carolinians a choice to vote for someone who understands where they are coming from and can take their voice to Congress . " snip
The support of an independent candidate against Kissell shows the labor movement is not backing down from challenging Democrats this year , despite seeing Sen.
Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) fend off a union - backed challenger this week .
The Hill
More from David Dayden ( DDay ) :
SEIU has drafted Fant for this , but there is no wall of separation between the two .
Fant has been aware of the draft effort and has n’t discouraged it .
As he is not a current candidate , SEIU can support the draft effort without running into any contribution limits for signature gathering .
Once Fant decides to become a candidate – and he must affirmatively make that decision by filing the petitions – then it becomes a more traditional campaign .
" I do n’t know what his decision will be , but we have created the conditions where he has more than enough signatures to be a candidate and if he wants to , we will have successfully drafted him into the race , " said SEIU ’s Matt Browner - Hamlin .
SEIU Drafting Former Kissell Staffer to Run Against Him in General Election
Meanwhile Kissell has lowered himself to filing an ethics complaint against Fant for using a government computer TO FILE A VETERANS ADMINSTRATION CLAIM !
In a letter to the chair of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct , Kissell said Fant had broken House rules by using his official title and government computer to work on his own Veterans Administration case .
http://www.charlotteobserver.com/...
As DDay says :
As for the ethics complaint , the more you think about it , " using a government - issued computer " for filing a VA claim is about the weakest complaint I ’ve ever seen .
Let he who has never used a work computer for anything but work activities cast the first stone .

Update I : As Marcus Graly points out in the comments , Kissell is not a formal member of the Blue Dog group in the house .
He votes like one , though .
Is atheism a choice ?
I mean , could you simply start believing in fairy tales again if you wanted to ?
Is the mental act of becoming an atheist in the first place ( i.e. , initially discarding theism as valid ) voluntary ?
Once one has rejected god belief ( i.e. , is an atheist ) , is it meaningful to describe the continued rejection of theism as voluntary ?
As an atheist , could you voluntarily choose to embrace theism ?
I have been conducting an informal ( i.e. , non-scientific ) poll of my Twitter followers on the following question :
Obviously , the manner in which I worded the question was fairly poor by anyone 's standards .
But I 'm not sure it would have made much difference in this case .
The unanimous response I 've received is that atheism is not a choice and really is n't even so much a decision as a reflection of the available data .
The question of whether atheism is a choice is an important one , with many implications for how to spread the atheist meme , how to interact with believers , and the like .
After all , if atheism is not really a choice , then must we not make the same concession for religious belief ?
I 'm getting ahead of myself .
First , we need to disentangle what we mean by the question of whether atheism is a choice .
Based on the responses I received to the Twitter poll , I think it is safe to say that the overwhelming majority of atheists would likely answer " no " to question 3 .
Knowing what I know at this point in time , it is difficult to imagine that I could voluntarily turn my back on atheism and return to a theistic worldview .
Set question 3 aside for now .
We will come back to it later .
It also seems that question 2 can be fairly easily dealt with .
It certainly does not feel to me that I expend any sort of mental energy to maintain my atheism .
It is a position I have reached based on the available data , and it would only be in the case of new data that I might have to reevaluate it and make some sort of decision .
We can set question 2 aside and revisit it briefly when we come back to question 3.I find question 1 the most interesting and potentially problematic of the three .
I have little doubt that the act of identifying oneself as an atheist , adopting the atheist label , and embracing atheism as part of one 's identity are all voluntary .
Just consider the number of atheists who do none of these things , and you 'll see what I mean .
But what about the initial discarding of theism ?
It sure did n't feel voluntary , but was it ?
I remember struggling to retain theism because I had been taught that it was the only option .
But in the end , I simply could not do it anymore .
I did n't choose atheism ; I had no idea what it was .
Now , where we have to revisit question 3 ( and 2 to a lesser degree ) is that some atheists do in fact report returning to theism .
What are we to do with such observations , and how do they impact our understanding of questions 2 and 3 ?
Perhaps the process through which they arrived at atheism was simply reversed and not necessarily voluntary .
Or perhaps they adopted the behaviors associated with theism but not the underlying beliefs to fit in .
These unknowns make it difficult to know what to do with questions 2 and 3 .
Since this is getting long , I 'll address the implications of our questions and what they might tell us about both atheism and theism in a follow - up post .

On Thursday evening , NFL commissioner Roger Goodell took some questions from a group of middle and high school football players at a camp in Queens .
One of them delicately asked how he could get the job as NFL commissioner .
Goodell laughed and said he hoped that one day the kid would have it .
" I know I 'm not going to be around forever , but while I 'm here I 'm going to do the best I can for the game , " Goodell said .
In his fourth year as commissioner , Goodell is changing the way players are disciplined , heading into a capless year in which the NFL vacated the collective bargaining agreement with players and , most recently , spearheading a campaign to increase the number of regular - season games to 18 .
" Can we do things differently ?
I think we have to , " Goodell said .
It 's not a popular idea among players , who fear that a longer season would increase the risk of injury at a time when they are already physically spent .
" This will be the first time you hear me agree with Tom Brady and say I think it 's a bad idea , " New York Giants defensive end Justin Tuck said .
" The season is pretty long as it is .
And if you talk about if you get into a playoff run , you have the opportunity to play in up to 22 games .
You can look back how beat - up all the players are with their postcareers .
You add two more games , I do n't really agree with that , and I do n't see the benefit for the players or the fans . "
Goodell said that other changes might go with a hypothetical longer season , including roster size , rules on injured reserve restrictions and the offseason training program .
" I think we 're going to have some guidelines and restrictions on what can be done and what can't be done in the offseason , " Goodell said .
Some players see the fact that the league is pushing for the extended season now as part of the back - and - forth between the NFL and the NFL Players Association .
Both parties are in contentious negotiations to install a new CBA in the spring .
Last week the NFLPA contended that the league had n't been fair in negotiating broadcast revenue , which is the pool from which the players draw their salaries .
" I think everything is leverage right now , " Giants center Shaun O'Hara said .
" You know why they want the games , because it 's going to increase revenue . "
But would the players benefit from the money that could be negotiated from networks for two additional weeks of football and a late - February Super Bowl ?
Goodell contended that players were already being paid for the 20 games that make up the NFL preseason and regular season , an idea that does n't sit well with starters who might sit for three preseason games but certainly would play if those games counted .
" The risk that we take as far as playing regular - season games is considerable , " Giants defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka said .
" We 're constantly trying to improve player safety , player wellness , and we 're doing a lot of re right now to find out what are going to be the repercussions to adding two games to the regular season , " O'Hara said .
" I think everyone knows the injury rate in the NFL is 100 percent . "
O'Hara added that for undrafted free agents like himself , the four preseason games are an important proving ground .
Goodell is aware that this proposition is n't popular with many players but said it ultimately would increase the NFL 's popularity .
Other changes might include a developmental league , possibly one that plays in a different season .
Goodell also said that the league was still gathering information in the case of Vince Young 's misdemeanor assault citation for an incident that was recorded on a cell phone last weekend .
No discipline had yet been decided on .
" Right now we 're just gathering facts , " Goodell said .
It 's issues like this that have defined Goodell 's tenure to this point .
One young player asked him what he thought was the most important quality in a man who plays for the NFL .
And Goodell did n't hesitate to answer .
" Well to me , " Goodell said , " it starts with character . "

A new software engineering joint venture called Linaro has been set up by six major chip making companies including IBM , ARM Holdings , Texas Instruments and Samsung Electronics , with the aim of dedicating itself to improving Linux distributions for use in devices such as phones , netbooks , tablets , and TVs .
The aim of the joint venture is to give open - source developers the software and tools they need to accelerate and simplify development of Linux for portable devices using ARM - based system - on - a- chip ( SoC ) designs .
The founders say they will release tools , kernel and middleware software for a variety of SoCs based on the ARM Cortex - A processors every six months , beginning in November 2010 .
At present consumer devices use a variety of operating systems such as Apple , Windows , Blackberry , Intel , Palm , and Nokia ’s Symbian .
Linux operating systems in mobile phones are growing , and there are already a number of Linux versions that run on ARM chips , including Ubuntu and Debian .
There is also a Red Hat Fedora Linux version for ARM , but it is not yet commercially available .
Linux is the most popular open - source operating system available , and is a direct rival of Microsoft on personal computers and the open - source Symbian on phones .
Google ’s Android and MeeGo , LiMo and webOS are among the Linux operating systems , and the establishment of Linaro should simplify the development of Linux versions and accelerate their uptake , by enabling developers to concentrate on the user interface rather than the kernel and middleware .
The inclusion in Linaro ’s plans of MeeGo , which was developed by Nokia and Intel , suggests Intel will be involved at some stage , but the initial focus of the group will be on ARM chips .
The other two companies that have signed up to the non-profit foundation are ST - Ericsson and Freescale Semiconductor , but other companies are welcome to join the group .
The companies have pledged tens of millions of dollars a year to fund the project , according to the interim CEO of Linaro , Tom Lantzsch .
The foundation will work with Linux to align their core operating principles , and will contribute to a variety of open source projects .
The formation of the Linaro foundation was announced in Taipei in Taiwan on June 3 at the Computex trade show .
According to Ben Cade , co-CEO , the present growth is in always - on , always - connected devices powered by SoCs , and the joint venture is expected to increase the numbers of such devices using Linux distributions .

Senior cabinet ministers on Sunday approved steps toward easing Israel 's land blockade of the Gaza Strip , days after Jerusalem had issued a non-binding declaration supporting such a move .
" There will be no civilian closure of Gaza but there will be a security closure , " Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the meeting .
" That security closure will be tightened from now on . "

He added : " We have deprived Hamas of the ability to blame Israel for hurting the civilian population [ of Gaza ] and our friends around the world are getting behind our decision and giving international legitimacy to the security blockade on Hamas . "
Sources inside the prime minister 's office expressed satisfaction with the move .
" In the wake of this decision , the world 's focus will be on the Qassam rockets Hamas is firing out of Gaza and not the coriander that Israel is n't allowing in , " one senior aide told Haaretz .
Another official said the policy reversal would have been the right move , even without Israel 's raid on Gaza - bound aid flotilla three weeks ago , which left nine activists dead and stepped up pressure on Israel to lift the siege .
" The new policy will prevent absurdities like blocking shipments of pasta to Gaza and will strengthen Israel 's international position in enforcing a security closure .
It will also strengthenl Israel 's moral standing in its demand to free [ captured Israeli soldier ] Gilad Shalit .
The decision drew praise from the White House and criticism from the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip , who called it " deception " and said that the blockade must be lifted entirely .
The prime minister 's office said that Israel would release " as soon as possible " a detailed list of goods that would not be allowed into the Gaza Strip , which would include all weapons .
" Israel seeks to keep out of Gaza weapons and material that Hamas uses to prepare and carry out terror and rocket attacks toward Israel and its civilians , " Netanyahu said .
" All other goods will be allowed into Gaza . "
Israel 's new policy will allow an inflow of construction material into the Gaza Strip for projects approved by the Palestinian Authority or under the auspices of international supervision , including schools , health facilities , water treatment and sanitation , the statement said .
Israel also said it would keep the right to ban " dual-use " construction materials that could be used by Hamas to manufacture weapons and to rebuild its military facilities .
The change in policy is also aimed at improving economic activity in the coastal territory , said the PMO .
The new policy was also to allow humanitarian aid to be brought into Gaza in a more effective way and to ease movement in and out of the coastal territory , said the PMO .
Israel would consider further easing its siege as the situation on the ground improved , said the PMO .
It would also continue to inspect every item brought to the Ashdod Port bound for the Gaza Strip .
The PMO emphasized in its statement that its defense regime along the Gaza border would remain in place and that Israel still sees Hamas as a terrorist organization .
The Prime Minister 's Office announced late last week , after two days of extensive deliberations , that the security cabinet had agreed in principle to relax Israel 's three - year blockade on the Gaza Strip .
The ministers decided after their marathon talks on Wednesday and Thursday to " liberalize " Israel 's policy regarding the entry of goods into the Hamas ruled territory , which was set in place after the Islamist movement violently seized control over the Gaza Strip in 2007 .
The aim of the discussions was to approve a plan drafted by Netanyahu in coordination with the United Nations ' Middle East envoy Tony Blair .
Over the course of the six - hour meetings last week , ministers voiced their opinions regarding the blockade and the defense establishment presented the plans for the " liberalization " of the blockade .
However , upon concluding the discussions , the ministers did not vote on any binding practical draft of the decision .
Prior to the vote on Sunday , the government was bound by a policy regarding the blockade decided by the security cabinet under former prime minister Ehud Olmert .
Israel had " every intention to increase the transfer of goods into Gaza even before the cabinet meeting , " a senior defense official said last week , indicating a change in the government 's policy even before a binding decision .
" We have notified the Palestinians , regardless of the cabinet meeting , that we will allow the entry of food items , house wares , writing implements , mattresses and toys .
Beyond that , we have not said a thing , " the official said .
Israeli decision yields calls to lift blockade entirely
Israeli Arab MK Ahmed Tibi said Sunday that the security cabinet 's decision to ease the blockade was not enough , calling on the government to lift its siege entirely .
He added that Israel 's decision , in the wake of criticism over its raid of a Gaza - bound aid flotilla , proved that the government understands " only international pressure " ,
Hamas minister Ziad al - Zaza characterized Israel 's decision as " deception " , and said that the blockade must be lifted completely to allow Gaza to import all necessary materials , particularly cement , iron , raw materials for industry and agriculture , as well as import and export between Gaza and the world .
Chris Gunness , spokesman for UNRWA , the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees , agreed .
" We need deeds on the ground , not words , " he told The Associated Press .
" We have to see the blockade lifted , because the blockade is illegal . "
The White House welcomed the decision and called on all parties " to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza " .
" Once implemented , we believe these arrangements should significantly improve conditions for Palestinians in Gaza , while preventing the entry of weapons , " the White House said in a statement .
" We will work with Israel , the Palestinian Authority , the Quartet , and other international partners to ensure these arrangements are implemented as quickly and effectively as possible and to explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza , including greater freedom of movement and commerce between Gaza and the West Bank . "
The White House added that President Barack Obama would discuss the new policy and further steps during his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington on July 6 .
A little girl receives the Holy Ghost , speaks in tongues at Sunday School Camp
A little more than a week after buying the iPad , I returned it to Apple .
The problem was n’t the iPad exactly , though it has some flaws .
The problem was me .
I like technology , but I ’m not an early adopter .
I waited for the second - generation iPod , the second - generation iPhone , and the second - generation MacBook Air .
But the iPad was different .
So sleek .
So cool .
So transformational .
And , I figured , since it ’s so similar to the iPhone , most of the kinks would already be worked out .
So at 4 PM on the day the 3G iPad was released , for the first time in my life , I waited in line for two hours to make a purchase .
I set up my iPad in the store because I wanted to make sure I could start using it the very moment I bought it .
And use it I did .
I carried it with me everywhere ; it ’s so small and thin and light , why not bring it along ?
I did my email on it , of course .
But I also wrote articles using Pages .
I watched episodes of Weeds on Netflix .
I checked the news , the weather , and the traffic .
And , of course , I proudly showed it to , well , anyone who indicated the least bit of interest .
( That could be a whole post in itself .
We proudly show off new purchases as though simply possessing them is some form of accomplishment .
Why ?
I did n’t create the iPad .
I just bought one . )
It did n’t take long for me to encounter the dark side of this revolutionary device : it ’s too good .
It ’s too easy .
Too accessible .
Both too fast and too long - lasting .
Certainly there are some kinks , but nothing monumental .
For the most part , it does everything I could want .
Which , as it turns out , is a problem .
Sure I might want to watch an episode of Weeds before going to sleep .
But should I ?
It really is hard to stop after just one episode .
And two hours later , I ’m entertained and tired , but am I really better off ?
Or would it have been better to get seven hours of sleep instead of five ?
The brilliance of the iPad is that it ’s the anytime - anywhere computer .
On the subway .
In the hall waiting for the elevator .
In a car on the way to the airport .
Any free moment becomes a potential iPad moment .
The iPhone can do roughly the same thing , but not exactly .
Who wants to watch a movie in bed on an iPhone ?
So why is this a problem ?
It sounds like I was super - productive .
Every extra minute , I was either producing or consuming .
But something — more than just sleep , though that ’s critical too — is lost in the busyness .
Something too valuable to lose .
Boredom .
Being bored is a precious thing , a state of mind we should pursue .
Once boredom sets in , our minds begin to wander , looking for something exciting , something interesting to land on .
And that ’s where creativity arises .
My best ideas come to me when I am unproductive .
When I am running but not listening to my iPod .
When I am sitting , doing nothing , waiting for someone .
When I am lying in bed as my mind wanders before falling to sleep .
These “ wasted ” moments , moments not filled with anything in particular , are vital .
They are the moments in which we , often unconsciously , organize our minds , make sense of our lives , and connect the dots .
They ’re the moments in which we talk to ourselves .
And listen .
To lose those moments , to replace them with tasks and efficiency , is a mistake .
What ’s worse is that we do n’t just lose them .
We actively throw them away .
“ That ’s not a problem with the iPad , ” my brother Anthony — who I feel compelled to mention is currently producing a movie called My Idiot Brother — pointed out .
“ It ’s a problem with you .
Just do n’t use it as much . ”
Guilty as charged .
It is a problem with me .
I ca n’t not use it if it ’s there .
And , unfortunately , it ’s always there .
So I returned it .
Problem solved .
But it did teach me something about the value of boredom .
And I ’m far more conscious now of using those extra moments , the in - between time , the walking and riding and waiting time , to let my mind wander .
Around the same time I returned my iPad , I noticed that my eight - year - old daughter Isabelle was unbelievably busy from the moment she got home from school to the moment she went to bed .
Bathing , reading , playing guitar , eating dinner , doing homework , she was non -stop until I rushed her off to bed .
Once in bed she would try to talk to me but , worried about how little sleep she was getting , I would shush her , urging her to go to sleep .
We have a new ritual now , and it really has become my favorite part of the day .
I put her to bed 15 minutes earlier than before .
She crawls into bed and , instead of shushing her , I lie next to her and we just talk .
She talks about things that happened that day , things she ’s worried about , things she ’s curious or thinking about .
I listen and ask her questions .
We laugh together .
And our minds just wander .
Home secretary tells MPs Derrick Bird 's licence covered firearm used in shootings UK Parliament
The home secretary , Theresa May , today promised a review of Britain 's gun laws following yesterday 's shootings in Cumbria , but said it would be wrong to act before the full facts about Derrick Bird 's killing spree were known .
David Cameron later backed up her comments , warning against any rash response , an approach endorsed too by Labour 's former home secretary Alan Johnson .
The prime minister and May plan to visit the area tomorrow to make sure the police , emergency and health services and local councils have all the support they need .
May told MPs : " Undoubtedly , yesterday 's killings will prompt a debate about our country 's gun laws .
That is understandable – and indeed it is right and proper .
But it would be wrong to react before we know the full facts .
Today we must remember the innocent people who were taken from us as they went about their lives .
Then , we must allow the police time to complete their investigations . "
Cameron , speaking at a press conference in Downing Street , said : " The right thing to do is , of course , to look at all of these issues and have an open mind .
" But we should be clear that in this country we have some of the toughest gun control legislation anywhere in the world and we should n't make any kneejerk reaction to think that there is some instant legislative or regulatory answer . "
The prime minister added : " Of course we have to do everything we can to stop these dreadful events , but you can't legislate to stop a switch flicking in someone 's head and for this dreadful sort of action to take place . "
Cumbria police confirmed that Bird – who went on the rampage in the UK 's most deadly shooting incident since the Dunblane massacre – had been a licensed gun holder .
May , in a statement to the House of Commons , said he had held a shotgun licence since 1995 and a firearms licence ( for a .22 rifle ) since 2007 , adding that police had confirmed to her that his licences covered the firearms seized yesterday .
Twelve people were killed and eight remained in hospital today after the 52 - year - old taxi driver went on the apparently indiscriminate shooting spree .
Bird shot dead his twin brother and at least one colleague before driving through rural west Cumbria firing seemingly at random at people in towns , villages and on country roads before killing himself .
More than 100 detectives are beginning to piece together the sequence of events and trying to establish his motive .
Eleven people were injured during the three - and - a - half hour incident , which paralysed the county as police , hunting the gunman on the ground and by air , ordered people to remain indoors .
Cumbria police said they may never completely uncover the reason for what they described as the " most exceptional and challenging incident " the small force had ever dealt with .
The alarm was raised in the harbour town of Whitehaven at 10.30 am .
By then , it is believed , Bird 's twin brother , David , and the family solicitor , Kevin Commons , were already dead .
It ended only when the gunman 's body was found in a copse outside the hamlet of Boot at 1.40 pm .
All 12 people killed by Bird have been named locally , but the identity of only one has so far been officially confirmed by police – that of Commons , 60 , who worked for KJ Common solicitors .
A statement on Cumbria police 's website this morning listed 19 locations where shots were fired by Bird , including 10 sites where people were killed , and the village where he was found dead .
Detectives renewed their appeal for witnesses .
" We have now concluded a 150 km land and air search of the known and possible routes [ Bird ] could have used and as a result we are not expecting to find any further victims . "
Eight people who were injured remained in hospitals in Cumbria and Newcastle upon
Tyne today – four were said to be in a stable condition and four described as comfortable .
There were unconfirmed reports that the gunman , from Rowrah , near Frizington , who was divorced with two sons and had recently become a grandfather , had argued with colleagues at the taxi rank the previous night .
One friend , Peter Leder , told CNN Bird had said to him : " You wo n't see me again . "
According to one woman in Whitehaven , Bird " shook them [ his colleagues ] by the hands one by one and said , ' There 's going to be a rampage in this town tomorrow and it's going to start with my mother ' ...
They just laughed and did n't take him seriously " .
Others spoke of a reported family row over the will of Bird 's seriously ill mother , involving Commons .
Commons 's home was last night cordoned off by police , and letters from his law firm were visible on a windowsill of Bird 's home .
It is thought that after killing his brother and Commons , Bird headed to Whitehaven and shot a fellow taxi driver , named locally as Darren Rewcastle .
Witnesses said Bird then drove through the town with a gun hanging out of his car window .
Police released a map showing Bird 's progress south to Egremont , Gosforth and Seascale , where the killings continued .
Bird 's spree is the biggest mass shooting since Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and an adult at Dunblane primary school in March 1996 , before killing himself .
The police helpline number for witnesses is 0800 096 0095 .
A bicycle is a fun and eco-friendly means of transportation , but it does have its drawbacks .
These include being exposed to the elements ( wind , rain , snow , spray - tanned soccer - MILFs trying to referee the urchins in the backseat rather than watching the road ahead of their three - ton SUV , etc. ) and giving many passersby the impression , rightly or wrongly , that you are a ) too poor to afford a motorized conveyance or b ) of the opinion that wearing genital - asphyxiating spandex drawers and being pumped full of more hormones than an adolescent rabbit makes you feel empowered and “ totally awesome ” like your cousin Floyd .
Whatever the case may be , human - powered conveyances and their operators are generally looked down upon by the motor vehicle set .
But what if there was a pedal - powered ride that featured not only four wheels and an enclosed body , but the looks of a famous German sports car ?
Would the world still be laughing at you rather than with you ?
Those are just some of the questions the creators of the Ferdinand GT3 RS hope to answer .
Aside from the trademark - dodge - tastic name , the other clear connection to the Porsche it ’s inspired by is the distinctive shape , right down to the genuine Porsche headlights and taillights , plus a convincing tribute to the flat - six propelled original ’s race - ready whale tail .
Of course , on closer inspection , the differences become obvious : ultra-skinny bicycle wheels and tires , shiny but wrinkly bodywork , and the complete absence of engine noise .
The wrinkly bodywork is attributable to the fact that it is made of metallic foil draped over a PVC pipe spaceframe .
Sure , you ’re a sitting duck if you get t- boned in anything heavier than a Peel P50 , but considering the whole car weighs but 220 lbs. , does that really matter ?
Also , as you ’ve probably figured out by watching the video above , the Ferdinand GT3 RS slower than a lobotomized snail suspended in frozen molasses .
Would it be quicker with a passenger pedaling as well ?
Probably not by much , but this contraption is all about looking cool and leaving people scratching their heads .
Oh , and track day addicts need not apply .

For days before he died from internal bleeding in a federal prison , Adam Montoya pleaded with guards to be taken to a doctor , pressing a panic button in his cell over and over to summon help that never came .
An autopsy concluded that the 36 - year - old inmate suffered from no fewer than three serious illnesses Ã¢â‚¬â€ cancer , hepatitis and HIV .
The cancer ultimately killed him , causing his spleen to burst .
Montoya bled to death internally .

But the coroner and a pathologist were more stunned by another finding :
The only medication in his system was a trace of over - the - counter pain reliever .
That means Montoya , imprisoned for a passing counterfeit checks , had been given nothing to ease the excruciating pain that no doubt wracked his body for days or weeks before death .
“ He should n’t have died in agony like that , ” Coroner Dennis Conover said .
“ He had been out there long enough that he should have at least died in the hospital . ”
The FBI recently completed an investigation into Montoya ’s death and gave its findings to the Justice Department , which is reviewing the case .
If federal prosecutors conclude that Montoya ’s civil rights were violated , they could take action against the prison , its guards , or both .
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment , saying that the matter was still being investigated .
The coroner said guards should have been aware that something was seriously wrong with the inmate .
And outside experts agree that the symptoms of cancer and hepatitis would have been hard to miss : dramatic weight loss , a swollen abdomen , yellow eyes .

During Montoya ’s final days , he “ consistently made requests to the prison for medical attention , and they would n’t give it to him , ” said his father , Juan Montoya , who described how his son repeatedly punched the panic button .
Three inmates corroborated that account in interviews with The Associated Press .
The younger Montoya was taken to the prison clinic one day for “ maybe five , 10 minutes , ” his father said .
“ And they gave him Tylenol , and that was it .
He suffered a lot . ”
The federal prison in Pekin will not discuss Montoya ’s death .
Prison spokesman Jay Henderson referred questions to the Bureau of Prisons , which denied an AP request for information on Montoya ’s medical condition , citing privacy laws .
ADVERTISEMENT
It is n’t clear whether the prison system , relatives or even Montoya himself knew the full extent of his illness .
Montoya ’s father had no idea his son had cancer or hepatitis .
Inmates who knew him said he told them he had cancer , but they knew nothing of his HIV .
According to its website , the Bureau of Prisons tries to screen the health of new inmates within 24 hours of their arrival .
A closer examination within two weeks is required for prisoners with serious , long - term illnesses .
But officials have not said whether Montoya was given any kind of exam or whether his medical records made it to Pekin .

Montoya pleaded guilty in May 2009 to counterfeiting commercial checks , credit cards and gift cards .
Prosecutors will not say how much money was involved in the scheme , but Montoya was ordered to pay a little over $ 2,000 in restitution .
Montoya , who had a history of methamphetamine abuse , was released while awaiting sentencing and was ordered not to use drugs .
At the time , he was living with his father and working for his father ’s process - serving business , which delivers legal documents .
His father said he was paying Montoya ’s bills and paying him about $ 300 a week .
Then in mid-June , Adam Montoya was diagnosed with HIV .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It hit him like a ton of bricks , ” his father said .
After the diagnosis , Montoya retreated back into methamphetamine .
Following a urine test , he admitted using the drug three times in a month , and he was locked up .
Montoya began taking antiviral drugs , so his father still had hope and tried to give his son a sense of the same .
“ I thought , ‘ You ’ll get out .
You ’ll get your probation , and you ’ll have years of life , ” the elder Montoya said .
In mid-October , Montoya was sentenced to two years and three months in prison .
When he arrived at a federal prison transfer center in Oklahoma City , his medication was waiting for him .
His father took that to mean that the prison system knew Montoya suffered from HIV .

Montoya arrived at the Pekin prison on Oct. 26 .
He lived just 18 more days .
The inmates around him say he spent much of that time pleading for help from his cell .
Prison staff told Montoya he had the flu , according to Randy Rader , an inmate in the next cell who wrote letters to his mother about Montoya and discussed him in an e-mail interview with the AP .
“ That man begged these people for nine days locked behind these doors , ” Rader wrote to his mother on Nov. 14 .
The letter was first obtained by The Pekin Daily Times , which wrote about Montoya ’s death earlier this year .
Rader has since been moved to a prison in California Ã¢â‚¬â€ far from his family in Michigan .
He suspects the move was retaliation for speaking out about Montoya .

The last time a staff member visited Montoya , about 10 p.m. on Nov. 12 , he reported having trouble breathing and complained that he could no longer feel his fingers , Rader said in the e-mail interview .
The staff member told Montoya that he would try to get help the next day .
Around 6:30 a.m. , prison officials found Montoya ’s body in his cell .
The autopsy showed that Montoya ’s spleen was almost 10 times the normal weight because it had been engulfed by a cancerous tumor , which was on its way to doing the same with his liver .
The pathologist who examined Montoya ’s body said his eyes were also yellow Ã¢â‚¬â€ an unmistakable sign of hepatitis .
Dr. John Ralston is reluctant to speculate whether treatment could have saved Montoya ’s life by the time he reached Pekin .
The doctor suspects he would have needed a liver transplant to have a chance .
That said , “ You would think that he would have been feeling bad enough and complaining enough that somebody should have tried to get to the bottom of this , ” Ralston said .

The AP sought opinions about Montoya ’s condition from other doctors who did not examine him but were familiar with his diseases .
They agreed he probably displayed obvious signs of distress .
Montoya would have had a swollen abdomen because of his spleen .
At the same time , he probably was losing weight rapidly because the large tumor would have left little room in his belly for food , according to Dr. Krishna Rao , an assistant professor of oncology at Southern Illinois University Medical School in Springfield .
Someone in Montoya ’s condition should have been taking heavy doses of chemotherapy for his cancer or receiving stem cell transplants , if he were healthy enough , said Dr. James Egner , an oncologist with the Carle Foundation Hospital in Champaign .
If the cancer was too advanced , Montoya should have at least been treated for pain with powerful drugs , possibly in a hospice , Egner said .

The president of the American Civil Liberties Union ’s National Prison Project said it is n’t uncommon for medical records not to arrive with a federal inmate .
“ Sometimes it arrives late , and sometimes it does n’t happen at all , ” said David Fathi , who has spent 15 years studying prison conditions .
“ That ’s why it ’s so critical that the new facilities do a medical screening ” of new inmates .
Fahti said Montoya ’s death “ is really an egregious failure , of the kind that you would n’t expect from even a small county jail , let alone the largest prison system in the United States . ”
After his son ’s death , Juan Montoya wrote to the prison complaining about its medical care .
Warden Richard Rios wrote back to defend his institution .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I must respectfully disagree with your characterization of the medical care Adam received and want to assure you that we carefully monitored you son ’s medical condition , ” wrote Rios , who was not hired for the job until months after the death .
He did not elaborate , writing that privacy laws limited what he could say .
The elder Montoya is now waiting for his son ’s medical records , but he doubts they will offer many clues .
The family has hired lawyers but has not decided whether to file a lawsuit .
Montoya thinks a lot now about the assurances he offered his son as he headed for prison .
“ Your time will go by fast , and you ’ll get out , and we ’ll get you a job and be part of the family , ” Montoya recalls telling his son .
“ It never happened . ”

Have you ever been to a business meet and greet where you met the guy with the stick up his ass ?
I have .
You know the old saying , “ If you do n’t know who the sucker at the poker table is , it ’s probably you . ”
Well if you do n’t know who the guy at the party is with the stick up his ass , it ’s probably you .
Do n’t be that guy .
You do n’t have to act professional to win people over .
Actually , acting in such a robotic manner will do just the opposite .
When someone acts like a cardboard cut - out , they become a commodity .
Why the hell would I go with your business when I can go with the cheaper megacorp reps and get treated the same way by the same greasy - haired wannabe cheeseball ?
I do n’t want the cheeseballs - I hate cheese .
Instead , tell me about your passions , your worries , what keeps you up at night , how your business is struggling , etc .
That ’s the real shit , not some fake - ass facade that you think I want to hear .
Megacorp can spit your widgets out at twice the speed and half the cost .
But they ca n’t make a YOU .
Only you can be you .
So do n’t hide your individuality , celebrate it in every interaction .

Amanda ’s right .
I do n’t want to run into Jo Schmo business owner at a baseball game to find out that he ’s really a cool dude who loves the Celtics ( shameless team plug ) .
Sure , he might be laid back , but now I do n’t know what to expect when I do business with him .
I also do n’t know how to act around him .
Should I act extra professional ?
Should I act laid back ?
I do n’t know and the inconsistency makes me anxious .
People need safety , and that safety is a real connection .
I can know that you ’re the biggest asshole in the world but at least I know what I ’m getting when we do business .
So just be yourself .
You ARE the brand and people will be able to connect with your business if they can connect with you .

Despite its increasing influence over consumers ’ use of technology , Apple has kept a low profile inside the Beltway -- and that is starting to get under lawmakers ' skin .

Apple secrecy is bitter fruit on Hill
Apple is famous for its veil of secrecy around the new iPads and iPhones .
But Sen. John Rockefeller and others in Congress wonder whether the company has more than technological innovations to hide .
When Apple did n’t participate in an April hearing on children ’s online privacy , the West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee , gave voice to his suspicions .

“ When people do n’t show up when we ask them to ... all it does is increases our interest in what they ’re doing and why they did n’t show up , ” Rockefeller said of Apple and Google , which both declined to testify .
“ It was a stupid mistake for them not to show up , and I say shame on them . ”
While Apple ’s success has earned rock - star status in Silicon Valley , its low - wattage approach in Washington is becoming more glaring to policymakers .
Despite its increasing influence over consumers ’ use of technology — most recently with the iPad and iPhone 4 — Apple has kept a particularly low profile inside the Beltway .
“ It ’s unfortunate because they are a major player in this area , and we are going to continue to have a long , in - depth conversation , ” on these topics , said Sen.
Mark Pryor ( D - Ark. ) , who presided over theprivacy hearing , referring to Apple ’s empty seat at the witness table .
Like Microsoft and Google before it , Apple is getting attention from regulators as it grows and starts to compete more directly with other technology heavyweights .
This week , Google complained about Apple ’s new rules limiting application developers ’ ability to share iPad and iPhone user data with third parties .
Google said the new rules restricting advertisers from Apple ’s popular platform are anti-competitive .
This follows other objections to Apple ’s exclusion of Adobe ’s software from the iPhone .
The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are looking into the complaints .
Last fall , the Federal Communications Commission demanded to know why Apple rejected the Google Voice application from the iPhone App Store .
The FCC is also investigating whether exclusive arrangements between wireless carriers and cell phone manufacturers — such as the one involving AT&T and the iPhone — are anti-competitive .
And on Thursday , the FBI launched an investigation of a security breach that revealed information about some 100,000 iPad users , including those working on Capitol Hill and in the White House .
“ As Apple continues getting success in new areas , the more they ’ll be a lightning rod for attention , ” said Rebecca Arbogast , managing director of analyst firm Stifel Nicolaus .
“ So far , these are all issues Apple ’s been able to ignore . ”
It ’s not that Apple does n’t pay attention to Capitol Hill .
Four respected lobbyists make up its Washington office , led by Catherine Novelli , former assistant U.S. trade representative and partner at Mayer , Brown , Rowe & Maw .
Apple is active in several industry trade groups — including TechNet , Business Software Alliance and Information Technology Industry Council — but goes out of its way to stay under the radar .
The company would not comment for this story .
It is one of the few major technology companies not to have a political action committee .
While CEO Steve Jobs supported the presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton and Al Gore , he has n’t been especially active in political fundraising or races .
Gore now sits on Apple ’s board of directors .
Compared with other tech giants , Apple ’s lobbying expenditures are small .
In 2009 , Apple spent only $ 1.5 million to lobby the federal government , less than Amazon , Yahoo and IBM .
In 2009 , Google , for example , spent $ 4 million , Microsoft $ 7 million and AT&T $ 15 million .
In the first quarter of this year , Apple spent $ 560,000 on lobbying , according to disclosure reports .
During the same period , Google spent $ 1.4 million and Microsoft spent $ 1.7 million .
“ They ’ve been very focused on their own innovation , and they do n’t have a history of coming to town to get their competitors regulated , ” said Jonathan Zuck , president of the Association for Competitive Technology .
“ But they ’re expanding into so many areas that they ’re going to find themselves in other companies ’ cross hairs , so they probably should be ready to play defense . ”
Microsoft learned that lesson when the government accused the software giant of abusing monopoly powers in 1998 .
Google beefed up its presence three years ago to lobby for open - access wireless rules .
Both companies have become major lobbying powers on the Hill and in the administration .
Microsoft , Google and other companies , such as Intel and Yahoo , regularly bring executives to town .
Apple ’s guarded approach in Washington reflects the company ’s secretive corporate culture .
Despite being one of the most closely watched tech companies by both Wall Street and gadget geeks , the company rarely deals with the press and seems content not to be a D.C. player .
“ They do n’t have the arrogance of Google , nor does Steve Jobs think he’s in the Obama cabinet like Eric Schmidt does , ” one tech industry lobbyist said .
To handle discussions on the Hill , Apple hired Franklin Square Group , a technology - focused lobbying firm started by Josh Ackil , former White House aide in the Clinton administration and tech adviser to former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle .
Paul Margie of Wiltshire & Grannis does much of the company ’s work at the FCC .
Apple has visited the FCC only four times in the past three years , according to agency records .
Apple may be forced to change that strategy as it pushes into new markets .
In December , it acquired Quattro Wireless , the third - largest mobile advertising network , to launch its own mobile ad service .
Its entry into that field played a significant role in the FTC ’s decision to approve Google ’s purchase of AdMob last month .
But the FTC also hinted at Apple ’s potential to lead the mobile ad market : “ Apple not only has extensive relationships with application developers and users but also is able to offer targeted ads ... by leveraging proprietary user data gleaned from users of Apple devices . ”
Just as it shaped the way consumers buy digital music with iTunes , Apple is poised to change how millions of people consume all types of media with the iPad .
But its tight control over developer license agreements could raise eyebrows , especially if it tries to prevent developers from writing applications for competitors such as Google ’s Android or Research In Motion ’s BlackBerry .
Despite Silicon Valley ’s reluctance to get involved in Washington debates , Apple , during the early 1980s , was one of the first technology companies to establish an office in the D.C. area — in Reston .
Its initial goal was to sell Macintosh computers to the government , but most agencies were already using IBM systems .
Apple then worked with the FCC on establishing standards for digital TV and setting aside airwaves for wireless computers .
Education , intellectual property and trade issues were top priorities for the company , said James Burger , now a partner at Dow Lohnes , who ran Apple ’s government affairs shop .
In the company ’s biggest push for visibility , the D.C. representatives arranged for Apple ’s then - CEO , John Sculley , to sit next to first lady Hillary Clinton during President Bill Clinton ’s first State of the Union address in 1993 .
Apple also led companies , including Oracle and AOL , to a major 1995 lobbying victory over the accounting industry that put restrictions on securities class action lawsuits .
“ Apple was actually very forward thinking in its approach to Washington , and it wanted to understand how being here could benefit the company or at least prevent the government from doing harm , ” Burger said .
“ But the problem was that the chasm between Washington and Silicon Valley was even wider than it is today .
...
It was often a struggle to pull together the tech industry on legislative and regulatory issues impacting innovation . ”
Apple closed its Washington office in 1996 .
It opened a new office , this time downtown , three years later .
It hired Josh Tenuta , a lobbyist for the American Electronics Association , and Joseph Fortson , a former staffer to Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) .
Along with Novelli , Lisa Errion works on international trade issues .
The company ’s quiet , targeted strategy has paid off , say tech industry lobbyists , according to whom Apple easily gets meetings with lawmakers and the administration .
Some expect Apple to increase its Washington presence in the coming years , especially as top lawmakers plan to rewrite telecommunications laws .
“ In my mind , Apple ’s great success continues to come from the brilliance of their products , ” said Bruce Mehlman , partner at tech - lobbying firm Mehlman Vogel Castagnetti .
“ As long as you ’re pumping out iPhones , you ’ll have lots of friends . ”
2010 Soccer World Cup : All in the Name of the Beautiful Gain

A ZACF statement on the 2010 Soccer World Cup in South Africa
Giving the red 'n ' black card to FIFA
The FIFA 2010 Soccer World Cup must be exposed for the utter sham that it is .
The ZACF strongly condemns the audacity and hypocrisy of the government in presenting the occasion as a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for the economic and social upliftment of those living in South Africa ( and the rest of the continent ) .
All in the Name of the Beautiful Gain * A ZACF statement on the 2010 Soccer World Cup in South Africa
What is glaringly clear is that the opportunity  is and continues to be that of a feeding - frenzy for global and domestic capital and the South African ruling elite .
In fact , if anything , the event is more likely to have devastating consequences for South Africas poor and working class  a process that is already underway .
The 2010 Soccer World Cup must be exposed for the utter sham that it is .
The ZACF strongly condemns the audacity and hypocrisy of the government in presenting the occasion as a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for the economic and social upliftment of those living in South Africa ( and the rest of the continent ) .
What is glaringly clear is that the opportunity  is and continues to be that of a feeding - frenzy for global and domestic capital and the South African ruling elite .
In fact , if anything , the event is more likely to have devastating consequences for South Africas poor and working class  a process that is already underway .
In preparing to host the World Cup the government has spent close to R800 billion ( R757 billion on infrastructure development and R30 billion on stadiums that will never be filled again ) , a massive slap in the face for those living in a country characterized by desperate poverty and close to 40 % unemployment .
Over the past five years the working poor have expressed their outrage and disappointment at the governments failure to redress the massive social inequality in over 8,000 service delivery protests for basic services and housing countrywide .
This pattern of spending is further evidence of the maintenance of the failed neoliberal capitalist model and its trickle down  economics , which have done nothing but deepen inequality and poverty globally .
Despite previous claims to the contrary , the government has recently admitted this by doing an about turn , and now pretends that the project was never intended to be a profit making exercise [ 1 ] .
South Africa desperately needs large - scale public infrastructure , especially in the area of public transport which is in some cities , including Johannesburg , is almost entirely absent .
The Gautrain , which was launched on Tuesday the 8th June ( just in time for the big event ) is probably the biggest irony here : in a country where the large majority rely on unsafe private mini- bus taxis to travel long distances on a daily basis , the Gautrain offers high speed , luxury transport for tourists and those travelling between Johannesburg and Pretoria who can afford it if a single trip between the airport and Sandton will set you back a massive R100 .
The same picture reveals itself everywhere : the Airports company of South Africa ( ACSA ) has spent over R16 billion on upgrading the airports , the commercialised South African National Road Agency Ltd ( SANRAL ) has spent over R23 billion on a new network of toll roads  all of which will implement strict cost - recovery measures to recoup the billions spent , and most of which will be of little benefit to poor South Africans .
All over the country municipalities have embarked on urban regeneration schemes accompanied by corresponding gentrification schemes , as the government attempts to hastily paper over the harsh South African reality .
Over 15,000 homeless people and street children have been rounded up and dumped in shelters in Johannesburg alone , in Cape Town the municipality has evicted thousands of people from poor areas and squatter camps as part of the World Cup vanity project .
The City of Cape Town ( unsuccessfully ) attempted to evict 10,000 Joe Slovo residents from their homes in order to hide them from the tourists travelling along the N2 highway , and elsewhere they are being removed to make space for stadiums , fan parks or train stations [ 2 ] .
In Soweto , roads are being beautified along main tourist and FIFA routes , while adjacent schools sport broken windows and crumbling buildings .
Although many South Africans remain unconvinced , others are inundated and swept along by the deluge of nationalist propaganda aimed at diverting attention from the circus that is the World Cup .
Every Friday has been deemed  soccer Friday , in which the nation is encouraged ( and school children forced ) to sport Bafana - Bafana t- shirts .
Cars are kitted out in flags , people learn the  Diski - dance  which is performed regularly at every tourist restaurant , and buy Zakumi mascot dolls .
Anyone sceptical of the hype is denigrated unpatriotic , the prime example being when appeals were made to striking South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( SATAWU ) workers to shelve their concerns in the national interest  [ 3 ] .
In a context where close to a million jobs have been lost over the course of the past year , government celebrations that the world cup has created over 400 000 jobs are empty and insulting .
The jobs that have been created in the run up have been mostly casual or  Limited Duration Contracts ( LCDs )  , taken by workers that are not unionised and paid well below the minimum wage .
Apart from the repression of unions , social movements have received similar hostility from the state , which has unofficially put a blanket ban on all protest for the duration of the event .
In fact there is some evidence that this has been in place since as early as the 1st March .
According to Jane Duncan :
A snap survey conducted at the end of last week of other municipalities hosting World Cup matches revealed that a blanket ban on gatherings is in operation .
According to the Rustenberg municipality , " gatherings are closed for the World Cup " .
The Mbombela municipality was told by the SAPS that they were not going to allow gatherings during the World Cup .
The Cape Town City Council claimed that it continues to accept applications for marches , but indicated that it " may be a problem " during the World Cup period .
According to the Nelson Mandela Bay and Ethekwini municipalities , the police will not allow gatherings over the World Cup period [ 4 ] .
Although it is clear that the constitution , often hailed for its progressiveness  is far from the guarantor of freedom and equality that government claims it to be , this new form of repression is clearly in contradiction with the constitutional right to freedoms of expression and gathering .
However , social movements in Johannesburg including the Anti-Privatisation Forum and several others have not given up so easily , having managed to get authorization for a protest march on the day of the opening with the help of the Freedom of Expression Institute .
However , the march is being forced to be held three kilometres from the stadium where it will not attract the sort of media attention the government is worried about .
Not only has the state been repressively severe on the poor and any anti-World Cup demonstration or activity , all within the guise of painting South Africa as a host flinging its arms open in invitation to those flocking to its upmarket hotels , bed - and - breakfasts and cocktail lounges , but it does so under the guidance of Sepp Blatter & Friends  legal criminal empire called FIFA ( wonderfully referred to as THIEFA by the Durban Social Forum ) .
Not only are they expected to benefit from a 2010 windfall of nearly  1.2 billion , but have already gained over  1 billion from media rights alone .
The stadia , and areas around the stadia , which were handed over to FIFA for the duration of the tournament ( tax - free cocoons  literally creating FIFA - controlled and monitored areas exempt from normal taxation and other State laws ) , and all routes to and from the stadia have been forcibly cleared of anyone selling non-sanctioned FIFA products and those eking out an existence in squatter camps along airport roads .
As such , people who would have banked on World Cup sales to boost their survival incomes are left out in the " trickle down " cold .
FIFA , as sole owner of the World Cup brand and its spin - off products , also has a team of approximately 100 lawyers scouring the country for any unauthorised selling of these products and marketing of the brand .
These products are seized and sellers are arrested despite the fact that most in South Africa and on the continent purchase their products from the informal trading sector , as very few have R400 to dole out on team t- shirts and other gear .
It has also has effectively gagged journalists with an accreditation clause that prevents media organisations from bringing FIFA into disrepute , clearly compromising freedom of press [ 5 ] .
The major irony is that soccer was once truly the game of the working class .
Viewing games live at stadia was cheap and easily accessible to people who chose to spend 90 minutes forgetting about the daily drudgery of their lives under the boot of the boss and the State .
Today , professional football and the World Cup bring exorbitant profits to a small cabal of a global and domestic elite ( with billions spent unnecessarily and in a time of a global capitalist crisis ) who charge patrons thousands of rands , pounds , euros , etc. every season to watch disgustingly overpaid footballers fall and dive all over manicured pitches at the slightest tug and who squabble , via parasitic agents , over whether or not they are deserving of their huge salaries .
A game , which in many respects maintains its aesthetic beauty , has lost its working - class soul and has been reduced to just another set of commodities to be exploited .
Bakunin once said that people go to church for the same reasons they go to a tavern : to stupefy themselves , to forget their misery , to imagine themselves , for a few minutes anyway , free and happy  .
Perhaps , amongst all the blindly nationalistic flag waving and vuvuzela - blowing , we can add sport to his equation and that it might seem easier to forget than to actively partake in combating injustice and inequality .
There are many who do , though , and the working class and poor and their organisations are not as malleable to illusion as the government would want to believe .
From temporary squatter camp constructions at the doors of the stadia , to mass protest and demonstrations , to countrywide strike action , unsanctioned or not , despite the taunts and jeers and the labels of being unpatriotic , or blanket bans on freedom of speech , we will defiantly make our voices heard to expose the terrible inequalities characterising our society and the global games played at the expense of the lives of those upon whom empires are built and will be , ultimately , destroyed .
Down with the World Cup !
Phansi state repression and divisive nationalism !
Phambili the people 's struggle against exploitation and profiteering !

* The title for this article was inspired by the recent single The Beautiful Gain by the Chomsky AllStars .
Fricker was about to return to Switzerland when he was arrested on May 25 , and his employer , Zurich - based Comit AG , which specialises in software for the financial industry , confirmed he had been suspended from work .
Today the world has become truly global and students from developing countries like India and China prefers to go abroad for further education .
There , they receive immense exposure to different culture and education in a holistic manner .
With the growing time , the population of overseas students in foreign countries is growing in a fast pace .
Australia is one such developed nation , where many students ( around 80,000 ) from India are settled to pursue their further studies .
Despite , that Australia ’s education is quite expensive for Indian students , they still go for it to receive the best education .
But recent changes made by the Australia in their Immigration laws have erected a wall between Indian students and their dreams .
To counter this problem , India has planned to express it ’s disapproval by protesting the sudden changes made by them in the migration policy .
The new policies would be affecting the future of around 80,000 Indian students , studying there .
Recently , issues of racial discrimination were the major cause of worry for Indian students but now another feather has been added to their list of problems .
The implementation of the new policy would be from July1 onwards .
Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde would be visiting Sydney to discuss this issue with Australian Government .
In an interview , he has expressed that our intent is definitely not to oppose the rule but to initiate a dialogue with them to resolve this problem in mutual interest of both .
Indian students have paid a lot for their education in Australia and now they have to face all these inconveniences for no fault of their own .
The Indian government is trying its best and taking all the necessary measure to ensure the well being of Indian students in Australia .
There are more than five lakh students ( from foreign countries ) in Australia out of which major population comes from India and china .
And the future of all these students could suffer if this policy would come into effect from July onwards .
In the previous essay , I discussed some of the challenges that next - generation biofuels face according to a recently released USDA report :
Next - Generation Biofuels : Near - Term Challenges and Implications for Agriculture
Here are five positive notes from the report :
1. Renewable Diesel Plant Capacity
“ Next - generation U.S. biofuel capacity should reach about 88 million gallons in 2010 … ” This is primarily a result of the expected start - up of a next - generation renewable diesel plant .
I have reported on this technology before , as well as the efforts of first - generation biodiesel producers to slow it down and protect their own interests .
My guess is that unlike the ConocoPhillips project that was killed after Congress voted to deny them the full tax credit , this project will receive the same tax credit as a conventional biodiesel producer .
On a level playing field , I believe the hydrocracking approach is superior to first generation biodiesel , but our political leaders will need to stop playing games with the tax credits in order for next generation diesel to realize its potential .
( For a complete explanation of the different kinds of renewable diesel , see my Renewable Diesel Primer ) .
2. Competitive Race
Companies are taking a number of different approaches to coming up with next - generation solutions , increasing the chances that a dark horse will arise as a contender : “ There are about 30 next - generation companies in the United States developing biochemical , thermochemical , and other approaches , and experimenting with a variety of feedstocks , some of which are directly linked to agriculture .. ”
3. Open for Business
The first next - generation plants are expected to come online in 2010 : “ Range Fuels and Dynamic Fuels are expected to complete the first commercial next - generation biofuel plants in 2010 . ”
I have certainly given Range Fuels a hard time over their public statements – especially in light of recent reports which this USDA report also flagged : “ According to the EPA , however , the plant ’s initial capacity has been reduced from 10 million to 4 million gallons per year and initial output will be methanol . ”
However , readers should not mistake my position as hoping that they fail .
To the contrary , I hope they succeed , because we are going to need a lot of successes .
I am just skeptical that they will achieve commercial ( unsubsidized ) success , and unhappy that they sucked up a lot of taxpayer funds based on their initial promises that clearly did not materialize .
I would further note , however , that Range Fuels and Dynamic Fuels may be the first U.S. plants that could be classified as next - generation commercial plants ( although as I have pointed out , we had commercial cellulosic ethanol plants in the U.S. by 1920 ) , but such plants do already exist overseas .
Neste Oil , in fact , has built several plants based on the same sort of technology that Dynamic Fuels is employing .
There are also other overseas companies doing gasification ( the Range approach ) that are further along than Range is .
4. Algae Research
Just as there are many different approaches to next - generation fuels , there are many companies taking many different approaches to producing fuel from algae : “ More than 30 U.S. companies currently are experimenting with different approaches to producing algae - based fuels . ”
Some of these approaches are unconventional : “ Although the majority of algae - to - biofuel companies are focusing on producing algae oil for traditional biodiesel production , some companies are using algae to produce ethanol ( Algenol ) , or petroleum - equivalent fuels ( UOP and Sapphire ) . ”
The challenge of course will be to drastically reduce production costs , but the potential is too great to ignore .
5. Production Costs Decrease
Both production and capital costs for cellulosic ethanol are falling .
The report noted “ POET recently reported it had lowered production costs for cellulosic ethanol , including capital expenses , from $ 4.13 to $ 2.35 per gallon in a year as of November 2009 at its South Dakota pilot plant . ”
The report further notes that estimates for a 100 million gallon cellulosic ethanol facility have fallen from the $ 650 million to $ 900 million range ( 2004 estimate ) to $ 320 million ( 2009 estimate ) .
However , the report notes that these estimates should still be considered speculative , since “ there are no actual cost data for commercial operations since none are yet operational . ”
As a body of work , I highly recommend you read the USDA report if you are interested in the status of next generation biofuel facilities .
It is a sober , objective assessment of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead as next generation fuel technologies continue to develop .

There ’s no denying that the Droid X floodgates are wide open now .
Over at the Android Forums some new photos of the device have emerged by way of user matrix2004 .
Far more fascinating than the typical leaked images , what makes these ones special is that the show off the X next to EVO 4G , iPhone 3G and Droid Eris giving us a good idea of its size .
No surprises here , but it ’s absolutely massive .
Other things of note in the image are some of the custom widgets that come along with “ Shadow BLUR “ , the ( thankfully ) tasteful update to MOTOBLUR .

Al Qaeda has announced the death of its top leader in Afghanistan , Mustafa Abu al - Yazid , according to the SITE group which monitors Islamist websites .
Yazid , an Egyptian national , was a founding member of Al Qaeda and a trusted former treasurer to terror mastermind Osama bin Laden .
The SITE statement did not say how Yazid died , but said the message from Al Qaeda to jihadist forums said his wife , three of his daughters , his grand - daughter , and other men , women , and children , were killed .

Nowhere to run , nowhere to hide , panic spreading far and wide .
Let me explain something to you .
If aliens landed right now , and they were the kind of squiggly slime - beasts that were totally into wiping out mankind , there ’s one organisation that I ’d want to defend us .
It would n’t be the US Army , or the ThunderCats , or even the Autobots led by a Powermaster Series Optimus Prime from eBay with all the fiddly gun bits still in the box .
The organisation that I ’d want to defend us against space invaders – indeed , the only corporation I actively want to join even now – is Cobra .
Cobra gets a very bad rap , but that ’s not always their fault .
Their principal opponents are flag - sucking Stars and Stripes wankers with suntans and perfect smiles , and that ’s the kind of thing that gets American TV networks spooging all over their safe , safe schedules full of safe , safe programs .
I ’m willing to admit that Cobra has its flaws , but what company does n’t ?
Yes , their leader ’s catchphrase is “ Cobra ! Retreat ! “ , but in his defence , they ’d all be arrested or killed if they stood around fighting a losing battle .
So really , retreating is about the only smart thing you can do in those situations .
At least he ’s not shouting “ Cobra ! Surrender ! ” or “ Cobra !
Let them take us to Guantanamo Bay for our crimes ! ”
But too often , this is the image people have of Cobra Commander :
But that ’s all he does ?
He kicked a dog once , and that ’s it ?
That makes him a bad leader and a useless terrorist mastermind ?
No .
Besides , that dog was probably being a dick .
So what is it about Cobra that makes them so awesome ?
Why do I , a 29 - year - old white male , want to join a ruthless terrorist organisation bent on taking over the world ?
I ’ll tell you why .
First , watch this :
Now , there are several things you can take from this , before we even get into the real shit .
Firstly , notice what ’s happening at 0:41 .
Cobra Troopers are parachuting down , and that one guy is so badass you do n’t simply zoom into his thousand - yard - stare , because he totally catches a thermal , rises up , and descends toward the camera again .
And on this second time , you get a close up of his balls .
You might think all terrorists are assholes , but these are the guys that go headfirst into battle , decide that ’s just not rad enough , and make it balls - first instead .
My point is this :
If you do n’t think that ’s hardcore , then you and I will never be friends .
Judging by all the flashing lights , fireworks and multicoloured balloons floating around the Statue of Liberty , Cobra are apparently committing a parachute assault against a Gay Pride March .
I do n’t know why this would be , but then , I ’m not Cobra Commander .
I assume he had his reasons for deploying his private army in such a way .
What I find particularly haunting about this naked aggression against gays is that Cobra is , in all ways , an equal - opportunity employer .
So maybe they just got their coordinates wrong this once .
But then , a lot of this opening sequence is actually bullshit , and goes against the fundamentally awesome principles of Cobra .
Gay - bashing is just one of the things they ’d never do .
Look what happens at 0:56 .
As if Cobra Troopers did n’t look awesome enough , here ’s a Crimson Guard – one of Cobra ’s elite soldiers – parachuting down to be off the scale in maximum coolness .
They did n’t always wear this armour , by the way .
They also acted as deep - cover agents in civilian life , and it was mandatory for all Crimson Guards to have accounting or law degrees .
I ’m not even kidding .
That ’s how rad Cobra was : their elite guards also had day jobs as handsome lawyers .
But here ’s why this cartoon reeks of anti-Cobra propaganda .
This guy lands and punches a camera , shattering its helpless glass eye .
That makes no sense .
That ’s not what Cobra was about .
They loved publicity .
One of the reasons Cobra was so awesome was that they advertised themselves on TV .
They became a sovereign nation .
They had their own embassy / office block in some US city that I forget the name of right now .
They craved attention .
The sky is full of 3,000 parachutes all with the Cobra symbol on them .
Does this look like a sneak attack ?
There ’s no way a Crimson Guard – who , let ’s recall , has a law degree – would just touch down and punch out Camera One .
That ’s not the Cobra I know and love .
Objectively , there ’s no way of arguing against the central fact , here .
Dressing up like this :
… is the best thing any of us could hope to do in our lives .
Which brings me to my next point .
Why would I be a soldier in Cobra , but not join the army ?
Simple .
I could n’t be trusted in the army .
The reason I could never be trusted in a military situation is n’t because I suck at taking orders ( although I do ) , but because if I was going house - to - house in Fallujah , I would n’t be able to control myself .
I ’d kick in people ’s doors and scream “ COBRA ! ” at them while they cowered in fear .
At the first sign of conflict , I ’d shout “ COBRA ! RETREAT ! ” in Cobra Commander ’s whiny voice .
I just know I would .
There ’d be no stopping me .
Maybe for the first few times , the other guys would laugh .
But sooner or later – and probably sooner – they ’d just shoot me in the back and say the bad guys did it .
My parents would be told that I ’d died a hero ’s death , which would be a lie .
I ’d have died an annoying twat ’s death , and it would ’ve been a fate I ’d earned most richly .
Part of my affection for Cobra is simply that they were n’t G.I. JOE , because the Joes were unbelievably , insufferably uncool .
I ’d cringe every time they won , because they really did n’t deserve to triumph at all .
The Joes were also confusingly American , which I found hard to relate to .
They waved that flag every 5 minutes and talked like idiots , while their tagline was “ A real American Hero ” .
Cobra , on the other hand , were deliciously multinational .
Destro was a morally - flexible arms dealing skinhead in a weird silver mask , and as if that was n’t awesome enough , he was also Scottish .
I thought that was a nice touch , though even at a tender age I wondered just what opportunities for gun-smuggling could arise between Carlisle and Aberdeen .
Destro also got laid , which was something the Joes never seemed interested in .
But Destro , that Scottish ironmonger , was a hit with the only lady worth anything : The Baroness .
But the real reason I would willingly swear my life ( and indeed , die ) for Cobra is that I thought their plans were fucking brilliant .
Vision like theirs deserved to be supported .
Each time the Joes foiled them , I ’d regard it as some inevitable but disgusting shame , and eagerly await the next caper that would deserve to hand them the world on a plate , while knowing it would ultimately end in a necessary retreat .
Even in this opening sequence , there ’s a great plan that deserves to go all the way , cockblocked at the last minute by some square - jawed asshole in an unbuttoned shirt .
Here we have Destro giving a bomb to Cobra Commander , which the latter will use to blow up the Statue of Liberty .
Firstly , I admire the sheer ambition of that as a statement of terrorism .
I feel like it ’s something I could get involved with .
Aim high .
Live to win .
All that good stuff .
Secondly , Cobra Commander jetpacks in to plant the bomb himself , and I think we can all get behind a leader who likes to get his hands dirty once in a while .
Note also , at 1:36 , Cobra Commander actually plants the bomb while under ( pink … ) enemy fire , after flying through a massive sky war .
That ’s not the action of a coward , so again , anyone who says Cobra Commander sucks needs to shut the hell up , and piss off while doing so .
And thirdly , the Statue of Liberty is French , so fuck it .
Blow that shit up .
Cobra ’s plans were always like this .
At one point , Cobra ’s very own ninja , Storm Shadow , comes to England and finds Excalibur , which he then promptly uses in an attempt to kill Americans .
Did King Arthur intend this ?
I just do n’t know , but it ’s an intriguing notion .
Later , when Cobra runs out of money , they set up a heavy metal band – the mighty Cold Slither – in order to brainwash the population with subliminal messages in the music .
Why did n’t that work ?
It should ’ve done .
The world would be an awesome place if it had .
Here are some of the Slither ’s fine lyrics :
“ We ’re Cold Slither , you ’ll be joining us soon ,
A band of vipers , playing our tune ,
With an iron fist ,
And a reptile hiss ,
We shall rule . ”
Real subtle , guys .
Anyway , as with all of Cobra ’s plans , something goes wrong .
In this case , the members of Cold Slither are too batshit - crazy , and they go from shoving guitars up each others ’ asses to simply chainsawing their instruments in half .
I ca n’t be mad at them for that , though .
I mean , we were all young once .
Cobra celebrated its weirdness .
Ninjas and freaks and bikers and terrorists , all hanging out and trying to take over the world by heavy metal , flamethrowers , chainsaws and accountancy .
They ’d manipulate the stock market .
They ’d invade countries .
They ’d invent bubblegum that turned kids into zombies .
All of this was punishingly awesome .
I ’d be proud to have all of that on my resume ’ .
I ’d be honoured to kick in people ’s doors and yell “ COBRA ! ” at them , only to retreat if they seemed annoyed .
By contrast the Joes were impossible to relate to .
Even their names were related to being an asshole boiling in his own bubbling machismo , or being a sports guy .
Roadblock ?
Beach Head ?
Big Lob ?
Gung - Ho ran around in army gear with no shirt on .
Falcon and General Hawk were named after birds of prey .
Duke – fucking Duke – who the hell is called that in real life ?
Who ’d choose that as their codename ?
Only the Overlord of Douchebaggery .
And I ’m sorry , but “ Yo , Joe ! ” is not a cool thing to yell in the middle of a battlefield .
It ’s not cool to yell it anywhere , but mid-warfare is surely the stupidest place .
The only good Joe was Snow Job .
Snow Job is awesome for all the most obvious reasons .
His name means to lie ; to get cocaine snorted off your cock by a hooker ; and it sounds a bit like blowjob .
Strangely , his wikipedia article has this to say about him :
“ He helps the Joes secure weapons grade Plutonium that Cobra was trying to steal .
He also tries a to run a minor scam against Rock ’N’Roll via getting cash to set him up with Gung - Ho ’s sister , a model ( who was really nine ) .
After Doc explains the trick , the officer himself says ‘ This is why they call me ‘ Snow - Job ' ” . ”
I have no idea what that means , but it sounds pretty illegal .
So maybe he should just join Cobra ?
He can leave the 9 - year - old girl at the door , though .
That ’s not cool .
Lastly , even in situations of catastrophic terrorism , it ’s not Cobra that causes danger to the public .
If you watch that clip , at 0:33 , the cobra skythingy arrives and eclipses the moon in what top scientists suspect is a metaphor .
And then Cobra ’s guys jump out .
All good , right ?
That means this is above the Statue of Liberty .
Like , directly above it .
Whether it ’s a Gay Pride march or not is irrelevant .
You ’ve got people running around everywhere .
So how do the good guys solve this problem ?
Duke ( Ugh , that name … ) jetpacks around , takes the bomb , and plants it on the bottom of the Cobra airship .
So the hero has just set explosives on a massive warship thing that ’s hovering over the Statue of Liberty and all the crowds .
Good game , genius .
And that ’s why Cobra is awesome .
On a final note , if Cobra Commander ever came to me and asked if I had any ideas , I ’d say “ Yes , yes I do . ”
Step 1 : Breed an army of these :
Step 2 : Introduce them into every river in some out of the way place , like Burma or whatever .
Step 3 : Cobra ! Retreat !
Every summer thousands of visitors flock to our seaside resorts – loud and confident , swaggering around gorging on ice cream and chips .
No , not holidaymakers but herring gulls .
One of our most familiar , and possibly least popular , birds , they are the quintessential sight and sound of the British coast .
Yet despite their seeming abundance , these raucous and resourceful members of the gull family have suffered alarming population declines in recent years , plummeting in number since the late 1960s to such an extent that they have been placed on our national " red list " of bird species of the highest conservation concern .
Where they are thriving is where we want them least of all – in our towns and cities .
Exchanging sea cliff nest sites for rooftops , and fresh fish for the contents of our bins , their noisy , messy and occasionally aggressive behaviour has brought them into conflict with people .
Rather than lament their widespread collapse , some would gladly see the back of them .
Love them or loathe them , herring gulls are undeniably impressive birds .
Large and powerful , with silver - grey backs and the kind of clean white plumage that would look good on a washing powder advert , they are effortless in the air , riding ocean storms or slipstreaming ferries .
Their evocative yelping cries , as heard on the theme tune to Radio 4's Desert Island Discs , provide the soundtrack to seaside holidays .
They are also intelligent and opportunistic .
When it comes to finding a meal , their techniques include dropping shellfish onto rocks to break them open , trailing tractors for ploughed - up invertebrates , paddling the grass in playing fields to coax worms from the soil – and swooping down to snatch food from unwary passers - by .
For such a ubiquitous bird , the herring gull seems a little out of place alongside the bittern , corncrake and cuckoo as a cause for conservation attention .
However , its population decline of more than 50 per cent in the past three decades qualified it for inclusion last year on Britain 's ever - growing red list .
In order to identify which of our birds are most in need of help , a partnership of organisations including the RSPB and British Trust for Ornithology ( BTO ) , periodically scrutinise the status of over 245 of our regularly - occurring species , putting them in either green , amber or red categories .
The red list section of this Birds of Conservation Concern report comprises , for the most part , those species whose population or range has more than halved over the preceding 25 - 35 years – a substantial drop over a sufficiently generous time span to iron out short - term fluctuations – and currently totals 52 .
More than 130,000 pairs of herring gulls breed in Britain , and five times that many individuals spend the winter here , boosted by feathered visitors from Scandinavia .
As red list species go they are certainly some way off extinction in the UK .
But when compared with their soaring numbers throughout much of the 20th century , their future is now far less secure .
Predators such as foxes and mink have had an impact , as well as avian botulism , a bacteria picked up from warm contaminated water which has led to deaths , particularly in Ireland .
More significantly , according to experts , the rise and fall of herring gulls is closely tied to the fluctuating fortunes of commercial fishing .
" They are a familiar sight swirling in clouds around trawlers returning to port , and their numbers certainly built up on the back of the growth in the fishing industry , " says Grahame Madge , the RSPB 's spokesman .
" It provided them and other sea birds with discards of undersized fish and with offal as catches were cleaned at sea .
But as the industry has declined along with fish stocks , the feeding opportunities for gulls have reduced , and that will have played its part in the decline of the herring gull and other birds such as the fulmar . "
If herring gulls reaped the benefits of our wasteful approach at sea , then they have also done much the same inland , plundering rubbish dumps that became a rich source of scraps after the 1956 Clean Air Act prevented the burning of domestic refuse .
Targets to reduce biodegradable waste at landfill sites mean these opportunities for free lunches may also diminish .
While still predominantly a coastal bird , city living has proved to their liking , as it is relatively free from predators and offers local sources of food , with street lighting enabling birds to pilfer late - night takeaway leftovers .
A few took to rooftop nesting in the 1920s , and the habit spread so that today thousands of pairs breed in built up areas and raise young that largely grow up as committed townies .
The catch - all term " sea" gull has become , for them at least , something of a misnomer .
The behaviour of these urban invaders is n't always as neighbourly as it could be .
Corrosive splotches of guano on cars and menacing dive - bombing in defence of their chicks , raids on dustbins and ear - splitting calls at the break of dawn are the stuff of Asbos .
As a result all manner of tactics have been deployed to deter them , including fitting plastic eagle owls to chimneys or broadcasting taped distress calls , but this can simply push the problem from one rooftop to another .
According to urban gull expert Peter Rock , who has spent the last 30 years ringing and studying them , the numbers of herring gulls and their close relatives lesser black - backed gulls are rising " exponentially " in the cities they have colonised , such as Gloucester , Bath , Bristol , Aberdeen and Cardiff .
He argues that the future management of urban gulls must be based on " science rather than guesswork " , and has applied in conjunction with Bristol University for funding to study their feeding habits and economic impact .
" I do n't think we will ever be entirely rid of them , " he says .
" We will find a way of managing them so they are less successful .
It is not going to be cheap and it is going to be a long haul . "
In response to their wider population decline , Natural England this year tightened up the licensing controls for those wanting to eradicate herring gulls as a pest – a move that has been welcomed by the RSPB .
" In certain situations , such as airport or hospital environments , there can be a case for culling them , " says Madge .
" But what we have never been comfortable with is destroying gulls for spurious public health and safety reasons or in nuisance situations such as nesting in towns and waking people up .
" We have always had a great deal of sympathy for those who are troubled by these birds .
They can be a nuisance and we have never shied away from that .
But if we just try to remove the bird we are not removing the problem .
The reasons they have adapted to urban environments is that there is plenty of food around .
Our throwaway culture is providing them with an easy living .
The ultimate objective should be to see the native population build up in coastal colonies , where they will present less of a problem . "
Given the part we play in providing for herring gulls , we can never know what the perfect natural target population should be .
But the fact that they continue to rapidly lose ground demonstrates that even relatively common species can never be taken for granted .
One in five British bird species have halved in number or range over the last 25 years .
Niall Burton , the BTO 's head of wetland and marine research , says data from repeated seabird survey work has shed light on the plight of herring gulls .
" We should be concerned if previously abundant species are in steep decline , be they herring gulls or house sparrows , because it suggests there is something wrong with their environment , " he says .
" Herring gulls are a familiar element of seaside holidays and it would be a great shame if their numbers were to reduce still further . "
Few birds are as self - assured and approachable , which allows us to appreciate herring gulls at close quarters : their diligent parenting , complex interactions and smart appearance ( that red spot near the tip of their bill acts like a vending machine button – a tap on it from their young prompts adults to regurgitate food ) .
They are also quick to learn , and this , coupled with a lifespan of up to 30 years , may help coastal populations exploit new sources of food and make good recent losses .
Whether encountering them on mudflats or multi-storey car parks , herring gulls are always worth a second look – perhaps now more so than ever , in the knowledge that despite their fierce expressions and anti-social tendencies , they have been having a tough time of it lately .

' Something smells here , ' finds 538.com , suggesting possibility of ' very devious manipulation ' of voting machines or tabulators ...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/11/2010 , 8:55 pm PT
This post is an update to our earlier one today , which highlighted early , unexplained disparities seen by academic experts working on behalf of South Carolina Democrats , between paper - ballot absentee voting results and those from the 100 % unverifiable ES&S iVotronic touch - screen systems used on Election Day last Tuesday in South Carolina for the Democratic U.S. Senate primary race between the unheard of , jobless candidate Alvin Greene ( who did absolutely no campaigning ) , and state legislator Vic Rawl ( who did ) .
As we detailed in the previous post , Greene 's " victory , " thus far , seems to make absolutely no legitimate sense to state Democrats , or anybody else , in truth .
The disparities in the voting patterns were described by experts quoted in Politico earlier today as " curious , " " staggering , " and " red flags , " and by Election Integrity experts who we quoted as " clear signs of election fraud . "
Please read that post first for the full background on this story .
We 've already included one update to our previous post , based on a post by Tom Schaller at FiveThirtyEight.com , a site which focuses on statistical analysis of elections .
That post examined the possibility of the race factor in Greene 's " win " over Rawl as the former is African American while the latter is white .
Schaller 's analysis of precinct data in the race , however , as compared to non-white registrants in each , found " no relationship between the race of a county 's registrants and Greene 's performance in that county , " thus largely , but not entirely , ruling out race as an explanation for the bizarre results .
While Schaller had posited four existing possibilities for what " could have happened here " in his original article --- including the possibility of " systematic " election fraud --- he has now filed a follow - up report describing the matter as " getting weirder by the hour . "
His new piece includes a number of reports from other statistical experts which " suggest tampering , or at least machine malfunction , perhaps at the highest level " ...
Schaller 's follow - up piece quotes from a number of analyses by statistician and election expert colleagues of his which narrow down the possibilities of what " could have happened here , " to just " two scenarios . "
The analyses by Schaller 's colleagues find , among other things , statistical tests in which " Rawl 's Election Day vote totals depart from the expected distribution at 90 % confidence .
In other words , the observed vote pattern for Rawl could be expected to occur only about 10 % of the time by chance . "
The results of those tests lead Schaller to believe " something smells here . "
Another analysis debunks the theory that the results were due to GOP dirty - tricksters , crossing over in SC 's open primary to vote for the candidate presumed to be the easiest one for Republican incumbent Sen. Jim DeMint to defeat in November .
" In conclusion , " writes the author of the analysis examining that theory , " while the voting patterns in the D - Senate primary are strange and may not be totally legitimate , they do n't bear the expected hallmarks that would arise in the case of a Republican plant . "
Schaller then summarizes what he sees as the dwindling possibilities for what may have happened as such :
[ W]e can almost certainly eliminate the idea that there was a coordinated GOP effort to get Republican and / or conservative voters to pick up Democratic ballots with the intent of selecting Greene as DeMint 's general election opponent .
That leaves what I think are now two scenarios : A . The first is a combination of the first and second possibilities of my initial post : Greene was a nobody , but Rawl was darn near close to a nobody , and thus Greene 's alphabetical ballot position , coupled with whatever signal the spelling of his surname sent to some African Americans that he might be ( and in fact is ) an African American , with a dash of Rawl 's high disapproval among the 18 percent of survey respondents who had heard of him , combined to take what in theory might otherwise have been a 50/50 split among two broadly unknown candidates and turned it instead into a 59 / 41 race .
B. Somebody with access to software and machines engineered a very devious manipulation of the vote returns -- but not so devious that he / she / they were unable to cover the tracks of the digit patterns in those results .
While we 're certainly not a statistical analyst , and nowhere near as smart as Schaller , the first of his two scenarios above does not seem to take into account the disparities noted previously between the paper - based absentee votes and those cast on the unverifiable touch - screen systems on Election Day .
While Scenario
A would seem to make potential sense , it seems that the same voting patterns would apply to both Election Day votes cast at the polls as well as absentee votes cast in the same race .
But that was n't the case , as we detailed in our previous article , which quotes academic experts who found , among other similar anomalies , " a staggering 84 percent to 16 percent margin " in favor of Rawl in Lancaster County , where " Greene easily led among Election Day voters by 17 percentage points . "
Overall , a study by an academic expert has found , according to the Rawl campaign , that " the result in the Senate election is statistically highly significant : Rawl performs 11 percentage points better among absentee voters than he does among Election Day voters . "
If Scenario A does n't similarly apply to both the absentee and Election Day vote counts , that would seem to point to his Scenario B , " a very devious manipulation of the vote returns , " or what we 'll call " Scenario B.1 , " the somewhat less nefarious possibility of out - and - out e-voting system malfunction .
Malfunction and / or programming error with ES&S systems is neither unheard of , nor particularly rare .
We experienced our own similar machine failure while attempting to vote ( unsucessfully ) on an ES&S e-voting system this week in Los Angeles , on the same day as the South Carolina primary , and previously , two years before when the very same system mis-recorded four out of twelve of our votes .
South Carolina itself is no stranger to failure and known breakdowns of the e-voting system .
In the 2008 Republican Party primary in Horry County , as we reported at the time , the ES&S machines failed to work at all for much of the day , leaving voters scrambling to find bits of paper , and even paper towels , on which to cast emergency paper ballots .
For the Democratic primary the following week , the party advised voters to print out sample ballots from off of the Internet before coming to vote , just in case the same train wreck occurred .
And , of course , we could offer countless links to BRAD BLOG reports detailing ES&S touch - screen systems flipping the intended votes of voters right on the screen .
While one would presume a massive case of on - screen vote flipping would be noticed and reported , the fact is , as we 've tried to warn , a vote can appear to register accurately on the screen , but be recorded for anybody or nobody internally , in the only tally that actually counts .
It remains , as we 've often pointed out , impossible to know that any vote has ever been recorded accurately --- ever --- on one of these types of voting machines during an actual election .
Given the well - documented history of malfunction by ES&S iVotronics and its central tabulating system , along with similarly well - documented scientific reports of how easily those specifics systems can be manipulated --- most easily and directly by election insiders --- it 's sounding more and more like there is a serious problem , of some type , in South Carolina 's electronic voting system .
For the record , this is not the only questionable race in South Carolina 's Democratic primary .
We may have more soon on a different race with very odd results .
And there are also strange numbers emerging in South Carolina 's Republican primary as well , where Schaller 's piece quotes a study finding " three counties with more votes cast in [ the ]
Republican governor 's race than reported turnout in the Republican primary , " resulting in the nearly impossible case of zero overvotes or undervotes in that race , across all three counties .
This is n't Arkansas after all , where they also use the same unverifiable ES&S voting systems , which also reported impossible numbers in the May 18th general primary as we reported last week .
Or is it ?
Or Florida , where the still - unexplained failure by the ES&S iVotronic system resulted in some 18,000 votes disappearing all together in Sarasota in the FL - 13 Special Election for the U.S. House in 2006 , resulting in a 329 vote " victory " for the Republican candidate Vern Buchanan over Democrat Christine Jennings .
Or is it ?
" Something smells here , " indeed .

I used some scrap wood to make corners for the cages .
I cut them on a 45 degree angle so they did not hobble me as I walked around my garden .
I screwed in 4 castors - two that swivel and two that do not ( because they were cheaper ) .
The castors I used are a little small for the weight of the garden , I would recommend assuming the soil will weight the same as water ( 1 cubic centimeter of water = 1 mL = 1 gram ) .
To get the weight , measure the volume ( length x width x height ) of the soil in cm and divide it by 1000 to get the weight in kilograms AND the volume in Litres .
Soil and compost are sold in litres so this is a handy number to have .
Do n't forget to divide this weight by the number of wheels to get the weight on each wheel .
If you are in an Imperial country , measure the volume in inches ( length x width x height ) and multiply by 0.03606 to give you the weight in pounds ( lb ) .
As to the volume - I 'm sorry , I 'm an engineer and even I find it confusing to use inches , pounds and gallons !
One day after frustrated Gulf Coast mayors laid into a BP official , saying the company was not doing nearly enough to forestall the spread of the Gulf oil spill , the Coast Guard admiral in charge of the relief effort said that , ultimately , he is in charge .
On Saturday , Orange Beach , Ala. , Mayor Tony Kennon was among the mayors laying blame for the ineffective oil spill response at BP ’s door .
Oil is now washing ashore on Alabama and Florida beaches , and tourism there has fallen 50 percent this year .
Speaking of one oil slick that came ashore , Mayor Kennon said that he “ could not get a skimmer here in time before it made landfall .
That 's inexcusable .
I do n't care how much money BP has to spend .
I want the resources here to handle any situation . ”
IN PICTURES : Louisiana oil spill
But Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , who is in charge of coordinating the federal response , said Sunday that the people in charge of moving assets around the Gulf chessboard were not BP employees , but federal officials in his chain of command .
“ As far as prioritization and directing the oil response , it is the federal on - scene coordinator , the United States Coast Guard ” that is responsible , Allen said on CNN ’s “ State of the Union . ”
It was a rare moment of clarity amid the often confusing posturing that has marked the halting Gulf oil spill response .
Whose responsibility ?
Both the federal government and BP have made broad and non-specific claims of responsibility .
For his part , BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward on Sunday reiterated his statement that BP will clean up the mess its well is causing .
" We 're going to clean - up the oil , we 're going to remediate any environmental damage , and we are going to return the Gulf coast to the position it was in prior to this event , ” he said on the BBC .
“ That 's an absolute commitment , we will be there long after the media has gone , making good on our promises . "
President Obama , meanwhile , said during a recent trip to Louisiana : " I ultimately take responsibility for solving this crisis .
I am the president and the buck stops with me . ”
What has been unclear to local officials on the ground in Louisiana – and now Alabama – is who , exactly , they should call when they spot oil heading for their shores .
For the most part , officials have antagonized BP , and for obvious reasons .
BP ’s pronouncement that the containment cap installed last week is working – siphoning away a “ majority ” of the leaking oil – comes too late for mayors watching oil wash ashore .
“ I would love to have one of your guys go down and look at our beaches and tell me that what you see is effective and is working , " Robert Kraft , mayor of Gulf Shores , Ala. , said at the Saturday local mayors ’ meeting .
The relief hierarchy
Yet Allen ’s comments Sunday made clearer the actual operational hierarchy at the Gulf .
BP , he said , is responsible for making available the necessary assets at its own expense .
It is then the Coast Guard ’s job to oversee the response .
Allen summed it up this way : “ Coast Guard is the federal on - scene coordinator for this response .
BP is the responsible party .
We are the ones accountable to make sure BP does the job . ”
That gap – the space between the logistical capabilities that BP brings to bear and the Coast Guard ’s ability to oversee their deployment effectively – has been the single murkiest area of command and control during the cleanup .
The federal government has never contested BP ’s management of the effort to kill or contain the well – BP alone has the tools and technical know - how .
But the shoreline has been a gray area .
“ I would say on the shore cleanup side , we have more degrees of freedom and more capability and competency we can bring to bear and a greater , wider set of authorities allow us to effect the outcome than on the sea floor – that ’s true , ” Allen said in a May 24 press briefing .
That area , too , is where BP is most deficient , he added :
“ If I were to give you an area where I ’ve had more conversations with BP than any other , it ’s been on the difference between wholesale and retail : BP does wholesale really good as far as massing logistics , moving stuff around , getting it into the warehouses .
That last mile of retail , where you get the siting of the oil , you got to get the boom – you got to coordinate all that , that ’s where the formation has got to be tightened up . ”
Complex effort
The comments of the Alabama mayors , at least , suggest that the formation has not been tightened adequately in recent weeks .
This is partly because the cleanup effort is not a black - and - white tableau of BP and the Coast Guard .
Much of the cleanup is being done by a kaleidoscope of contractors paid by BP .
But even in his briefing two weeks ago , Allen said the federal government was at the top of that hierarchy of organizations .
“ It ’s a multifunctional team , multi - disciplined team .
And they ’re staffed by the local federal on - scene coordinator , ” he said .

His passion for WordPress , both the software and the community , has gained him considerable respect and appreciation around the community .
He was kind enough to answer a few questions for our interview series .
Jeff Chandler

Favorite WordPress Feature : Automatic Core , Plugin and Theme Updates .
How long have you been working with WordPress ?
Since 2007 .
How did you get started with WordPress ?
When I decided to take blogging seriously in 2007 , I decided to use my Joomla knowledge to build the site .
I quickly found out that Joomla would be too much for what I needed .
I ca n’t remember how I discovered WordPress but after I installed it for the first time and tried to edit a theme , I was overwhelmed and thought that it was too difficult to do anything in WordPress .
I went back to my Joomla setup until I realized that it simply would n’t work so I decided to give WordPress a second try .
Only after I figured out template tags and the way WordPress themes are developed did I finally get a sense of zen as I have n’t looked back since .
Where does the passion for the WordPress community come from ?
That ’s a good question .
WordPress is a piece of software that has an international reach .
Every day , someone somewhere is doing something cool with the software .
Whether it ’s a cool plugin or a beautiful theme or perhaps even a tool to help others , there ’s always something new around the bend .
In fact , there is so much new stuff happening within and around WordPress every week that it ’s impossible for one man to cover it all .
However , what I enjoy most is talking to people that no one has ever heard of such as the guy running his own hyper-local website for his community powered by WordPress or the woman that has developed a vibrant community surrounding her recipes using Buddy Press .
All of the developments week in and week out not only surrounding the core software but the people making a difference for the rest of us is what fuels my passion for the software as well as the community .
Earlier this year you launched a VIP program .
What brought you to start it , and why did you later close it down ?
The VIP program was something put together to enable another revenue stream .
The idea was to give VIP members exclusive coupons for products , give them their own area to talk , a job board as well as other content .
However , I just never had enough time to put forth the effort in the program to justify the cost .
I felt as if I was not delivering and in fact , those that had purchased accounts ended up wasting their money .
I could n’t take it anymore so I refunded everyone that had signed up and closed down that section of the forums so I would n’t have to worry about it anymore .
Did the campaign to bring back the VIP program sway your opinion ?
As usually happens in my little neck of the woods , someone started a thread discussing the idea of bringing back the program .
That thread has not swayed my opinion but since there is interest in helping to support the work that I do , I have a major call for help that will be on the website within the next few days .
If you could change one thing in about the WordPress community , what would it be ?
If I could change one thing about the community , it would be to remove the asshats and replace them all with unicorns , pots of gold and triple rainbows .
The human element is needed to keep the WordPress project a well oiled machine but it ’s this human element that at times can be the software ’s own worst enemy .
Not only can the software succumb to the human element , but the community surrounding the software also suffers at times .
At the end of the day though , that ’s just the way it is .
What do you have planned in the future for WP Tavern ?
You ask a tough question .
With the death of my father - in - law that occurred recently and my stint away from writing and monitoring the community , it ’s given me some time to think about what I want to do .
Right now , WPTavern does not bring in enough income to live on and the income stream is very unreliable and not constant .
On the other hand , I ’ve never really taken myself or WPTavern seriously as a business where I put 110 % into the site .
Another thing that has bothered me is that I seem to have strayed away from what was making WPTavern successful in it ’s earlier days in that I ’ve branched off to write about bbPress , BuddyPress , etc , I ’ve lacked consistency in publishing content and I ’ve also lowered the amount of content I publish .
It ’s weird because since I began to write for an audience instead of for myself , I care about how many posts are published in a day , what posts should or should not be published , what to write about and what not to write about .
I ’ve tried to overcome these limitations I ’ve put on myself but it ’s been difficult .
So regarding the Tavern , I can tell you that after giving it some thought , I am going to try to focus on WordPress only with just a sprinkling of the other stuff .
I am going to try and become consistent again with at least one post a day while some days there may be five posts .
I ’m going to point more people to the forum and continue to make sure it ’s running like a well oiled machine .
In fact , the beautiful thing about the forum is that it ’s now running itself .
People are finding it via referrals and Google and signing up , mainly for troubleshooting but it ’s cool to see that there are almost 1,000 registered users .
I ’m going to bring back the WordPress Weekly podcast and implement more news elements into the show such as 5 - 10 minute interview segments with the news makers themselves .
As for WordCamp coverage , I ’ll put the call out to any company that would like to sponsor me for a particular event and if any of them bite the bait , I ’ll be able to record sessions and create video interviews from those events for those that could n’t make it .
Outside of WordPress and blogging , what do you enjoy doing ?
I enjoy spending time with my fiancee , playing Battlefield Bad Company 2 , wasting time on YouTube and living on the world wide web .
A big thanks to Jeff for the interview !
Let me know in the comments who else you would like interviews with .

Donsol , Philippines ( CNN ) --
" Welcome to Donsol , the home of the gentle giants , " Alan Amanse says smiling broadly at us as we awkwardly scramble onto the traditional fishing boat .
" We have something must be followed ; the rules about whale shark interaction . "
He 's delivered this speech countless times , but says he never tires of seeing newcomers eager faces .
Donsol in the province of Sorsogon , Philippines , was once a sleepy fishing village , now it buzzes with excited tourists who flock here for what many later describe as a life changing experience -- swimming with the largest fish in the ocean , the whale shark .
I have to admit , I was filled with childish excitement I had n't experienced in years .
" If I say ' Ok , let 's rock and roll ' , its time to get in the water ; that 's my magic word , ' rock and roll ' , " Alan tells us , perched on the edge of the boat , a devilish twinkle in his eyes .
He and the crew are experts at whale shark spotting , able to scan what to us looks like a blank horizon for signs of the sharks below the surface .
Small boats filled with tourists dot the tricolor waters , the shoreline rolling hills of emerald green .
" Look , look right there , " Alan points at what to me initially looks like nothing .
" Wow !
Its huge , 3 - meters - long , about 20 meters in front of us , " I shrieked as I began to make out the dark shape moving along side our boat .
We jumped in , but only just barely caught a glimpse of the whale shark before it disappeared into the depths of the ocean .
I should note at this stage that despite my initial reaction 3 meters is n't a " huge " whale shark , they can grow up to 20 meters in length .
In fact at 3 meters they are still considered young , and seeing small ones is a rarity we are told .
The whale shark interactions are closely regulated ; 6 tourists per boat , 1 boat per whale shark , and no more than 30 boats in the water at a time .
Plus , we 're briefed to swim 3 meters away from the head and body , 4 meters away from the tail -- one powerful inadvertent hit can cause serious damage .
We had a professional underwater cameraman , Rico , added on to our crew for the day .
I envied his lung capacity , his ability to free dive for minutes alongside these majestic creatures , filming them from all angles while I gasped for air and struggled to keep up .
We end up spotting a total of four whale sharks , the last one huge and right underneath our boat .
It stayed close to the surface as if bemused by the attention and splashing .
I managed to dive down and see its gentle eyes , upturned mouth formed into a permanent smile .
All I could think was , " Wow " .
That short moment I had was special , as if nothing existed but me and this graceful animal .
Eco-tourism has changed everyone 's life in Donsol .
Alan tells us how he used to have to take on odd jobs -- driving a tricycle taxi , construction work , playing guitar at bars -- to make ends meet .
Now he makes six times what he used to , enough money to put his two children through school , even university .
Like most people in these parts , Alan used to view whale sharks as pests , constantly getting caught up in fishing nets and overturning boats .
He says they were also hunted by villagers from other areas .
" Before I am not thinking that we need to save the whale shark because we do n't have an idea of the whale shark , " he admits .
According to the World Wildlife Fund , whale sharks are coveted in many countries .
Their meat can sell for up to $ 17 per kilo , their fins a staggering $ 800 .
The attitude towards whale sharks here changed nearly overnight .
Credited with helping to make that happen is Dave Duran , a charismatic , passionate cameraman turned diver .
Twelve years ago he shot footage of the whale sharks and brought it to international spotlight , to the attention of the World Wildlife Fund , marine biologists and scientists .
Suddenly Donsol became a major research destination .
Little is known about whale sharks , a major part of preserving the species is understanding their migratory routes and breeding habits .
Within three months of Dave going public with his footage the Philippine government issued a ban on fishing whale sharks .
" If we were just late for about a month or so the story would have been different , " he tells us .
" Maybe now we would be seeing whale sharks being slaughtered here , right on this beach . "
Eco Solutions have covered many stories in the ongoing battle of preservation vs. destruction .
Here the balance shifted in favor of nature .
" It 's just a matter of luck , " Dave says .
" We gave [ the people of Donsol ] some sort of hope that eco-tourism could work in Donsol and they believed it . "
CNN is reporting right now that for the birds that can be saved and cleaned , they 'll be transplanted to Tampa .
If they are not captured and cleaned quickly , they die quickly because they can't fly , hunt for food , or breath .
Oh , and Happy Birthday to Anderson Cooper .
Your reporting on this disaster has been a gift to us all , painful as it is .

This PDF report is from the Official Deepwater Horizon Response website .
Consolidated Fish and Wildlife Collection Report
DATE : June 3 , 2010
These are the consolidated numbers of collected fish and wildlife that have been reported to the Unified Area Command from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) , National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , incident area commands , rehabilitation centers and other authorized sources operating within the Deepwater Horizon / BP incident
impact area .
Obviously , the source is n't exactly unbiased , but nonetheless it 's the only official numbers we have to go by :
Chinese workers are taking industrial action .
A generational shift and new expectations among workers have changed labour relations .
The government looks for a quick fix , to little avail , and as usual , sends in the police .
Shanghai ( AsiaNews ) – Fresh strikes have broken out in mainland China , this time in the affluent Yangtze River Delta , where hundreds of workers clashed with police on Monday morning trying to forcibly stop their sit - in outside a rubber factory near Shanghai .
Meanwhile , a strike at a Honda - affiliated plant in the city of Foshan looks set to continue for a third day .
The strike , involving more than 250 of the 300 workers at the Foshan Fengfu Autoparts plant , brought in heavy police deployment .
Demonstrators said they were inspired by the two - week strike by fellow workers in the manufacturing sector , which yielded a 500 - yuan pay raise .
Workers , in addition to this raise , want their union representative removed , saying that he is management and thus can not be a trade union official .
In China , trade unions exist but they are under tight party , hence , government control .
Geoffrey Crothall , a spokesman for the Hong Kong - based group China Labour Bulletin , said the presence of police and clashes with workers have become part of the ongoing social confrontation .
“ There has definitely been an upsurge in worker discontent and activism this year , " he said .
" It is n't just in southern China .
We are seeing it in central provinces and now in the Yangtze River Delta .
And it is not just the young — middle - aged workers are now beginning to say ‘ enough is enough , give us our due ’ . "
He explained that worker activism tended to come in waves .
There was a big surge in 2008 but things went relatively quiet last year due to the economic downturn .
“ As things begin to improve and orders are now starting to pick up again , workers are quite rightly wanting their fair share of the profits .
As long as workers are being paid ridiculously low wages that can't even provide basic subsistence living costs , then they are going to start standing up for themselves . ”
The central government , which fears social protests as the only force with the potential to overthrow the Communist Party , has dealt with the problem with half - hearted measures .
For instance , for the past four weeks the People ’s Daily has published blistering articles against company managers , urging them to respond positively to workers ’ just demands .
However , the authorities do not allow free trade unions and usually crack down on anyone trying to oppose companies ’ excessive power .
Following events in Honda and Foxconn ( where 13 employees committed suicide ) , things appear to be getting worse .
Under the circumstances , the government has decided to use force .
What is more , in addition to police deployment in plants affected by strikes , reports are coming in of violence inside factories .
Employees at Taiwan - owned KOK International in Kunshan ( Jiangsu ) have complained for example about indiscriminate violence against them by so - called “ security agents ” , involved in trying to stop protests inside the plant ( pictured ) .
Far beyond traditional listing services , we rely upon many platform tools offered by Nasdaq to help us operate more intelligently , whether it be shareholder targeting , corporate engagement , or policy advocacy on behalf of public companies .
An open letter from actor Jon Voight to President Obama :
June 22 , 2010
President Obama :
You will be the first American president that lied to the Jewish people , and the American people as well , when you said that you would defend Israel , the only Democratic state in the Middle East , against all their enemies .
You have done just the opposite .
You have propagandized Israel , until they look like they are everyone ’s enemy — and it has resonated throughout the world .
You are putting Israel in harm ’s way , and you have promoted anti-Semitism throughout the world .
You have brought this to a people who have given the world the Ten Commandments and most laws we live by today .
The Jewish people have given the world our greatest scientists and philosophers , and the cures for many diseases , and now you play a very dangerous game so you can look like a true martyr to what you see and say are the underdogs .
But the underdogs you defend are murderers and criminals who want Israel eradicated .
You have brought to Arizona a civil war , once again defending the criminals and illegals , creating a meltdown for good , loyal , law - abiding citizens .
Your destruction of this country may never be remedied , and we may never recover .
I pray to God you stop , and I hope the people in this great country realize your agenda is not for the betterment of mankind , but for the betterment of your politics .
With heartfelt and deep concern for America and Israel ,
Jon Voight

Often there was a precise association in her work .
After she had created a number of vertical spirals that seemed to twist in space , she evoked childhood memories of the tapestry business and her family : “ When a tapestry had to be washed in the river , it took four people to hoist it out and twist it .
Twisting is very important for me .
When I dreamt of getting rid of the mistress , it was by twisting her neck . ”
At the age of 20 , she entered the Sorbonne to study mathematics and geometry , disciplines that she valued for their stability .
“ I got peace of mind , ” she later said , “ only through the study of rules nobody could change . ”
But she left to enroll in a succession of art schools , and counted Fernand Léger among her teachers .
In 1938 she married Robert Goldwater , an American art historian noted for his pioneering work in the field then referred to as primitive art .
They moved to New York City that same year , and Ms. Bourgeois attended the Art Students League , where she studied painting with Vaclav Vytlacil and also produced sculpture and prints .
She knew many of the European surrealists then arriving as refugees in New York ( she later dismissed them as “ smart alecks ” ) , but the artists to whom she felt closest were the American painters who would come to be known as Abstract Expressionists .
Ms. Bourgeois had a solo show of paintings in New York in 1945 and her first exhibition of sculpture — an installation of tall , polelike figures that she intended as abstract portraits of family members and friends — four years later at the Peridot Gallery , at which time she gave up painting for good .
She enjoyed some professional success as a sculptor thereafter ( she participated in the Whitney Museum of American Art ’s Annual Exhibition almost yearly until 1962 ) .
But a significant shift in her career came in 1966 , when she was included in an exhibition at the Fischbach Gallery in New York , “ Eccentric Abstraction , ” organized by the critic Lucy Lippard .
It is sometimes suggested that there is n’t a real difference in terms of “ openness ” between share - alike ( SA ) and non-commercial ( NC ) clauses — both being some restriction on what the user of that material can do , and , as such , a step away from openness .
This is not true .
A meaningful distinction can be drawn between share - alike and non-commercial clauses ( or any other clause that discriminates against a particular type of person or field of endeavour ) , with the former being “ open ” and the latter being not “ open ” .
This distinction is important .
It has relevance , for example , as to why Open Data Commons should not provide NC licenses but will provide a share - alike one .
As well as to Creative Commons whose set of licenses includes both share - alike and non-commercial options .
As such , not all CC licenses are open and CC licenses are are not all mutually compatible .
This is something of an irony as it means that Creative Commons provide a set of licenses that do n’t , in fact , result in a commons .
What ’s the Problem ?
Why Does This Matter ?
What ’s the problem with NC licenses , are n’t “ SA ” licenses a step away from open too ?
And if we debate this , do n’t we just end up having a pointless license holy war ?
The distinction between NC and SA licenses is n’t about “ holy war ” but something very practical : license compatibility and the integrity of the “ open ” commons .
The core of a “ commons ” of data ( or code ) is that one piece of “ open ” material contained therein can be freely intermixed with other “ open ” material .
This interoperability is absolutely key to realizing the main practical benefits of “ openness ” which is the ease of use and reuse — which , in turn , mean more and better stuff getting created and used .
The Open Knowledge / Data Definition functions as a “ standard ” to ensure interoperability just in the same way as normal tech standards operate ( but in this case for licenses rather than for a piece of hardware or software ) .
The aim is to ensure that any license which complies with the definition will be interoperable with any other such license meaning that data or content under the one license can be combined with data or content under the other license .
Share - alike or attribution requirements are allowed within the definition precisely because they do not break this interoperability ( and may even help promote the commons by ensuring material is “ shared back ” ) .
Non-commercial provisions are not permitted because they fundamentally break the commons , not only through being incompatible with other licenses but because they overtly discriminate against particular types of users .
( I should emphasize here that the definition is directly following the line set out in the original open source definition …)
Thus , there is a meaningful distinction between attribution and share - alike requirements and other such as non-commercial ( NC ) , and it is a distinction that merits the description of share - alike licenses as being open but non-commercial licenses as not being open .
Is n’t It Just About Degree ?
Yes , NC and especially ND are more restrictive , but stating that NC
licenses are n’t open is wrong – they ’re just not as open .
This is incorrect .
To reiterate : it is a mistake to view the set of licenses as some continuous spectrum of ‘ openness ’ with PD at one end and full rights reserved at the other — with the implication that all licenses in between are more or less open .
There are significant discontinuities and in particular we can meaningfully partition the set of licenses into open and not - open based on a ) their interoperability b ) the freedom they provide to all persons ( and companies ) to use , reuse and redistribute .
But You Can’t Trademark Openness …
it ’s annoying that someone claims to be releasing data openly , but it turns out to be
NC and no -compete and a bunch of other stuff .
It would be nice to say to them – “ you ca n’t claim to be open because you do n’t meet this
definition ” .
But unfortunately it would probably be difficult to get
the trademark on the word “ open ”
It ’s quite right that you ca n’t trademark openness — and no - one should want to !
However , we can make an effort as a community to have a clear shared meaning for “ open ” in relation to data and content along the lines of — just as the open source definition has done for code .
By insisting on this meaning we are doing something valuable : creating a standard and maintaining interoperability .
God , what we would give to be Rahm Emanuel and Joe Biden .

Letting Rand Paul Twist in the Wind
By Larry Elder
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com | Libertarian Rand Paul , Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate from Kentucky , shocked many conservatives when he refused to give full - throated support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
The Act criminalized public sector racial discrimination , and struck down laws that required discrimination and segregation .
But it went much further .
It outlawed racial discrimination by private actors such as restaurant and hotel owners who refused to serve blacks .
National Review's Rich Lowry , for example , wrote : " [ T ] he Civil Rights Act was the last spasm of the Civil War .
The South had frustrated the imposition of black civil rights during Reconstruction in a low - grade insurgency that successfully rumbled on into the 1960s .
Black civil rights were n't going to be vindicated any time soon , absent the application of federal power again ...
I 'm sympathetic to libertarianism , but it sometimes has a weakness for theoretical exercises removed from reality . "
This sounds like a white , guilt - ridden rationalization to justify an abandonment of principle .
And it has real world , not merely " theoretical , " consequences .
For one thing , it encourages grievance - driven race - based identity politics — and invites special - interest legislation to protect all manner of niche groups perceived as having been " held down by The Man . "
It is in these waters that professional victim seekers and exploiters like the Rev. Al Sharpton , race and gender " advocacy groups , " and the Democratic Party do their fishing .
Rand 's critics also unintentionally expose the condescending way " compassionate conservatives " deem that blacks — still standing after slavery and Jim Crow — are in need of protection by rare " noble " whites from the bigot - infested world through which blacks are obviously incapable of navigating .
Why else throw overboard the just and basic principle that private actors , short of engaging in force or fraud , should behave as they wish ?
What about the pro-life pharmacist who considers it immoral to stock and sell the morning - after pill ?
What about the landlady who thinks homosexuality is immoral and refuses to rent to a gay couple ?
What if she refuses to rent to an illegal alien ?
What about the " morally straight " Boy Scouts organization that discriminates against an openly gay scoutmaster ?
What about the healthy 25 - year - old who refuses to purchase health insurance ?
Republicans go all deer - in - the - headlights when someone questions their colorblind bona fides .
But when Nazi sympathizers want publicly to march , many conservatives correctly defend the " right . "
Constitutional rights extend to both saints and sinners and those in between , no matter the outrage — in this instance of Jewish Holocaust survivors over the prospect of swastika - wearing fascists parading through their neighborhood .
This is freedom 101 .
It is this freedom to discriminate that enabled Black Entertainment Television founder Robert Johnson to become a billionaire through the use of race - based programming .
It is this freedom that allows the Miss Black America beauty pageant to exclude non-black applicants .
It is this freedom that allows private colleges and universities to discriminate against white applicants with higher SAT scores to achieve " diversity " by helping the " underrepresented . "
The Congressional Black Caucus discriminates when it refuses membership to whites , as it did recently to a white Tennessee representative even though he represents a majority black district .
If National Review 's Lowry owned a restaurant , would he discriminate against blacks ?
Does he intimately know anyone who would do so ?
How would he treat friends who patronized restaurants that refused blacks ?
Of course he would n't exclude .
Nor would his friends or associates .
Obviously none of those " noble " souls in his immediate circle would consort with racists .
So why assume that some unacceptable percentage of the " unwashed masses " will act as merchant - racists — either without harmful consequences or the willingness to accept those consequences ?
Why do we further assume that , whatever the number of bigots , they will be capable of meaningfully affecting the day - to - day lives of blacks ?
If anything , these racists would have publicly outed themselves as part of the bad and the ugly .
The consequences of government coercion are more harmful than the certainty that some will use their freedom in ways that offend .
Bad behavior tends to get punished in the social and business " marketplace . "
The Boston Red Sox , one of the last teams to hire black ballplayers , discovered fans valued winning much more than team racial homogeneity .
The well - intended , but misguided , passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — as applied to private conduct — sought to change not only whites ' behavior but also their " feelings . "
Some blacks perceive racial hostility toward them from their local Korean grocer .
But if treated with a smile and offered quality goods at fair prices , most blacks patronize the store .
People expect and respond to a certain measure of respect as a customer , regardless of how the proprietors may personally " feel " about them .
Instead of defending Paul on this issue against race - card - playing leftists like MSNBC's Rachel Maddow , conservatives / Republicans / pundits panicked .
How are we to get the country back on the course set by its Founders if we cannot stand with the Rand Pauls of the nation on the bedrock principle of maximum personal liberty ?
Of the many regulatory problems that helped make the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster possible , the Endangered Species Act 's shortcomings have received little attention – but fixing its flaws and loopholes could help prevent future catastrophes .
Oil companies never considered the impacts of a massive spill on the Gulf 's sperm whales or five sea turtle species .
They did n't have to , because the law does n't require it .
" We need to include disaster planning in the Endangered Species Act consultation process , " said environmental lawyer Keith Rizzardi .
" We can learn from experience . "
So far , critics have focused on the Minerals Management Service 's evasion of National Environmental Policy Act , which requires federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts when making decisions .
The MMS essentially operated in collusion with the oil industry in what one federal investigator called " a culture of ethical failure , " allowing drilling to proceed without NEPA review .
Those approvals have continued , with at least 19 environmental waivers granted since the April 20 explosion .
The MMS also ignored the Endangered Species Act , which demands consideration of impacts on endangered species .
Since January 2009 , the MMS has approved 346 drilling plans without getting required permits – but even if they 'd followed the Act 's letter , it probably would n't have mattered .
Reviews would only have considered the physical footprints of wells , ship traffic and other relatively small impacts .
That 's because the Endangered Species
Act only requires consideration of events that are " reasonably certain to occur . "
That a wellhead would blow – as happened 36 times in the Gulf between 1992 and 2006 – and release a steady stream of oil was not so far - fetched as the industry insisted , but it was n't reasonably certain .
Rizzardi intends to discuss changes to the Act at the next meeting of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee , of which he is a member .
Congress has the ultimate responsibility for changing the law , which would be relatively easy , requiring little more than amendments to its wording .
" It 's more a matter of politics than law , " said Penn State environmental law professor Jamison Colburn .
Environmental law specialist J.B. Ruhl of Florida State University said that planning for every conceivable disaster would be difficult , and that far - fetched possibilities might discourage legitimate development .
But he agreed that considering catastrophic risk is " a valid question , " and Rizzardi said that amendments need n't paralyze development , but would simply require foresight and planning .
In the event of disaster , agencies and companies could say , " We can't guarantee that it wo n't cause extinction – but we can do everything possible to mitigate the disaster , " said Rizzardi .
" We do n't do any of that now . "
The lack of planning has been painfully evident in the Gulf , where deployment of obvious , first - line relief measures – oil skimmers , containment structures , chemical dispersants – were logistically delayed and poorly understood .
Had the Endangered Species
Act demanded it , those plans might have been made .
In addition to considering catastrophes , the Endangered Species Act also needs to restrict what 's called segmented consultation , in which impacts are evaluated only in incremental blocks – over , say , the first few years of a project , rather than its expected lifetime .
That makes it easy to avoid thinking about long - term problems .
" Incremental step consultation is most appropriate for long - term , multi-staged activities for which agency actions occur in discrete steps , such as the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf , " reads the ESA now .
" Segmentation into oblivion goes on all the time , " said Colburn .
But Colburn warned that amendments are only a first step .
Endangered Species
Act enforcement is woefully underfunded .
Total federal spending on endangered species amounts to about $ 562 million , including what 's given to NOAA and the Fish and Wildlife Service , who are responsible for protecting the animals and evaluating plans submitted by other federal agencies .
Both NOAA and FWS are barely able to handle what 's already asked of them , and have more incentive to complete reviews and reduce backlog than to do their jobs right , said Colburn .
" Americans do n't want to spend more money for environmental protection , but they have to , " said Colburn .
" If you want to have a market economy with agents like BP out there , you need to have well - funded environmental enforcement . "

The new dress code for striking Israeli diplomats
Israeli diplomats have started wearing jeans and sandals to work as part of a labour dispute over pay conditions , foreign ministry officials have said .
Diplomatic employees are demanding wages on par with their colleagues at the defence and intelligence agencies .
The strike could disrupt PM Benjamin Netanyahu 's upcoming trip to the US .
The workers ' pay committee has urged employees at Israel 's Washington embassy not to make arrangements for his visit in July , local reports say .
According to the committee , foreign ministry employees are paid half of what the defence ministry staff and members of the intelligence community who serve abroad receive , even though they do the same amount of work .
Dressing down
The dispute - now entering its sixth month - is becoming increasingly public .
Several employees of the foreign ministry have abandoned the normal suit - and - tie dress code , and were coming to work in jeans and sandals , an official told the BBC on condition of anonymity .
The partial strike has also extended to the foreign ministry 's visitors ' department , which is in charge of rolling out the red carpet for foreign dignitaries , the official said .
On Monday , Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon was forced to welcome visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov without the customary ceremony because no - one had organised one , the AFP news agency reports .
Mr Lavrov is due to meet top Israeli officials in Jerusalem before travelling to Ramallah for talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on the last day of his two - day visit .
According to the workers ' pay committee , foreign ministry employees are paid half of what the defence ministry staff and members of the intelligence community who serve abroad receive , even though they do the same amount of work .
As flights resume , how dangerous is it to fly through a volcanic ash cloud ?
Driving could actually be a lot more dangerous , says Julian Baggini .
" The safety of air passengers is of paramount importance . "
So spoke Gordon Brown this week , defending the flight restrictions that have been put in place due to the volcanic ash cloud .
And could he really have said anything else ?
Has any leader every claimed that the safety of the people is his second priority ?
However , the ethics of risk is not as straightforward as the rhetoric of " paramount importance " suggests .
People talk of the " precautionary principle " or " erring on the side of caution " but governments are always trading safety for convenience or other gains .
Many Americans avoided planes after 9/11 and travelled by road instead resulting in an estimated 1,200 more deaths on the roads
Big task for airlines as ban ends
For instance , 30 mph speed limits on motorways would increase road safety , but almost no - one is advocating them .
Lord Adonis , the transport minister , would sound callous if he said slowing cars down is too high a price to pay to save a few hundred lives per year , but that is precisely the rationale for the policy .
In this respect , governments are only behaving as we all do .
We take risks all the time , and safety is never allowed to trump all other concerns .
The under 30s could eliminate one of their single biggest risks of death at a stroke if they never got into a car , but virtually all consider the inconvenience too high a price to pay .
The problem is that people are generally terrible at making rational decisions about risk .
To take just one of many examples , many Americans avoided planes after 9/11 and travelled by road instead .
As a result , a team of researchers from Cornell University estimated there were at least 1,200 more deaths on America 's roads than there would have been .
Foibles Some 1,200 people died because they were avoiding what they perceived to be a riskier form of transport , 954 more than who died on the planes used for the terrorist attacks .
But governments have to choose on our behalf which risks we should be exposed to .
Should politicians act like concerned parents ?
That poses a difficult ethical dilemma : should government decisions about risk reflect the often irrational foibles of the populace or the rational calculations of sober risk assessment ?
Should our politicians opt for informed paternalism or respect for irrational preferences ?
The volcanic ash cloud is a classic case study .
Were the government to allow flights to go ahead when the risks were equal to those of road travel , it is almost certain that , over the course of the year , hundreds of people would die in resulting air accidents , since around 2,500 die on the roads each year .
This is politically unimaginable , not for good , rational reasons , but because people are much more risk averse when it comes to plane travel than they are to driving their own cars .
So , in practice , governments do not make fully rational risk assessments .
Their calculations are based partly on cost - benefit analyses , and partly on what the public will tolerate .
This means that that the price placed on a human life by different policies varies enormously .
For example , the Train Protection and Warning System put in place after the Ladbroke Grove disaster cost £ 15.4 m per life it has estimated to have saved .
What price a life ?
On the other hand , when the US government allowed speed limits of freeways to be increased to 65 mph , dividing the extra dollars earned due to efficiency gains by the number of lives lost resulted in a price of $ 1.54 m ( about £ 1 m ) per life .
Faced with the choice between risking someone 's life in Africa and an optional new gadget , we routinely choose the latter
In other words , one policy spent £ 15.4 m pounds to save one life and the other sacrificed one life to generate an extra £ 1 m for the economy .
There 's a widespread feeling that it is immoral to put a price on a human life , but in practice governments can't make informed risk decisions without doing so , and we often implicitly support them .
For instance , the cost effectiveness of drugs supplied by the NHS is determined in England , Wales and Northern Ireland , by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) .
Nice , usually determines a treatment not to be value for money if it costs more than £ 20,000 - £ 30,000 per quality - adjusted life year ( QALY ) saved .
This seems absurdly small to many people , who would pay every last penny they had just to secure one QALY .
But if any party went into this election proposing to double National Insurance contributions to double the value Nice puts on a QALY , I do n't think many would vote for it .
We may not like to admit it , but we too think there is such a thing as putting too much value on a human life .
One iPad or two lives saved in the developing world - about $ 500 Indeed , you could argue that we all often value a life at less than £ 160 .
Research by the philosopher Peter Singer suggests the cost of saving a life in the developing world ranges from around $ 250 ( about £ 160 ) - $ 3,500 ( £ 2,270 ) .
Faced with the choice between risking someone 's life in Africa and an optional new gadget , we routinely choose the latter .
What then is a government to do ?
On the one hand , the most rational policy is to do whatever will be most effective in reducing risks .
On the other , it is more democratic to take only the kinds of risks the populace is willing to take , valuing lives lost in the developing world less than lives lost on the road , which are in turn valued less than those lost in the air .
So which is more ethical , the rational or the democratic choice ?
I 'll leave that for you to decide .
You can be pretty sure , however , that as the government weighs up the rational and with public opinion in the case of the current flying restrictions , the latter will weigh more heavily than the former .
That 's democracy .
Julian Baggini is the author of Do They Think You 're Stupid ? : 100 Ways of Spotting Spin and Nonsense from the Media , Celebrities and Politicians ( Granta ) Below is a selection of your comments Finally a little common sense on this issue .
How hard can it be to see that spending fifteen million to save a life is an utter waste of money when we have rationed health care and people are dying for lack of drugs or operations .
A pox on the " if it just saves one life " brigade .
Ian Nartowicz , Stockport , England
There 's another factor to consider .
No insurance company will cover an airline if they see any increased risk - and certainly not flying against official advice .
Remember the governments had to step in after 9/11 .
Increased insurance costs and tighter conditions are making many previously informal events impossible to organise .
It 's not the individual or the operating company who can take a position on risk however rational , it is dictated by governments and the insurance industry .
Alan , London
The article suggests that we are irrational for being much more risk averse when it comes to flying than we are when driving cars but there is a fundamental difference between the two .
When driving a car , people have some measure of control over the risks they experience and , in the worst case , there is always the option of pulling to the side of the road and stopping .
When you fly , you have essentially no control over the risks and the pilot has no option to just park the plane and stop if he feels things are getting too dangerous at 36,000ft .
Anon
If your engine stops in a car you can pull over to the side , not an option in a plane .
Also , you lose not only propulsion but hydraulics , electrical , and possibly instrumentation .
One certainty is that you are coming down - and pretty fast .
Ron Clarke , Northampton , Northamptonshire I was present at a road safety meeting with a country council who were considering the value of investing £ 650,000 in a road safety scheme .
They were told that if it saved ' just one life ' it would save £ 1.56 m .
One councillor pointed out that this cost saving would actually be to the whole of society , rather than their authority and therefore this was misleading .
Life is important then , and saving lives can even provide a cost - saving ; just as long as it goes back into * your* budget .
Kevin Chambers , Anon , England I remember The Goons ' sketch showing them each stepping high over an imaginary tripwire , telling each other : " You ca n't be too careful . "
Tony Wood , Farnborough , Hampshire , UK Is n't this comparing chalk with cheese ?
I can't remember any road accident in the UK causing 100 deaths or more .
In the event of a plane crash especially on a heavily populated area deathswould be hundreds , casualties perhaps thousands .
The " additional " deaths after 9/11 are I see estimates which could be wildly under or over reality .
There are times when people wish to take control of their own lives .
By car , they are doing so , but taking 100 passengers into the air without due regard to those below is not .
Geoff , Swansea / Wales
Is n't it just that we all value the lives of those we know and love as higher than the " unknown stranger " ?
Claire , Surrey , UK
There 's a further issue on the relative safety of driving - the authorities know full well that there are many reasons for road accidents - statistically the highest single factor is falling asleep , while failing to maintain a safe gap to the vehicle in front is another .
Some accidents are even caused by driving too slowly .
Then there are many unnecessary deaths caused by failure to wear seatbelts .
However because it would cost a huge amount to monitor every driver for sleepiness , or to check that everyone is wearing a belt or leaving a safe distance , the authorities effectively ignore those issues and concentrate on the only problem where they have the technology to monitor it cheaply - speeding .
This means there 's a complete disconnect between money spent vs the real causes of road deaths and injuries .
Graeme , Bristol Interesting article that highlights the fact that decisions that truly affect our lives are more and more often decided with an economic aspect to the equation .
It is an illusion that our government actually ' care ' about our lives as individuals - as the u-uturn in policy about the volcanic ash has demonstrated .
Ben Skinner , Leeds Very insightful article .
Thanks for pointing out the very uncomfortable truth about our irrational priorities - and the very considerable shortfalls of democracy , even if it 's the best system we 've got so far .

You know who burns popcorn a lot ?
Arsonists .
Out of all the houses they set afire , I bet at least 35 % of them have popcorn in the cabinets .
Then the arsonist goes to work the next day and says , “ Man , I ’m always burning popcorn ! ” to his coworker and the coworker says , “ Me too ! haha , ” and the arsonist says , “ So do you want to burn down a warehouse with me tonight ? ” as the coworker says , “ I think it ’s the microwa- what ? ” and then conversations are awkward after that , because the coworker finds out that the arsonist is dating his ex .
( CNN ) --
If you believe the ads , Ajay Bhatt is tech 's version of an arrogant rock star .
The co-inventor of USB -- the near - ubiquitous technology that connects computers to cameras and other gadgets -- strolls into an office looking nerd - confident in a sweater vest , tie and a puffed - up , game - show - host haircut in a TV commercial for Intel .
Women fawn .
Metal music blares .
A crazed fan rips his shirt open .
Bhatt acknowledges his fans only with passing glances .
" Our rock stars are n't like your rock stars , " the commercial says .
The ad was such a success that Conan O'Brien had Bhatt on the " Tonight Show " in October 2009 .
But there 's just one problem :
That 's not Bhatt .
Not the hair .
Not the attitude .
And , most strikingly , not even the person .
In the Intel ad , Bhatt is played by actor Sunil Narkar .
To meet the real Ajay Bhatt -- an unassuming and introverted man who 's much more Rick Moranis than Roger Daltrey -- is to realize just how outlandish Intel 's marketing team was when it decided to pitch Bhatt as a go - it - alone rock star .
That 's not because of the image , although the real Bhatt does n't look like he 's used many blow dryers lately .
It 's because , in reality , Bhatt has built a career and a successful technology line on the idea that the individual is far less important than the group .
In his world , a person does n't need to stick out and should n't stick out .
As the new , 10 - times - faster line of USB 3.0 products hits the market this year , Bhatt continues to believe in that group - over - self philosophy , even if he has become a rock star by proxy .
Complicated plugs
The Universal Serial Bus is one of those inventions that everyone uses but no one notices .
Even if you know that the rectangle - shaped hole in the side of your computer -- the one with a little icon next to it that looks like a pitchfork -- is a USB port , it may be difficult to understand why that small plug - in is so important until you think back a decade or two .
In the early 1990s , Bhatt , like many people , was trying to hook up a printer to his computer .
To do so , he first had to fiddle with a plug that had a dozen or more tongs on it .
The plugs of the '90s looked somewhat like acupuncture devices .
They were difficult to use .
Tiny screws held them in place .
To make matters worse , Bhatt thought , once a connection was made , there was no guarantee a computer would recognize a printer or gadget .
Consumers had to install special software for that .
" There 's got to be a better way to do this , " he recalled in a recent interview .
He looked to the wall sockets for inspiration , seeking to imitate their simplicity .
Cooperative wisdom
There is a quiet revolution in the idea that all computers and gadgets should cooperate and talk to each other in the same language , with the same cables and with the same ports .
That 's been the beauty of USB .
When you plug a camera into a USB port , the computer , in theory , recognizes that the device is there and helps you download photo files .
All USB plugs are compatible .
So if you buy a new computer , you do n't have to upgrade all the rest of your equipment -- the video cameras , mobile phones and the like .
That remains true as USB 3.0 products start hitting the market this year .
The new plugs look slightly different -- the connectors have an extra sliver of metal tacked on to the side , like a new thumb -- but older USB plugs still work with the newer plug-ins .
USB 's main competitor is a connection called Firewire , which is used primarily in higher - end gadgets .
USB 's strength is that it connects almost anything to a PC , even computer mice , said Steve Whalley , who worked with Bhatt on USB in the early days .
Getting there was anything but easy , Bhatt said .
Simplifying the digital Babylon that preceded USB involved convincing nearly every computer and gadget maker in the world to get on board with a single type of cable , creating a sort of universal language that lets all computer hardware connect .
A boss at Intel once told Bhatt to stop working on the USB project because it would never take off , he said .
He recalls one large presentation where executives stared at him like he was crazy when he suggested they all switch to this new hook - up .
Still , Bhatt said he never doubted his vision .
" To some extent , we were naïve and full of energy , " he said .
" We did n't know what a big task we were taking on . "
Today , more than 6 billion devices use the USB system , according to the USB Implementers Forum .
Humble origins
That kind of against - all - odds tenacity has been a part of Bhatt 's life since childhood .
He grew up in India , raised by a father who was an art history professor and an encouraging mother .
They told Bhatt he could do anything if he put his mind to it .
Often , he put his mind to breaking things and putting them back together -- just for the fun of it .
" I'm the kind of guy who buys stuff from IKEA " simply because it 's fun to build things , he said .
" I used to build a computer every year just to get a feel for it . "
In 1981 , after earning a bachelor 's degree in India , Bhatt left his home country for the first time to attend graduate school at the City University of New York .
His only reason for choosing the school was that , as an undergraduate , he 'd studied and liked an engineering textbook written by a CUNY employee .
On his second day in the country , Bhatt said , he bumped into the professor on an escalator .
" I came here , I talked to the professor and I said , ' I want to be your assistant . ' "
He went to work for him the next day , he said .
Co-creator
At first , Bhatt squirmed at the thought of himself as a tech rock star .
He wished the commercial had spotlighted the band of people who worked on USB .
Bhatt is careful to describe himself as the " co-creator " of USB , giving a nod to other Intel workers , particularly Bala Cadambi , who had a hand in its creation .
The goal of the Intel ad was to highlight that group 's efforts , even if it singled out Bhatt , said company spokesman David Dickstein .
Bhatt also emphasizes that the entire tech community had to come together to make his idea of universal hardware connections possible .
He sees several positives in his cult fame .
One is that he gets to talk to groups of students frequently .
He tells them it 's cool to be smart .
" If I can make a difference in just one kid 's life , it 's worth it , " he said .
Another is that his daughter , who did n't know he had created USB until her later years in high school , around 2005 , now thinks he 's cool .
" When I first found out my dad was going to get a commercial ... I screamed , actually , " said Priya Bhatt , a bubbly 22 - year - old .
" I was so excited .
I just thought it was so great that he finally was getting the recognition that I felt was very deserved . "
Today India celebrates six decades of independence from British rule .
For a long time it was viewed by many as a backward country , known mostly for its poverty and spiritualism .
Times have changed , the economy is booming , and the country has been reborn .
We look back over some of the key events of the last 60 years .
The US and Russia have drafted an initiative to ban nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East , the Guardian has learned .
The proposal – involving the appointment of a special coordinator to conduct exploratory talks with Israel , Iran and the Arab states , followed by a regional conference – will be a central issue at a conference beginning tomorrow in New York aimed at preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons around the world .
Washington and Moscow have circulated the proposal among the three other permanent members of the UN security council , seeking their endorsement .
But it is unclear whether the initiative , aimed at reviving a largely - forgotten 15 - year - old agreement with some tentative practical steps , will go far enough for Egypt , a key player at this month 's talks .
Cairo has long championed the idea of a WMD - free Middle East as a means of exerting pressure on Israel , the only country with nuclear weapons in the region .
The New York conference brings more than 150 countries together in a month - long effort to repair and update the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , at a time when it is threatening to unravel .
" This will be the most important conference in our lifetime on disarmament and non-proliferation , " said Des Browne , the British former defence minister who now leads a multi-party group of veteran politicians and generals pushing for the elimination of nuclear weapons .
Some officials are calling the NPT review conference a " nuclear Copenhagen " .
Like the climate summit last December , it demands complex trade - offs between powerful nations , emerging powers and weaker states .
The eventual outcome may be unclear , with degrees of success measured in shades of grey .
And , like Copenhagen , the consequences of failure may not be felt for years , but could prove catastrophic .
" We 're not at a nuclear tipping point , but we are approaching a nuclear tipping point , " said Daryl Kimball , the head of the Washington - based Arms Control Association in Washington .
The pact itself is not in imminent danger of implosion .
Its 189 national signatories extended its life indefinitely in 1995 .
But its underlying bargain – that the nuclear powers would disarm and share their technology for peaceful purposes and , in return , the rest of the world would not try to acquire nuclear weapons – is fraying .
Israel , India and Pakistan , which all have nuclear arsenals , remain outside the treaty .
North Korea withdrew seven years ago and has since been building its own bombs .
Iran is widely suspected of cheating , and the five nuclear powers recognised under the pact – the US , Russia , UK , France and China – are under fire for what non-weapons states see as hypocrisy and the slow pace of disarmament .
Western officials fear that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , who is expected to attend tomorrow , will use the occasion to put the nuclear powers on trial and distract attention from his country 's controversial programme .
The last NPT conference , in 2005 , broke up in acrimony when Iran clashed head - on with the Bush administration .
Many countries in the non-aligned movement ( NAM ) , a cold war grouping which still carries clout in these negotiations , sided with Iran in lambasting the US and other established nuclear powers .
Barack Obama 's administration believes it has done enough to avert another fiasco .
Last year the US president pledged to pursue the eventual abolition of weapons .
In its nuclear posture review last month , the US narrowed the circumstances in which it would use nuclear weapons , and in the new Start treaty , both the US and Russia have lowered the number of strategic warheads they will deploy .
" The setting is very different from 2005 , in terms of disarmament , " said a senior diplomat from the non-aligned movement .
" In 2005 , there was no disarmament going on .
Bush did n't even believe in multilateral treaties . "
According to the Washington Post , the US will reveal the exact size of the American arsenal for the first time , in a show of transparency and to underline the cuts it has made .
But to ensure vital support from Egypt , which is chairing the non-aligned movement nations , the US and Russia have also drafted the proposal for a nuclear - free Middle East zone .
The nuclear powers first agreed to help set up a Middle East zone free from weapons of mass destruction in 1995 .
It was part of the price of persuading Egypt and the Islamic world to accept the indefinite extension of the NPT .
The US , Britain and Russia were supposed to manage the process , but have done little , to Egypt 's fury .
This year , Egypt has made it clear it will demand small , but concrete , steps in return for its co-operation .
The size of those steps will be the focus of the bargaining in New York .
Egypt and the NAM states want a full negotiating conference to take place next year , to be organised by a standing committee of the NPT .
That is not seen as feasible in Washington , which is arguing for a more open - ended exploratory conference at some future , undefined date .
Ellen Tauscher , the US undersecretary of state for arms control , said last week : " The best chance we have to achieve a WMD - free zone in the Middle East is to reach an agreement on a lasting and just peace in the Middle East . "
Negotiations on such a zone would require Israel to confirm the existence of its nuclear arsenal – something it has so far refused to do – and ultimately bargain it away .
Few expect it to do so in the foreseeable future , but Israel has said it is ready to enter into regional arms control talks if its security concerns are addressed .
Israel , which is not an NPT signatory , will not take part in the New York conference , butis watching warily from the sidelines .
In return for backing a Middle East nuclear weapons - free zone , Washington will want support from Egypt and other non-weapons states to isolate Iran , impose greater penalties for leaving the NPT , and give the UN nuclear watchdog more teeth to curb proliferation .
Weeks of tough negotiation lie ahead , and success is far from preordained .
" There is a range of outcomes , " said Deepti Choubey , an NPT expert at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace .
" The best and most unlikely would be a final declaration that all states agree to and is meaningful .
If you could get a summary from the chair that broadly captures a consensus , apart from a few spoilers , that is not a disaster . "
10.45 am : Xan will be here from around 11 am .
In the meantime , read a report on Andy Murray 's straight sets victory over Jan Hajek yesterday and why , apart from Murray , have British tennis players done so badly ?
For the latest live scores and results follow this link .
And for comprehensive coverage of Wimbledon visit our microsite .
11.15 am : Welcome to a sun-bathed All England Club , nestled in the heart of SW19 - a good mile from the tube and a good few thousand miles from Port Elizabeth , South Africa .
It 's day three at Wimbledon and , almost imperceptibly , we 're into round two .
The chaff has been sorted and the wheat has gone through .
And with a sad inevitability , some of that chaff turned out to be home - grown .
Yesterday saw the shuffling departure of Anne Keothavong , Jamie Baker and Heather Watson , all of which leaves Andy Murray as the lone British hope in the singles ' draw .
It 's the first time this has happened in the tournament 's 124 - year history .
Never before has the All England Club looked so ironically named .
At 10.30 each morning the Voice of God comes on the PA , ordering the stewards to throw open the gates and let the 40,000 come in .
Until then , the employees and reporters have the run of the place and the club feels more about the past than the present .
On Monday I saw an aged Nick Bollettieri sunning himself outside Centre Court .
Today , in exactly the same place , I see Gerald Williams , who used to host Today at Wimbledon alongside Des Lynam back in the 1980s .
Williams was ( and presumably still is ) a wonderfully erudite tennis commentator and it's good to see him here , perusing the day 's schedule on his bus - man 's holiday .
Try as it might , the BBC has never quite matched the Des 'n ' Gerry shows of old .
11.30 am : Right , enough with the nostalgia ; let 's look to the future .
On the Centre Court menu today we have a red - meat serving masterclass from fifth seed Andy Roddick , who 's up against Michael Llodra , a wily French left - hander .
Following that , Venus Williams is preparing to slice and dice the Russian Ekaterina Makarova and then serve her up as sushi .
And then , for dessert , we have a firework display from the big- hitting Taylor Dent , out to upset Novak Djokovic .
The Serbian third seed barely survived his first round match and lost his only previous battle with Dent .
This draw is doing him no favours at all .
Over on Court One , Kim Clijsters takes on Karolina Sprem , while 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt is pitted against Evgeny Korolev .
Then , last but not least , it 's Roger Federer against qualifier Ilija Bozoljac .
On paper , this should pose no problem for the reigning champion .
But then we thought the same thing on Monday and look how that one turned out .
Play on these two show - courts begins at 1 pm , but we have a noon start on the other arenas , where Justine Henin makes her first trip to SW19 since 2006 .
I 'll be covering the action until this evening and hope you 'll stick with me all the way .
And by that I mean All the Way !
Through 3 pm and Beyond !
Because , after all , there 's nothing else going on today .
Is there ?
12.10 pm : Out on Court Two , the players are knocking up , with Justine Henin all but dwarfed by Kristina Barrois of Germany .
But then Henin never did rely on power and physique to dominate her opponents .
Instead , she uses foot - speed , anticipation and the sugar - sweet timing of her groundstrokes ( in particular , that poetic one - handed backhand ) .
The Belgian stepped out of the game in 2007 and her subsequent comeback has played out in fits and starts .
Yes , she ran to the final of the Australian Open back in February and picked up a title on the clay court circuit .
But she went down to Sam Stosur at Roland Garros ( previously her best tournament ) and arrives at Wimbledon as something of an unknown quantity .
Henin has traditionally toiled on the grass and has never won the title here .
It would be great to see her do so this year , but I wonder if she quite has the steel and firepower to get past the Williams sisters .
Having promised to keep tabs on all today 's tennis , I appear to have already dropped the ball .
Jonathan Ross tweets to report that he has just lost on a tiebreak to the comedian Jimmy Carr .
I do n't know what court that was on but I 'm mortified to have missed it , because it sounds like a classic .
So Ross is out and Carr goes through .
I 'm guessing he faces Nadal or someone in the following round .
12.25 pm : Justine Henin canters to an early 2 - 0 lead on Court Two , courtesy of a ripped forehand passing shot on break point .
She then claws her way to 3 - 0 , although Barrois is no push - over and is making her work for every point .
Still no word from comedian Jimmy Carr , fresh from his titanic tussle with Jonathan Ross .
I 'm guessing he 's hooked up to an IV drip somewhere , his legs contorted with cramps , his head cradled by a concerned fitness trainer .
You do n't come through a match like that without feeling some pain and leaving a bit of your soul out there on the court .
We 'll let you know when he shows up at the press conference .
12.42 pm : Early drama on Court Two as Battling Barrois breaks back and Henin sits in her chair with her head in her towel .
But the German is unable to maintain this mini revival , pounding a backhand into the tramlines as Henin again edges ahead .
The Belgian promptly serves out to love , taking the first set 6 - 3 .
1 pm : I mosey over to Court 14 , where Jurgen Melzer ( a recent semi- finalist at Roland Garros ) is locked in a first set breaker with Serbia 's Viktor Troicki .
The first half of the tiebreak plays out as a comedy of errors .
Both players are solid on serve , but each time a ball comes back they proceed to plant their feet , wind up angrily , and send the thing canon - ing into the net .
It happens time and time again .
Are these two in Jimmy Carr 's section of the draw ?
If so , he stands a chance .
Eventually Troicki pulls himself together .
He connects with a return and then rifles a forehand and is rewarded with the first set .
Melzer is obviously a demon to play on the red clay of Paris .
But here , he is struggling .
It could be that another seed is planning to exit this year 's Wimbledon .
Over on Court One , Henin is up 6 - 3 , 4 - 1 and seems set fair for a routine win .
For all that , she looks pensive and nettled and keeps muscling the ball when she used to glide it .
Whenever she wins a point , the Belgian clenches her fist and looks up at her supporters as though seeking reassurance .
It 's safe to say that she has yet to relax into this year 's championship .
1.15 pm : We now flit like a gadfly to the hallowed turf of Centre Court for the second - round stand - off between Andy Roddick and France 's mercurial Michael Llodra .
Roddick was in fearsome form on Monday and starts out in the same mood today , holding to 15 .
He serves with a frowning , almost comical concentration , as though he 's hammering in fence - posts or bashing gophers at a fairground stall .
How many of these gophers does he have to hit before they will give him the prize he really wants ?
The fifth seed is tilting at his fourth Wimbledon final .
He came within a whisker of victory last year , before being edged out 235 - 233 in a marathon fifth set with Federer .
I exaggerate , but only slightly .
1.25 pm : More , in the meantime , on the current ( constant ? ) parlous state of British tennis .
Allthings comments :
" I just do n't think we are a particularly sporting nation .
We spend most of the year hiding from the cold , we are not that comfortable in our bodies , we 're reserved , polite , easily embarrassed and we just lack a kind of hungriness and fundamental drive that you need to do consistently well in sport , especially at today 's level ....
Brits are more mentally ambitious ; we 're intellectual warriors , not physical or artistic ones .
But we have got the nouse and wherewithal to put on a prestigious , well run and stylish sporting ( like Wimbledon ) ; we 're great at tradition , pomp . "
I think I need to mull that over for a bit , like the weedy Intellectual Titan that I am .
In the meantime , if you please , the real men are rustling up an intriguing battle on Centre Court .
Llodra makes a brilliant reactive save off a Roddick smash to scramble to love - 40 .
The Frenchman has suddenly caught fire and the gophers are evading Roddick .
Llodra takes the game with a swooping cross -court backhand volley and now leads 3 - 2 in the first set .
1.40 pm : Having purloined one Andy Roddick service game , Michael Llodra almost manages to sneak another , creeping to 0 - 30 before the American hauls him back .
Llodra , it seems , is one of those talented , maddening French players in the tradition of Henri Leconte , Guy Forget and Fabrice Santoro ; at once supremely gifted and curiously brittle .
He is now 30 and has never really broken through at the highest level of the game .
Well , here 's another chance for him .
He leads 5 - 4 and will serve for the set .
Elsewhere , Kim Clijsters is up 5 - 2 on Karolina Sprem .
Viktor Troicki is now two sets up on 16th seed Jurgen Melzer , while Mardy Fish and Florian Mayer are currently locked at one set apiece .
Oh , and Justine Henin has now beaten Kristina Barrois 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 , having weathered the storm of a late comeback by the German .
1.45 pm : First set to Michael Llodra on Centre Court .
The Frenchman sails to 30 - 0 but is then rocked by a lancing backhand passing shot from the American .
Llodra then double faults for 30 - 30 and Roddick has a chance .
But then it 's over , as soon as it arrives .
The Frenchman steps up to the baseline and delivers a pair of left - handed aces that swing off into the stands ; one to the right , the other to the left .
Both shots are miniature masterpieces of timing , placement and spin .
Andy Roddick looks momentarily shell - shocked out there .
2 pm : So far today , these Wimbledon championships seem pointed towards a bygone era .
It began with the sight of Gerald Williams , who co-hosted Today at Wimbledon back in the 80s .
It continued through the graceful , old - school elegance of Justine Henin on Court Two .
And now here comes Michael Llodra , who plays like he 's just flown in from the 20th - century .
His game is all dinks and slices and sly changes of pace .
Sometimes he even serves and volleys , loping to the net to deftly cut off Roddick 's passing shots .
Eventually , I suspect , that the American will stop being flummoxed by the novelty of his opponent and begin to take this match by the throat .
But for the time being , Llodra is enjoying himself out there .
He darts to 15 - 40 on Roddick 's serve and it is all the fifth seed can do to batter his way out of trouble .
The pair are now tied at 2 - 2 in the second set .
2.15 pm : Let 's pause for some updates from around the ground .
Florian Mayer has now scooped the third set from Queens runner - up Mardy Fish and now leads 6 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 . Kim Clijsters leads Karolina Sprem 6 - 3 , 4 - 1 on Court One , while Nicolas Mahut and big- serving John Isner are locked at two sets all on Court 18 .
Meanwhile , back on Centre , the second set is building nicely to a conclusion .
The players stand at four games all and Roddick has yet to find the key to unlock the fiendish enigma of the Llodra serve .
2.25 pm : Good news for Roddick fans .
The American has found the key .
Serving at 4 - 5 , Llodra dances to the net , the same as he 's been doing all afternoon .
He is anticipating some nice high returns , some easy put - aways .
Instead , the ball comes back at him down the centre of the court .
It comes like a bullet , low and hard .
At 0 - 30 , the Frenchman 's wrist buckles and he scrapes his volley into the net .
At 0 - 40 the bullet zips through even lower and he pushes a half - volley into the tramlines .
Roddick takes the second set 6 - 4 and heaves a huge sigh of relief .
2.45 pm : The metaphorical storm - clouds have lifted from around Andy Roddick 's head , although Michael Llodra is not quite done yet .
The Frenchman conjures up a break point at one game all after winning a rat - tat - tat exchange at the net .
Roddick serves his way out of danger and then it's his turn to go after Llodra 's serve .
He is moving better , getting hold of the ball .
He hits a backhand pass , a forehand pass .
And then , at 15 - 40 , Llodra opts to volley back to the forehand and the American lets rip , hitting hard and high , with a great whip of topspin .
It 's a clean pass and Llodra is nowhere near it .
Roddick gets the break and Llodra is rattled .
And so the American noses ahead and now leads 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 4 - 1 .
What else from the day ?
Well , Kim Clijsters has now emerged victorious from her Court One tussle with Karolina Sprem , winning 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 . Gael Monfils is a set up on Karol Beck and Nicolas Mahut and John Isner are locked in a marathon at 5 - 5 in the final set .
I 'm off out for a spell to grab a sandwich and see the sights , though rest assured the kind folk at Guardian Towers will keep this blog ticking over in my absence in case anything momentous occurs .
Back shortly ...
3.30 pm : OK , am now back from my lunch - break tour of the grounds , where I walked the walkways and cafes , peered into outside courts and shamelessly eavesdropped on snatches of passing conversations .
These seemed to run as follows ...
" Are they showing the football anywhere ? "
" When he came out , we shouted ' We love you , Roger ! '
He did n't say anything . "
" Where can we watch the England game ? "
" Two salads ?
That 's £ 34 ! " ( this delivered with the bright , happy air of someone breaking extremely good news )
" Who 's the one with the funny serve ?
You know - the REALLY funny serve . "
" Is there nowhere that we can watch the football ? "
So far as I can work out , there is nowhere they can watch the football .
I assumed they might show it on the big screen by Henman Hill , but it was n't playing when I walked by 15 - minutes ago ( perhaps it 's on now ) .
However , it does play on the screens in the press area , where most of the journalists seem to have briefly forgotten the tennis .
England , in case you did n't know , are currently 1 - 0 up .
3.45 pm : Shall we catch up on some tennis results ( I 'm guessing the football is being tackled elsewhere ) ?
I stood out by Court 14 and caught the closing stages of Jurgen Melzer 's impressive fightback against Viktor Troicki , the 16th seed winning through 6 - 7 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 .
Gael Monfils is two sets to the good against Karol Beck , while Lleyton Hewitt is a set up on Evgeny Korolev .
Over on Centre , order has prevailed and the struggle is over .
Andy Roddick wins through 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 to send gifted , febrile Michael Llodra out of the tournament .
This was a tough , tricky test for the fifth seed , but ultimately the Frenchman could not quite sustain the darting , will - o- the - wisp brilliance of the opening set and a half .
So Roddick goes through to round three , where he will meet either Philipp Kolschreiber or Teimuraz Gabashvilli .
I seem to recall him losing a Grand Slam match to Kolschreiber a few years back .
Even so , he will surely fancy his chances against either man .
The drama has now moved , lock , stock and barrel , to Court 18 .
There John Isner and Nicolas Mahut are locked in a deadlock that shows no sign of ending .
The pair are tied at 15 games all in the final set of a mountainous struggle .
4.05 pm : The Isner - Mahut battle is a bizarre mix of the gripping and the deadly dull .
It 's tennis 's equivalent of Waiting For Godot , in which two lowly journeymen comedians are forced to remain on an outside court until hell freezes over and the sun falls from the sky .
Isner and Mahut are dying a thousand deaths out there on Court 18 and yet nobody cares , because they 're watching the football .
So the players stand out on their baseline and belt aces past each - other in a fifth set that has already crawled past two hours .
They are now tied at 18 - games apiece .
On and on they go .
Soon they will sprout beards and their hair will grow down their backs , and their tennis whites will yellow and then rot off their bodies .
And still they will stand out there on Court 18 , belting aces and listening as the umpire calls the score .
Finally , I suppose , one of them will die .
Ooh , I can see the football out of the corner of my eye .
England still 1 - 0 up !
4.25 pm : News from all - around .
Venus Williams is galloping towards the first set against Ekaterina Makarova on Centre Court .
Monfils and Beck are into a fourth set .
Feliciano Lopez seems to be easing ahead of Ricardas Berankis .
Florian Mayer has fried Mardy Fish , and Lleyton Hewitt has advanced after Evgeny Korolev retired with a shoulder injury .
Roger Federer is due any second on Court One .
But none of this means a thing to the Everlasting Zombie Tennis Players on Court 18 .
They hear nothing but the thud of the ball off their racket and the sonorous tones of their Zombie Umpire .
They can think of nothing beyond their next trudge to the chair for a short sit down before the ordeal begins again anew .
They have forgotten all about Wimbledon and the world beyond the backstop .
John Isner 's serving arm has fallen off .
Nicolas Mahut 's head is loose and rolling bonelessly on his neck .
And yet still they play on .
The score is now 21 - 21 in the fifth and final set .
This is now , officially , the longest final set in Wimbledon history .
4.45 pm : It 's ace number 62 for John Isner in the Never - Ending Story of Court 18 , a tournament record .
But , incredibly , Mahut seems to be coming back at him .
He forges his way to the first deuce of the set thanks to a backhand lob that somehow gets over the head of the American , who stands six - foot - nine in his stockinged feet .
Both men , as has been established , are now dead on their feet , although the Frenchman looks the marginally less rotten ( a few less worms wriggling from his eye sockets ) .
Naturally Isner holds on , He staggers , sightless , to the net and scrapes off a desperate drop volley for a winner .
The American now leads 24 - 23 .
But inevitably we are still on serve .
" No ! " screams a gang of reporters .
" Nooo ! "
I think that they are lamenting the match , but of course they are lamenting the football .
On the other side of the world , Slovenia just came close to scoring .
4.50 pm : It 's over .
It 's finally over .
It was a long , hard match and it took its toll on the players .
But finally , at long last , we have a result .
I 'm actually talking about the football here .
England win 1 - 0 against Slovenia to go through to the knock - out stage .
The Isner - Mahut match is still ongoing : 24 - 24 in the final set .
Isner 's leg has just dropped off .
5.05 pm : In the world beyond Court 18 , the Wimbledon matches are won and lost .
There are victories for Feliciano Lopez and Nadia Petrova , Venus Williams and Gael Monfils .
Federer is 2 - 2 against his qualifier on Court One , while Novak Djokovic and Taylor Dent are limbering up on Centre .
On Court 18 it is very different .
On Court 18 a match is not won and lost ; it is just played out infinitely , deeper and deeper into a fifth and final set as the numbers rack up and the terrain turns uncharted .
Under the feet of John Isner and Nicolas Mahut , the grass is growing .
Before long they will be playing in a jungle and when they sit down at the change of ends , a crocodile will come to menace them .
They are poised at 25 games apiece in a deciding set that is now nudging three hours .
I do n't know who 's going to win this one .
Mahut looks slightly more alert and industrious , but Isner ( flat - footed , grey about the gills ) has a thunderous serve to fall back on .
Time and again he falls back on it .
Time and again it gets him out of trouble .
It keeps thumping against the turf and splatting against the backstop .
Mahut is now serving to stay in the match at 25 - 26 .
5.25 pm : Isner and Mahut are currently level at 28 games apiece in what people are now telling me is the longest match in Wimbledon history .
Over on Court 14 , Thiemo De Bakker and Santiago Giraldo are locked at 14 - 14 .
This suggests that the curse of Court 18 has started to infect the other courts too .
What happens if they just keep going ?
What happens if , from here on in , every single match at Wimbledon heads into a decider and then decides to stay there , with neither player ever reaching an advantage ; with the scoreline simply sailing off the map and into the wide blue yonder ?
Do the stewards lock the gates and make us stay ?
I 've been chuckling over the nightmarish experience of Isner and Mahut , little realising that it has implications for the rest of us as well .
We are all involved - going round and round , round and round .
Wake me up when the scoreline goes into triple figures .
5.30 pm : Phew , the Wimbledon Zombie Pandemic has been contained .
Thiemo
De Bakker comes through 16 - 14 in the final set of his match against Santiago Giraldo .
He will now play ( hysterical laughter ) the winner of the match between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut .
Needless to say , it 's still going on : 30 - 30 in the final set
In other news , Roger Federer has taken the first set 6 - 3 from qualifier Ilija Bozoljac .
I pine for the days when a set came that easy .
5.45 pm : False dawns and shimmering mirages out on the jungle Congo of Court 18 .
For a moment there , I thought Isner was cracking .
The man can barely move his feet any more and Mahut still has some bounce , lashing a backhand return for a clean winner .
But what John Isner still has is his serve .
It is a brutal serve , heavy and reliable .
He totters to the baseline , fires some aces and goes ahead 32 - 31 , leaving Mahut to serve to stay in the match for what I am reliably informed is the 2,362nd time .
This he duly does and so we go merrily on through the jungle .
The score stands at 32 - games apiece ; the clock at six hours and thirty - odd minutes .
It is now the longest match in Grand Slam history .
5.50 pm : Bizarrely there is also tennis taking place on the other courts .
Roger Federer is being detained at 5 - 5 in the second set on Court One. Djokovic and Taylor Dent are on serve on Centre , and Thomas Berdych has just won the first set of his match against Benjamin Becker .
I 'm sure John Isner and Nicolas Mahut wll be delighted to hear the news .
5.55 pm : Is it a dream , a lie , or is John Isner really about to triumph in the longest match in tennis history ?
The American flicks a backhand return up the line to reach 15 - 40 , with two match points .
But then Mahut finds the line with a forehand and hastens in to tap away a terrified volley .
Incredibly , he saves the second match point too and then pulls level once more : 33 -33 in the final set .
So yes , it was a dream , it was a lie .
The Amazing Zombie Tennis Pros are not through with us yet .
Ha ha ha ha !
Ha ha ha !
6 pm : The score stands at 34 - 34 .
In order to stay upright and keep their strength , John Isner and Nicolas Mahut have now started eating members of the audience .
They trudge back to the baseline , gnawing on thigh - bones and sucking intestines .
They have decided that they will stay on Court 18 until every spectator is eaten .
Only then , they say , will they consider ending their contest .
6.10 pm : Let us pause for a brief detour to the land of the living .
Roger Federer 's travails continue : the reigning champion has just dropped the second set on a tiebreak to the qualifier Ilija Bozoljac .
Over on Centre , third seed Novak Djokovic has bagged the first set ( again on a tie - break ) from Taylor Dent .
All of these four players are alive .
Their blood runs warm and their eyes are bright .
They have nothing - nothing !
- in common with the two shuffling , shambling ruins that are currently hitting aces and eating spectators in an ongoing horror show on Court 18 .
Latest update from the abattoir : 35 games each .
6.25 pm : The scoreboard is barely visible through the grass and weeds and trails of Spanish moss .
It shows that John Isner and Nicolas Mahut are locked at 37 games each in the final set .
I 'm wondering if maybe an angel will come and set them free .
Is this too much to ask ?
Just one slender angel , with white wings and a wise smile , to tell them that 's it 's all right , they have suffered enough and that they are now being recalled .
The angel could hug them and kiss their brows and invite them to lay their rackets gently on the grass .
And then they could all ascend to heaven together .
John Isner , Nicolas Mahut and the kind angel that saved them .
6.35 pm : More news from the real world : Roger Federer is two sets to one up on Ilija Bozoljac .
Thomas Berdych is two sets to the good against Benjamin Becker , and Novak Djokovic is heading in the same direction in his contest with the big- hitting Taylor Dent .
News from Nightmare Country : the Zombie Umpire has lost his voice and now calls the score in the croak of a crone .
Zombie Mahut double faults to allow Zombie Isner a glimmer of hope at deuce .
It is merely a glimmer .
Mahut comes through and we stand at 39 - all .
6.48 pm : The sun is sinking and the court is a blur .
It is at this stage that Zombie Isner starts to look like Zombie Mahut and the Zombie Umpire stops croaking and starts to chirrup like a grasshopper .
In other words , we 're here but we 're gone .
Is anyone still alive up in the stands or have they now all been eaten ?
It 's 40 - 40 .
And that 's games , not points
Still no sign of that angel either , the one that swore blind that she would come down and spirit the players off to Disneyland Paris where they could ride the Thunder Mountain rollercoaster forever and ever amen .
I 'm now starting to wonder if she really exists .
7 pm : The umpire climbs down from his chair and starts mildly slapping the net cord with his right hand .
No one knows why .
John Isner winds up for a backhand and misses the ball entirely .
No one knows why .
What 's going on here ?
Once , long ago , I think that this was a tennis match .
I believe it was part of a wider tennis tournament , somewhere in south - west London , and the winner of this match would then go on to face the winner of another match and , if he won that , the winner of another match .
And so on until he reached the final and , fingers crossed , he won the title .
That , at least , is what this spectacle on Court 18 used to be ; what it started out as .
It 's not that anymore and has n't been for a few hours now .
I 'm not quite sure what it is , but it is long and it 's horrifying and it's very long to boot .
Is it death ?
I think it might be death .
42 games all .
7.10 pm : It 's 43 - 43 and John Isner is serving to make it 44 - 43 , after which Nicolas Mahut will serve to make it 44 - 44 .
I 'm indebted to the commenter who explained that Nicolas Mahut recently knocked the sensor of the net and that this is why the umpire climbed down off his chair and started slapping the cord with his hand , with his mouth hanging open and vomit all down the front of his shirt .
For a moment I had hoped the slapping might have been his way of summoning the angel we 've all been talking about , the one that will come down and usher the contestants up to their Eternal Rest .
But no .
Turns out it was just something to do with the net sensor .
Isner moves to 44 - 43 .
Mahut now serving to make it 44 - 44 .
Fingers crossed he makes it !
7.20 pm : And so this match goes on and on , on and on .
Somewhere along the way , the players have mislaid their names .
The man who was once Mahut is now a string - bag of offal .
The man who was Isner is a parched piece of cow - hide .
The surviving members of the audience do n't seem to care who wins .
They just cheer and applaud whoever looks likely to make a breakthrough and bring this nightmare to a close .
Invariably they are disappointed .
The offal looks fresher , possesses a piercing backhand and still throws itself about the court on occasion .
But the cow - hide can serve and has the advantage of going ahead by one game and forcing the offal to catch - up .
This the offal is only too happy to do .
It hits a backhand down the line and then follows that up with an ace , and the score now stands at 45 games apiece .
7.30 pm : Let it end , let it end , it 's 46 - all .
It was funny when it was 16 - all and it was creepy when it was 26 - all .
But this is pure purgatory and there is still no end in sight .
John Isner has just struck his 90th ace .
Nicolas Mahut , poor , enfeebled Nicolas Mahut , has only hit 72 .
Maybe we should just decide it on the number of aces struck ?
Give the game to Isner and then we can all crawl into our graves .
7.45 pm : What happens if we steal their rackets ?
If we steal their rackets , the zombies can no longer hit their aces and thump their backhands and keep us all prisoner on Court 18 .
I 'm shocked that this is only occurring to me now .
Will nobody run onto the court and steal their rackets ?
Are they all too scared of the zombies ' clutching claws and gore - stained teeth ?
Steal their rackets and we can all go home .
Who 's with me ?
Steal their rackets and then run for the tube .
It 's 48 - 48 .
What further incentive do you need ?
8 pm : Do n't look now but I think the cow - hide has officially expired .
John Isner stands at the baseline .
He is facing the right way but he is no longer moving and the string - bag of offal peppers him with aces left and right to bring the score to 50 - 50 .
But Cow Hide is still facing the right way and that says something .
And he is still vertical , and that says something too .
What it says , unfortunately , is that the match is not quite over yet .
8.05 pm : In the stands , a woman is laughing .
She laughs long and hard and her laugh is the sort of ghastly yodel you normally hear in antique horror movies about Victorian insane asylums .
" Wa - la - ha - la - wah , " she goes .
" Wa - la - ha - la - ha - la ! " Will nobody drag her out ?
Call in the goons in white coats .
Get this woman to a lobotomy !
Mahut is serving to make it 51 - 51 .
Would n't you know it , he does .
He makes it to 51 - 51 , finishing up with an ace .
8.20 pm : Wow , is that really the time ?
I must go home ; can't think what 's kept me .
Wa - ha - la - ha - la - ha-la !
Oh yes , just remembered .
The tennis .
The tennis .
Out there on Court 18 , our two white - clad derelicts dig deep into the reserve tanks and remember to run again .
They move along the baseline , coaxing the ball back and forth , back and forth until Mahut falls over .
Is he ever going to get up ?
Astonishingly , he does .
At game point , he pushes Isner into his backhand corner , staggers in to the net and dinks a drop volley .
It 's 53 - 53 .
8.30 pm : " John ! " chants the crowd .
" John ! John !
John ! "
They 're either calling for Isner or calling for a bathroom break , or possibly both .
I 'm still not convinced they want Isner to win any more than they want Mahut to win .
They just want someone to win ; anyone to win .
They just long to be released and to go back home .
Possibly via the bathroom .
They are chanting " John ! " because Isner gets to 0 - 30 on Mahut 's serve and is therefore just two points from victory .
Chant all you like , it wo n't change a thing .
Mahut fights back and the score is tied again , at 54 games apiece .
8.40 pm : It 's 56 games all and darkness is falling .
This , needless to say , is not a good development , because everybody knows that zombies like the dark .
So far in this match they 've been comparatively puny and manageable , only eating a few of the spectators in between bashing their serves .
But come night - fall the world is their oyster .
They will play on , play on , right through until dawn .
Perhaps they will even leave the court during the change - overs to munch on other people .
Has Roger Federer left the grounds ?
Perhaps they will munch on him , hounding him down as he runs for his car , disembowelling him in the parking lot and leaving Wimbledon without its reigning champion .
Maybe they will even eat the trophy too .
Growing darker , darker all the while .
8.45 pm : A tweet , a tweet from Mr Andy Murray .
" This , " he says , " is why tennis is one of the toughest sports in the world . "
Thanks for that Andy : wise words indeed .
Actually we were hoping you were tweeting to say when the angel was coming to rescue us all .
Instead we get that .
You sit comfortably , and eat your nice dinner , and spare us the tweets .
Unless they 're about the angel , that is .
We still have hopes for the angel .
And ooh look , it 's 57 - games all .
8.55 pm : Yet again , Mahut wobbles on the brink of defeat .
Yet again he steadies himself .
One minute Isner has him at 30 - 30 .
The next he 's through again and we 're tied at 58 games apiece .
But wait !
An official has stepped out on the court .
Is it an official , or is it the angel ?
Is this endless , epic Battle of the Zombies finally going to be brought to a close ?
8.59 pm : No .
It 's not .
At least not just yet .
An exhausted Isner is serving to make it 59 - 58 .
An exhausted Mahut runs for a volley and falls flat on his face .
An exhausted umpire calls the score in a dreadful , reedy croak .
An exhausted Isner takes the game .
It 's 59 - 58 .
9.10 pm : Is it over ?
It is not over .
For a brief moment back then , I thought it was over .
Isner clambers to match point on Mahut 's serve .
Mahut steps forward and saves it with his 95th ace .
It 's 59 - 59 .
Mahut wants to come off now ; the light is almost gone .
But the official orders the pair to play two more games .
" We want more !
We want more ! " chant the survivors on Court 18 .
I 'm taking this as proof that they have gone insane .
9.12 pm : Mahut prevails !
Mahut wins !
This is not to say he wins the match , of course .
Nobody is winning this match ; not now and not ever .
But he prevails in his complaint and his wish is granted .
Play is suspended .
They will come back tomorrow and duke it out all over again .
The scoreboard will be re-set at 0 - 0 first set and Isner and Mahut will take it from there .
OK , so they wo n't do that , exactly .
Instead , they will pick it up where they left off , at 59 - 59 in the final set .
Apparently the last set of this match has now lasted longer than any match in tennis history .
Can this really be true ?
Nothing would surprise me anymore .
9.25 pm : Last thoughts before I ring me a hearse .
That was beyond tennis .
I think it was even beyond survival , because there is a strong suggestion ( soon to be confirmed by doctors ) that John Isner actually expired at about the 20 - 20 mark , and Mahut went soon afterwards , and the remainder of the match was contested by Undead Zombies who ate the spectators during the change of ends ( again , this is pending a police investigation ) .
Still , if you 're going to watch a pair of zombies go at each other for eleventy - billion hours , far into the night , it might as well be these zombies .
They were incredible , astonishing , indefatigable .
They fell over frequently but they never stayed down .
My hat goes off to these zombies .
Possibly my head goes off to them too .
It 's a crying shame that someone has to lose this match but hey - ho , that 's tennis .
The historic duel between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut will resume tomorrow and play out to its conclusion .
Possibly .
Maybe they 'll just keep going into Friday and Saturday , Sunday and Monday ; belting their aces and waiting for that angel to come and lead them home .

Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers recently released a concept aircraft design that could use 70 percent less fuel than current commercial airliners .
The simple secret , they say : Optimize the aircraft for modern , efficient jet engines .
Jet engines these days burn much less fuel at slightly slower speeds than the original designs that influenced the swept - wing designs of the '50s and '60s .
One of the main problems is that most airliners still use leftovers from those designs even though the older jet engines they were designed around have n't been used by most airlines for many years .
Today 's modern jet engines are much bigger in size , and much more efficient and quieter , says professor Mark Drela , the lead designer on the MIT team .
" From a purely design viewpoint , they 're really mismatched ; the big engines want to go slower , which means the airplanes really want to have less wing sweep , " Drela says .
" That 's one of the things we took advantage of . "
The new design from MIT was presented to NASA as part of a research contract to improve the efficiency of commercial aircraft .
NASA wants to see aircraft ideas that could dramatically reduce air and noise pollution and four teams from MIT , Boeing , GE Aviation and Northrop Grumman submitted designs .
Despite the slightly slower flying speeds , the MIT group says the overall travel time on shorter trips would actually be less than current airliners , thanks to the innovative fuselage design that means less time waiting at the gate .
Drela says the team developed two aircraft designs for NASA .
The first is aimed at the airliners the size of an Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 , and a bigger aircraft that would be closer to the A340 or 777 .
The larger design is a similar design to the Boeing blended wing - body scale model aircraft being tested at NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center .
The smaller aircraft , simply called the " D " series , is a slightly more traditional design , though it uses a unique approach to solving the efficiency problem .
Instead of having a single tube for a fuselage , the D Series uses a " double bubble " design that is essentially two partial cylinders side by side to create a wider , flatter fuselage .
The wider fuselage is how the airplane can make up for lost speed during flight by decreasing the load and unload times on the ground .
Of course , there would have to be a few changes made at the airports to accommodate the new design .
There are several other design aspects that add to the fuel efficiency , including mounting the engines at the rear of the fuselage to take advantage of slower - moving air .
But one of the key design features behind the increased efficiency is the wings .
The long , slender wings are much straighter than current airliners that still use the swept - wing design left over from those original jet airliners .
At the time , airplanes like the iconic Boeing 707 were designed to fly at speeds where the early jet engines were most efficient .
" They really favored high speed , they liked to go fast , " says Drela of the early jet engines .
" The faster they go , the less fuel they burn to go a certain distance . "
The 707 and just about every commercial jet made since the '50s uses the swept - back wing because it reduces drag at higher speeds .
As an airplane approaches the speed of sound , or Mach 1 , there can be small areas around the wings where some of the air is accelerated past Mach 1 .
These local areas of supersonic airflow dramatically increase the drag on the aircraft .
On an airplane with a swept - back wing , this drag is reduced because only a portion of the airflow travels perpendicular over the wing , lowering the effective airspeed , or Mach number over the wing .
This reduction in the effective Mach number is most helpful at the higher speeds where the older jet engines were most efficient .
" The 707 look originated from the demands of the low - bypass engine , " says Drela , referring to the types of engines used by airliners in the '60s and ' 70s .
The original 707 flew for a few years with what is known as a turbojet engine that was also used on fighter jets of the time and was even less efficient .
On modern high - bypass engines we see at the airport today , those big fan blades in the front push most of the air past the engine to provide thrust .
And since most of the air bypasses the engine , only a small amount is actually is being used for combustion inside the engine which means less fuel is used .
These high - bypass engines are dramatically more efficient and quieter than the older turbojet and low - bypass engines that started on airplanes such as the 707 and Douglas DC - 8 .
" The new engines are actually much closer to propeller engines than the old jet engines , paradoxically , " says Drela .
" If you look at a propeller - driven airplane , the optimum wing sweep is zero . "
So as some passengers lament over the fact that a modern airliner is 70 to 100 miles per hour slower than the original 707 , the optimum design for fuel efficiency is to fly even a little bit slower , about another 50 miles per hour .
Drela says the fuel savings of 70 percent could would require some new technology for both the airframe and the engines , and admits the technology could be years away .
But he says a simpler version of the D series that burns 50 percent less fuel than current airliners could be built with existing aluminum and jet engine technologies and be ready for service in the near - term future .

Vice President Joe Biden backed Israel 's right to board ships bound for Gaza to prevent weapons smuggling on Wednesday , but said Washington remained concerned about the plight of Palestinians there .
Israeli commandos boarded a flotilla of six aid vessels trying to break Israel 's three - year - old naval blockade of the Palestinian enclave on Monday .
Nine activists were killed in the assault and dozens injured , including some commandos .
The U.S. has been careful in its response to the deadly raid and has not joined the international condemnation of Israel 's use of force to stop the ships after its commandos were attacked as they rappelled down from helicopters .
" Israel has an absolute right to deal with its security interest , " Biden said in an interview on PBS 's " Charlie Rose " show , while reiterating the Obama administration 's support for a transparent , impartial investigation of what happened .
The aim of the Israeli commando operation had been to seize control of the ships and escort them to Israel 's Ashdod port .
From there , Israeli authorities had promised to transfer the seized cargo to Hamas - controlled Gaza .
" They ( Israel ) have said , ' Here you go .
You 're in the Mediterranean .
This ship -- if you divert slightly north you can unload it and we 'll get the stuff into Gaza . "
So what 's the big deal here ? "
Biden said .
" What 's the big deal of insisting it go straight to Gaza ? " he asked .
" Well , it 's legitimate for Israel to say , ' I do n't know what 's on that ship .
These guys are dropping eight -- 3,000 rockets on my people , " ' he said , referring to Hamas , the Islamist movement which rejects interim peace terms with Israel and has regularly fired rockets into the Jewish state .
But Biden said the U.S. also needed to " put as much pressure and as much cajoling on Israel as we can " to allow in aid shipments such as building materials .
A day earlier , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs did not question Israel 's motives in trying to enforce its 3 - year - old blockade of Gaza , which is ruled by Hamas , designated by the State Department as a foreign terrorist organization .
The aim , he pointed out at a White House briefing Tuesday , is to keep weapons , not food , out of the territory .
Gibbs said the U.S. is " working to improve the humanitarian conditions " in Gaza .
At the same time , he stressed the administration was " greatly supportive " of Israel 's security and " that 's not going to change . "
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also did not call for an end to the blockade , but she pressed Israel to allow greater access to humanitarian relief supplies .
In New York , meanwhile , the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Alejandro Wolff , suggested to reporters that the flotilla " may have been intended to provoke . "
The impact on efforts to promote a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians may be minimal .
While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a meeting with President Barack Obama to return home to deal with the aftermath of the raid , he spoke three times with the president .
U.S. mediator George Mitchell is due back in the region Wednesday and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas ' June 9 White House meeting with Obama has not been canceled .
The raid provoked some angry rhetoric from Turkey , and seemed to threaten Israel 's historic warm ties with Ankara .
But the long - range impact on Israeli - Turkish relations may be limited .
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan furiously told parliament Tuesday that the " bloody massacre " of at least four Turkish activists among nine passengers slain by Israeli naval commandos was a turning point in the long - standing alliance .
" Nothing will be the same again , " Erdogan said , gesturing angrily , his voice shaking at times .
But Turkey 's Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc took a softer tone .
" We will find a solution within law and diplomacy , " he said .
" No one should expect us to declare war on Israel over this . "
When Obama telephoned Erdogan Tuesday , according to the White House , the U.S. president said it was important to find better ways to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza without undermining Israel 's security .
Gibbs , meanwhile , suggested Obama 's effort to build ties to Arab countries would not be damaged .
" In terms of our relationship with the Muslim world , I think the president has obviously spent a lot of time on improving our relationship with countries throughout the world , and special time and care on our relationship with the Muslim world .
" I do not think that this will have a great impact on that , " he said

" I do n't need ketchup or mayonnaise from Israel .
I need my business back , " says Nasser al - Helo standing on a busy street in Gaza City .
Mr Helo used to run a business making steel doors in the Gaza Strip .
Before the blockade he was able to import metal from Israel and would produce more than 300 doors a month .
" Now , it 's a big zero , " he says .
" I 've lost $ 300,000 in the past three years . "
Private industry has been devastated by Israel 's blockade , which was tightened in 2007 after the Islamist group Hamas seized control of the coastal territory .
Factories making anything from furniture to textiles , floor tiles to biscuits have gone under .
The Israeli blockade has starved them of the raw materials they need to produce their goods .
Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs .
The United Nations estimates unemployment is at 40 % in Gaza .
Mr Helo used to employ 32 people at his factory .
Now there are only four .
' Not enough '
The overwhelming feeling among Gazans is that Israel 's announcement on Thursday that it is " easing the blockade " is simply not enough .
The details of how the blockade will be " liberalised " are still not clear , but reportedly the Israeli authorities will allow more civilian goods to enter , including all food items , toys , stationery , kitchen utensils , mattresses and towels .
Construction materials for civilian projects will be allowed in under international supervision .
" Of course it 's not enough , " says Omar Shabban , an economist at the Gaza - based think tank PalThink .
" What about the blockade on people for starters ? " he asks .
" One - and - a - half million people are trapped in a prison unable to leave . "
Israel maintains tight control of the border with Gaza , only allowing out a limited number of people to seek medical treatment .
Israel says this is needed to protect itself from " terrorist " attacks .
The Rafah crossing into Egypt has also been closed since 2007 , although special medical cases are also sporadically allowed to pass through it .
Desperate vendors
Mr Shabban argues that what is really needed in Gaza is not a few more food items - many of which are already available through smuggling tunnels running under the Egyptian border - but a total lifting of the blockade to allow people to work in Israel , as over 100,000 people used to do .
GOODS ALLOWED INTO GAZA
Canned meat and tuna , but not canned fruit
Mineral water , but not fruit juice
Sesame paste ( tahini ) but not jam
Tea and coffee but not chocolate
Cinnamon but not coriander Details of Gaza blockade revealed
Gaza also used to export many goods to Israel and beyond .
Strawberries and flowers are still two of Gaza 's most famous products , but most of them never get beyond the barrier into Israel .
Instead , in strawberry season in January they are sold dirt - cheap off huge wheelbarrows on street corners , the vendors desperate to sell them at any price before they rot .
Israel has argued that the blockade is necessary to put pressure on Hamas .
The group came out top in the Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 , but the EU , the US and Israel refused to recognise Hamas in government unless it renounced violence and its commitment to destroy Israel .
Then in June 2007 , Hamas ousted its secular rival , Fatah , and the Fatah - dominated Palestinian Authority security forces from Gaza .
Rockets
Over the past decade , Hamas has fired thousands of rockets into Israel , killing more than 20 Israelis .
Image caption
When in season , strawberries are available at rock - bottom prices
But since Israel 's major offensive on Gaza in 2009 , which devastated the territory and left more than 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead , the number has dropped dramatically .
One person - a
Thai farm worker - has been killed in southern Israel by a rocket fired from Gaza in the past 12 months .
Hamas has tried to rein in rocket fire , but it does not control all the militant groups in Gaza and sporadic , usually ineffective rocket fire continues .
Israel says it is the responsibility of the Hamas authorities to stop all rocket attacks , and that the blockade is necessary to stop weapons being brought into Gaza .
But at least until now the list of items banned from entering Gaza has gone far beyond weapons .
Coriander , chocolate and children 's toys have famously been excluded .
Low expectations
In actual fact , such things are readily available in the supermarkets in Gaza .
Millions of dollars worth of goods are smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt .
Image caption Most goods are smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt
There is food on the shelves and in the markets but the blockade means it is too expensive for most people to afford .
A kilo of beef smuggled from Egypt costs around $ 15 , more than most Gazans earn in a day .
" We are living on a black - market economy , " says Mr Shabban .
Gazans have little faith in Israel 's announcement .
At best , they will wait and see if anything changes in the coming weeks and months .
Indeed , like most places in the world , people here are more preoccupied with the World Cup .
The cafes of Gaza City on Friday were full of people cheering on Algeria as they thrashed out a dire draw with England .
The beaches in Gaza are packed this weekend with thousand of children enjoying summer camps and frolicking in the Mediterranean Sea .
But as they play in the water , a reminder that the blockade of Gaza is still very much in place - the sound of machine - gun fire just a few kilometres off the coast .
Israeli navy ships , which continue to occupy and control Gaza 's territorial water , regularly open fire on Palestinian fishing boats that stray beyond the limits of where Israel allows them to fish .
Yet most of the children did not even bat an eyelid at the gunfire .
The blockade here has been come a way of life .
Few people are optimistic that will change .
KEY ENTRY POINTS INTO GAZA
Earlier this week I read a report about creating a geographic data system for a community group in Lawrence , Massachusetts .
The document contained detailed technical documentation for how to use iPAQ handheld computers to collect geocoded data .
Since the data was collected and managed in geographic information system ( GIS ) software , it required pages of technical instructions .
This case seemed a prime example of how GIS tools missed the mark for planners who need to work with geographic data , but in a different way than technical analysts .
The purpose of the project was to empower community youth to collect basic data , a task ill suited to software designed for data management by experts using hundreds of attributes and a fine degree of precision .
One day later , I found myself reading Newsweek 's cover story about the iPad , which reported that Apple expects to sell hundreds of thousands of the sturdy , easy - to - use devices in the coming months .
Could the iPad be used for planning ?
I have previously written about the potential for the iPhone to augment city life .
Since then the types of apps I described have only grown in popularity : navigation apps that use transit data , apps to report potholes or other issues to city officials , augmented reality apps providing information about your surroundings , and geographic networking and gaming like FourSquare .
The iPad shares the capabilities that make the iPhone so useful in urban contexts : it is highly mobile , location aware , and some iPads are 3G - connected .
For planning , an important difference is the larger screen .
Not only does it make it easier to record data in the field , it could be used to pull up renderings , images , and other data on the go .
In a small meeting , the iPad could sit on the table allowing for the functionality of a touch table without the hassle and expense of the real thing .
In short , it creates the potential for collaborative mobile computing with an easy - to - use yet technically sophisticated device .
Of course , much of the potential will be limited by the available software .
The functions I am describing may not be sufficiently lucrative to attract developers , or seem too specialized for Apple to include in their store .
Assuming that like the iPhone , the browser can query the device 's location , one solution could be websites designed for planning purposes .
Someday we could even see an city data portal , pulling up local property ownership , zoning , land use , permitting , and crime data as you walk down the street .
Then again , planners are often the first to point out that problems are rarely solved by technology , no matter how " magical " it is ( to use Apple 's term for the iPad ) .
New devices only expend our toolkit for the hard work of good planning .
A global poll of football experts has been conducted by the BBC Sport website to produce a predicted top four at the 2010 World Cup .
We have been asking pundits , players , managers , journalists and other experts to give us their predicted one - two - three - four at the tournament , which kicks off in South Africa on Friday .
The identities of the top four will be revealed daily , one by one from Monday , with the outright tournament winner and all the individual selections announced on Thursday .
Our survey forecasts ENGLAND will finish in fourth place , making the semi-finals for the first time in the World Cup since their heartbreaking penalty shoot - out defeat by Germany at Italia 90 .
International users can view England guide here
While several experts reckoned the English side , managed by Fabio Capello , could make the final four , only a handful felt they would reach the final itself or lift the famous trophy .
One of them is the former Brazil midfielder Socrates , who said a Wayne Rooney - inspired England could emerge triumphant ahead of Spain , Brazil and the Netherlands .
" Today it is essential to have a good team and also a key player to demonstrate superiority , " he said .
And the former Sweden full - back Jan Olsson had England ahead of Germany , Ivory Coast and Brazil .
606 : DEBATE
" It 's time for them now I think , it 's been long enough since 1966 .
They have a very good coach , better than most other countries , and some good players too , " stated Olsson .
Ex -England midfielder Geoff Thomas was another of our experts to plump for Capello 's side to bring the World Cup home for the first time since 1966 .
His one - two - three - four is England , Brazil , Portugal , Argentina .
" England will win the World Cup because for once I think we have got a team that backs up being favourites , as they always are in our eyes , " commented Thomas .

" I can't see a side out there who can beat us on our day .
If we can get to the quarter - finals , we have got a really good chance . "
Over 50 experts from more than 20 nations were polled in our survey .
They were asked to predict their top four , with the caveat that some forecasts may not work out precisely because of the variable nature of the draw .
But there are some fascinating forecasts , as demonstrated by the team which is predicted to be third .
All will be revealed on Tuesday ...

Updated : Google ( s goog ) , according to a much - retweeted message posted by Digg co-founder Kevin Rose over the weekend — which he attributed to a “ very credible source ” — is working on a Facebook competitor to be called Google Me .
There ’s been much debate since about what such a service might look like , with some theorizing it could be a blend of Google Buzz and Orkut , the often - forgotten Google social network .
Others are expecting it to be an evolution of Google Profiles , in which users could add Facebook - like features to their profile pages .
But one thing is almost certain : the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against the search engine company .
Despite its size and market clout , Google has n’t shown that it has any real understanding of how social networking actually works , or any idea what to do with it .
Although there is little evidence of a Google Me project apart from Rose ’s tweet , the idea that the search and advertising giant might be trying to cobble together a Facebook competitor is at least plausible , for a couple of reasons :
Search : Despite a deal with Microsoft ( s msft ) , in which the software company powers its search engine , Facebook is currently not a major player in search , with a fairly small share of the market .
However , the social network ’s rollout of its new social graph search , in which the “ likes ” that users record at millions of websites are recorded and indexed , could serve to put a wrench in Google ’s gears .
Although there is still debate about how much competition such a search engine could be for Google , it ’s clearly on Facebook ’s radar .

Although there is still debate about how much competition such a search engine could be for Google , it ’s clearly on Facebook ’s radar .
Advertising : Advertisers are increasingly interested in taking advantage of social networking , and the reality is that Facebook has become the de facto way to do that .
The number of advertisers it ’s working with doubled last year , and despite some debate about what a Facebook “ fan ” is really worth to a company , that number is almost certain to grow .
The risk for Google is that advertisers will start to prefer ads based on a person ’s social interactions rather than what they type into a search box , a risk Om flagged in a GigaOM Pro report last year ( subscription required ) .
Could Google put together a credible competitor to Facebook ?
Anything is possible , but so far there ’s little reason to believe that the search giant could come up with a service that represented a real threat .
Orkut may be popular in South America and India , but has shown no signs of growing outside of those countries .
Could Google use it as the basis for something that takes parts of Google Buzz , parts of Google Profiles , parts of Google Wave and parts of Blogger to construct a comprehensive social network ?
Theoretically , but that sounds more like a Frankenstein - style strategy than anything else — stitching together pieces of half - dead services and hoping they come alive .
Although Google has been working hard to add features to Buzz since its rough start earlier this year , the service does not appear to be gaining much traction ( Google has n’t released any figures on number of users ) .
Google Wave , which also had a much - hyped launch , seems to have more or less sunk without a trace , or at least has not been able to build much of a popular following .
Google Profiles provides some of the same features as a Facebook profile , and has the ability to pull in streams of activity from other services in a similar way to Friendfeed , the social network that Facebook acquired , but Profiles do n’t seem to be all that popular either — nor has Google ’s Friend Connect gotten much widespread adoption .
Google Latitude is interesting , especially when combined with Android and mobile devices , but it has so far failed to provide much competition for Foursquare or Gowalla .
The bottom line is that while Google seems to have many of the pieces of a potential social network , they are scattered here and there , either not connected to each other or only loosely so , and without any sign of a coherent strategy ( Google Wave and Google Buzz , for example , are independent services that overlap in many ways , but were launched by separate teams and do n’t really work together ) .
Maybe once Google hires a new head of social all that will change , but for now Facebook probably does n’t need to lose a lot of sleep worrying about competition from Google — more likely it ’s the other way around .
Update : Adam D’Angelo , a former Facebook executive who now runs a question - and - answer service called Quora , has added some fuel to the rumors about Google Me in a response to a question at the site .
Based on reports from what he calls “ reliable sources , ” D’Angelo says : “ This is not a rumor .
This is a real project .
There are a large number of people working on it .
I am completely confident about this . ”
He also notes that the service is being modeled on Facebook , that it is “ high priority ” and that Google is “ really scared ” of the social network ’s growth .

BBC World News America
St Louis has long been known as America 's beer capital .
It 's the home of the US 's largest brewery , Anheuser - Busch , and more than a dozen craft breweries - which have been gaining new fans after Anheuser - Busch 's sale to Belgium 's InBev in 2008 .
To most people around the world , Anheuser Busch is America 's brewery and America 's beer is Budweiser .
To its hometown crowd , it has simply been known as " the brewery " .
" There was no part of this community that was n't a part of the brewery , " says Dan Kopman , who founded Schlafly Beer in St Louis in 1992 .
" Everyone in town knew someone who worked for the brewery . "
My grandfather , my father , they were the guys drinking this beer and they drank it because they had pride in St Louis
Mike Sweeney , STL Hops
It gave its name to university and hospital buildings .
It donated beer to charity events .
It " touched so many people in so many ways , " Kopman says .
The fact that " AB " , as most locals call the company , became a major international player only added to their sense of pride .
When Kopman and his partner opened what was then the second brewery in town , they had to build a restaurant along with it , to get people to try their beer .
Allegiances " Reaching consumers through the normal channels was going to be very difficult because the bars were so loyal to Anheuser Busch , " said Kopman , who learned his trade in the UK at Young & Co's Wandsworth brewery .
There are more new beer styles being created here , there are more rules being broken here .
Dan Kopman , Co-Founder Schlafly Beer
At the time of Schlafly 's opening , there were around 100 small and independent craft breweries in the United States .
That number has grown to more than 1,500 in the last two decades , according to the Brewers Association .
There are now 14 in St Louis alone - and the sale of Anheuser Busch to the Belgian beverage giant InBev , has given them a big chance to expand sales to drinkers re-thinking their allegiance to the AB .
" My grandfather , my father , they were the guys drinking this beer and they drank it because they had pride in St Louis and because they had pride in the brewery , " says Mike Sweeney , a local beer blogger .
" The younger people are going to try something from the guys that they know are brewing here in St Louis , " said Sweeney .
" The ones that are actually hands on , somebody that they can go into the bar and actually sit next to and start talking to about beer . "
Broken rules Kopman calls it a revival not just of the beer culture in St Louis but in America in general .
In St Louis , 40 breweries were wiped out during the prohibition , leaving only one .
The variety of beer available in the city now would have been unthinkable just a few decades ago .
" There are more new beer styles being created here , there are more rules being broken here , there are new beer styles being created every day in the 1,500 small American breweries , " says Kopman .
Opened in 2004 , Schlafly 's Bottleworks houses the main brewing operation .
" If I was to change our Pale Ale recipe at Young 's , the head brewer I worked for in London would have had something to say about that .
" The new generation of brewers in the US wants to experiment with different combinations of grain , hops , and yeast strains .
They do not feel that tug of a tradition that might tie them to do something a certain way . "
Something unique
While overall beer sales in the US were down 2.2 % in 2009 and the sales of imported beer were down almost 10 % , growth of the craft brewing industry in 2009 was up 10.3 % , according to the Brewers Association .
For Dan Kopman and Schafly Beer , the biggest challenge at the moment is how to stay small .
Right now , the brewery is producing 50,000 barrels a year , while in St Louis alone , some 2.5 million barrels are consumed each year .
For Kopman , it is not about challenging Anheuser Busch , but offering something that makes St Louis unique again .
" You are not going to get Schlafly Light in 30 - packs , " he says , with a smile .
" In a time when you can get everything everywhere I really enjoy people coming up to me and asking where can I buy this beer .
And I 'll say - St Louis . "

One of my most popular posts was a piece entitled “ How to talk to your bisexual boyfriend ” and it attracts a lot of comments from women seeking to deal with their boyfriend ’s bisexuality .
I thought it would be interesting to analyse the female reactions to discovering they have a bisexual boyfriend and to see if we can learn anything from it .
I apologise in advance if this article comes across as sexist .
I do have a prejudice in so much as I have experienced these situations for myself as a male who has come out as bisexual to several girlfriends .
But I do think this perspective and my conclusions will be helpful to women , so if you can get over my wounded male bias and reach the end of the essay , you ’ll hopefully find it useful .
Based on the comments my earlier article attracted and on emails I received privately , it would seem that generally speaking you can characterise the sentiments of women who have just discovered their boyfriend is bisexual as some or more of the following .
They still love their boyfriend
They are angry / hurt he did n’t reveal his bisexuality sooner .
They are worried he might decide he is gay .
They want him to be true to himself .
They do n’t want him to sleep with men on the side .
( The monogamy clause ) .
Lets briefly deal with each and then I ’ll take a more holistic discussion of the points .
(1) Women still love their bisexual boyfriends .
Good !
Happy days !
This is an excellent and fortunate place to start .
From here all things are possible .
(2) They are angry and or hurt that their boyfriends did n’t reveal their bisexuality sooner in the relationship .
On this point I see varying definitions of “ sooner ” ranging from “ before he even asked her out ” to “ before he asked her to marry her ” .
What ’s more the definition of “ sooner ” appears to be proportional to the length of the relationship up to the revelation .
Men ca n’t seem to win on this one , because they can never tell their girlfriends they are bisexual soon enough .
Whilst its understandable that women are going to feel hurt , particularly if they have caught their boyfriend being unfaithful .
I have never heard from a woman ( even one who has not been cheated on ) consider all the social barriers , shame and fears a man might have about revealing his bisexuality .
In our hetero dominated world , few people outside the LGBT community understand how hard it is to come out .
Girls you need to be more understanding about this , especially if you and your boyfriend live in a very heterosexual social environment or have a religiously conservative background .
(3) They worry their boyfriend might decide he is gay .
I ’ll analyse the motives behind this fear later , but for now , I ’ll just say two things , ( a ) we can blame every gay man that ever tried to be straight for creating this stereotype [ Joking ] and ( b ) it singularly fails to understand bisexuality as a distinct orientation to homosexuality .
Its worth noting that for many bisexual men , the last two points ( 4 ) & ( 5 ) are impossible to reconcile .
A point seemingly wasted on some of their girlfriends .
Due to the logical inconsistency , I tend to dismiss point ( 4 ) as tokenism or at least as being very low on the list of priorities .
In fact what is far more over - riding in these circumstances is abandonment issues .
Personally , I find its telling that I have never heard from a woman , who has dumped her boyfriend because she found out he was bisexual .
They all want to save the relationship , they often are unsure how to do this or whether the relationship can survive .
They are often confused and hurt , but I have not heard from a woman who instantly gave her boyfriend his marching orders just because she found out he liked boys .
So I do n’t think women want to leave their boyfriends .
More over their objections to him sleeping with men ( the monogamy clause ) and their fear that he might decide he is gay , are actually two sides of the same coin and centre on their fear that their boyfriend will leave them , not vice versa .
This is what leads me to think that abandonment fears are actually at the heart of the whole issue .
Bisexual men tend to keep their sexuality a secret because they fear their girlfriend will dump them .
Something I have seen no evidence of .
When they reveal their bisexuality , their girlfriend then fears that their boyfriend will leave them .
Again if he is bisexual there is no evidence of this either .
The unfairness about these respective fears is that the male fear of abandonment is falsifiable and can be demonstrably shown to be misplaced , ie : by coming out and discovering that your girlfriend does n’t actually want to leave you .
In contrast the female fear of abandonment is ( in the short term at least ) unfalsifiable and there is nothing the guy can do to show her it is misplaced .
The problem is that this female fear of abandonment tends to manifest itself with trust issues , resentment and insecurities .
These become a destructive force in the relationship before sufficient time has elapsed to allow the abandonment fear to be abated .
One guaranteed cure for female abandonment fears is long - term monogamy .
Some women might be able to gradually accept an open relationship whereby they allow their boyfriend to have casual male partners providing of course that they always return to their female partners afterwards .
But each takes time to accept and the abandonment fears actively work actively against allowing this to happen .
I seemed to be working towards a conclusion that you are damned if you do and damned if you do n’t .
However , I do n’t think that ’s helpful or proactive in terms of relationship counselling .
The solution as I see it rests with the ability of women to quickly get over any feelings of hurt and anger they are experiencing and to rapidly resolve any abandonment fears they might have .
This is easier said than done and places a heavy burden on women , but I do believe that if more women can take a cognitive approach to the situation , better outcomes ie : a loving and trusting relationship will result .
An explanation of how this might work will have to wait for another article , and whether or not you think I ’m being fair towards women is also open to debate .
However , I think we ’ll agree that abandonment fears are a major destructive force in relationships , they cause men to lie and women to lose trust and feel insecure .
Getting over abandonment fears is therefore central to a happy relationship .
NEOGA , Ill . 
Signs on the wall at the old Pioneer School here seem not to have not changed much since the ’ 80s .
A multiplication table hangs on one wall , a copy of the Constitution on another .
But near the entrance to the cafeteria , where generations from this central Illinois farming community took their school lunches , one sign reveals just how dramatically the yellow brick building ’s role has shifted : “ Our dancers are entertainers not prostitutes so do n’t ask ! !! ”
The building , sold by the school district in 2002 , recently reopened as a strip club , shocking Cumberland County residents  many of whom walked its halls as youngsters and discovered its new use one week before it opened .
Some who want it shut down protest regularly .
Praying for its patrons to see the error of their ways , they illuminate a small cross and display a sign that reads : “ Does your family know where you are ?
Jesus does . ”
The video game wedding or proposal is not new , but when it ’s done in a cool way it ’s worth noting and what cooler way is there to propose than in an awesome classic game like Chrono Trigger ?
Phil wanted to propose to his ( now wife ) Anna and after going through a few ideas he decided to hack the video game she was currently playing .
Here ’s what was said on the YouTube page .
On October 17th , 2008 , I proposed to my ( now ) Fiancé .
Originally I wanted to return to the site of our first date , Mount Baker , near Bellingham Washington .
Sadly , there was no discrete way to get her out there .
So I turned to the next best thing , digitally recreating the mountain !
But why stop there ?
I figured I ’d try and recreate many of our other favorite memories — stargazing , dancing , even her favorite song lyrics ( from the Princess Bride ) .
I ’m a college student who is studying Computer Science , and I wanted to do something unique that used my talents , so I did some research on Rom hacking , as she was playing through Chrono Trigger .
( A perennial favorite of mine , I ca n’t wait to buy it for my DS . )
I even put in her cat , Cleo !
I had several goals in mind :
First )
Keep the area in the context of the original game , the proposal should be a surprise .
Second )
Get it done quick !
I had the ring , I had the Father ’s blessing , and you ca n’t sit on either of those for too long .
You ’ll notice some of the NPC collision information is missing ( the cat runs through a lot of weird places ) and I did n’t have time to properly debug every tile .
Third )
Place memories that might be poignant enough to remind her of our relationship , while not inadvertently giving away that this was somehow hacked .
( See goal # 1 . )
Overall , it was a resounding success .
She had no idea that this was n’t part of the original .
She asked , “ Hey , are those the Princess Bride lyrics ?
Do the Japanese really love that movie ? ” to which I responded , “ Yeah !
That ’s probably it !
Either that or a bored translator slipping in an Easter egg . ”
When her name appeared on screen ( blurred in this video ) , she glanced over to me ( on one knee , with the ring out ) , wondering , “ How did they get my name in this game ? ”
When she saw the ring , she reread the proposal , nodded yes , and said , “ You are such a huge nerd !
I love this ! ”
I spent a long time debating whether or not this proposal was awesome or incredibly stupid .
Her friends , and my friends helped talk me into it , and it was a huge success !
I built the area by fusing a pre-existing area ( Denodoro Mountains ) with concepts I had in my mind .
Each NPC in the area ( save the cat , and the young girl at the beginning ) is supposed to be either myself or my fiancé .

Flax Oil for Omega-3
When untainted and unadulterated by the food industry , flax seed oil seems to have virtually countless miraculous health - generating properties , which are falsely believed to stem from the oil 's omega - 3 content .
Technically , flax seeds and flax seed oil do not contain omega - 3's .
They instead contain alpha - linolenic acid , which a body 's enzymes use as a raw material to synthesize its own EPA and DHA ( omega - 3 oils ) in exactly the amounts needed to balance the inflammatory omega - 6 and 9 oils that are so common in our diets .
These facts make flax seed oil superior to fish oil supplements for getting both the exact amount of needed omega - 3's , and for getting absolutely pure omega - 3's into the body .
For these reasons , we have always recommended that only flax seed oil be used for omega - 3 supplementation .
It may be the most important supplement that a person can take , with it racing closely against vitamin C .
It literally is a cure for cancer and it substantially fights heart disease and other inflammatory disorders .
The polyunsaturated fats include vegetable oils such as soy , corn , safflower , canola , sesame seed , sunflower , and flax seed oil .
Unfortunately , they all produce an undesirable repercussion when they are used for cooking , due to the fact that they are easily altered with exposure to light , heat , or oxygen .
They quickly become rancid and carcinogenic .
Flax seed oil is especially sensitive .
Supplemental flax seed oil is usually stored in dark bottles and refrigerated for this reason .
If exposed to heat , light , or oxygen , then the oil can quickly become rancid .
Polyunsaturated oils become trans fats and worse through break - down .
Flax seed oil may develop a profuse odor , and it can become toxic to the point of becoming a carcinogen .
The odor is caused by rancidity .
It is the reason why dangerous fish oil supplements smell so terrible .
That smell is usually much more than just the smell of the fish , and fish oil is usually extremely rancid from the extra processing that is required .
Highly - processed fish oil is precisely the omega - 3 supplement that is prescribed by the medical establishment , and it is certainly good for business .
The rancid trans fats that are produced with shoddy or over - processed oils actually neutralize the useful omega - 3 that is already in the body , so the consumption of them is like taking an anti-omega - 3 supplement .
" ... I investigated the high temperature treatment for fish oils , for the purpose of making them keep longer , and killing their fishy taste .
I came to the conclusion that these oils do great harm to the entire internal glandular system , as well as to the liver and other organs and are therefore not suitable for human consumption . "
-- Dr. Johanna Budwig , Flax Oil as a True Aid Against Heart Infarction , Cancer and Other Diseases
Flax seed oil has become famous for fostering improved health , so the food industry is offering a plethora of flax seed based foods .
There are a variety of food items such as cereals that are marketed for having health benefits , due to the inclusion of baked flax seeds .
Remember what heat does ?
Surely these companies must know what they are doing to people , for these food empires have huge R&D departments .
What is even more incredible is that some products have whole flax seeds , such as granola bars .
Whole flax seeds are extremely difficult to digest , unless they are first ground .
This must be done just prior to consumption , in order to avoid rancidity .
Whole seeds just pass without any digestion , which merely burdens the digestive system , instead of providing health benefits .
The destroyed omega precursors neutralize iodine too .
In the final insult , they always bake the included flax seeds to ensure that the useful compounds are destroyed .
Once again , the food industry has found a way to toxify an otherwise healthy food , and then it tricks customers who are concerned about their health into consuming it .
This is even happening in health food stores .
Our Omega - 3 Recommendations
We recommend that omega - 3 supplements be consumed in the form of individual , light - resistant capsules to protect the oil from heat , light , and oxygen .
It should also be cold pressed .
Buy it and all other supplements from health food and herbal retailers , unless you are shopping by way of the Internet .
The products found in regular retailers have serious quality control and potency issues .
Especially avoid U.S.P. supplements , which are made by , and approved by the pharmaceutical industry .
For best results , combine the flax seed oil with a source of sulfur proteins , such as goat cheese , or unhomogenized yogurt .

Leyla W. could n’t figure out where her birth control pills kept going .
One day a few tablets would be missing ; the next , the whole container .
Her then - boyfriend shrugged and said he had n’t seen them .
She believed him — until she found them in his drawer .
When she confronted him , he hit her .
“ That was his way of shutting me up , ” says Leyla , who is in her mid-20s and living in Northern California .
( For her safety , Leyla wishes to withhold her last name and hometown . )
He also raped her and , most days , left her locked in a bedroom with a bit of food and water while he went to work .
( A roommate took pity and let her out until he came home . )
Thanks to the missed pills , she got pregnant twice , the second time deciding against abortion .
Ad Policy
Despite his role in getting her pregnant , when Leyla decided she did not want to have an abortion , her boyfriend did a 180 , screaming at her belly that he did n’t want the baby to live , threatening to “ kick the baby out ” of her stomach and even , one day , pushing her down a flight of stairs .
Her pregnancy was “ hell , ” says Leyla .
Perhaps mercifully , it ended at thirty - seven weeks — the baby arriving three weeks early , her doctor speculated , because of his mother ’s profound stress .
( Her doctor was aware , to some degree , of the abuse , and told Leyla the best thing she could do was leave . )
Related Article Conversation : Lynn Harris & Elizabeth Miller on Reproductive Coercion The Nation on Grit TV
Leyla eventually did just that , getting herself out of her abusive relationship and into a support group .
“ I do ask every day why I stayed with him for seven years , ” she says ( though she now says that witnessing her father abuse her mother corrupted her sense of what counts as “ normal ” in a relationship ) .
She married a “ wonderful ” man last November who is , she says , “ a great father ” to her son , Eddie , now 2 .
Leyla ’s story turns a modern fable on its head : that of the woman — call her the femme fertile — who conspires to get pregnant , perhaps by “ forgetting ” to take her birth control pills , as a way to “ trap a man ” and force marriage — or at least keep him in her life .
In reality , experts researchers on dating violence and unintended pregnancy say , it ’s Leyla ’s version of that story is all too common .
Two new studies have quantified what advocates for young women ’s health have observed for years : the striking frequency with which it is in fact young men who try to force their partners to get pregnant .
Their goal : not to settle down as family men but rather to exert what is perhaps the most intimate , and lasting , form of control .
( “ Control ” may also include attempts to force both pregnancy and abortion , even in the same relationship . )
Together with earlier small - scale studies and reports by those in the field , the new figures help fill out the picture of a long - known , but under - addressed , phenomenon now referred to as “ reproductive coercion , ” in which abusive partners subject young women already at risk of violence to the additional health risks of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections .
The new data confirm that we must expand not only our assumptions about who ’s forcing whom to get pregnant but also our understanding of the meaning and causes of “ unwanted ” pregnancy .
“ If we are serious about stopping unplanned pregnancy in this country , we simply must address the sexual violence and reproductive control that often cause it , ” says Esta Soler , president of the Family Violence Prevention Fund , which has been a leading advocate on the issue .
A new study has found that among 71 women aged 18 - 49 with a history of intimate partner violence , 74 percent reported having experienced some form of reproductive control , including forced unprotected intercourse , failure to withdraw as promised or sabotaging of condoms .
Women who became pregnant were coerced to proceed in accordance with the wishes of their partners , who in some cases threatened to kill them if they had an abortion .
Study authors Ann Moore , Lori Frohwirth and Elizabeth Miller , MD , recommend that service providers in women ’s health clinics ask questions designed to identify women who may be experiencing reproductive coercion , and should be aware that some women may need birth control ( such as IUDs ) that can be hidden from partners .
In the largest study of this phenomenon to date , “ Pregnancy Coercion , Intimate Partner Violence and Unintended Pregnancy , ” published in the January issue of the journal Contraception , lead researcher Elizabeth Miller and others surveyed nearly 1,300 16 - to 29 - year - old women who ’d sought a variety of services at five different Northern California reproductive health clinics .
Among those who had experienced intercourse , i.e. who could be at risk of unintended pregnancy , not only did 53 percent of respondents say they ’d experienced physical or sexual violence from a partner , but one in five said they had experienced pregnancy coercion ; 15 percent said they experienced birth control sabotage , including hiding or flushing birth control pills down the toilet , intentional breaking of condoms and removing contraceptive rings or patches .
These figures were consistent from clinic to clinic .
Three years ago , Miller , now assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California , Davis , School of Medicine and a practitioner at UC Davis Children ’s Hospital , published what is said to be the first study in adolescent health literature to document the role of abusive partners in promoting teen pregnancy .
The study was based on interviews with a racially and ethnically diverse group of sixty - one girls from Boston ’s poorest neighborhoods , all with histories of intimate - partner violence .
Fifty - three of them were in abusive and sexually active relationships at the time of the interview ; of those girls , 26 percent reported that their partners were “ actively trying to get them pregnant ” by manipulating condom use , sabotaging birth control ” — many reported trying to hide their birth control from boyfriends — or simply sweet - talking them about “ making beautiful babies ” together .
One girl reported that her boyfriend deliberately got her pregnant , and then made her have an abortion .
“ Pregnancy is an extremely contested area of human relationships , ” says Miller .
“ It ’s likely that there are women who try to get pregnant on purpose in order to maintain or change a relationship .
But now we can also say that there is another part of this story that we have not paid enough attention to : men ’s direct role in promoting pregnancy against women ’s wishes .
It ’s not the only cause of teen pregnancy , but it ’s one that we ’d managed to miss for a very long time . ”
The new data is both alarming and promising .
While it adds wrinkles to the often - linked problems of unwanted pregnancy and intimate partner violence , it may also provide new clues as to how to address them .
What we now know about reproductive coercion could begin , for one thing , to shine some light onto recent upticks in rates of teen pregnancy and abortion .
In January , the Guttmacher Institute reported that between 2005 and 2006 the pregnancy rate among girls ages 15 to 19 had jumped for the first time since 1990 , by a factor of 3 percent .
“ There are a multitude of reasons for the recent increase in teen pregnancy , ” says Miller .
“ Reproductive coercion may be one piece of the puzzle . ”
Longitudinal studies are needed , Miller says , along with further exploration of the well - documented but puzzling phenomenon of “ pregnancy ambivalence , ” a term those in the field use to describe sexually active women who say they do n’t want to get pregnant , yet who do n’t try consistently to prevent it .
“ We need further research to find out if part of what we ’ve been addressing as ‘ ambivalence ’ is in fact male - partner influence on women ’s reproductive health and autonomy , ” explains Miller .
A better understanding of reproductive coercion also offers a new — though not always sufficiently early — warning system for intimate partner violence .
Unwanted pregnancy should not be considered just a fait - accompli consequence of a series of individual and societal failures .
Rather , Miller and others say , healthcare providers should treat unplanned pregnancy ( or repeat pregnancy or STD testing ) as a potential red flag for relationship abuse .
( This is something Miller began to suspect a decade ago when , while working as a volunteer counselor in a Boston clinic , she gave a 15 - year - old girl a pregnancy test — negative — and sent her on her way with the usual information about birth control ; two weeks later , the girl wound up in the ER when her boyfriend pushed her down a flight of stairs . )
In fact , Miller ’s latest , still - unpublished research has shown that when counselors at family planning clinics are trained to ask questions designed to reveal unhealthy relationships —
“ Did your partner ever mess with your birth control or try to get you pregnant when you did n’t want to be ? ” — not only are they able to detect cases of relationship violence that might otherwise have fallen through the cracks but the young women at risk are also significantly more likely to get themselves safely out .
Of course , protecting and educating women is only half — if that — of the equation .
Why do men abuse in this way in the first place ?
In one 2007 study , some young men said outright that they ’d insisted on condomless sex as a way to establish power over female partners .
( There is some evidence of analogous male - on - male violence , but no in - depth studies exist . )
Other research shows that men consider a request for a condom an accusation — or admission — of cheating .
Advocates such as Patti Giggans , executive director of Peace Over Violence , also hear male gang members say things like “ I ’m not gonna be around forever .
I ’ve got to leave my legacy . ”
( That said , anecdotal evidence — to say nothing of wide reports that even philandering celebrities and politicos eschew condoms — shows that the phenomenon is not limited to the most economically depressed classes . )
According to Miller and Giggans , innovative , male - focused violence prevention programs are popping up all the time .
But Miller says that recent research demonstrates that there ’s a clear need for relationship violence prevention to be integrated into pregnancy prevention and sexual health curricula , and vice versa .
Given her findings , after all , preventing unwanted pregnancy appears to be about more than making contraception available , accessible , and acceptable .
Never mind abstinence - only education , which would be irrelevant , to say the least , to someone experiencing sexual coercion — even the most comprehensive , medically accurate sex ed— or all the free condoms in all the fishbowls in the world — wo n’t deter a sexually abusive partner , and wo n’t magically protect a girl from a partner who deliberately damages a condom or suddenly removes it mid-intercourse .
“ Ideally , we ’d discuss healthy relationships as a foundation for sex ed before we discuss mechanics , ” Miller says .
Given how embattled sex ed already is , that will be a slow , state by state , curriculum by curriculum process .
In fact , some dating violence educators , Miller says , are a bit resistant to tie the issue too explicitly to pregnancy prevention , for fear that too much discussion of sex could jeopardize the inclusion of their entire curriculum .
But changes are already beginning to take place — at least ten states have passed laws requiring ( or at least “ urging , ” though not necessarily funding ) dating violence education — and teen advocacy groups are generally on board with the notion of broadening pregnancy prevention curricula to include coercion .
Members of Miller ’s team , for example , have been working with the writers of the California pregnancy prevention curriculum to add a vignette in which a girl asks a guy to use a condom but then he removes it during sex .
( Right now , Miller says , “ that kind of conversation is just not happening . ” )
As important as it is to address the dangers of coercion , experts agree with Miller that the best big - picture approach is to educate young men and women alike about healthy relationships .
“ It ’s imperative that we teach kids comprehensive sex ed that includes awareness of violence and coercion .
The more we can help them understand what constitutes a good relationship and where you go for help when something ’s not good , the more they have a fighting chance , ” says Debra Hauser , executive vice president of Advocates For Youth .
On the upside , there is at least one sense in which talk of sex - ed innovation is not pie in the sky : there may actually be some money for it .
For all the warranted concern about reappropriation of funds for abstinence - only education , in December 2009 President Obama signed into law a $ 114.5 million teen pregnancy prevention initiative based on medically accurate , research - based information .
While $ 75 million is reserved for programming already proven effective , at least $ 25 million is earmarked for research and testing of innovative new approaches .
The increasing awareness of the interpersonal complexities of unintended pregnancy — plus the potential funding — make Sarah Brown , executive director of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , “ uncharacteristically optimistic , ” she says .
“ Sex ed has mainly been focused on reproduction , not relationships .
But people in the field have been beginning to understand that — while there is a role for specific pregnancy prevention and harm reduction — it ’s all part of a larger picture that also includes substance abuse and overall life planning .
It ’s not just about body parts or pathogens or the mechanics of contraception ; it ’s about what constitutes a respectful , warm relationship .
If it were n’t for the money , I would n’t be so sanguine , but five years from now we ’ll have seen many more efforts to talk about the particular sex and safety topics within the larger context of healthy lives and relationships . ”
And , of course , school is n’t the only place where prevention and intervention can take place — or be improved .
The Family Violence Prevention Fund , in collaboration with the Office on Women ’s Health of the US Department of Health and Human Services , has just launched a $ 3 million violence - prevention initiative called Project Connect , which is designed to find new ways to identify and respond to domestic and sexual violence , including reproductive coercion , in public health settings .
Working with ten state health departments and violence - prevention advocacy groups nationwide , the fund will train staff at family planning , adolescent health , home visitation and other maternal child health programs to understand domestic violence and reproductive coercion so that they recognize it when they see it and know how to help .
Given what we know now — and can do about — the link between violence and pregnancy prevention , there ’s hope for steps forward .
“ My dream is that we ’ll see a comprehensive public health response to domestic violence and reproductive coercion in the way we ’ve seen for smoking cessation and HIV prevention , ” says Lisa James of the Family Violence Prevention Fund , director of Project Connect .
“ We ’re starting with just ten sites , but we know this will become the national standard . ”

We 've been hearing about the upcoming Android Gingerbread release in Q4 for a while now .
And also how the new Android user interface will blow our socks off .
Still , everyone 's been pretty sketchy about exact details of what 's actually coming to Android Gingerbread .
Until now .

Mobile - review.com 's Eldar Murtazin just went and spilled a boatload of interesting details about the upcoming Android Gingerbread release .
Do n't run searching for these details to his blog or his main site , you wo n't find anything there yet .
Eldar did all the spilling in his Russian podcast " Digestiv " .
It 's audio only , so Google Translate wo n't help you much .

Android 3.0 Gingerbread will be released in mid- October ( around 15 - 16th ) , 2010 .
First handsets shipping in November / December – for the Holiday Season .
Minimum hardware requirements for Android 3.0 devices are : 1GHZ CPU , 512MB or RAM , displays from 3.5 " and higher .
( We all , of course , heard that Android handsets with 2GHz CPU 's are coming )
for Android 3.0 devices are : 1GHZ CPU , 512MB or , displays from 3.5 " and higher .
( We all , of course , heard that Android handsets with 2GHz CPU 's are coming )
New 1280 — 760 resolution available for the devices with displays of 4 " and higher .
( Anyone thinking about Android tablets now ? )
Completely revamped user interface .
If you want to get a feeling of what Android 3.0 Gingerbread UX is like , check out the Gallery App on Nexus One .
The same overall feel , light animated transitions , etc .
Natively , through all the UI .
Android 's split into 2 branches becomes official .
3.0 for top of the line / high end devices .
Cheap , low - end mass market handsets will keep Android 2.1/2.2
Eldar also confirmed my musings about the death of third party User Interface shells like HTC Sense , MotoBlur , etc ; .
Android 3.0 basically kills the need for them .
Still , there 's some hope for third party vendors here – while Google takes over the UI on the high end , vendors get to keep their UI shells / improvements on mass market Android smartphones , running Eclair or Froyo .

BP said on Friday that it recovered nearly 30,000 barrels of oil in the most recent 24 - hour period .
But putting that figure in context , Admiral Thad Allen , the head of the federal response , said that at least 35,000 barrels a day , and possibly as much as 60,000 barrels , were gushing from the well .
It ruptured after an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers .

Cheers .
With the US through to the knockout stage , it seems a good time to take inventory of what 's worked so far and which parts of the machine need a good screw turn .
Bob Bradley ’s side rightfully earned a revenge shot at Ghana with their group play , but the round of 16 is different , much different , than the first round .
The opponents come harder and the game 's a do - or - die .
The Positives
Fight in the dog .
I doubt it necessary to even repeat this , but the Red , White & Blue come at you and do n't quit until the ref makes them .
There really can't be enough said about the character of Bradley 's USMNT .
Work the keeper .
As the saying goes : you can't score if you do n't shoot .
The posse of Jozy Altidore , Michael Bradley , Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan have pulled the trigger 34 times in three games .
This stat means the US are n't just getting shots ; they 're getting them to the right people .
Come from all angles .
To continue that last point , they are also mixing things up in attack .
They go wide , they charge up the gut , they go over the top .
I like it , and it has seen them get those smart shots from every possible direction .
Goalkeeper ’s do n’t know how to deal with an array of attempts such as a low driven freekick followed by a cross for a header followed by a quick ground move followed by a blast from outside .
Foul the wiser .
The US have done a terrific job thus far in generally avoiding a cardinal tourney sin : the cheap foul around the box .
Teams that give away oodles of danger freekicks do n't last long in the knockouts .
Smart alterations .
The boss ' ability to call the right names off the bench has faded in and out over the last four years , but he 's got the hot hand right now .
When games are tight at the hour ( as US World Cup matches tend to be ) , this becomes a major plus .
The Negatives
The off cocktail .
Here 's the flip side to that last item .
It might be better if the US did n’t require quite so many key second - half changes .
The starting lineup was at its most solid against England , which might mean a great deal if Ghana were an English replica .
They are n't , so the coach must go back to the lab .
Early D mistakes .
No , the US did n't concede early to Algeria , but let 's be honest , they well could have .
Whatever it takes to get the center backs to play the opening 20 like the final 70 , do that .
I wo n't act like I know what " that " is .
Ceding the way .
As noted above , they probably should have fallen behind in game three as in the two before .
Yes , we know the team can chase down a game like few other teams in recent memory .
We get it .
It 's time , though , to see them run the show .
I do n't want to wait until the next Mexico meeting for another 2 - 0 win .
I continue to believe that this squad has what it takes to control a match from whistle to whistle , but at some point they have to prove me right .
Against Ghana would be a good time for that .
( Newser ) – Probably one or two Texas jokes applies to this one : Most of the state 's lobbyists are signing up for permits to carry concealed weapons , reports the Houston Chronicle .
They 're not angry or afraid — they 're just tired of waiting in long lines at newly installed metal detectors for visitors to the Capitol .
By flashing their permit , they can walk on by .

Diet pill containing NHS anti-obesity drug is sold out in just THREE days
Capsiplex is the first diet pill to contain ingredients previously only available on the NHS
A diet pill which contains an NHS anti-obesity drug has sold out just three days after going on sale .
More than 50,000 packs of Capsiplex flew off the shelves when the product hit the high street earlier this month .
The drug made by the British pharmaecutical giant of the same name , is the first to contain ingredients previously only available on the NHS .
It includes the clinically - proven Methylcellulose , which doctors prescribe to around 10,000 dieters every year .
Capsiplex claims to increase metabolism to burn calories 12 times faster than normal .
It sold out of 50,000 packs at stores such as Harrods , Selfridges and Lloyds Pharmacy , forcing the company to order more stock to keep up with demand .
A spokesman for Capsiplex said : ' Demand has been staggering with pre-launch orders and subsequent sales far greater than we could have ever expected .
' It is a discreet tablet which enables you to effortlessly lose weight without inhibiting your lifestyle .
As we all know weight management basically comes down to making sure you do n't consume more calories than you need .
Capsiplex costs £ 29.99 for a month 's supply
' It sounds obvious but increased calorie intake , combined with an inactive lifestyle , can lead to significant weight gain but with our hectic life styles and meal times based on convenience food , it is incredibly easy to lose control and consume too many calories . '
Capsiplex launched the product on June 1st in chemists and pharmacies nationwide as well as on the manufacturer 's website .
It costs £ 29.99 for one month 's supply .
The pills contain an increased dosage of blood sugar - regulating Chromium , fat burner L - Carnitine and ' star ' ingredient Methylcellulose .
The company also produces Capsiplex Appetite Suppressant , which contains Potassium Citrate to control the body 's water balance and improve muscle function , regulating blood pressure and producing more energy .
The company claims the appetite suppressant , which is £ 24.99 a month , can effectively balance blood sugar level , increase insulin efficiency and cut out sugar cravings and hence a reduced appetite .
It said clinical trials roved over 90 per cent of participants felt satisfied with half their usual food intake .
With all the rumors , backstabbing , parties , and secret hook - ups , E3 is already kind of like High School .

Do n't expect the Devils to sign Paul Martin before the NHL free agency market begins at noon ( ET ) Thursday .
Although it is very possible Martin will eventually choose to stay with the Devils , the two sides have not been able to work out a new deal and the talented defenseman is anxious to see his market value .
" I 've spoken to Lou ( Lamoriello ) on a few different occasions , " said former Devils player Ben Hankinson , who represents Martin .
" It 's obviously been a very frustrating year for Paulie and the Devils .
There will probably be some more changes .
Time will tell if he ends up back in New Jersey .
" It 's not really that Paul wants to leave .
It 's almost like Lou with Johnny MacLean .
He took his time to see what his options were , even though Johnny Mac may have been his first choice , and then Lou made his decision . "
Hankinson said he plans to speak to Lamoriello again Wednesday .
But the two sides are not close to an agreement to avoid free agency .
" If Paulie does go to July 1 , it does n't mean he 's ruling out the Devils , " Hankinson said .
" New Jersey has been good to him .
It 's just that it was a tough year with his injury and missing the Olympics .
It was like there was a cloud over his head . "
Lamoriello was unavailable for comment .
President Obama praised lawmakers today for developing a new set of financial regulations he hopes to sign into law by July 4 .
" We are poised to pass the toughest financial reform since the ones we created in the aftermath of the Great Depression , " Obama said at the White House as he prepared to leave for the G - 20 summit in Canada .
The new rules are designed to " hold Wall Street accountable " and prevent the kind of financial meltdown that crippled the economy in 2008 , Obama said .
The package includes further restrictions on too - risky investments by banks , a new consumer protection agency to oversee the activities of credit card companies and financial firms and an end to the concept known as " too big to fail . "
This would be the second major piece of legislation to be signed by Obama this year , following the big health care overhaul that became law in March .
The administration also hopes to sign a big energy bill by the end of the year , though that is still under negotiation in Congress .
Obama , whose Democratic Party faces tough sledding in this November 's congressional elections , touted other accomplishments during his five - minute speech .
" Over the last 17 months , " he said , " we 've passed an Economic Recovery Act , health insurance reform , education reform , and we are now on the brink of passing Wall Street reform . "
House and Senate negotiators wrapped up their work on new financial regulations at 5:39 this morning .
Obama praised the " incredibly hard work " of the two key Democrats : Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , and Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn .
Global financial reform is also a topic of the G - 20 summit this weekend in Canada , Obama said .
" I 'll work with other nations not only to coordinate our financial reform efforts , but to promote global economic growth while ensuring that each nation can pursue a path that is sustainable for its own public finances , " the president said .
The president said he believes in investment and a dynamic economy , " but we 've all seen what happens when there is inadequate oversight and insufficient transparency on Wall Street . "

LONDON - The Methodist Church of Britain is on a collision course with Jewish community leaders after being accused of producing a document against Israel to debate the conflict at its annual conference in Portsmouth later this month .
The church , the fourth largest Christian denomination in Britain , is set to have a “ debate on Israel - Palestine ” then vote on whether to implement a boycott of products and services from the West Bank .
Written by group of Methodist clergy , academics and peace activists , the document , titled “ Justice for Palestine and Israel , ” has been accused of being selective and “ full of historical distortions and bias .
” The Board of Deputies of British Jews has expressed concern saying the document could damage Jewish - Methodist relations in the UK .
Board chief executive , Jon Benjamin , has written to the president of the Methodist Conference to ask for an urgent meeting .
“ This deeply disturbing paper is full of historical distortions and bias , ” Benjamin told .
“ That 's unsurprising , given that its main sources appear to be anti-Zionist campaigners .
Especially troubling is the suggestion that the Methodist Church will investigate expelling Zionists .
“ If it passes , the paper will be damaging to Jewish - Methodist relations .
We are seeking an urgent meeting with Methodist leaders to make our objections clear and to seek a resolution .
” The 54 - page document has been distributed to all Methodist churches , circuits and regions throughout the UK in order to “ resource them in their understanding of and engagement with the issues , ” the document described .
Almost all the sources used in the document are controversial .
It includes anti-Zionist and anti-Israel activists such as scholars Ilan Pappe and Avi Shlaim ; Jeff Halper from the fringe group ‘ Israeli Committee against House Demolitions ’ ; Anglican vicar Stephen Sizer and journalist Robert Fisk .
There are also testimonies from Breaking the Silence and the Ecumenical Accompaniment Program in Palestine and Israel ( EAPPI ) , a group funded and supported by the World Council of Churches , which supports the divestment campaign against Israel .
Jerusalem - based research organization NGO Monitor said EAPPI uses a biased Palestinian narrative using demonizing terms such as “ apartheid ” and “ war crimes ” to describe Israel and said that most volunteers become active in anti-Israel campaigns on returning to their hometowns .
The report says that 12 volunteers from the Methodist Church in the UK have so far volunteered with EAPPI and spoken at numerous church gatherings .
“ EAPPI members have a history of promoting anti-Israel agendas under the facade of peace , ” NGO Monitor president Prof. Gerald Steinberg said .
“ Christian groups that promote anti-Israel demonization and international isolation display a very disturbing insensitivity and fuel the conflict .
The report reflects the distortions of the World Council of Churches , Amos Trust , KAIROS , EAPPI and other groups in this one - sided and biased document .
The exclusive emphasis on " occupation " strips away the context of Palestinian terror and rejectionism for seven decades , which forced Israel to response in defense of its citizens .
“ This document entirely ignores the rights of Israelis including Gilad Schalit , who was kidnapped and held in Gaza for four years , in violation of all moral principles .
If the Methodist leaders and their allies were really concerned about justice , they would not ignore the suffering of Jewish victims of Palestinian terror , ” Steinberg added .
In the recommended reading section , the document recommends the Goldstone Report ; a 2008 report on Gaza by Christian Aid , Amnesty , Oxfam and other charities .
Apart from Herzl ’s Jewish State , other recommendations include Jimmy Carter ’s book Palestine : Peace not Apartheid and books by Fisk , Pappe and Shlaim .
“ The report is amateurish and one - dimensional in its depiction of the history of the tortuous Israel - Palestine conflict , ” said Prof.
Colin Shindler , senior lecturer in the Department of the Near and Middle East at the University of London ’s School of Oriental and African Studies .
“ Its recommended sources are highly selective - presumably to produce a narrative which would reinforce an intended outcome .
For example , in the recommended ‘ books on background history ’ , the names of Benny Morris , Anita Shapira , Martin Gilbert and Howard Sacher - all well - known historians of Israel - do not appear .
“ There is no suggested book for understanding the evolution of Zionist ideology .
No interested student of this complex conflict would treat this seriously .
While it is understandable that the Methodists would wish to alleviate the plight of the Palestinians , this skewered account will be viewed as simplistic and partial , ” Shindler added .
Among the Israeli groups the documents recommends are Machsom Watch , Women in Black , Physicians for Human Rights and Zochrot .
David Gifford , chief executive of the Council of Christians and Jews ( CCJ ) also raised his concerns with the document .
“ We all agree the Palestinians need to be heard but Methodist church has fallen into this chasm of listening to one voice , ” he told the Post .
“ It is sad that the Methodist Church ’s document is so unbalanced , appearing to completely ignore other cries of frustration , desperation and confusion .
“ A closer examination by the authors of the Methodist document , of projects of reconciliation and community and economic development in Israel and the West Bank would have revealed opportunities for investment in hope .
Instead all we are left with is a call for disinvestment again and no real solutions .
Instead we are all thrown into even greater desperation , ” he added .
Gifford said that reconciliation over “ fertilizing discontent ” was the way forward .
“ The way forward is to water the seeds of reconciliation rather than fertilize discontent by hearing one narrative and seeing only what one wants to see , ” he said .
In a statement , Rev. Graham Carter , chair of the working group that produced the report , said : “ The report is not a doctrinal statement but is designed to facilitate a stimulating and wide - ranging debate at the Methodist Conference concerning justice for Israel and Palestine .
“ We are sure that the discussion at the Methodist Conference will be open and balanced , addressing the report in a spirit of discernment and with a commitment to hearing , as well as expressing , a variety of perspectives on the issues .
Conference members will make the final decisions on the resolutions in the report following this discussion .
“ We are committed to seeking ways of achieving a lasting and just peace for all people living in the region , regardless of religious affiliation .
We remain deeply committed to working with people of all faiths and none and hope to seek a way forward that will both honour and learn from these relationships , ” Carter said .
The Chicago area Audi dealership that refused to help a customer who had his wheels stolen on their lot has finally heard the roar of thousands of Jalopnik readers and forum members .
Now he 's going to do right by him .

Jason Lee left his new Audi A4 at Schaumberg Audi last Saturday for its 5000 - mile service .
Before he could pick it up on Monday , his unapologetic service rep called to inform him the aftermarket wheels on his car were stolen and he'd have to get take care of it .
Mysteriously , the security systems that were supposed to be protecting the lot were n't working .

Given the strange circumstances surrounding the incident and the lack of proper security for his vehicle , Lee asked the dealership if they 'd consider paying his $ 500 deductible .
They refused , and when he informed them he'd seek legal counsel they told him to return his loaner car and immediately remove his wheel - less car from their lot .
Lee turned to the Audizine forum , who quickly informed other enthusiasts and Jalopnik about the incident .
When we tried to contact the dealership an employee hung up on us , but as soon as the story was posted a representative from Audi customer service and Audi USA got on the phones and Lee quickly got a response from the dealership .
" I was contacted by the general manger of [ Schaumberg Audi , " said Lee .
" We had a long conversation and he was extremely reasonable and apologetic .
He was talking to me as another Audi enthusiast and was regretful that the situation has come to this .
All in all , he promised to cut a check for $ 500 deductible and offered to let me use the loaner as long as my car is out of commission for repair . "

Whether or not you think the dealership was responsible for the vehicle , their behavior and the difficulty Lee had getting someone from Schaumberg Audi 's management to contact him was unacceptable .
It may have taken the power of the Internet for him to get a response , but the dealership 's now acting in a responsible manner .
" Thank you all for your support and I could n't have done this without you , " said Lee . " [ A ] nd huge thanks to Jalopnik and Supraforum — SFOT CREW — that have been the most active . "
Next time the cops pull you over , you might want to avoid the urge to answer calls on your iPhone if you put it in this case .

The family Ziad Julani left behind — Moira with her three daughters ; Hannah 17 , Mirage , 15 , and Yasmin 7 . ( Mel Frykberg / IPS )

“ My life only began when I met him .
I will never meet such a wonderful man again , ” Yasmin ’s mother Moira Julani tells IPS .
While it is just another statistic for the Israelis , another Palestinian family has been torn apart .
US citizens , 17 - year - old Hannah , 15 - year - old Mirage and seven - year - old Yasmin are now fatherless .
Former Texan Moira , nee Reynolds , who left the US 17 years ago to start a new life with her husband in Jerusalem , has lost her soul mate .
Two weeks ago 41 - year - old Ziad Julani from East Jerusalem was shot a number of times at close range in the head and abdomen by Israeli special forces as he lay wounded on his stomach on the ground .
An ambulance took the critically injured man to hospital but he died shortly afterwards .
Israeli soldiers accused Ziad of deliberately trying to run over a couple of soldiers as they walked in the street .
Eyewitnesses , however , say that Julani ’s car accidentally swerved slightly when his windscreen was hit by a rock , after he unknowingly drove into the middle of a clash between stone - throwing Palestinian youngsters and Israeli soldiers .
Two soldiers , who were slightly injured , and two of their comrades opened fire on Julani ’s car , wounding him in the shoulder .
The panicked Julani drove a short distance further until he reached a dead - end road .
According to testimony compiled by the Jerusalem Centre for Social and Economic Rights , Julani then got out of his car .
He was shot again several times by four special forces police who had pursued him , before he collapsed to the ground .
One of the policemen then came up and shot the critically wounded man again at close range in both sides of the head and in the abdomen before kicking him .
Witnesses who tried to help Julani were beaten back with clubs , with one requiring 20 stitches to his head .
Other bystanders were wounded , including a five - year - old girl , when police and soldiers sprayed onlookers with rubber - coated steel bullets .
The Israeli authorities accused Ziad of attempting to perpetrate a “ terrorist attack ” and of having a “ criminal record . ”
“ Ziad was roughed up about a month ago by Israeli soldiers as he tried to pray at Jerusalem ’s Al - Aqsa Mosque .
He was held temporarily for a couple of hours , then released , and no charges were laid .
Maybe one of these soldiers had a grudge against my husband , ” Julani tells IPS .
“ He was not involved in politics and was not affiliated with any political group .
He was a peaceful man with a cosmopolitan background who had lived in Switzerland as a child and studied pharmaceuticals in the US . ”
“ On the morning he was killed he had gone to pray at al - Aqsa and had planned to later take the family out on a trip to the Dead Sea . ”
Occupied East Jerusalem has become a boiling cauldron of anger and resentment as Israel ’s Judaization of the eastern part of the city increasingly involves the destruction of Palestinian homes , and throwing Palestinian families on to the street to make way for illegal Israeli settlers .
In the rising tension several Palestinians have carried out attacks on Israelis in West Jerusalem using vehicles and bulldozers , killing several and wounding others .
The Israeli authorities have used these incidents to assert “ self - defense ” in the increasing numbers of cases where unarmed Palestinians have been shot dead by security forces at close range despite presenting no threat .
At the beginning of the year a media blackout was imposed on the house arrest of Israeli journalist Anat Kamm after she secretly copied Israeli army documents while she was doing her military service .
The documents outlined how Israeli hit squads were assassinating Palestinian activists , some of them unarmed , instead of arresting them , in flagrant violation of an Israeli high court ruling .
Kamm has been accused of treason .
IPS has reported a number of cases in which young Palestinian men in the West Bank died after they were shot in the back and in the head .
The Israeli army initially claimed they had used non-lethal ammunition , and had acted in “ self - defense ” after they were “ attacked . ”
Later , however , army investigations conceded that live fire was used and that in some of the cases the soldiers involved had used “ excessive force . ”
Turkish autopsies carried out on the nine activists shot dead on the Mavi Marmara as it tried to deliver aid to Gaza several weeks ago also indicate that a number of the dead were shot several times in the head at close range as part of Israel ’s “ confirm kill ” policy .
The Israeli security forces have become accustomed to impunity when it comes to the killing of Palestinians under dubious circumstances .
“ We are asking for an independent investigation into my husband ’s killing .
We do n’t want the Israeli security forces investigating themselves , ” says Julani .
Since the shooting of Ziad Israeli security officials have arrested witnesses who filmed the killing and confiscated their recording equipment .
Street camera footage has been removed .

Children with autism have a different chemical fingerprint in their urine than non-autistic children , according to new research published tomorrow in the print edition of the Journal of Proteome Research .
The researchers behind the study , from Imperial College London and the University of South Australia , suggest that their findings could ultimately lead to a simple urine test to determine whether or not a young child has autism .
Autism affects an estimated one in every 100 people in the UK .
People with autism have a range of different symptoms , but they commonly experience problems with communication and social skills , such as understanding other people ’s emotions and making conversation and eye contact .
People with autism are also known to suffer from gastrointestinal disorders and they have a different makeup of bacteria in their guts from non-autistic people .
Today ’s research shows that it is possible to distinguish between autistic and non-autistic children by looking at the by - products of gut bacteria and the body ’s metabolic processes in the children ’s urine .
The exact biological significance of gastrointestinal disorders in the development of autism is unknown .
The distinctive urinary metabolic fingerprint for autism identified in today ’s study could form the basis of a non-invasive test that might help diagnose autism earlier .
This would enable autistic children to receive assistance , such as advanced behavioural therapy , earlier in their development than is currently possible .
At present , children are assessed for autism through a lengthy process involving a range of tests that explore the child ’s social interaction , communication and imaginative skills .
Early intervention can greatly improve the progress of children with autism but it is currently difficult to establish a firm diagnosis when children are under 18 months of age , although it is likely that changes may occur much earlier than this .
The researchers suggest that their new understanding of the makeup of bacteria in autistic children ’s guts could also help scientists to develop treatments to tackle autistic people ’s gastrointestinal problems .
Professor Jeremy Nicholson , the corresponding author of the study , who is the Head of the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London , said : “ Autism is a condition that affects a person ’s social skills , so at first it might seem strange that there ’s a relationship between autism and what ’s happening in someone ’s gut .
However , your metabolism and the makeup of your gut bacteria reflect all sorts of things , including your lifestyle and your genes .
Autism affects many different parts of a person ’s system and our study shows that you can see how it disrupts their system by looking at their metabolism and their gut bacteria .
“ We hope our findings might be the first step towards creating a simple urine test to diagnose autism at a really young age , although this is a long way off – such a test could take many years to develop and we ’re just beginning to explore the possibilities .
We know that giving therapy to children with autism when they are very young can make a huge difference to their progress .
A urine test might enable professionals to quickly identify children with autism and help them early on , ” he added .
The researchers are now keen to investigate whether metabolic differences in people with autism are related to the causes of the condition or are a consequence of its progression .
The researchers reached their conclusions by using H NMR Spectroscopy to analyse the urine of three groups of children aged between 3 and 9 : 39 children who had previously been diagnosed with autism , 28 non-autistic siblings of children with autism , and 34 children who did not have autism who did not have an autistic sibling .
They found that each of the three groups had a distinct chemical fingerprint .
Non-autistic children with autistic siblings had a different chemical fingerprint than those without any autistic siblings , and autistic children had a different chemical fingerprint than the other two groups .
First - time buyers purchased 46 % of existing home sales in May , down from 49 % in April .
We all knew that first - time home buyers activity was going to fade after the tax credit expired .
But there was not much of a way to quantify exactly what the impact would be beforehand .
We could wait for subsequent monthly sales data to reflect that weakness — but that is hardly much of a solution .
Enter the Campbell / Inside Mortgage Finance Monthly Survey of Real Estate Market Conditions , a proprietary survey of 1,500 real estate agents nationwide .
The results of the first survey are out , and not surprisingly , it indicates that first - time “ homebuyer traffic dropped sharply in May .
This drop implies fewer signed contracts in June and fewer closed transactions in July and August . ”

Given its fiscal condition , one would n’t imagine California could afford its own own first - time home buyers tax break , but somehow , they came up with one .
California enacted its own $ 10,000 credit on May 1 — the day after the federal tax credit expired .
Not surprisingly , Cali fared better than the rest country in terms of first - time home buyer activity .
As the chart below shows , California ’s first - time homebuyer traffic did much better than the rest of the nation :

Home buyer Traffic Tumbled in May as First - Time Shopping Stalled ( PDF )
When architect Bill Peterson and development partner Carol Swedlow bought this sixteen - foot - wide brownstone on East 14th Street in 2004 , it had one tenant — a ground - floor check - cashing joint — and the upper stories had been vacant for decades .
Their plan was to turn it into four condominium units , with a penthouse for Swedlow .
Peterson was determined not to make the brownstone look , on the one hand , like a “ shallow revival , ” or , on the other , too drastically modern .
Why could n’t it have old qualities , but exploit new technology ?
“ I started thinking of ways to reinterpret the building using high - performance versions of the original materials , ” Peterson says .
The result : an 1869 brownstone , its guts torn out and replaced with thoroughly modern systems and surfaces ; its décor a combination of updated Victoriana and punkish East Village nostalgia ; and its second - floor brownstone façade a movable plane that slowly tilts inward to reveal a white - box living room , with a careful arrangement of modern furniture ( Knoll , Mies van der Rohe ) tweaked to reference the past ( velvet , fringe ) .
This is a house with surprises .
Peterson , who dresses preppily and attacks design problems with the alacrity of a scientist , imagined the brownstone tilting back and up like a garage door , updating the traditional parlor - level balcony into a 21st - century porch .
Of course , the reality was somewhat trickier than the vision .
The architect went to Stone Panels in Coppell , Texas , to source ultralight brownstone , which weighs three and a half pounds per square foot rather than 60 .
A thin veneer of real stone is bonded to a three - quarter - inch aluminum honeycomb , and the resulting blocks can be used like quarried rock .
The hardware on the moving wall is custom , and McLaren Engineering Group , the firm Peterson eventually hired , also works for Cirque du Soleil .
“ These guys were like magicians , ” he says .
His next innovation was on the street level , where he took inspiration from the rusticated bases of palazzi , rough - hewn stone that typically ends after the ground floor .
He traced the pattern on a brownstone of the same vintage a few streets over , and rendered it into a computer drawing .
Cherokee Porcelain Enamel , a Tennessee firm that also makes graffiti - proof signs for the MTA , cut the pattern out of sheets of iron and then baked it with a porcelain finish .
The resulting screen offers privacy at ground level ( it is a busy commercial block ) and creates a dappled light on the interior .
Inside , Peterson and his team ( Mark Castellani , Miki Sawayama , Miwa Tanaka , Hiromi Watatani , and contractor ABR Construction ) thought up more mergers of past and present .
The interiors are spare , with glass - finish concrete floors and white plaster walls , but include nods to Victoriana .
The bedroom walls are upholstered , but with silvery acoustical blankets .
John James Audubon ’s 1840 Birds of America was mined for images : A bluebird , the official avian of New York State , appears as a decal on the bathroom sink .
It ’s just one more small surprise in a building that ’s loaded with them .

Living Room
A pair of buffers keeps the outside and inside environments separate .
The first , a 42 - inch - high railing of ultraclear glass , acts as a safety barrier .
The second , an “ air curtain wall system ” that shoots air from the ceiling at high velocity , creates a thermal barrier and bug screen .

Living Room
The garage - door - like façade has sensors on the sides and bottom ” it will stop moving if it encounters an obstacle .
It ’s activated by keying a control panel hidden in the closet .
To go from opened to closed , or vice versa , takes only a few minutes .
The triplex ’s interiors reference both the Victorians and the velvet - suited punks of the neighborhood ’s past .
Peterson upholstered the Knoll couch in Brunschwig & Fils purple mohair velvet .
The chairs are vintage bentwood Thonet and the coffee table is by Mies van der Rohe .

Bedroom
Peterson went wild with the quilted theme , decorating with padded acoustical blankets on the walls and a vintage quilt on the bed .
A Marcel Wanders for Moooi cube sits at the foot of the bed in place of a traditional crocheted coverlet .
On the walls are framed T - shirts worn by bartenders at Fillmore East and Max ’s Kansas City , once nearby haunts .
The red phone adds a playful shot of color .
To open up the second - floor bedroom to sunlight , the builder first had to break through layers of old brick and stucco .

Kitchen
The dining area at the back of the ground floor can also switch from indoor to outdoor spaces on command .
Peterson found an off - the - shelf garage door to install here .
The counters are porcelain enamel , the same material used on the building ’s lower front façade .
Peterson fashioned a farmhouse table out of a wood door and orange metal sawhorses .
The chairs on the wall are the same as those in Bryant Park , and can be easily taken down and set up in the yard .
The stovetop is Viking ; and the faucet is an Arne Jacobsen design for Vola .
The overhead lamp is a reissue of a Jean Prouvé design ( sold at Design Within Reach ) .
Yard
For ease of maintenance , Peterson chose to carpet the small backyard in artificial turf .
The stairs lead down to the cellar , which gets some daylight .
The concrete cabana at the back of the yard provides shaded seating , along with privacy for the wide - open kitchen .
“ There ’s lots of uncertainty , ” said Charles R. Fisher , a professor of biology at Pennsylvania State University , who is leading a federal study of the dark habitats and who observed the nearby community .
“ Our best hope is that the impact is neutral or a minor problem . ”
A few scientists say the gushing oil — despite its clear harm to pelicans , turtles and other forms of coastal life — might ultimately represent a subtle boon to the creatures of the cold seeps and even to the wider food chain .
“ The gulf is such a great fishery because it ’s fed organic matter from oil , ” said Roger Sassen , a specialist on the cold seeps who recently retired from Texas A&M University .
“ It ’s preadapted to crude oil .
The image of this spill being a complete disaster is not true . ”
His stance seems to be a minority view .
Over roughly two decades , the federal government has spent at least $ 30 million uncovering and investigating the creatures of the cold seeps , a fair amount of money for basic ocean research .
Washington has provided this money in an effort to ensure that oil development does no harm to the unusual ecosystems .
Now , the nation ’s worst oil spill at sea — with tens of millions of gallons spewing to date — has thrown that goal into doubt .
The agency behind the exploration and surveying of the cold seeps is none other than the much - criticized Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior — not its oil regulators but a separate environmental arm , which long ago began hiring oceanographers , geologists , ecologists and marine biologists to investigate the gulf seabed and eventually pushed through regulations meant to protect the newly discovered ecosystems .
The minerals service is joining with other federal agencies to study whether the BP spill is harming the dark habitats .
Scientists say ships may go to sea as soon as July , sending tethered robots down to the icy seabed to examine the seep communities and take samples for analysis .
It is a bittersweet moment for scientists like Dr. MacDonald of Florida State University , who has devoted his career to documenting the ecosystem ’s richness and complexity .
In an interview , he said the sheer difficulty of trying to fathom the ecological impacts of the spill had left some of his colleagues dejected .

A group of undocumented students and their advocates on Monday launched a round - the - clock vigil outside the Massachusetts State House in protest of a state Senate budget amendment calling for stricter measures aimed at illegal immigrants .
Holding signs and placing candles along the State House steps , members of The Student Immigrant Movement vowed to sleep under the shadow of the building — through bad weather and the threat of arrest — until the Senate withdraws the amendment or Gov. Deval Patrick vetoes it .
Andres Del Castillo , 19 , of Boston , said the students had no choice but to stage a civil disobedience protest against a measure that he said would discriminate against Latinos and other immigrant groups .
" This law is actually allowing the public to racially profile , " said Del Castillo , a Suffolk University student who was born in Massachusetts .
" This is going to create ... an unsafe community where I 'm not going to trust my neighbor because I think he might call immigration on me . "
The measure , passed in the Senate last month by a 28 - 10 vote , would require companies doing business with the state to verify their workers are in the country legally .
It also would create a toll - free phone number to report suspected illegal immigrant workers and bar children of illegal immigrants from obtaining the same in - state tuition rates to public colleges as legal Massachusetts residents .
Supporters say the measure would help curtail illegal immigration to Massachusetts and save taxpayer money , although no senator could show how it would cut costs .
Still , Democratic Sen. Steve Baddour , who backed the measure after pressure from Senate Republicans , called the passage a bipartisan compromise .
The measure still must survive budget negotiations between the Senate and the House .
The House narrowly rejected a similar amendment .
Patrick has not said whether he 'd line - item veto the measure if it came to his desk .
" If he signs this , he might as well put himself out there as the next Brewer , " said Del Castillo , referring to Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer who recently signed a controversial immigration law that has drawn nationwide protest .
Bianca Kreiling , 20 , also a Suffolk University student , said the student protesters have sleeping bags and supplies needed for days .
She said other advocacy groups have promised donations of supplies and money .
Six students were scheduled to spend Tuesday night on the State House steps and more are planning to camp out in the coming nights , student said .
" We 'll be here for as long as it takes , " said Kreiling .
The very first federal admissibility hearing for fMRI lie-detection evidence wrapped up May 14 in a Tennessee court room .
The decision , expected in a couple weeks , could have a significant influence on the direction that brain scan evidence takes in the courtroom .
A special session was held to determine whether brain scans that were generated by the company Cephos could be entered as evidence in the federal court case of Lorne Semrau , whom the government has accused of defrauding Medicare and Medicaid .
FMRI brain scan evidence has yet to be admitted for lie detection in court , and this case is the most serious consideration yet of the technique in an American court .
" It 's in some ways a potentially watershed moment , " said Owen Jones , a professor of law and biological sciences at Vanderbilt University , one of the few hearing observers in the nearly empty court room .
" I had the sense throughout that , whichever this court decides , this was going to be a significant moment . "
In federal court , the admissibility of scientific evidence is governed by the Daubert standard , first established in the early 1990s .
To be entered into the record , scientific evidence has to be empirically testable , subjected to peer review , have a calculable error rate , and be generally accepted by a relevant scientific community .
Through a pretrial hearing , a judge decides whether the evidence offered meets these criteria .
In the Semrau case , Steven Laken , CEO of Cephos , is the expert witness whom the defense would use to bring in the brain scan evidence .
He testified at the Daubert hearing on May 13 and 14 .
He was followed by plaintiff 's witnesses ' Marcus Raichle , a neuroscientist at Washington University in St. Louis , and Peter Imrey , a biostatistician at the Cleveland Clinic .
A transcript will likely become available , but in the meantime , Wired.com spoke with Jones , who is also the incoming director of the MacArthur Foundation Law and Neuroscience Project .
Wired.com :
What was the tack the defense took in making its case ?
__Owen __Jones :
Their basic effort was devoted to demonstrating two things .
First , that fMRI technology itself is sound , and second , that this specific application of fMRI to lie detection is sound and scientifically credible .
There was much discussion of publications .
Through Laken , the defense walked the judge through understanding a bit about how the technology worked and how the test was administered and why some people in the lie-detection community consider this technique to be scientifically valid .
Wired.com :
What points did the prosecution focus on in cross-examination ?
Jones :
They focused on the fact that this would be the first case in which fMRI brain scan evidence like this would be admitted .
Reference was made to the recent Brooklyn case , where it was not admitted .
And there was some discussion about the extent to which Cephos stands to gain financially if this technique becomes widely acceptable .
One of the things highlighted was the seeming inconsistency between some scans Cephos did of Semrau , some of which suggested that he was lying and some of which suggested that he was telling the truth .
There was much discussion on Laken 's basis for discounting the scan session in which the conclusion was that the defendant was lying .
Laken discounted the evidence because of the alleged fatigue of the defendant .
There was discussion on cross on general ecological validity , which means the degree to which real - world situations conform to the experiments done in the laboratory .
The prosecution pointed out that there was a long duration between the event in question and the scan itself , roughly six to eight years .
There was also much discussion about the difference in age between the defendant and the maximum and also median ages of subjects in published research studies .
Semrau is 63 or 64 , and in prior studies the oldest subjects were 50 .
Certainly there was a lot of discussion about the alleged accuracy rates of the technology .
And that 's obviously one of the important factors in the Daubert standard .
The scientific expert is claiming that they have 100 percent accuracy at finding liars .
There was also discussion about the nature of the questions administered .
Some of the questions were short .
Some were long .
Some were highly detailed .
Others were quite general .
So , there were questions about the methodology of the test and whether it was sound .
There was also a heavy emphasis on the extent to which the published studies do not have subjects for whom there are real and significant consequences for failing the truth verification tests .
That very specifically raises the question about whether the published studies are at all relevant to this particular case .
Wired.com : What was Laken 's response ?
Jones :
My recollection is that Dr. Laken pointed out , as did the defense attorney , that no tests are perfect , and it is very difficult to imagine a realistic scenario in which one could study in a scientifically controlled way people who have very large stakes in the outcomes of their testimony .
Laken 's argument was , in part , that there is no present reason to believe that the areas of the brain involved in [ lie detection ] are meaningfully different if one does or does not have high stakes involved in the issue .
Wired.com :
In the recent Brooklyn case , an attorney successfully had fMRI evidence excluded arguing that it was the fundamental right of juries to decide the credibility of witnesses , so machine lie detection should always be excluded .
Did the lawyers in this case raise that point ?
Jones :
Well , the issue is not so much whether machine lie detection should always be excluded .
It ’s whether there ’s any sound scientific reason to think that a machine is more reliable at discovering lies than a member of the jury .
The legal system tries to let the jury be the arbiter of what is and is not true – and that will still be true , ordinarily , even if the brain - scan evidence is admitted .
A jury could choose to disregard it , or adopt the interpretation of the opposing party .
The Daubert standard requires the judges to be gatekeepers of the quality of information that reaches the jury .
One of things you see here is that the prosecution will analogize the fMRI to discredited polygraphy and the defense will analogize fMRI lie-detection to widely accepted DNA forensic tests .
Wired.com :
The prosecution , which is trying to exclude the fMRI evidence , called Marcus Raichle and Peter Imrey , a neuroscientist and statistician , respectively .
Jones : Raichle is an extremely distinguished neuroscientist and is considered to be among the founders of functional brain imaging generally .
[ I should acknowledge both he and Imrey are colleagues of mine , within the Law and Neuroscience Project . ]
He testified about the extent to which fMRI had not been adequately tested in real world contexts .
He testified that in his view the peer review and publication prong of Daubert – particularly with respect to the difference between group averaged studies and claims about individual states of truthtelling or lying – was not sufficiently satisfied .
And with respect to general acceptance , Raichle offered compelling evidence that although there were consistencies in the findings , they were not necessarily applicable to lie detection in a particular case .
The cross examination focused on the extent to which fMRI is generally accepted .
Imrey gave a masterful overview of biostatistics as applied to the lie detection context .
And basically encouraged the court to think about the extent to which the relevant question was whether or not this lie detection technique as used by Cephos is sufficiently valid .
In his view , it suffered many statistical failings including selection bias , measurement bias , confounding and chance .
He emphasized the extent to which the error rate was not sufficiently known for the court to conclude that the testimony was admissible .
There was much discussion of the extent to which Dr. Laken may be overinterpreting the statistics
Wired.com :
After the prosecution 's witnesses , Laken got recalled on Friday .
Were there any fireworks there ?
Jones :
In much of this part of the testimony , Dr. Laken described why he did not believe his study was vulnerable to the criticisms that Dr. Imrey and Raichle had leveled at it .
There were many technical statistical points to which he and Dr. Imrey obviously disagree .
For example , he believes that the sample sizes in the relevant studies were enough and that the individual in appropriate circumstances can serve as his own control for both lying and truth telling .
In that respect , it ’s important to mention that Dr. Semrau had been asked to answer each of the questions in both the affirmative and in the negative .
Wired.com :
Now that the hearing is over and we expect a ruling within a couple of weeks , do you have any impressions about who might win the motion ?
I ’m asking explicitly for your opinion here as a professor of both law and biology .
Jones : Both sides presented strong cases and strong testimony .
The defense expert was very polished and thorough .
The prosecution experts were very knowledgeable and specific .
Both sides presented the judge with a great deal of relevant evidence .
At the end of the day , the government will probably win the recommendation to exclude this evidence .
This is in part because it is probably the case that fMRI lie detection is , though promising , insufficiently sound at present to pass the Daubert admissibility test .
It is also relevant to consider that if this evidence were admitted for this purpose , it would be the first known time in the United States that the jury would hear fMRI lie-detection evidence .
The significance of that is that courts tend to move slowly with respect to new technologies .
Wired.com : Does fMRI brain scan evidence getting its first Daubert hearing say anything about the state of the technology ?
Jones :
The fact that this court chose to hold a Daubert hearing has no precedential value with regard to other courts .
What is significant about this case is that whichever way the recommendation comes out , there is likely to be more litigation both in this case and future cases over the admissibility of fMRI lie detection .
If it ’s admitted , it has some persuasive , though not precedential value for other judges .
If it is not admitted the reasons will be specified and those attempting to perform more studies of fMRI lie detection and to have it admitted in the future will have a bit of a roadmap of what to do to increase the chances of getting it in .
Wired.com :
Is there anything special about the way the defense is trying to use fMRI in this case ?
Jones :
One of the things about this case that has gone undernoticed is that even though fMRI lie detection has not yet been admitted , the purposes for which people are seeking to admit it are already rapidly evolving .
In this case , the defense is not attempting to introduce fMRI lie detection for purposes of verifying what was at some past time an external state of the world as , for example , when a hypothetical defendant says he was in his house at the time of the alleged murder .
That would be a natural context to use lie detection .
You ’d ask , “ Were you home ?
Are you lying ? ”
In this case , the defense is taking it to the meta - level .
They are using a scan as evidence of a person ’s prior state of mind .
What ’s at issue is whether the defendant knowingly and willfully did what he did .
The defense is therefore attempting to offer fMRI to demonstrate his past state of mind .
The report actually says , “ Doctor Semrau ’s brain indicates he is telling the truth in regards to not cheating or defrauding the government . ”
It means that the defense is attempting to introduce evidence of the brain ’s current assessment of the brain ’s former mental state .
That ’s one of the things that makes it tricky .
He ’s trying to have his brain testify as to the prior state of his brain .
For fMRI to have already reached that level of complexity in the first case in which there has been a Daubert hearing gives some indication of how much more future litigation there is likely to be in this arena .

Sexting , sending nude or inappropriate pictures via cell phone or e-mail , would be a misdemeanor for teenagers under a plan approved by the state House today .
The House voted to sign off on the plan by state Rep. Seth Grove , R- York , 163 - 36 .
The bill now heads to the state Senate .
Grove said his proposal allows district attorneys to charge teens ages 13 to 17 who " sext " with a summary offense or second - degree misdemeanor rather than charge the teen with a felony under child pornography laws .
He also said the bill aims to keep inappropriate images out of the hands of child predators .
" We cannot assume that sexting is normal expression of adolescent sexuality , " Grove said .
Opponents of the measure said even a misdemeanor was too serious an offense for a teen who uses poor judgment or sends an image to a boyfriend or girlfriend in confidence .
" This is a parental problem ...
This is a family problem .
This is a moral problem , " said state Rep. Kathy Manderino , D - Philadelphia .
" This should not be made a criminal problem .
" This all starts with a consensual activity that gets out of control .
I 'm sorry if it gets out of control , but there are other sexual acts that children get involved with that get out of control that are not a crime , " Manderino said .
Liaisons dangereuses ?
EVER since Charles de Gaulle called for the launch of Le Monde , first published in 1944 , to replace Le Temps , a once prestigious daily tainted by collaboration with German invaders , the paper has prided itself on its independence .
Uniquely among leading newspapers , its journalists control it , and have the right to veto the choice not only of editor but also of the company 's chief executive .
But the lossmaking firm has just a few months to avert bankruptcy by finding fresh capital — and the price may be the abolition of the writers ' powers .
Three groups are still in the running to take a majority stake in Le Monde SA , the owner of Le Monde , Télérama ( a weekly television - listings magazine ) and other publications .
At the top of the list is a consortium of Xavier Niel , a telecoms mogul , Pierre Bergé , the former business partner of Yves Saint Laurent , and Matthieu Pigasse , the local boss of Lazard , an investment bank .
Other possible contenders are Claude Perdriel , owner of a weekly paper , Le Nouvel Observateur ; and Prisa , a Spanish media group which already owns a 15 % stake in Le Monde SA .
L'Espresso , an Italian media group , and Ringier , a Swiss one , this week said they would not enter the bidding despite initial expressions of interest .
On June 14th shareholders will vote on any formal offers received .
The management of Le Monde SA says the number of interested parties points to the group 's strong prospects as France 's most respected media brand .
But potential bidders may be having second thoughts after looking at the accounts , according to people close to the firm .
It has nearly € 100 m ( $ 120 m ) of debt , € 25 m of which comes due in 2011 .
Management says that € 60 m - 70 m is required to reduce this burden and put the firm on a footing for growth .
But others , pointing to ongoing losses , including more than € 10 m in 2009 , reckon the firm needs as much as € 100 m - 150 m .
Only one or two offers may come in , with the group led by Mr Niel reckoned to have the deepest pockets .
Blame for Le Monde 's situation rests chiefly with its journalists , businesspeople argue .
The firm racked up debts in the late 1990s and early 2000s with a series of acquisitions designed to create a broader media group around the flagship paper .
But it was not profitable enough to sustain the expansion , mainly because the editorial staff resisted moves to improve efficiency .
“ Unlike the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal ” , says Philippe Micouleau , the ex-boss of La Tribune , a business daily , “ neither the current nor the former management of Le Monde SA have been able to implement radical restructuring plans because of strong internal resistance . ”
Raising € 60 m or more of new capital will mean that the internal shareholders which control Le Monde SA — notably the journalists ' association — will have their control diluted .
It is still just possible , some people reckon , that the journalists will refuse to cede power , forcing the group to seek bankruptcy protection .
Otherwise they will try to hang on to some trappings of independence , such as their veto over the editor .
If other bidders pull out by June 14th , however , the rescuer will have more power to dictate terms .
A new backer would certainly insist on full commercial freedom to break with the lossmaking past .
Le Monde looks likely to join a number of other French newspapers controlled by corporate interests , such as Le Figaro , owned by Serge Dassault , owner of Dassault Aviation , and Les Echos , controlled by Bernard Arnault , chief executive of LVMH , a luxury - goods firm .
Until now , for France 's media establishment , that had been unthinkable .

PENALTY charges imposed on consumers in the depths of the financial crisis contributed to a record $ 12.7 billion fees bonanza enjoyed by Australia 's banks in the last financial year .
As the sagging economy left many Australians in tough circumstances , the banks managed to extract an extra 9 per cent in fee income from consumers and businesses in the 12 months to June 30 last year .
Reserve Bank data released yesterday showed fees charged to households rose by 3 per cent to $ 5 billion .
Businesses were hit harder , with a 13 per cent jump in non-interest fees to $ 7.7 billion over the same period .
The Australian Bankers Association calculated that the fees charged to households represented $ 11.50 each week paid by every Australian household .
About $ 1.2 billion of the total - or about $ 1 in every $ 10 in bank charges - was accounted for by penalty fees , a figure little changed from the previous year .

Keanu Reeves :
The three billion dollar man
Who can earn $ 100 m a job ...
Make films that gross $ 740 m ...
Give away $ 100 m to his film crew ...
And strip and fix his own motorcyles ?
Keanu Reeves can ...
The New York Ritz - Carlton ’s most luxurious suite is on the 15th floor .
It affords a magnificent view of Manhattan , as one of the world ’s highest - paid actors has just found out .
A wail of police sirens has drawn him to the floor - length window .
While I wait in a ridiculously ornate rococo chair , he swings a Starbucks coffee cup from his fingers and presses his face to the glass .
Scroll down below for The Day The Earth Stood Still trailer ...
He looks a lot younger than 44 .
His hair is jet black , gelled and sticking up in spikes .
He ’s over 6ft and has broad , muscular shoulders , but seems to be doing his utmost to disguise his handsome – even beautiful – face .
He arrived without entourage , unshaven and dressed in ripped jeans , scuffed brown biker boots , black T - shirt and black blazer .
The boots , incongruous in our plush surroundings , are no pose , but a symbol of Reeves ’s ‘ vagabond ’ spirit .
Despite his wealth , Reeves has only just bought his first house , having lived in hotels and on - set trailers for much of his life .
He ’d been talking about life on the highway before the sirens interrupted him .
As
they fade , he picks up the thread .
‘ I love riding through Los Angeles on my own , with the wind , the sound … ’
He imitates the twin-piston noise of a Norton motorbike engine .
‘ And then there are the aesthetics , the beauty of the motorcycle and the smell of a hot Norton , the oil oozing out – it ’s fantastic .
' I have a 1973 Norton Commando 850 Mk II Roadster with an Interstate tank on it and raised compression .
It ’s got rear sets ( pedals ) and a front fork stabiliser .
‘ I am also very fortunate to have a 1972 Norton Combat Commando and a 1969 Fastback with some period engine modifications – a camshaft and slightly raised compression again , which keeps things reliable , and a Manx fender on the front .
‘ There ’s a helmet law in California , but for years I would n’t wear one .
I crashed a few times .
Once , a car pulled a U - turn in front of me , did n’t see me coming and I could n’t get out of the way .
That one ’s responsible for my fake teeth . ’
He bares a perfect set of incisors .
‘ I sheared some skin off my right shin and I have a scar on my stomach from running into the hillside when I took a turn a little too fast . ’
He shows me the battle scars .
‘ I ’ve ruptured my spleen , I ’ve broken my ankle and I ’ve got a couple of scars on my knees … ’
I point to the scar above his mouth .
‘ Oh , yeah – that ’s when my tooth went through my upper lip , ’ he says .
‘ You go faster when you ’re younger , but I wo n’t give up .
I love it . ’
Not only is Reeves unfazed by these injuries ; they seem as meaningful to him as anything he ’s achieved in his 20 years in Hollywood .
This is more significant when you consider the sheer extent of his success as an actor : in dollar terms , he ’s one of the biggest and safest bankers in the business , as effective at garnering profits for his films as Pitt , Clooney , Cruise or DiCaprio .
It ’s estimated that in total his films have grossed a staggering $ 3 billion – the Matrix series made $ 1.7 billion , with The Matrix Reloaded alone pulling in $ 740 million .
Which explains how , after the series was filmed , he could afford to share $ 100 million of his earnings with the costume and special - effects teams .
Reeves made his name with the cult Bill & Ted slacker comedies and followed up with the art - house classic My Own Private Idaho , co-starring his friend River Phoenix , who died of a drug overdose in 1993 .
Next he appeared in the adrenaline - charged hit Point Break and Bernardo Bertolucci ’s Little Buddha .
After the 1994 action blockbuster Speed he was hailed as the new action hero – yet he turned down Speed 2 .
‘ I do n’t want to keep doing the same things over and over again , ’ he says .
‘ What ’s the point ? ’
It ’s an attitude more suited to a drifter than an A - list actor .
Keanu with his Harley - Davidson Dyna Wide Glide
Some critics have questioned Reeves ’s acting ability , accusing him of getting by on good looks and luck .
It ’s true he does n’t bring the same intensity to a role as , say , Robert De Niro – but perhaps that ’s the secret of his success .
Reeves is a blank page , blowing in and out of movies , his Midas touch enabling him to earn pay cheques that dwarf those of his more ‘ actorly ’ peers .
What ’s even more ironic is that Reeves does seem genuinely uninterested in money and is known to donate a large proportion of his income to charity .
Could this self - confessed nomad in fact be one of the most astute actors of his generation ?
Reeves has never married and remains extremely reticent about his private life ( just before this interview , he was asked at a media junket if he was currently dating ; he roared with anguish , pulled his hands over his face and shouted , ‘ Aargh !
I am not going there !’ ) .
He ’s never played much of a publicity game and admits that he finds the media difficult to deal with .
This alienation gives the impression that there ’s something other - worldly about Reeves – which is apt , as we ’re here to discuss his new sci- fi film , The Day The Earth Stood Still , a $ 100 million remake of the 1951 classic .
In this version , Reeves plays Klaatu , an alien who arrives on Earth with a warning to humanity to end its constant fighting or face annihilation .
With a stunning CGI recreation of robot Gort and co-starring Jennifer Connelly , the film should be one of the biggest blockbusters of the Christmas season .
‘ I loved the original Michael Rennie film , ’ he says .
‘ I remember seeing it first when I was 14 on a black - and - white television .
It ’s a cautionary tale .
It ’s about our apocalyptic tendencies : man ’s extinction impulse .
Klaatu is trying to get an international summit together and it ’s not happening .
' He ’s thinking , “ I can wipe you out and yet you ca n’t sit at the same table .
How self - centred are you ? ”
The film is also about human nature , the fact that it ’s only when our backs are against the wall that we do anything to change . ’
Sci-fi is the only genre Reeves works in consistently .
As well as the Matrix films , he also appeared in Johnny Mnemonic , Chain Reaction and A Scanner Darkly .
‘ I used to escape into another world as a kid , ’ he says .
‘ I built spaceships .
It was that whole idea of getting out of my own circumstances , a fascination with distant planets , unknown mysteries , going wherever the imagination could go .
I loved Star
Wars , 2001 : A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner . ’
He pauses and adds , quite without pretension , ‘ In Jungian terms , it ’s all about adventure and the heroic archetypes .
In Freudian terms , it ’s all about swords .
And mothers and fathers . ’
Reeves laughs at his own attempt at pop psychology .
But he ’s not showing off .
Our interview is littered with references to his wide - ranging reading : he ’s just finished Proust ’s A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu , talks at length about Updike ’s Rabbit novels and refers at one stage to his ‘ spatial conceptual predilection ’ .
It makes sense that escapism appealed to Reeves from an early age .
He was born in Beirut to a British mother , Patricia , who was a casino showgirl .
She married his Chinese - Hawaiian father , Samuel Nowlin Reeves , who abandoned the family a few years later ( Reeves has two younger sisters ) .
I 've crashed a few times , ruptured my spleen - but I wo n't give up
After years travelling around the world with her children , Patricia eventually settled in Toronto , where she became a successful costume designer .
Reeves and his sisters had a succession of stepfathers while growing up , but the actor is still estranged from his natural father .
Reeves left home at 17 and headed for Hollywood three years later .
‘ I got a green card , jumped in my car , drove across the border from Canada and came to LA , ’ he says .
‘ I had some speakers in boxes in the back .
If I was with
a girl , I ’d take out the speakers and put them on the roof so we could dance .
I ’d throw camping equipment in the back and go off for weekends .
' I stayed with my stepfather in his guest bedroom ; he was a writer and director .
Then I made some friends and moved into an apartment .
I ’ve had a vagabond life . ’
So far that life has n’t included children .
I know he ’s good with kids ; I met him years ago in Minneapolis during the filming of Feeling Minnesota .
He did n’t have a lot to say to me , but struck up a lengthy conversation with my daughter , who was two at the time , over tea in the hospitality suite , making her laugh and sharing his chocolate - chip cookie .
I remind him of this , and he begins to talk about his own childhood , which is interesting , as he has always studiously avoided the subject in the past .
‘ It was difficult , ’ he says .
‘ I went to four different high schools in five years .
I was OK academically , good at English and creative writing .
I was on the chess team . ’
Poor at maths and science , he excelled at basketball and baseball and was such a skilled ice - hockey goalie he was nicknamed The Wall .
His acting talent earned him a place at a prestigious performing - arts school , but the experience was traumatic .
‘ It was a very small school and I guess I did n’t fit in .
I had conflicts and run-ins with the staff .
The principal and I did n’t see eye to eye .
I was one of those “ Why ? ” kids – I asked too many questions about everything .
I could n’t stop even if it got me into trouble .
' I wanted my autonomy , and if you wanted to impose something on me , then you and I would have a problem . ’
The teenager was so rebellious he ended up getting expelled at 16 .
When I raise this , Reeves bursts out laughing , then sighs and covers his face with his hands .
‘ Of course , it was n’t funny then – it ’s a terrible letter to receive , saying you ca n’t come back to school next year .
Getting asked to leave was very upsetting .’
He had the last laugh , though .
‘ I did .
Ironic , is n’t it ? ’
Reeves believes his rebellious nature is due to being part - English .
‘ I have n’t gone back to Hampshire ( where his mother was born ) .
My mother left home when she was very young , 14 or 15 .
But she is a very independent woman and passed that on .
' She gave me British manners – which side of the plate the fork goes on , but also the two fingers ( he gives me the V - sign ) .
That was an attitude I inherited .
' I do feel English .
I was raised on The Two Ronnies , Monty Python … I always loved the irreverence .
Maybe it led to me getting that letter from school . ’
For years after his long drive to LA he was effectively homeless .
Even as a rising film star , his only semi-permanent base was the Chateau Marmont hotel , a popular celebrity haunt on Sunset Boulevard .
‘ The road has been my home for a long time , ’ says Reeves .
‘ I was in Australia for 16 months making Matrix Revolutions and Reloaded .
I ’ve made over 40 films , so I ’ve lived in trailers for long periods .
When you think about it , with 12 - hour shooting days , it works out at four years in total sitting in a trailer . ’
Reeves describes his new $ 4 million house in the Hollywood Hills as ‘ chateau modern ’ .
‘ It ’s got two bedrooms , 13ft ceilings and French oak floors , ’ he says .
‘ It ’s very rectangular with a lot of straight lines , but there ’s also a lot of limestone tile .
I used stone , glass , steel and wood .
I ’m kind of behind on furniture , though .
I must get some .
And I do n’t cook yet .
I eat out . ’
It does n’t sound like he feels at home there , and it seems he ’s still happiest on the road , in his 1996 all - black Porsche Carrera , or riding one of his classic Norton Commandos , incognito in helmet and leathers , racing along the Pacific Coast Highway .
‘ With these bikes you have to break in the engine – you ca n’t raise the rpms too much .
I was given a $ 50,000 West Coast Chopper for my 40th birthday by Sandra Bullock ’s husband ( motorbike builder Jesse James ) .
' I took it out down Sunset late one night – it was only the second time riding it – and in my enthusiasm I revved it a little too high for too long and blew the engine …
Oops .
I can do my own minor repairs .
If the cable breaks I can fix it , but I ca n’t do a bottom - up rebuild . ’
By now Reeves has almost forgotten that he ’s doing an interview .
I ask about his favourite drive , and it ’s as if he ’s already pounding the Tarmac .
‘ I ’d take Sunset Boulevard , a 30 - mile - long street that ’s quite residential .
If there ’s a good moon out you can coast all the way down to the ocean and make a right on the Pacific Coast Highway for 50 miles .
It ’s pretty fantastic .
I ’m a city / countryside biker – I have n’t done the trans - continental ride yet .
What I do is nothing compared to Ewan McGregor .
Now he is doing some riding .
‘ I also like riding at night .
You shut off your lights and go .
It ’s quiet and you ’re guided by the moonlight .
You ’re getting away from it all .
' It ’s about getting out and feeling the wind in your hair , just having two wheels to ride .
You have to be in the present , here and now – there ’s nothing like it .
You take a turn and go .
‘ It ’s a cliché that money does n’t buy you happiness .
But it does buy you the freedom to live your life the way you want . ’

I ’m intrigued by the search engine phrases that lead people to this blog .
My most - viewed post , on librarian stereotypes , is still steadily getting hits — apparently not just from people interested in the topic , but from people searching for information about the deaths of abalone divers .
( Who says search engines have eliminated serendipity ? )
And now my post about scale - of - the - universe videos , with a passing mention of Morgan Freeman , is showing up in search results for “ morgan freeman atheist . ”
So I Googled that phrase myself , and lo and behold :
This morning on CNN ’s American Morning , Morgan Freeman was interviewed about a new show in which he is the executive producer and host of , “ Through The Wormhole With Morgan Freeman ” .
One of the CNN hosts , Kiran Chetry , began the interview stating , “ You are a man of God ” , with Freeman snickering while replying , “ And when did I ever say that ? ”
Chetry corrected herself and said , “ you are a man of faith . ”
Again , Freeman came back with “ If faith is what you believe , then yes , ” then alluding to a belief in science .
Update ( 6/3 ) : Here ’s video ( thanks to Anonymous in the comments ) .
I have reservations about how he tries to explain “ faith ” in scientific principles ; a scientist would have made a stronger distinction between religious belief and the process by which scientific theories become accepted as “ facts . ”
Not quite an explicit admission of atheism , but pretty darn close , I think .
How ironic that Freeman , whose voice is often likened to the voice of God , and who has in fact played God himself on film , is actually a nonbeliever ; then again , perhaps it should come as no surprise that actors do n’t really believe their characters are real .
The show itself sounds fascinating :
This new series , produced by Freeman ’s Revelations Entertainment , seeks the answers to the big questions :
Are we alone ?
Where did we come from ?
Is there life on other planets ?
From the latest work at NASA and private enterprise facilities to the latest theories from academics and researchers , this series looks at black holes , colonizing the planets , string theory and more .
Science Channel invites viewers on the journey as Morgan Freeman picks up where Carl Sagan ’s “ Cosmos ” left off and explores the new frontiers of what is beyond Earth .
And here ’s the video promo :
Interesting that “ Is there a creator ? ” is one of the questions the video poses .
Will the show be brave enough to declare what scientists really think about that ?
And : picking up where Cosmos left off ?
Ambitious , and a very worthy goal ; if it comes anywhere near to being as informative and compelling as Sagan ’s series , I ’d consider it a triumph .
I look forward to seeing the show — and , eventually , to seeing it get Symphony of Science ‘s autotune treatment :
I have to say , though , that there must be better titles out there than “ Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman . ”
In a certain frame of mind , that just sounds … wrong .

This football Worldcup in South Africa is notorious for two things until now .
Boring football games and the annoying sound of the vuvuzela , the blaring horn that drowns all other background noises out .
Some football watchers helped themselves by turning off the sound of the TV while others played around with their TV 's equalizer to reduce the impact of the vuvuzela on the overall sound .
The developers of VLC Media Player have now posted instructions on how to reduce the sound of the vuvuzelas while watching soccer .
This does however mean that only users who watch football in VLC will be able to enjoy the games without those sounds .
This means that users who use a TV card in their PC can benefit from the startup parameters , as do users who watch recorded games on their PCs .
VLC Media
Player needs to be started from the command line with the following parameters to remove the vuvuzela when watching the world cup .
vlc --audio-filter=param_eq -- param-eq - f1=233 -- param-eq-f2=466 --param-eq-f3=932 --param-eq-gain1=-20 -- param-eq-gain2=-20 -- param-eq-gain3=-20 -- param-eq-lowf=100 --param-eq-lowgain=15 -- param-eq-q1=10 -- param-eq-q2=10 -- param-eq-q3=10
The parameters can be added to a batch file that needs to be placed in the VLC directory so that the commands are executed without having to issue them on every startup .
Just download this batch file and extract it into your VLC directory .
Execute it whenever you want to watch football .
A similar option is available for Mplayer users , they need to issue the command
mplayer - af an=1:0.5:0.5,sinesuppress=233:0.01 ,sinesuppress=466:0.01 ,
sinesuppress=932:0.01 ,sinesuppress=1864:0.01 ,sinesuppress=232:0.01 ,sinesuppress=465:0.01 ,sinesuppress=931:0.01 ,sinesuppress=1863:0.01 ,sinesuppress=234:0.01 ,sinesuppress=467:0.01 , sinesuppress=933:0.01 ,sinesuppress=1865:0.01 name-of-video
This command can be added to a batch file as well .
It does however require the video file name as a parameter which means that it needs to be edited whenever the video changes .

Have you found another way to stop the annoying sounds of the vuvuzela ?

Look …it ’s a bird , it ’s a plane , it ’s a Father ’s Day Sale Extravaganza .
We ’ve all been trying to figure out just what exactly is in store for June 19th .
We ’re still working to paint a total picture of what exactly is happening that day , but the above image should give a better idea of what is going down .
As always , this is all subject to change .
These images are none other than the scripts for two commercial spots , filmed last week and airing sometime before the 19th of June .
While our sources have stated some additional details that may not be included , we ’re only going with what ’s actually on the picture itself .
Is this rock solid information ?
No , of course not , nothing is rock solid until we can say , “ this is rock solid ” , but we ’re confident that the above images are real and actually scripts for commercials regarding the Father ’s Day June 19th promotion .
So , while it looks as though new lines or new family plans are the real sell here , there are still plenty of unknowns regarding this promotion .
As with any other rumors , we ’re still trying to figure out fact from fiction .
For now , hopefully , the above images will get some buzz going and allow T - Mobile to pick up some customers and actually begin a real fight for third place .
We have plenty of lingering questions , however , about what plans will this work with .
Will it be Even More and / or Even More Plus ?
What happens to customers who want to upgrade AND add a line ?
Plenty of questions over here , but we ’ll keep hunting for details !

I can tell you what my reaction was : stoked .
While a Mortal Kombat film was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson ( of Resident Evil movie fame ) in 1995 , an updated take on the franchise has been languishing in development hell .
However , a lawsuit has been filed by the development partner of the original film as it signed a contract in 2006 to do a sequel .

One of the Israeli police officers , Yehushua " Shuki " Sofer , who was shot in a terror attack on a patrol car Monday morning in the Hebron Hills area has succumbed to his wounds .
Sofer was rushed to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem from the scene of the attack by Magen David Adom where he died from gunshot wounds to the chest approximately two hours after the attack .
Sofer , 39 , was a police veteran having served 19 years on the Hebron police force and resident of Beersheba .
His funeral will be held in the military section of Beersheva 's old cemetary at 6 p.m. this evening .
Two other police officers were injured in the attack , as they were driving northwards on Route 60 in the West Bank , south of the of settlement of Bet Hagai , in the Hebron Hills region .
Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch , who is currently in Romania , released a statement following the attack , saying , " Today we have seen that the relative quiet is deceitful and we cannot know when it will be broken .
I send my condolences to the family of F.- Sgt.
Shuki Sofer , and I hope the injured will recover swiftly . "
Ahronovitch added that the police , IDF and Shin Bet would " do everything to quickly capture those responsible for this terrorist attack .
"
The shooter was likely a lone terrorist or a local cell operation on its own , without direction or backing from a larger group , IDF sources assessed .
According to IDF officers , the trend in terrorism in recent years has been attacks carried out by individuals , without working with a larger organization .
"
It 's very difficult to collect intelligence on an individual , and then to prevent what that individual plans to carry out all by himself , " an IDF officer said .
The officer referred to an incident in the West Bank earlier this year , in which a bulldozer driven by a Palestinian man struck an Israeli vehicle and caused a second motorist to swerve into a road ditch .
IDF troops were still searching for the perpetrator of Monday 's attack , though it remained unclear whether the shots were fired from a passing car , or a sniper lying on the side of the road .
One policemen shot in chest has improved from serious to moderate condition , while the third officer was shot in the arm and is in light condition , Magen David Adom paramedics said .
In March 2009 , two Judea and Samaria police officers , Yehezkel Ramazreger and David Rabinovitch , were shot dead in the Jordan Valley in a terrorist ambush .
The policemen had stopped to provide assistance to a Palestinian terrorist who pretended that his car had broken down .
Oh boy .
“ When we found this dolphin it was filled with oil .
Oil was just pouring out of it .
It was the saddest darn thing to look at , ” said a BP contract worker who took the Daily News on a surreptitious tour of the wildlife disaster unfolding in Louisiana .
His motive : simple outrage .
“ There is a lot of coverup for BP .
They specifically informed us that they do n’t want these pictures of the dead animals .
They know the ocean will wipe away most of the evidence .
It ’s important to me that people know the truth about what ’s going on here , ” the contractor said .
For good reason , there has been a lot of public outrage over BP ’s “ iron fist ” handling of the spill zone .
MoJo ’s Mac McClelland has been reporting on the media blackout .
when I ran into some packing up on the Grand Isle beach twenty minutes later , I asked them only if they were done working for the day , and they refused to tell me .
One woman said , “ I ca n’t talk to you , ” and then another worker ran up to her and grabbed her arm and said , “ Just ignore her , ignore her , ” and the whole interaction was unsettlingly rude and sort of sad .
BP has quartered off the coast like its guarding a war zone .
The company chased a CBS news crew from a beach in South Pass , Louisiana when they tried to film a thick coat of oil , and CEO Tony “ I just want my life back ”
Hayward famously barked orders at a cameraman as if he was a visiting king walking among peasants .
In a sane world , a company guilty of gross negligence that resulted in the deaths of 11 workers would be under criminal investigation , and not be parading around the coast , telling the media where they can go and who they can talk to , while forbidding their clean - up crews from wearing protective gear .
Law enforcement does n’t handle other crimes like this .
Cops do n’t let serial killers tidy up their crime scenes after they ’re done a’stabbin ’ .
The Lowdown On Lectins
Little known to the public at large .
Little understood by the health community .
Omnipresent in our conventional food culture .
Proven to be at least mildly detrimental for everyone and downright destructive for the more sensitive ( and often unsuspecting ) among us .
We ’re talking lectins today : common natural agents on the one hand , cloaked thugs of the anti-nutrient underworld on the other .
Our popular health media , if they ’ve heard of lectins , certainly never make mention of them .
Famous health gurus never deign to speak of them .
In short , lectins thrive in the American diet basically unfettered , unscrutinized .
Make no mistake , however .
They ’re a menacing power to be reckoned with .
I ’ve addressed them on Mark ’s Daily Apple in the past ( Why Grains Are Unhealthy ) and in my book ( The Primal Blueprint ) , but I still get a fair number of emails and forum questions asking for more info .
As I always say , let ’s break it down … .
What Are They ?
Before Monsanto , Mother Nature had her own pesticide strategy .
( Humans being among the “ pests ” to be warded off . )
In order to avoid being completely decimated by insects , foraging animals and Groks , plant species evolved assorted anti-nutrients that would make said pests regret their gorges with a variety of mostly digestive related ailments .
Low grade toxins , in a sense .
A workable balance developed between plants that were able to safeguard their species ’ survival and the “ pest ” patrons that were able to benefit from the plants ’ nutrition but learned to partake more sensibly from their supply .
Given that our primal forefolk foraged widely and ate a surprisingly diverse diet , the system worked .
Lectins are essentially carb - binding proteins universally present in plants ( and animals ) .
Just as they protect plant species from Grok - sized predators , lectins also support other immunological functions within plants and animals ( against pathogense , parasites , etc . )
They also assist in other functions like protein synthesis and delivery in animals .
They ’re relatively sticky molecules , which makes them effective in binding with their sought after sugars but undesirable for our digestion , in which their binding powers can lead them to attach to the intestinal lining and wreak havoc .
( More on this in a minute … )
Given their omnipresence in nature , a certain amount of lectin consumption has always been inevitable .
To the benefit of the plants , lectins are also hard to break down .
Regular old digestive enzymes only do about half the job .
Human ingenuity evolved across traditional cultures to “ predigest ” lectins through food preparation practices ( fermenting , soaking , etc. ) .
In our contemporary dietary culture , however , we too commonly skip these practices yet rely on the highest lectin - containing foods for our primary food sources .
What Foods Contain
Them ?
The short answer here is basically all plants and animal products ( PDF ) to varying degrees .
Nonetheless , lectins are concentrated more in some sources than others .
Foods with the highest lectin activity include : grains of all kinds ( especially wheat ) , legumes ( especially soy ) , nuts , dairy , and nightshade plants ( e.g. eggplant , tomatoes , potatoes , peppers , etc. ) .
Add to this list the oils and other derivative products from these food sources .
And yet another , lesser known category : GMO food , since lectins are often spliced into modified varieties in order to enhance “ natural ” pest and fungal resistance .
What Do They Do To The Body ?
Let ’s go back to the intestine again .
( Some field trip , eh ? ) Lectins ’ stickiness allows them to bind with the lining , particularly the villi , of the small intestine .
The result ?
Intestinal damage ( with impaired cellular repair potential ) , cellular death as well as compromised intestinal villi , which means reduced absorption of other nutrients , including minerals and protein .
Add to this altered gut flora , which can allow certain harmful bacterial strains like E. coli to run rampant .
Furthermore , because the body is now responding full - time to the needs of the injured gut lining , proteins and other resources are redirected from other basic growth and repair processes .
Furthermore , lectins have been associated with leptin resistance , a pre-diabetic condition linked to obesity .
Perhaps the most insidious impacts lectins can leave in their wake is this : leaky gut .
Leaky gut is a term for the breach in the intestinal lining created by lectins hand in hand with other antinutrients .
Once the intestinal breach exists , lectins and other particles ( like partially digested food , toxins , etc ) can “ leak ” into the bloodstream .
Once lectins open the door , so to speak , out of the small intestine , they and other fugitive particles are now free to move about the body and bind to any tissue they come across ( anything from the thyroid to the pancreas to the kidneys ) .
Of course , the body reacts to these invaders by directing an attack on these particles and the otherwise perfectly healthy tissue they ’re attached to .
Enter autoimmune mayhem .
That ’s why lectins are linked with autoimmune disorders like IBS , Crohn ’s , colitis , thyroiditis , fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue syndrome , and arthritis .
Specific lectins have been associated with particular ailments ( like wheat with rheumatoid arthritis ) , but more research is needed to trace and confirm these connections .
What is clear , however , is the potent autoimmune destruction that can result when the intestinal lining experiences this level of damage .
Primal Advice For Limiting Lectins
As mentioned , lectins are literally everywhere .
Although it ’s impossible to eliminate them altogether , you can significantly reduce your intake .
Purge the worst offenders .
That means grains and soy more than anything , but I ’d add other legumes to the list as well .
Eliminating the foods that contain the highest lectin activity will slash your overall lectin intake – and impact .
Cut back on other higher lectin sources .
Not everyone wants to nix every dairy or nightshade option .
Look at how you can reduce your overall intake of these items while keeping enough to enjoy their flavor and nutrient advantages .
Gauge your sensitivity .
For those of us who are most sensitive to lectins , more dramatic measures might be needed .
If you know or believe that you ’ve already suffered some serious intestinal damage , you might do well to steer clear of as many high and moderate lectin level foods as possible .
That means perhaps forgoing nightshades , dairy , legumes and even nuts and eggs in addition to all grains and processed foods .
Reintroduce desired foods back into your diet by “ family ” ( e.g. dairy , etc. ) and be mindful of any physiological effects ( however minor ) that accompany them .
Take up old traditions like soaking , sprouting and using bacterial fermentation techniques for any moderate / high lectin foods like beans you choose to keep in your diet .
Fermentation methods are especially effective , virtually eliminating lectins in one study of lentils .
All those kitchen rituals you remember from Grandma ?
They ’re adaptive , essentially pre-digestive techniques practiced by traditional cultures around the globe .
Going old school on your favorite nut varieties , for example , cuts those lectin levels dramatically .
Do n’t go wholly raw .
Yes , there are legitimate reasons to enjoy raw plants in your diet , but I do n’t support the practice as a movement or exclusionary principle for eating .
Humans have been cooking for well over a hundred thousand years .
Some nutrients are enhanced by heat .
Some anti-nutrients ( like lectins ) are at least partially “ disarmed ” by it .
Cooking methods with a mind toward maximizing overall nutrient value and bioavailability make good Primal sense and can lower your exposure to lectins .
Diversify !
Restrictive diets make us even more susceptible to the downsides of our foods .
( Soy formula fed babies being a dramatic example of this principle . )
Make Grok proud and forage more widely for your dinner .
Research shows that simply rotating primary foods was enough to limit lectin - related damage in rats that were given rounds of soy feed .
A healthy , mostly low lectin diet will offer enough balance and protective nutrition to blunt the impact of the occasional moderate level lectin sources .
Avoid GMOs .
Hidden lectin is just one more reason to leave GMO products on the shelf .
Maintain good overall gut health .
Our modern existence sometimes seems like one giant assault against our digestive tracts .
Minimize cumulative negative effects and increase positive , protective factors .
Eat a healthy diet with Primal doses of probiotics , prebiotics and good fats .
Limit stress and the use of medications like aspirin , NSAIDs and antibiotics ( as well as secondary exposure through antibiotic - administered livestock ) .
A healthy gut will be better equipped to weather the effects of inevitable but reasonable lectin intake .
Now it ’s your turn – for your comments , questions and anecdotes about lectin impact .

NEW YORK — New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has ventured into lonely territory , saying the world should not rush to judgment in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster .
The billionaire former CEO mayor is known for defending private businesses dealing with public relations problems .
Friday was no different .
Bloomberg said on his weekly radio show that the head of British Petroleum " did n't exactly go down there and blow up the well . "
He added that everyone might want to wait to assign blame because the expertise of BP is needed to fix the problem .
Scientists say the spill could now be in the realm of 42 million to more than 100 million gallons of oil .

I read your article on Iain Duncan Smith 's proposal for a " welfare revolution " with a sense of despair ( Duncan Smith starts welfare revolution , 27 May ) .
The work and pensions secretary enlists a familiar set of cliches in his attempt to portray the British welfare system as " bust " , while simultaneously displaying a worrying ignorance about how the system actually operates .
I worked in one of Jobcentre Plus 's contact centres for over two years , taking benefit claims over the phone in scripted telephone interviews .
I took claims for employment and support allowance ( ESA ) from the day it was launched .
Duncan Smith cites incapacity benefit ( IB ) as an example of how the welfare system fails society : " People basically get parked on this benefit and forgotten about . "
ESA was introduced in October 2008 specifically to address this .
The extension of the harsher work capability assessment to existing IB claimants is a long - standing Labour project , and for him to take credit for it , even by implication , is unfair .
In a BBC interview he described ESA as a " disability benefit " for those with the potential to work .
This is highly inaccurate .
It is a benefit intended for those suffering short - term illnesses as well as long - term disabilities , and is intended as a replacement for IB , not to supplement it .
It is disturbing that the man in charge of the welfare system does not seem to properly understand one of its key benefits .
In effect , ESA is designed to deal with the large numbers claiming for moderate depression , back pain and similar conditions .
Of those who are genuine , most would be better off in work .
These represented about 60 % of sickness claims I took .
Dealing with this problem is necessary , but the blunt instrument of ESA has created countless innocent victims .
A colleague 's bipolar brother recently became suicidal on receiving the letter calling him for his capability assessment .
Duncan Smith repeats another cliche – that people are better off on benefits than working .
He states : " If you are unemployed , and you come from a family that is unemployed , all you can see when you think about work is risk . "
In fact , very few are materially better off unemployed , as there are numerous financial incentives to ensure that taking a job is financially rewarding .
Jobcentre advisers are trained to offer " better - off calculations " that detail claimants ' potential earnings from these benefits .
A major factor behind long - term unemployment is that the slender rewards of taking poorly paid work are n't compensated for by the additional stress involved in taking some of the worst jobs in society .
Given a choice between receiving £ 60 a week to do nothing and £ 80 a week to clean toilets , most of us would opt for inactivity .
No restructuring of the system is going to compensate for lack of opportunity .
With this in mind , Duncan Smith 's promise to re-incentivise work has sinister implications .
The easiest and cheapest way to do this is to slash benefits to a level where they can't sustain a tolerable lifestyle .
This is what I suspect is planned , despite all his talk of reform .
When Amy Shroff ’s ex-boyfriend violated a restraining order by blocking her exit from a police station parking lot with his pickup , the Denver woman thought officers would come to her defense .
Instead , Officer Frank Spellman mistakenly arrested Shroff for violating the restraining order .
She ended up spending a night in jail despite pleas that her 4 - month - old needed breast milk due to a medical condition that prevented the baby from drinking formula .
Now Denver police are offering up a mea culpa , admitting the officer had no cause to arrest Shroff .
And the city of Denver is poised to pay $ 175,000 to settle a federal wrongful arrest lawsuit .
“ This is a reasonable settlement under the circumstances , ” said City Attorney David Fine in a prepared statement .
The Police Department says the restraining order was not reciprocal and did not prevent Shroff from having any contact with her ex-boyfriend , as the police officer interpreted .
Instead , the restraining order strictly prohibited the former boyfriend from having contact with her , and Shroff should have been considered the protected one , a representative of the Police Department later said in sworn testimony .
“ This case is an absolute outrage , and the citizens of Denver should storm City Hall in a torch - light parade demanding accountability , ” said Shroff ’s lawyer , David Lane .
Spellman could not be reached for comment .
In sworn testimony , he said the former boyfriend had contended that Shroff was stalking him , an accusation she adamantly denied .
Prosecutors dismissed the criminal charge of violating a restraining order within three days of Shroff ’s arrest .
But the dismissal did not occur until after Shroff , a management consultant , spent a night in jail and her baby became ill from drinking formula , her lawsuit states .
Shroff declined to comment for this story , but her lawsuit gave the following account :
On Feb. 23 , 2006 , she was going to drop off her daughter with the child ’s paternal grandparents so she could spend time with her father .
On the way to the police station exchange point , Shroff spotted the truck of the father , Greg Kruse , parked outside the Campus Lounge at 10:55 a.m .
She knew he had a drinking problem and took a photograph to show the court as proof .
Shroff proceeded to the District 3 police station and was confronted by Kruse there .
She contends that under the restraining order , only Kruse ’s parents were allowed to show up there .
As she was trying to leave the police station parking lot , the former boyfriend used his truck to block her exit .
Shroff went back inside to show police the restraining order that a judge had issued ordering Kruse to stay away from her .
Instead of finding sympathy , Shroff was arrested .
Spellman told her that the restraining order required her to stay away from Kruse , and that he was tired of her making so many appearances at the police station .
Instead of allowing her to go on to church as she had planned , the officer detained her in a holding cell .
She and her stepfather , Bill McAdam , repeatedly tried to point out that the restraining order was not reciprocal and was targeted at preventing Kruse from coming near her .
She claimed that in the past Kruse had choked her and thrown her against a wall .
“ Despite having the order in his hands , despite Shroff ’s and McAdam ’s entreaties to Spellman , he arrested Shroff and charged her with violating the restraining order and threatened to arrest McAdam if he did not ‘ shut up , ’ ” the lawsuit states .
The lawsuit adds that Shroff told Spellman that she was nursing the newborn and that the baby had a condition that prevented it from digesting formula .
Spellman was not sympathetic , the lawsuit claims .
“ She better start liking formula real quick , ” Shroff recalled Spellman telling her .
After much pleading , Shroff was allowed to use a breast pump in the holding cell .
The fact she had to disrobe to do so in front of a female cadet was so embarrassing that the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals later equated it to a strip search .
The lawsuit said that after Shroff was taken to the Denver City Jail , deputies there ridiculed her when she begged to be allowed to pump more breast milk so her stepfather could feed the baby .
It contended that one of the deputies referred to her as a “ rich bitch ” who believed she deserved “ special treatment . ”
By the time Shroff was allowed to pump again , 24 hours later , the infant had become ill from drinking formula that she was unable to digest , according to the lawsuit .
The settlement proposal that the Denver City Council will consider approving Monday would pay Shroff $ 94,238 .
The law firm that represented her , Killmer , Lane & Newman LLP , would receive $ 80,761 .

WASHINGTON — Rand Paul , the newly nominated Republican candidate for Senate from Kentucky , touched off more controversy on Friday by calling the Obama administration “ un- American ” for taking a tough stance with BP over the company ’s handling of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
A day after he was forced to explain remarks he had made suggesting he was not fully supportive of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 , Mr. Paul set off yet another round of Twitter , cable television and e-mail chatter by lambasting President Obama and his aides for insisting that BP be held accountable — and pay — for the oil spill cleanup and damage .
“ What I do n’t like from the president ’s administration is this sort of , ‘ I ’ll put my boot heel on the throat of BP , ’ ” Mr. Paul said , referring to a remark by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar about the oil company .
“ I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business .
I ’ve heard nothing from BP about not paying for the spill .
And I think it ’s part of this sort of blame - game society in the sense that it ’s always got to be someone ’s fault instead of the fact that sometimes accidents happen . ”
His Democratic opponent , Jack Conway , the state attorney general , has begun soliciting campaign donations by citing Mr. Paul ’s recent statements .
On the BP remarks , Mr. Conway said on Friday : “ Rand Paul apparently has a deeply held conviction that corporations should be allowed to do what they see fit without oversight or accountability . ”
Along with new manual and automatic transmissions  both with 6 forward speeds  the engines represent the single greatest technological leap for the Mustang since it entered production 46 years ago .
And while the new V - 8 deserves its own Irving Berlin ballad , the tune today is in the key of V - 6 .
Let ’s put that engine ’s performance in perspective .
It carries the same horsepower rating as the most muscular Mustang offered in 1998  the SVT Cobra with a 4.6 - liter , dual - overhead cam , 32 - valve V - 8 that seemed exotic at the time .
Yet the new Mustang manages 19 miles per gallon in the city and , when paired with the automatic transmission , 31 m.p.g. on the highway .
That ’s 5 m.p.g. better than the highway rating for the base Mustang notchback way back in 1984 .
That tired old horse weighed 900 pounds less than today ’s larger pony , had a crummy 88 - horsepower 4 - cylinder under its hood and a gear - grinding 4 - speed manual transmission .
“ It ’s all about interdependency , ” said David Pericak , the 33 - year - old chief engineer of the Mustang , explaining the talents of the new drivetrains .
“ About finding solutions at each opportunity that would be more efficient . ”
Those optimized interdependencies let the car ’s Duratec V - 6 perform as if it were actually two separate engines : one optimized for fuel economy at low engine speeds and partial throttle , and one that roars when allowed to spin toward its red line of 7,000 r.p.m. at full throttle .
Start up the new V - 6 and it growls a bit through its new dual exhaust outlets .
Put the shifter in D , touch the throttle pedal lightly and the Mustang moves out , well , tenderly .
There ’s enough torque available from just off idle to motivate the car easily  even the heavier Mustang convertible .
But if kept below 4,000 r.p.m. , the engine responds modestly .
It does n’t feel as if it is making anything close to 305 horsepower .
Mexico ’s 1.7 ton Angel of Independence has arrived in South Africa .
The statue , which took nearly two months to get here by ship , is considered to be “ the ultimate symbol of Mexico ” and will be unveiled in Johannesburg on Wednesday .
It will offer the Mexican football team and their fans national support during the 2010 World Cup .
According to Lynda Greeff Consulting , a 3 - ton crane was needed to mount the 3.4 m replica of the original statue .
The original stands on a 45 m pillar in Mexico City , where Mexican heroes of independence are buried at the base .
The heroes include Miguel Hidalgo , Vicente Guerrero , Jose Maria Morelos and Ignacio Allende .
The base of the column has female sculptures symbolising Law , Peace , Justice and War .
The Angel sculpture holds a crown of laurel , representing Victory , and a broken chain , representing Freedom .
It is a traditional gathering place for Mexicans , especially after victories by the national soccer team .
The statue that will be unveiled this week is made of bronze , but has a 14 - carat leaf gold cover .
It will stand in Melrose Arch until June 26 , after which it will make its way back to Mexico City .
The " household sector " plug in the Fed 's Flow of Funds reports provides some very crude and often inaccurate fund flow data when it comes to the US consumers , but at least one can often get a sense of which way capital is flowing .
As we continue spreading the data from yesterday 's Z.1 , we have initially focused on ' household " financial assets , which at a total of $ 45.5 trillion , represent two thirds of the total household sector 's assets of $ 68.5 trillion ( the balance is tangible assets which actually declined by $ 67 billion to $ 22,994 billion : as America gets wealthier , it is increasingly based on intangible " wealth " ) .
The key components of Financial Assets consist of Corporate Equities , Corporate and Foreign Bonds , Treasury Securities , Total Deposits , and Pension Funds Reserves .
Below we present the change in time over these asset holdings .
A casual glance at the change in the non-seasonally adjusted household financial assets reveals something strange : even as every tracker of mutual fund flows has repeatedly indicated that US investors are not only not investing in stocks , but are now increasingly redeeming funds from domestic corporate equities , the Fed will have you believe quite the opposite .
According to the Z1 , the household sector increased its Corporate Equity holdings by $ 329.4 billion , even as Corporate and Foreign bonds declined by $ 58.1 billion .
Of course , the truth is completely the opposite : non-institutional investors have been taking money out of stocks and investing it in bonds .
When one notes that Pension Funds allegedly also saw a $ 396.8 billion increase in assets , and then the lie is just complete .
The question is why is this " plug " category so far off .
If one assumes that households were really at best flat , if not negative , participants toward stocks , then the Fed is essentially saying there was a vacuum of at least $ 330 billion that came from somewhere .
It sure did not come from retail investors !
Continuing with the other imaginary NSA data , Treasury securities ( ex. savings bonds ) increased by $ 148.4 billion in the quarter .
This is at least a marginally credible number .
We will provide the other contributors to the Treasury category shortly .
What is most disturbing for banks is that Total Deposits , after increasing by $ 101.3 billion in Q4 2009 , fell by $ 104 billion in Q1 2010 .
Summing across these five categories , Equities , Corporate Bonds ( decline ) , Treasury Securities , Total Deposits ( decline ) and Pension Fund Reserves , and we get a change of $ 712 billion in Q1 alone .
What the source of this three - quarters of a trillion in new capital in the Fed 's dummy category is , is yet another secret that the Fed will never disclose .
In this market it is best not to ask questions : just take it for granted that somehow almost $ 1 trillion in purchasing power came in and lifted the market .
Below is the total notional of these abovementioned asset categories :
And below is the quarter over quarter change of categories in which the Fed needed the help of a dummy category to balance capital flows .

I 've had a rather successful tenure with autogenerated documentation , both as a writer and a reader .
So when Jacob Kaplan Moss 's articles on writing “ great documentation ” resurfaced on Reddit and had some harsh words about auto - generated documentation , I sat back a moment and thought about why autogenerated documentation leave developers with a bad taste in their mouths .
I interpreted Moss 's specific objections ( besides asserting that they were “ worthless ” as the following :
They usually did n't contain the information you were looking for ( “ At best it ’s a slightly improved version of simply browsing through the source ” ) ,
They were verbose ( “ good for is filling printed pages when contracts dictate delivery of a certain number of pages of documentation ” ) ,
The writers skipped the “ writing ” part ( “ There ’s no substitute for documentation written ... ” ) ,
The writers skipped the “ organizing ” part ( “ ... organized ... ” ) ,
The writers skipped the “ editing ” part ( “ ... and edited by hand . ” ) ,
It gave the illusion of having documentation ( “ ... it lets maintainers fool themselves into thinking they have documentation ” ) .
Thus , the secret to successful autogenerated docs is :
Remember your audience .
No doubt , gentle reader , you are lifting your eyebrow at me , thinking to yourself , “ Of course you should remember your audience ; that 's what they always teach you in any writing class .
You have n't told us anything useful ! ”
So , let me elaborate .
Why do developers forget to “ remember their audience ” ?
A defining characteristic of autogenerated documentation is that the medium it is derived from is source code : lines of programming language and docblocks interleaved together .
This has certain benefits : for one , keeping the comments close to the code they describe helps ward off documentation rot as code changes , additionally , source divers have easy access to documentation pertinent to a source file they are reading .
But documentation is frequently oriented towards people who are not interested in reading the codebase , and thus the act of writing code and documentation at the same time puts the writer into the wrong mindset .
Compare this with sitting down to a tutorial , the text flowing into an empty document unprejudiced by such petty concerns as code .
This is a shame , because in the case of end - user developer documentation ( really the only appropriate time for autodocs ) , the person who originally wrote the code is most likely to have the relevant knowledge to share about the interface being documented .
What does it mean to “ remember my audience ” ?
Concisely , it 's putting yourself into your end - user ’s shoes and asking yourself , “ If I wanted to find out information about this API , what would I be looking for ? ”
This can be hard ( and unfortunately , there are no secrets here ) , but the first step is to be thinking about it at all .
How can I remember to consider the audience when writing docblocks ?
While it would be nice if I could just snap my fingers and say , “ I 'm going to write docblocks with my audience in mind , ” I know that I 'm going to forget and write a snippy docblock because I was in a rush one day or omit the docblock entirely and forget about it .
Writing documentation immediately after the code is written can be frustrating if five minutes later you decide that function did the wrong thing and needs to be axed .
Thus , I 've set up these two rules for myself :
It 's OK not to write documentation immediately after writing code ( better not yet than poorly ) .
Like many people working in high - level languages , I like using code to prototype API designs .
I 'll write something , try to use it , change it to fit my use - case , write some more , and eventually I 'll have both working code and a working design .
If I do n't write documentation while I 'm prototyping , that 's fine , but when that 's all over I need to write the documentation ( hopefully before the code slips out of my active mindspace . )
The act of writing the documentation at the end helps finalize the API , and can suggest finishing touches .
I also use my toolchain to tell me when I 've left code undocumented ( with Sphinx , this is using the coverage plugin ) .
When writing documentation , constantly look at the output the end - user will see .
You probably have a write / preview authoring cycle when you edit any sort of text that contains formatting .
This cycle should carry over to docblocks : you edit your docblock , run your documentation build script , and inspect the results in your browser .
It helps if the output you 're producing is beautiful !
It also means that your documentation toolchain should be smart about what it needs to recompile when you make changes .
The act of inspecting what a live user will see helps put you in the right mindset , and also force you to say , “ Yeah , these docs are not actually acceptable . ”
My autodocumentor produces verbose and unorganized output !
I 've generally found autogenerated documentation from Python or Haskell to be much more pleasant to read than that from Java or C ++.
The key difference between these languages is that Python and Haskell organize their modules into files ; thus , programmers in those language find it easier to remember the module docblock !
The module docblock is one of great import .
If your code is well - written and well - named , a competent source - diver can usually figure out what a particular function does in only a few times longer than it would take for them to read your docblock .
The module is the first organizational unit above class and function , precisely where documentation starts becoming the most useful .
It is the first form of “ high - level documentation ” that developers pine for .
So , in Python and Haskell , you write all of the functionality involved in a module in a file , and you can stick a docblock up top that says what the entire file does .
Easy !
But in Java and C++ , each file is a class ( frequently a small one ) , so you do n't get a chance to do that .
Java and recent C++ have namespaces , which can play a similar role , but where are you supposed to put the docblock for what in Java is effectively a directory ?
There is also substantial verbosity pollution that comes from an autodocumenting tool attempting to generate documentation for classes and functions that were intended to not be used by the end - user .
Haddock ( Haskell autodocumentor ) strongly enforces this by not generating documentation for any function that the module does n't export .
Sphinx ( Python autodocumentor ) will ignore by default functions prefixed with an underscore .
People documenting Java , which tends to need a lot of classes , should think carefully about which classes they actually want people to use .
Final thoughts .
The word “ autogenerated documentation ” is a misnomer : there is no automatic generation of documentation .
Rather , the autodocumentor should be treated as a valuable documentation building tool that lets you get the benefits of cohesive code and comments , as well as formatting , interlinking and more .
I joined the United States Army as a public affairs specialist in 2003 , fully aware of “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” and the repercussions a gay soldier could possibly face .
I fought beside the finest men and women , fully knowing I was fighting to protect the freedoms of many who do not approve of homosexuality .
I wrote this five years ago during my service , as I felt the need to express my feelings , secretly , about being gay and in the military :
As a citizen of a democratic society , with freedom as its foundation and core , I stand , proud to serve my country and defend all this nation stands for .
I am prepared to fight for and protect freedom in our homeland .
I am also prepared to fight for others , so that those who do not understand or feel the slightest bit of freedom may share and know the freedoms that we have been blessed with as Americans .
Yet in that alone , there is a world of irony : I am not free , we are not free .
Freedom is defined as having liberty and privilege — independence of thought , choice and action ; the ability to move or act without interference , coercion or restraint .
Freedom implies that determining what is right to do or think is an internal matter , whether personally or politically , and is not to be decided by an outsider .
Liberty suggests having the power to do those things that freedom permits one to do .
Sure , in America we are free , free to vote a single person into office whose job in and of itself is to limit the so - called freedoms that we stand and fight to protect .
Yes , I suppose we do have a say as a whole , but it is society that chooses .
Who is society , anyway ?
I am definitely not society .
Love is defined as profound affection and deep devotion between people , involving compassion and concern for others .
To be in love is to feel enamored with love .
It is in the sphere of love that my freedoms are restricted .
It is love that our so - called great society — a free society — will not allow me to feel or even acknowledge .
Why , you ask ?
It is simple .
I am a homosexual American .
On top of that , I am an American soldier .
In that sentence alone , I just destroyed all credibility I may have ever gained — all awards , recommendations and accomplishments were just erased and I , like my voice , have become nothing .
Our nation strives to achieve peace throughout our world — freedom from war , strife and disturbance .
The foundation of peace is love , that compassion and concern we should carry for each other , but clearly do n’t .
Why is it that when others are n’t like “ society , ” others are not loved ?
Whites do n’t love blacks who do n’t love Mexicans who do n’t love Asians .
The rich do n’t love the poor who do n’t love the rich in return .
Christians do n’t love Mormons who do n’t love Muslims who do n’t love Jews .
Heterosexuals do n’t love homosexuals , yet homosexuals fight simply to love and be loved .
And in society , we are nothing .
­
Heterosexuals in society are very fortunate in the simple fact that they get to show and acknowledge the love they share .
Yet I , as a supposed member of this society , hurt and ache because I do not share the same privilege , the same freedom .
Heterosexuals in our society have no clue how much of love they take for granted .
However , I will agree with society on one thing :
It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all .
Unfortunately , society makes me despise love .
Why ?
Because I do n’t have the desire to love whom they want me to love .
And in that , I am nothing .
After serving for more than four years , I now live in Austin , Tex. , with my partner of more than two years .
I hold great pride in my service — I was named the Installation Management Agency Soldier of the Year and was awarded the Bronze Star for my work during my unit ’s deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom .
I was no less of a soldier , and I am no less of a person , because of my sexuality .
My unit had 110 soldiers killed during our deployment , and I would have gladly been killed 110 times over so they could live their lives today .
Yet it is disconcerting that had my sexuality been known , my opportunity to serve our nation would have been compromised .
Less than 1 percent of our population serves in the armed forces .
Not only that , we have been a nation at war for years , and still remain an all - volunteer force .
A good portion of our fighting force is gay , fighting for freedoms that as gay citizens , we are not allowed to enjoy .
How pathetic is that ?
I fully support the repeal of “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” and hope that those who fear homosexuality realize that gay or straight , we are all people capable of loving and serving one another .
It is also my hope that the repeal of “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” is only the beginning of changes for the gay population in America , our pride - filled nation that sadly harbors unnecessary hatred .
Document reveals that the company marked out ' expanding deepwater ' as its number one area for long - term growth
BP staked its future on expanding offshore drilling a month before the catastrophic explosion on the Deepwater Horizon triggered the United States ' worst environmental disaster , according to company documents revealed yesterday .
The investigative web site ProPublica published a March 2010 strategy document in which BP named " expanding deepwater " as its number one area for long - term growth .
But even as the document was drawn up , engineers were struggling to control the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico , which had already gained a reputation as a risky operation , according to industry sources .
The strategy paper claimed BP now held a global lead over its competitors in deepwater production – even though its costs were considerably lower .
Earlier this month the executives of BP 's rivals , including Exxon and Chevron , told a congressional hearing they would have taken more safeguards on the doomed Deepwater Horizon rig .
The battle over the future of offshore drilling continued yesterday as the country 's biggest business lobby said it would step up its campaign to force the Obama administration to lift its six - month ban on drilling new wells in the Gulf of Mexico .
The Chamber of Commerce , which has strenuously fought efforts to introduce climate change legislation , said Obama 's decision to halt new projects for an overhaul of safety regulations had had a " chilling " effect on the Gulf economy .
" We must avoid snap decisions following the spill that would threaten US energy security and harm our economy , " Karen Harbert , a Chamber official , said .
Meanwhile , there was fresh speculation about the professional future of BP 's chief executive after a senior Russian cabinet minister reportedly said he was expecting Tony Hayward to introduce a successor during a scheduled meeting in Moscow .
And the first hurricane of what is expected to be a very active season in the Gulf began moving up towards north - western Mexico and Texas .
Forecasters said Tropical Storm Alex was likely be upgraded to a hurricane tomorrow .
It is expected to pass well to the west of the site of the ruptured well , but the disturbance could still set back efforts to contain oil from the gusher and to drill a new relief well for as much as two weeks , the coastguard said at the weekend .
Officials said they would pull out heavy equipment and clean - up personnel from the area around the ruptured well if forecasts suggest the approach of a storm with winds higher than 46 miles per hour
The potential for delays in clean - up operations comes at a critical time .
BP officials say the relief well seen as the only surefire way of containing the gusher is within 20ft , horizontally , of the ruptured well .
BP 's senior vice - president Kent Wells said engineers were going to drill an additional 900ft down before trying to intersect the ruptured well with heavy mud .
He indicated it would take time to bridge that seemingly short distance .
BP has said it hopes to complete the relief well by August .
" This is the point in time we have to be very good at what we 're doing , " Wells said .
CHINA has cancelled a controversial visa restriction on bald Taiwanese visitors .
The rule imposed by the southern Chinese city of Xiamen barred bald people from applying for one - year multiple - entry permits before it was cancelled earlier this year , according to Taiwan 's Travel Agent Association .
" It would probably have raised the question of discrimination if Chinese customs officials were to ask visitors to remove their wigs , " said Roger Hsu , a spokesman for the association .
Mr Hsu said that the rule had mainly applied to frequent business travellers , although he did not know how many people had their visas rejected for being bald .
The Taipei - based Liberty Times quoted unnamed travel agents as saying that Chinese authorities were concerned that " it was easier for bald people to disguise themselves " .
Ties between Taiwan and China have improved markedly since Ma Ying - jeou became the island 's president in 2008 vowing to boost trade and tourism .
Beijing still considers self - ruled Taiwan part of its territory awaiting reunification , by force if necessary .
The two sides split in 1949 after a civil war .
Windows :
If you 're a devotee of Firefox 's add - ons and features but would like just a tad more operation speed , Pale Moon might be perfect , at least for a trial run .
The custom and extension - compatible Firefox build seems just a bit snappier .

It 's a relative measurement , of course , to note that Pale Moon , built and compiled specifically for Windows operation , tests out 25 percent ahead of Firefox in certain SunSpider rendering and scripting tests .
As we 've noted in our browser speed tests , browser testing suites can be subjective , and do n't always translate to real - world experience .
Then again , using Pale Moon for the better part of a morning , I could guess at feeling pages like Gawker.com and Slashdot loading a tad faster than in Firefox , which I kept open for side - by - side testing .
Pale Moon should work with most of your extensions , too , and if you install it in a non-portable fashion , it picks up your existing Firefox profile and runs with it .

In a Yes on 17 radio promotion , actors portraying a couple pondering their car insurance bills grumble about “ the flaw in the law ” that would rob them of a discount if they changed insurance providers .
“ I can take these coupons to any store in town but can only use the insurance continuous - coverage discount with one company ?
That ’s not fair ! ” laments the actress playing a penny - pinching wife .
The proponents of Proposition 17 contend that passage would benefit more than 80 % of California drivers because it would allow them to enjoy their continuous - coverage discounts — as much as $ 250 a year for some drivers — even if they switch carriers to take advantage of lower prices elsewhere .
FOR THE RECORD :
Prop. 17 : In an article in Friday ’s Section A about Proposition 17 , the car insurance initiative on the June ballot , two names were misspelled .
Ben Gertner ’s last name appeared as Gartner , and Mike D’Arelli ’s last name as Darrell .
In some editions , Richard Holober ’s last name was misspelled as Holier . —
But what insurers give to some clients comes at the expense of others , say consumer advocates opposed to the initiative bankrolled by Mercury Insurance Group .
They say the measure on the June 8 ballot would drive up rates for those who gave up driving when they lost their jobs , got sick , served out of state in the military or just wanted to help the environment or save money by taking public transportation .
Opponents also contend that the initiative would make rates unaffordable for many new drivers and those with tarnished records , boosting the number of uninsured cars on the road and thereby raising safety risks and eventually premiums for everyone .
A seemingly simple proposal for making the continuous - coverage discount portable , Proposition 17 has become one of the more contentious issues before voters in next month ’s primary election , largely because of the public relations baggage carried into the campaign by Mercury .
In mid-April , state Insurance Commissioner and gubernatorial candidate Steve Poizner lambasted Mercury , the state ’s fourth - largest auto insurer , for alleged violations of insurance law dating back a dozen years .
Auto insurance is highly regulated in California , with the Department of Insurance requiring providers to calculate individuals ’ premiums primarily on the basis of their driving records , the number of miles driven each year and the number of years they ’ve been licensed .
An additional 16 optional factors include a driver ’s age , marital status , residential location and whether he or she has been insured continuously by the same company , the latter known as a persistency or loyalty discount .
Portability of the loyalty discount was prohibited by Proposition 103 , a 1988 citizen initiative that broadly changed the insurance industry and required rating factors to be directly related to risk .
A bill passed by the Legislature in 2003 , with vigorous lobbying by Mercury , briefly allowed insurers to offer the persistency discount to new customers before a state appeals court struck it down as an illegal revision of the will of the voters .
Consumer Watchdog founder Harvey Rosenfield , who authored Proposition 103 and is active in the Stop Prop 17 campaign , complains about Mercury ’s expenditure of more than $ 7 million pushing the latest initiative in hopes of getting voter approval to raise premiums on new drivers and those reentering the insurance market .
The Campaign for Consumer Rights behind Stop Prop 17 has , by contrast , spent about $ 200,000 in contributions .
Joel Fox , Small Business Action Committee president and former head of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. , says business groups like the portability option , anticipating that it would instill more competition among insurers .
He likens the expected effect to what happened in the telecommunications market when cell phone subscribers were allowed to take their numbers with them when they switched providers , spurring carriers to offer unlimited minutes , free texting and other cost - saving inducements .
Some drivers would benefit , but extending the continuous - coverage discount to new customers would undermine Proposition 103 ’s link between rating factors and risk , said Richard Holober of the Consumer Federation of California .
“ It is discriminatory against people who are down on their luck and serving their country , ” Holober said , adding that those who suspend their insurance for more than 90 days because they ’re not driving — such as students away at college or military personnel posted out of state — would have to pay surcharges to reactivate their coverage .
The Stop Prop 17 activists argue in the forthcoming state voters guide that it could cost returning drivers up to $ 1,000 more to get insurance if the ballot measure passes .
That worries voters like Ben Gartner , a Los Angeles teacher who sold his car and stopped his insurance back when gas was selling for $ 4 a gallon .
Gartner biked or rode the bus to his job at Roosevelt High School for a year and a half before deciding he wanted the convenience of a car again .
He fears he could be subject to a surcharge if Proposition 17 passes because it would allow any lapse in the last five years to be considered in setting premiums .
“ I would feel it was very unfair if I had to pay more for insurance because I was n’t driving .
I did n’t have anything negative on my driving record .
I did it to save money , ” he said .
The Yes on 17 lobby says opponents are using scare tactics .
“ California is the most highly regulated insurance market in the country , with significant consumer protections , and our opponents know darn well the Department of Insurance would never approve rates with the surcharges they allege would occur , ” said Mike Darrell , executive director of the Sacramento - based Alliance of Insurance Agents and Brokers .
Most of the insurance industry has come out in favor of the measure , with varying degrees of intensity .
Sam Sorich , president of the Assn. of California Insurance Companies , said the group ’s members were divided on whether to take a stand on Proposition 17 .
A majority of the board of directors — he would n’t say how large — voted to endorse it in the expectation that it would increase competition and benefit clients by lowering rates .
But the association does n’t plan to contribute to the campaign or actively promote the measure ’s passage , Sorich said .

The derailing this week of the House Disclose Act gave Republicans – still reeling from Rep. Joe Barton ’s “ apology ” to BP CEO Tony Hayward this week – a rare chance to gloat about the pitfalls of cozying up to special interests .
“ Van Hollen ’s carve - out for special interests has proven about as popular as first - time World Cup ref Koman Coulibaly ’s blown call today , which cost the United States a victory , ” said House Republican whip Eric Cantor ( R ) of Virginia in a blog today .
His barb was aimed at Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D ) of Maryland , chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
At issue is a deal brokered by the House Democratic leadership to exempt the powerful National Rifle Association ( NRA ) and others from disclosure requirements in a new campaign finance law .
The legislation aimed to restore campaign finance limits stripped away by a controversial 5 - 4 US Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission , which scrapped restrictions on when and how much corporations and unions can spend to influence elections .
The proposed law would ban some corporations from funding campaign ads and require others to disclose their top five donors in ads and on their websites .
“ We believe voters have an absolute right to know who is spending money to try to influence their vote .
And this will prevent big special interests from hiding behind front organizations , sham entities , to try and hide from the voter what they 're doing .
Nobody , nobody should be afraid of this transparency unless they have something to hide , ” said Rep. Van Hollen in a press conference introducing the act on April 29 .
But cribbing from President Obama ’s playbook in cutting early deals with pharmaceutical companies and other potential opponents to move health care legislation , Democrats this week cut deals exempting the NRA as well as the Sierra Club , the Humane Society , and AARP from disclosure requirements in the bill .
The initial deal exempted organizations with more than 1 million members , in existence more than 10 years , with members in all 50 states , and no more than 15 percent of their funds from corporations .
Only the NRA met those criteria .
On Thursday , House leaders lowered the threshold to 500,000 members – a change that also exempted the Sierra Club , AARP , and the Humane Society .
The backroom deals set off a firestorm among the unexempted and their allies in the House , prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to postpone a vote that had been expected on Friday .
“ We remain very troubled about the creation of two - tiers of coverage for this legislation and would prefer no exceptions at all , " said Reps. Raul Grijalva ( D ) of Arizona and Rep. Lynn Woolsey ( D ) of California , co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , in a June 17 letter to Speaker Pelosi .
Meanwhile , business groups not part of the carveout rallied their own supporters on Capitol Hill , including moderates in the Blue Dog caucus , to resist the special deals .
“ The political , special - interest nature of the legislation is reflected in the recent addition to the bill of the NRA exemption , " says R. Bruce Josten , chief lobbyist for the US Chamber of Commerce .
“ This ad hoc carve - out is specifically tailored to exempt the National Rifle Association from the bill ’s key restrictions and burdens .
The admitted purpose was to end the NRA ’s opposition to the bill to secure passage , ” he adds .
“ This is clear and unconstitutional discrimination in favor of one speaker and against others . ”
House Democratic leaders remain committed to the legislation , including the NRA carve out , and expect to bring it back to the floor as soon as they can line up more votes .
The NRA initially backed the Supreme Court decision .
“ This ruling is a victory for anyone who believes that the First Amendment applies to each and every one of us , ” said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre in a statement on Jan. 21 .
“ This is a defeat for arrogant elitists who wanted to carve out free speech as a privilege for themselves and deny it to the rest of us ; and for those who believed that speech had a dollar value and should be treated and regulated like currency , and not a freedom .
On May 26 , the NRA had announced opposition to the bill as “ intimidating speech , ” but dropped opposition after the carveout .

I recently joined the Kulinarya Cooking Club , which consists of a group of bloggers who share a love of Filipino cuisine .
What started in Sydney , Australia grew into a truly international bloggerhood , and I ’m thrilled to be part of it .
A monthly theme is chosen , and for June , it was ( appropriately so ) barbecue .
When I think of Filipino barbecue , my mind first turns to our wonderful street food classic : barbecued pork in skewers .
It ’s the kind of food you ca n’t get enough of , no matter how sticky everything gets : your fingers , lips , mouth , cheeks … then you run out of clean napkins and try to sneakily wipe your grubby hands on your jeans .
( Or , if you ’re subtle enough , on the jeans of the person standing next to you . )
Unfortunately , Tom does n’t eat pork .
So I decided on another Filipino classic on the grill : chicken barbecue .
And if you ’re Filipino , you know the words “ chicken barbecue ” never fail to bring to mind the landmark restaurant Aristocrat , where an order of their popular chicken barbecue comes with a serving of Java rice and achara .
I was n’t ambitious enough to attempt Java rice because it ’s been years since I last had it , but I did make achara ( pickled green papaya ) to go with my chicken .
Filipino barbecue is often marinated in a mixture that includes 7 - Up or Sprite , likely for its tenderizing effect .
But that was pretty much all I knew .
So I started out by going online and looking at all the different recipes for Aristocrat - style chicken barbecue .
I bookmarked a few , noticed the common elements in many of them , then sat down to draft my plan of attack .
Then it dawned on me .
Why search the internet when I can get the family recipe directly from the source ?
So I called my mom , who rattled off the recipe over the phone .
I had to scribble furiously , because she was in a rush : she was home watching the NBA finals and did n’t want to miss any of the action .
( Yes , that ’s my mom . )
I noticed her recipe did n’t include catsup ( banana catsup or regular tomato catsup ) , which was often mentioned in online recipes as either part of the marinade or a component of the basting mixture .
My mom was adamant : the family recipe for chicken barbecue contains absolutely no catsup .
For good measure , she sent a message to our family cooks back home to verify the recipe she gave me .
This chicken is incredibly moist and flavorful , and the reduced marinade has just the right balance of sweet and savory , having cooked off the tartness of the vinegar .
Paired with achara and plain jasmine rice , it is a combination that instantly recalls our weekly family reunions from long ago , when all that we kids had to worry about was how much we could eat before it became impossible to go right back outside and play hide - and - seek in the yard .
And I ’m so glad I remembered to get the family recipe instead of relying on internet versions , because for me , this is the taste that brings me back home .
Filipino Chicken Barbecue ( Inihaw na Manok )
Serves 4
If you have concerns about boiling the used marinade , double the measurements for the marinade and set half aside for the basting mixture .
Ingredients : 1 1/2 cups cane vinegar , or 1 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup sugar
3 bay leaves , torn or crushed
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 garlic cloves , finely grated
1 tablespoon finely ground black pepper
12 oz .
7 - Up or Sprite
5 pounds chicken leg quarters or your preferred chicken pieces , preferably dark meat , cleaned and trimmed of excess fat
In a large container that can hold the chicken pieces , combine all ingredients except chicken .
Mix until sugar is dissolved .
Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or up to 8 hours .
Take the chicken out and transfer the pieces to a large plate .
While waiting for the chicken to come to room temperature , pour the marinade into a small sauce pan ( or discard the marinade and pour the additional reserved marinade into a sauce pan ) and boil over medium to high heat until the marinade is reduced to a sticky syrup .
Heat your grill to 350 degrees or medium heat .
Grill chicken pieces , bone side down , for about 8 minutes , then reduce the grill temperature to 275 degrees .
Continue grilling bone side down for about 20 minutes , basting once .
Flip the pieces over and grill for another 20 minutes , basting occasionally .
Continue grilling , flipping , and basting until chicken is fully cooked .
Check for doneness by piercing the joint to ensure juices run clear , or until chicken reaches 163 F internal temperature .
Take chicken off the grill , tent with foil , and let rest for about 5 minutes before serving .
Filipino chicken barbecue .
Perfect for summer cookouts and for fueling up before you spend hours chasing your cousins all over the yard .
The only caveat is that one serving of this can cause an acute attack of homesickness .
P.S. Stop back in tomorrow , when I share our family recipe for achara .
It ’s incredibly easy to make , and the perfect condiment for all kinds of grilled meat .
In this post I ’m going to provide some very practical outsourcing tips for Internet Marketing .
I ’m doing this more and more in my own business , and have learned some things that I want to pass onto you guys , so you can get the most out of your own outsoucing .
Having a varied readership to this blog , some people being complete newbies and other having more experienced , I think it ’s a good idea to first explain what Outsourcing is .
Outsourcing is where you pay someone else to do tasks for your online business that you do n’t need to be doing , so that you can move your overall operation forward much faster .
What to Outsource ?
The first thing you need to decide is what to outsource .
Now this will vary , depending on what marketing approach your pursue in your business .
However some of the main things that I outsource are link building and article writing and spinning .
I also outsource graphic design too , but this is not on a regular basis .
When to Outsource ?
Often people ask me if they should outsource jobs for their business straight away , and my answer to this is “ no ” .
The reason I say this , is because in order to get the best result from your outsourcing , you need to know how to do the tasks that you want outsourced first .
Before I outsource any link building or writing job , I always make sure that I have done the task myself .
Before I hired any staff to work for me , I did everything myself .
I wrote and spun all my own articles , built all my own links and websites .
There ’s two reasons I do this .
The first one being , that if I have done the task myself , I know how long it takes to complete , and number two , I know what kind of results to expect .
By doing this I know what is reasonable to expect from my outsource staff .
Not only that though , you can also offer advice and solutions to your workers if they are finding the task difficult , as you ’ll have experience doing it , and be aware of the common difficulties and how to overcome these .
I also advise people to wait until they are making money online before they outsource any tasks .
When you are starting out in Affiliate Marketing , it is important to keep your costs low and your profits high .
So hold off on the outsourcing until you can see money coming in , and it does n’t have to be much , what is more important is that you know how you did it and could easily make more money if you replicated what you did .
One lucky sale is not really a good indication that you have worked out a good system to replicate .
How to Outsource ?
Once you are ready to get some outsource staff working for you , I recommend that you go over to Odesk , as they have a huge number of workers for you to choose from , and they can work for you on a per project basis or ongoing .
That link to Odesk is an affiliate link by the way , however I am a user of this service so believe me it ’s quality .
I HIGHLY recommend that you look for people in the Philippines , as my experience with workers from here is very good .
However make sure you read their background information carefully and select people right for the job .
When you have shortlisted a few people that you think will be good for the job , what I recommend you do next , is set up a 30 mins test for them to complete , so you can assess how competent they are and how well the follow instructions .
One of the best free tools to help you communicate with your workers is Jing .
I did a post on Jing recently and I recommend you read that to learn more about it : Using Jing .
Also I always request that my outsource staff be available on skype , so that if I need to contact them with changes or feedback , I can do so easily .
My closing outsourcing tip is to make sure you check the work of your outsource staff early on .
Do n’t make the mistake of waiting until they have done 20 hrs for you , and then review their work .
I ’m only telling you from experience , because I have had a few disasters in my time .
So make sure after the first day of work , that you get them to send you what they did .
I hope these outsourcing tips for Internet Marketing were helpful !

During the 1980s , VW introduced U.S. car enthusiasts to the “ hot hatch ” when they released the VW Rabbit GTi during the 1983 model year .
A “ hot hatch ” is a small , sporty hatchback .
Designers of the original GTi made up for a lack of power with a lightweight chassis equipped with special aerodynamic features .
Although the first , second , and third generation Rabbit and Golf GTi were released without a turbocharger , later year models were equipped with a now - legendary engine called the 1.8T .
Automotive enthusiasts soon discovered that tweaking the turbocharger on the 20 - valve , 1.8 - liter , 4 - cylinder engine increased power output by a large margin .
Power gains of up to 100 horsepower over stock were easily obtained using off - the - shelf parts along with some mechanical know - how or help from a local speed shop .
Other VWs featuring turbocharged engines include the Passat , Jetta , and New Beetle .
There ’s a lot to like about turbocharged VWs , but there are a few downsides to owning one for more than a few years at a time .
Because turbocharged engines ( sometimes called forced - induction engines ) have more moving parts , there are simply more things that can go wrong with them .
One of the biggest problems owners of these cars face is a failing VW turbocharger .
It is pretty easy to diagnose a worn or failing turbocharger .
Telltale signs of a failing VW turbocharger include a significant loss of power or strange noises coming from under your VW ’s hood under heavy acceleration .

Washington ( CNN ) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan once believed a federal law to ban physician - assisted suicide was a " fairly terrible idea . "
The handwritten remarks were part of more than 46,000 documents released Friday , as Senate lawmakers prepare for confirmation hearings for the 50 - year - old Kagan .
The memos detailed Kagan 's service in President Bill Clinton 's Domestic Policy Council , which advised the White House inner circle on a range of issues pending in Congress and the courts .
As deputy to then director Bruce Reed , Kagan offered legal and political advice on an agenda that included abortion , tobacco legislation , AIDS , consumer protections and healthcare .
At issue was a federal challenge to Oregon 's 1994 Death with Dignity Act allowing doctors to prescribe lethal doses of medicine to assist patients to commit suicide .
The law , which passed a state referendum by a slim margin , survived multiple court challenges and attempts to blunt its effectiveness , including a second referendum in 1997 that would have repealed it .
Sixty percent of Oregon 's voters rejected the repeal attempt .
But in early 1998 , the Clinton administration was prepared to support the argument that Oregon 's referendum was acceptable and that federal authorities had no power -- under the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) -- to block doctors from prescribing lethal doses of drugs .
In a January 16 , 1998 , memo from the Justice Department , Clinton officials laid out their case , despite internal concerns the law was an improper preemption of federal power .
At the top of the document , Kagan added her thoughts .
" DOJ [ Justice Department ] is ready to opine that Oregon doctors who assist suicides are not violating the Controlled Substances Act ( This is contrary to an initial DEA [ Drug Enforcement Administration ] ruling , " wrote Kagan .
" We need to decide whether to accompany this ruling with a request for new legislation making assisted suicide a federal crime .
I think this is a fairly terrible idea , but I know Begala likes it . "
Kagan , in the memo , does not specify why she opposed that idea .
" Begala " is Paul Begala , a longtime Clinton political adviser .
He is now a political contributor for CNN and a Democratic party strategist .
She signed her remarks with " Elena . "
Conservative groups expressed initial concern over this and other memos outlining Kagan 's often blunt views on hot - button issues .
" It shows her as a political thinker , which was her role at the time , " said Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network .
" But as someone who has never been a judge , it is something to look out for , if her approach on the bench will be politically driven .
It can be hard to change that role , to become a fair arbiter of the law and not be a judicial activist . "
The high court the year before the Kagan memo upheld state bans on assisted suicide , concluding there was nothing in the Constitution supporting an individual 's right to die .
But the ruling left open the possibility of state referendums supporting the practice , and Oregon 's measure went into effect after numerous appeals and injunctions .
The Bush administration in the 2000s -- backed by a Republican - led Congress -- vigorously took up the issue to make assisted suicide a federal crime and to challenge the Oregon law , eventually appealing all the way to the Supreme Court .
The justices in January 2006 ruled against the federal government , dismissing the argument the U.S. attorney general has the power to block Oregon 's then - unique law .
Medical groups and patient right advocates supported Oregon , while many religious conservatives backed the Bush administration .

The larger plastic tubing is about the same size as a garden hose but harder plastic .
Smaller tubing is about 1/4 inch .
You can use emitters or drip lines that have a small hole every few inches .
You add taps into the larger harder plastic supply lines with a tap tool which punctures a specific sized hole for a tap .
The taps are just small pieces of plastic with a hole through them and they have nipples at both ends to lock them into the larger tubing and hold the smaller drip line tubing .
The taps are hard to pull back out and will make the hole a little larger .
I found a few taps without holes through them which I guessed were to plug any mistakes .
Make sure you lay out the larger tube to supply water at line pressure to as much of the area you want irrigated as possible .
If you use drip lines , you need to keep them fairly short and roughly the same length so that they drip evenly .
Each hole in the drip line reduces the water pressure and you will barely have any water flow the end of a long length .
I added a very long piece of drip line to a single tap for my first time and the first few feet were ok , but the rest was significantly less .
The emitters are very small holes and I expect them to clog easily so I use a filter and I use a programmable timer to turn the water on and off .
After yesterday 's failure to get enough votes to move forward on emergency spending to help the unemployed and get critical funding to states , Baucus has scaled down the bill .
Maybe now it 's just a minor emergency .
The spending reductions — estimated near $ 20 billion — are accompanied by tax changes tailored to the small - business concerns of Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) as well as venture capital and real estate interests with influence in both parties .
In the bargaining now , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , up for reelection in cash - strapped Nevada , is still holding onto a $ 24 billion , six - month extension of federal Medicaid assistance from January to June next year .
The money is vital to the finances of states like Reid ’s , hit hard by the economic downturn , and he has the support of President Barack Obama .
But the cost of the Medicaid funding makes the program an easy target , and the dollars may still have to be scaled back to win the swing vote of Snowe ’s fellow Maine Republican , Sen. Susan Collins .
The word coming out of D.C. now is that Snowe and Collins are demanding massive cut to that state aid , known as FMAP , in return for their cloture votes .
As many as 900,000 jobs are on the line in the states .
Maine is n't going to be immune from those cuts , where the " shortfall in the budget that begins July 1 would be at least $ 85 million . "
While Snowe and Collins are holding out their votes on cloture -- just like they did in order to get state aid stripped out of the original stimulus package -- Snowe along with others are fighting to protect the tax loopholes that hedge fund managers and S corporation executives have enjoyed for years .
Sen . Evan Bayh ( D - Ind. ) said he remained worried by the cost of the package and failure to do more about long - term deficits .
But in the process , he also won concessions for his state related to disaster low - income - housing tax credits .
And Bayh was also party to a deal with Baucus engineered by Sen. Mark Warner ( D - Va. ) that will further soften House - backed tax reforms targeted at investment - fund managers who now shelter their income at lower capital - gain tax rates ....
In the case of Snowe , her greatest tax concern has been a second reform meant to end a similar abuse under which small - business S corporations are used to shelter income as dividends — exempt from payroll taxes .
This abuse has become a greater cost to the Treasury as the Medicare tax rate has gone up for the wealthy , but Snowe has wanted more refinement so the reforms do n’t create problems in themselves and unfairly impose new charges on small - business owners .
Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins , along with those " moderate " deficit peacocks , are putting more hurt on the people who are already hurting and even trying to increase their ranks so that they can lessen the burden on hedge - fund managers .
If 900,000 more Americans lose their jobs , you can point the finger at the Maine twins .

You may be wondering why a blog dedicated to fandom conventions would be writing about Twitter .
Hell , you may even be wondering what Twitter is !
For those who may not know , Twitter is a social media site that allows users to post 140 character messages to the internet .
Many celebrities have joined the Twitter craze , and as they do Twitter works to officially “ verify ” them so fans know the account is legitimate .
Several Star
Trek actors are among the celebrity Twitter users , and I wanted to give you all a list of them .
Why you ask ?
Well , for one thing , several of these actors will do Twitter - based question and answer sessions , or respond directly to the occasional fan question .
In a way , Twitter has become just like a digital Q&A at a fandom convention .
I happen to think that ’s pretty darn cool .
These celebrities are also using Twitter to tell fans about their upcoming convention appearances , and they sometimes “ tweet ” ( i.e. , post Twitter updates ) while at cons .
Enough jibber jabber , here ’s the list !
Pleas note that these are only confirmed accounts .
Known fakes are listed as the end .
I wo n’t be posting ones that are unverified .

Encore performance !
It is the same two - act play ( farce ) of May 2005 .
The stage is the same .
The director is the same .
The stagehands are the same .
The script is the same .
The players are the same stage veterans .
The stagecraft ( lighting , makeup , props ) is the same .
The audience is the same .
Act I , last scene , ' End game ' .
( Kick the propaganda machine into overdrive and pump up the media volume !
Ethiopian opposition leaders , enter stage right . )
On 28 April 2010 , Reuters reported :
' The Ethiopian opposition may provoke violence during the first national elections since a disputed 2005 poll ended with street riots and the jailing of politicians , the ruling party has said .
The government said in 2005 that the violence was planned to force an unconstitutional change after a vote in which both sides claimed victory . '
On 13 April 2010 , dictator Meles Zenawi issued a thinly veiled threat to Ethiopian opposition leaders that he would hunt them out of their hiding places and burn them at the stake if they boycotted the May 2010 ' election ' , or agitate the youth for political action :
' If my estimation is correct , some of you are walking this direction [ boycotting the election ] .
I think you are making a huge mistake because to light the fire and at the last [ moment ] to go into hiding would not be good , because to light the fire and [ be ] behind it , and also to fight and use the blood of children , that would not be something that is useful . '
It is plain to see that the political and ' legal ' stage is now set for a round - up of opposition leaders once an official victory is declared over the already - won ' election ' scheduled for 23 May .
( How else could Zenawi make such arrogantly confident threats unless he is absolutely certain that he has already won the ' election ' ? )
A cascade of distortions , accusations and allegations of incitement to violence , charges of ' acting against the constitution ' and other malicious hyperbole are flooding the media as part of a calculated pre-emptive campaign of pre-'election ' intimidation of opposition leaders , and in preparation of public opinion for the inevitable incapacitation , neutralisation and paralysis of all opposition in Ethiopia in a post -' election ' period .
Professor Beyene Petros , an opposition party leader for the past 18 years , is the most recent victim of accusations of inciting violence .
He is alleged to have said that 'if the public is not happy with a government they can create some kind of problem , can protest and can bring down the government without elections . '
He immediately rejected the allegations : ' Violence was not implied at all in my argument .
I was just talking about normal democratic process .
They [ the ruling regime ] have been trying to find something in an effort to incriminate us …
I spoke of a public that votes into and votes out of power , all through the ballot box .
And that is mandated by the constitution .
There was no incitement to violence . '
Eskinder Nega , the distinguished and highly respected Ethiopian journalist who , together with his equally distinguished and internationally acclaimed journalist wife Serkalem Fasil , has long suffered at the hands of the ruling dictatorship , in his latest piece in the series ' Letter from Ethiopia ' described Beyene as ' one reliable politician , by universal consensus , that sincerely abhors any prospect of violence ' .
A few months ago , opposition Medrek - coalition leaders Gizachew Shiferwa and Gebru Asrat were accused of allegedly declaring that they would boycott the May 2010 ' election ' , drawing Zenawi ’s ire and threats .
They denied making any such declarations .
Another Medrek leader , Seeye Abraha , is now the victim of a vilification campaign in Tembien district in Tigray where he is running for a parliamentary seat .
Voters in Tembien are being told the reason they are getting only partial deliveries of foreign food aid is because Seeye has persuaded the Americans to cut back .
Muktar Keder , head of the office of the ruling party , three days ago accused Seeye of ' paving the way for violence ' by allegedly stating that if he did not win in Tembien district , it meant the elections would be rigged .
For the past year , Zenawi has repeatedly accused the opposition of bad faith in the international media :
' The intent of these individuals is to try and discredit the election process from day one , ' declared Zenawi at a press conference on 16 September 2009 .
( It baffles the reasonable mind to comprehend the prospect of a credible election in May 2010 when in 2008 opposition candidates won just three of 3.6 million seats in local and by -elections .
But facts and logic play no role in this political drama . )
Zenawi has also accused opposition leaders of whipping up passions with inflammatory rhetoric , and charged that unnamed opposition elements were collaborating ' covertly and overtly ' with Eritrea .
When opposition leaders protested the harassment and intimidation they were facing at the hands of the ruling party and complained that over 200,000 monitors appointed for the May ' election ' are either members or supporters of the ruling party , making it impossible to hold free - and - fair elections , Zenawi blasted them : ' These accusations are meant to incite public unrest and violence .
I would like to remind you ( opposition ) that this would result in dire consequences on yourselves . '
In the past few months , Zenawi and his spokesmen have repeatedly threatened to arrest and prosecute opposition party leaders who have violated the so - called election code of conduct after the ' election ' is over .
All of the pre-election wrath and fury signifies two things : 1 ) intimidation of opposition leaders into permanent silence ; and 2 ) if they insist on speaking up and challenging Zenawi , to set them up for kangaroo - court prosecution and imprisonment .
The grand plan is now in place and the die cast to round up opposition leaders and jail them after the ' election ' , regardless of what they do or do not do .
It is a question of when , not if .
We have seen this play ( farce ) staged time and again .
They used the same frame - up to re-arrest and jail Birtukan Midekksa , the first female leader of a political party in Ethiopia ’s history , in December 2009 .
Zenawi fabricated the most absurd and ridiculous charge one can possibly imagine as a pretext to knock her out of the running in the May 2010 election .
He said she had denied receiving a pardon in July 2007 in a talk she gave in Sweden .
She was ordered to retract .
A big media buzz was created to stir up anxious anticipation .
Then with the precision of a Delta Force commando unit , a horde of security thugs in unmarked vehicles literally snatched Birtukan off the street like some murderous terrorist for the ultimate Hollywood - style dramatic effect .
She was immediately thrown into solitary confinement where she remained for six months .
The fact is that Birtukan had never denied receiving a pardon .
In ' Q’ale ' ( ' My testimony ' ) , her last public statement issued a couple of days before her street - side abduction , she made full acknowledgement of receiving a pardon by signing an official document to that effect .
The US State Department Human Rights Report ( 2010 ) stated that Birtukan ' was held in solitary confinement until June [ 2009 ] , despite a court ruling that indicated it was a violation of her constitutional rights ' .
Flashback to November 2005 .
Zenawi ordered the arrest and imprisonment of nearly the entire opposition leadership , human rights advocates , journalists and civil society leaders .
He said they had orchestrated street violence in the post -2005 election period that resulted in hundreds of casualties .
He claimed they had incited the use of violence to change the government , the same charge levelled at Professor Beyene and other opposition leaders :
' It 's very obvious now that the opposition tried to change the outcome of the election by unconstitutional means .
We felt we had to clamp down .
We detained them and we took them to court .
In the process , many people died , including policemen .
Many of our friends feel that we overreacted .
We feel we did not .
There is room for criticism nevertheless it does not change the fact that this process was a forward move towards democracy and not a reversal .
Recent developments have simply reinforced that .
The leaders of the opposition have realised they made a mistake .
And they asked for a pardon , and the government has pardoned them all . '[ 1 ]
The very official Inquiry Commission that Zenawi himself set up in 2005 to investigate the post-election violence totally and completely exonerated the opposition leaders and the demonstrators of any wrong - doing , and totally and completely pinned the blame on the security forces who were under Zenawi ’s direct command and control :
' There was no property destroyed .
There was not a single protester who was armed with a gun or a hand grenade as reported by the government - controlled media that some of the protesters were armed with guns and bombs .
The shots fired by government forces were not to disperse the crowd of protesters but to kill by targeting the head and chest of the protesters . '[ 2 ]
Of course , Zenawi knew the opposition had nothing to do with any street violence or insurrection in 2005 .
He had hatched a plan to jail the opposition leaders long before the 2005 election was ever held , as he is doing right now .
For instance , on 6 May 2005 , nine days before the elections and months before the occurrence of any street demonstrations , Reuters reported that Zenawi had accused opposition leaders of trying to cause a ' Rwanda - type genocide ' by spreading ethnic hatred and strife , organising a violent uprising aimed at overthrowing the government , and treason .
Indeed , after opposition leaders were arrested in November 2005 , they were charged with genocide , which was dropped after the international legal community and media and unnamed diplomatic sources described the purported evidence of genocide as ' laughable ' .
Zenawi was pretty candid about how he orchestrated the arrest of the opposition leaders in November 2005 .
Congressman Christopher Smith , chair of the house subcommittee on Africa , global human rights and international operations , recounted a revealing conversation he had with Zenawi in his opening statement at a hearing ( H.R. 4423 ' Ethiopia Consolidation Act of 2005 ' ) on 28 March 2006 :
' During my visit to Addis last August [ 2005 ] , I met with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi , and I asked him why he had not investigated the June shootings of demonstrators by agents of his government .
His response was that the investigation might require the arrest of opposition leaders , and he did n’t want to do that while by - elections were still scheduled .
He went on to tell me that he had dossiers on all the opposition leaders and could arrest them for treason whenever he wanted .
Thus , their arrests were all but certain even before the events that ostensibly led to their being incarcerated . '[ 3 ]
What we are witnessing today is that same pre-planning that was set in motion in 2005 to swoop down and scoop up the opposition leaders who have challenged Zenawi after the election .
For the past weeks , there has been a barrage of the same types of allegations , accusations and charges made in 2005 .
When Zenawi says opposition ' accusations are meant to incite public unrest and violence ' , he is setting them up for a charge of violation of Article 240 ( armed rising or civil war ) .
When he says opposition elements are ' covertly and overtly ' collaborating with certain groups and countries , he is preparing to charge them with violations of Article 248 ( high treason ) .
When Sekoutore , the ruling dictatorship ’s spokesperson , declared on 28 April that ' Any statements that propagate violence and illegal ways of changing government are banned by the code of conduct , ' he is signalling a charge of violation of Article 238 ( ' Outrages against the constitution or the constitutional order ' ) .
Facts are being fabricated in the dirty tricks department of the ruling regime for election day shenanigans to charge opposition leaders with violations of Article 239 ( ' Obstruction of the exercise of constitutional powers ' ) .
There will likely be episodes manufactured between now and ' election ' day to pin on the opposition allegations of sabotage or terroristic acts in violation of Article 247 ( ' Impairment of the defensive power of the state ' ) .
There is no question whatsoever that opposition leaders will be charged with violations of Article 269 ( genocide ) as it can be proven beyond a shadow of doubt that all of them have listened to the Voice of America Amharic Service programmes , which according to Zenawi 'has copied the worst practices of radio stations such as Radio Mille Collines of Rwanda in its wanton disregard of minimum ethics of journalism and engaging in destabilizing propaganda ' .
In the last three weeks prior to the ' election ' , we are witnessing a repeat of the 2005 election endgame .
It is all so obvious .
The poor opposition leaders are being set up for the final coup de grace as they stand helplessly crying out for democracy and the rule of law .
They ruling dictatorship will crank up the propaganda machine to the max in the next three weeks to fabricate stories that will create a negative public perception of the opposition leaders .
The regime will use every trick to put the opposition in a false and bad light in the media ( while denying them an opportunity to respond to charges and allegations in the ruling party - run state media ) .
They will distort , exaggerate and misrepresent the public statements of opposition leaders .
They will ratchet up the general climate of fear , paranoia , anxiety and uncertainty in the country as election day approaches .
There will be daily talk about threats of violence .
There will be arrests of individuals committing violence .
The spectre of ' Shabia ' and ' Al - Shabab ' conspiracies will be raised .
Just yesterday , it was announced that the regime had arrested 10 members of the Somali Al - Shabab Islamist group and the Oromo Liberation Front as they were allegedly preparing to launch terrorist activities in Ethiopia ahead of the ' elections ' .
There will be reports of mysterious incidents of explosions in which the ' evidence ' points to the opposition .
Late last week , the ruling regime in a press conference accused Medrek of attempting to kill one of its party members in the Ilan Gelan woreda in the Western Showa Zone of Oromia region .
There was a reported fight at Addis Ababa University ( AAU ) between regime and Medrek supporters , resulting in injuries in the last 48 hours .
The regime will seek out any convenient pretexts and excuses to declare a state of emergency , beginning at the close of the polls on 23 May , just as they did in 2005 .
Political gatherings of any kind will be prohibited for the months following the ' election ' .
The regime will declare victory on election day before all the votes are counted , and they will stage repeated delays in announcing the official election results in the following weeks to give the impression that meticulous vote - counting is being done .
And on and on .
Of course , all of this is also intended to give the international community an early warning of a massive crackdown that will take place , and to prepare them not to ' overreact ' when the sledgehammer falls on the opposition ’s head .
It is all déjà vu .
We saw this farcical Kangaroo Theatre Production in 2005 .
When will they open up the ' dossiers ' on the opposition leaders ?
When will the sledgehammer fall ?
When will they scoop them up ?
On 23 May ?
Maybe the 25th ?
30 June ?
When will they join their leader Birtukan for a long post-election rest and relaxation at the Akaki Hilton Spa and Resort ( AHSR ) [ AKA Akaki Federal Prison ] ?
There is an old prophesy told in the lyrics of a song of African slaves from the harrowing days of slavery in America : ' God gave Noah the Rainbow Sign : No more water .
The fire next time !'
No Rainbow Sign for Ethiopia in 2010 !
Intermission : Act II resumes on 23 May 2010 .

When the World Wide Web went live in 1991 , it consisted of static pages of text connected to each other by hyperlinks , and that 's pretty much what it remained for years .
But from the outset , the Web 's inventor , Tim Berners - Lee , had envisioned a much more sophisticated Web , a so - called Semantic Web , which would n't just store data but would actually know what it meant .
Now an MIT professor , Berners - Lee also directs the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) , a standards body whose industrial participants include everybody from Adobe to Yahoo , and which maintains an office at MIT 's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab .
The W3C has just published a new standard that should help bring the Semantic Web that much closer to fruition .
If the current Web is like a giant text file — which you can search for instances of particular words — the Semantic Web would be like a database , where every item of information is categorized , and new queries can combine categories in any imaginable way .
You could , for instance , search the Web for a restaurant within a mile of a railway station in a town with a theater that offers vegetarian lasagna and at least one lamb dish .
And if you wanted the restaurant ’s menu , you could pull up just the menu — not page after page of review sites that happened to use the word " menu .
" But while an ordinary database has categories selected in advance by a programmer , the Semantic Web is " a database where each person controls their own data , " says Sandro Hawke , systems architect at the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) .
" You have your own parts of the database , so you can put whatever data out there that you want .
" A giant networked database where people control their own data has obvious advantages : huge numbers of people can contribute to it , and they can ensure that their contributions are n't categorized or recorded incorrectly .
But it also has an obvious disadvantage :
There 's no guarantee that people will organize and label their data in a uniform way .
To take a simple example , suppose that two nearby medical clinics put their staff lists online .
Semantic
Web technologies would allow the clinics to categorize the information in the lists .
But suppose that one clinic chose to label the surnames of its doctors " surname , " and the other clinic chose the label " last name . "
A Web search that listed local doctors by " surname " might not pick up those labeled " last name , " and vice versa .
In fact , an existing Semantic Web standard , the Web Ontology Language , solves this problem .
The language gives programmers a way to specify that , for instance , " last name , " " surname , " and maybe " family name " or just " last " indicate the same types of data .
But what if a third clinic , while still adopting Semantic Web technology , chooses to dump first names , last names , and middle initials into a single category , labeled " name " ?
A direct mapping of category to category will no longer work .
Instead , unifying the data on different sites requires a rule , such as , Put everything up to the first space character in " first name , " anything after the last space character in " last name , " and anything else in " middle .
"
The newly released Semantic Web standard is called the Rule Interchange Format , or RIF , and it gives Web programmers a way to write rules for translating between data on different sites .
But that 's not the only purpose rules serve on the Web .
For instance , Hawke points out , an online Web retailer might offer customers free shipping if their total purchases exceed some threshold in a given time period ; but the retailer 's
Web servers might store no data about its customers other than individual invoices .
The code for sifting through the invoices and determining whether to offer the discount is another example of a rule .
" Part of the standards game is to have these very different use cases around the same table and then get one standard that can be used in all these different pieces of software , " Hawke says .
If the RIF standard becomes widely adopted , it 's likely to go unnoticed by most Internet users .
The Web is already replete with pages that aggregate data from other sites : A personalized Google home page , for instance , might include headlines from several different news sources , weather reports from yet another site , and stock prices from still another .
When such content aggregators are already popular online destinations , it can be hard to convey exactly what the advantage of a Semantic Web would be .
But as Hawke puts it , " You can always build something to aggregate data you already know about " ; what the Semantic Web offers is a way to aggregate data you do n't already know about .
A small site that lists weekend events in a particular neighborhood , for instance , could retrieve data from sources that did n't even exist when it was built , as long as they categorized their data according to Semantic Web standards .
Although it has been nearly 20 years since Berners - Lee launched the first website , if his original idea finally comes to fruition , " it'll happen so quickly that no one will know , " Hawke says .
" They 'll just notice the Internet doing more cool things .
" Video : Melanie GonickSandro
Hawke , systems architect for the World Wide Web Consortium , discusses the new standards that will bring the Semantic Web a step closer to reality .
IF THE history books do come to recognise the idea of biology 2.0 , then the date it began may well be recorded as May 20th 2010 .
That was the day when Craig Venter announced JCVI - syn1.0 , the world 's first living organism with a completely synthetic genome .
The Frankencell project , as it was known jokingly at the beginning , had been going for 15 years — ever since Dr Venter started to wonder what was the minimal genome necessary to support a living organism .
To find out , he took a bacterium called Micoplasma genitalium , which has a particularly short genome anyway , and knocked its genes out one at a time to see which the bug could live without ( at least in the cushy circumstances of a laboratory Petri dish ) .
The answer was around 100 of its original complement of 485 .
The genetic flexibility this hints at — of a core set of genes and a penumbra of others useful in particular circumstances — has , over the past decade , been confirmed for many other species of bacteria .
Indeed , the way biologists think about the whole idea of “ species ” when they study these micro-organisms is beginning to shift rapidly .
This is part of a general broadening of genomics .
Though navel - gazing into Homo sapiens 's own genome remains of intense interest , the study and manipulation of non-human genomes may ultimately have greater impact .
Dr Venter certainly hopes so .
His company , Synthetic Genomics , based in San Diego , plans to patent the new bug .
It argues that although it is a living organism , which would normally be outside the scope of patent law , it is also a true artefact , not just the product of selective breeding .
The firm will then be able to use it , and the method used to construct it , in its programmes to make fuels and vaccines .
Technology and magic
On the other side of America , in Boston , George Church is taking a different approach .
Unlike Dr Venter , who focuses his energy on one firm , Dr Church is a promiscuous entrepreneur .
He has been involved in the foundation of several companies , including LS9 and Joule Biotechnologies ( which hope to manufacture biofuels ) and Microbia ( which plans to make speciality chemicals ) .
Like Dr Venter , Dr Church has something up his sleeve .
This is MAGE , a somewhat contrived acronym for multiplex automated genome engineering .
Instead of making new genomes from scratch , Dr Church plans to make lots of parallel changes in existing ones .
The idea is to induce simultaneous random mutations in all of the genes in a particular cellular pathway by introducing pieces of DNA which match parts of those genes , but which are attached to short sequences that do not .
As a cell replicates , the foreign DNA is absorbed and the genes in question are modified by the non-matching short sequences .
Thousands upon thousands of different versions of the pathway are thus created , and all are subsequently isolated and tested to see which are most effective .
The process is then repeated on the winners until the desired outcome is achieved .
This can replicate at a cost of thousands of dollars the sort of genetic modifications that have previously cost millions .
Even without the new platforms , non-human genomics is beginning to pay dividends .
Several firms , including Synthetic Genomics , LS9 and Joule , are engineering micro-organisms ( sometimes bacteria , sometimes single - celled algae ) to turn out biofuels resembling the petrol , diesel and kerosene that people put in cars and aircraft .
Existing biofuels , based on ethanol , are less good .
Ethanol is corrosive and has less energy per litre than petrol and diesel .
One firm , Amyris Biotechnologies , is already scaling up to industrial production of such biofuel , but in Brazil , where cheap cane sugar provides the raw material , rather than in the United States , where it is based .
Joule plans to use an even cheaper raw material : the carbon - dioxide exhaust from power stations .
It is one of the firms working on single - celled algae , tweaking their metabolic pathways to improve the rate at which CO2 is fixed by photosynthesis and then converted into hydrocarbons that can be used in cars .
Fuels are an attractive alternative to drugs for the new generation of synthetic biologists because they are not subject to regulatory whim to the extent that drugs are .
If anything , regulation is likely to favour them because their raw material is , either directly or indirectly , carbon dioxide that has come from the atmosphere or would end up there .
That makes them green in the eyes of governments , and therefore a good thing .
The smell of money
Fuel , however , is a low - value commodity .
A more profitable way to avoid the regulators may be to make complicated high - price chemicals such as fragrances .
This is what Allylix , of San Diego , California , is doing .
The firm 's founders realised that biological synthesis of certain sorts of molecule is much more efficient than chemical synthesis .
Many organic molecules contain what are known as chiral centres .
These are places where the atoms can be arranged either left - handed or right - handed .
In biochemistry , handedness can matter .
Left - and right - handed versions may , for example , smell different .
Traditional chemical synthesis cannot distinguish between left - and right - handed versions , so they have to be separated afterwards , which is tedious .
Moreover , if there are lots of chiral centres in a molecule , and each matters , the yield of the version with the right combination can be minuscule .
Allylix gets around this by engineering the genes for new biological pathways into yeast cells .
The molecular family it concentrates on is the terpenes , which are used as fragrances and flavours .
Some are very costly .
Sandalwood essence , for example , is a terpene , and the demand for its potent smell means the tree it comes from is becoming rare .
Allylix has duplicated the smell of sandalwood industrially , by extracting the genes for the relevant enzymes from sandalwood trees .
Indeed , its researchers have improved on nature .
They have identified the parts of the enzyme molecules that carry out the reactions , and tinkered directly with the DNA that describes these parts , in order to improve their efficiency .
Microbia plans something similar , using Dr Church 's MAGE technology , though its first products will be colourings rather than fragrances .
If genes are to be the raw material of a new technology , then it would be useful for researchers to know how many there are out there .
The answer is , a staggering number .
Most of them are bacterial .
Though the average bacterium has fewer than 5,000 genes , compared with around 20,000 protein - coding genes in the average mammal ( bacteria do not go in much for RNA - only genes ) , there are lots of species of bacteria .
In his round - the - world cruise after he left Celera , Dr Venter reckoned he identified 5 m new bacterial genes — and that was just a start .
Measuring bacterial diversity in genes rather than species makes sense because it is no longer obvious exactly what constitutes a bacterial species .
In the view of Julian Parkhill , of the Sanger Institute , near Cambridge , England , bacteriologists need to shift the focus of their investigations from organisms to systems .
The geneticists ' workhorse , E. coli , for example , has about 4,500 genes .
Only 1,500 - 2,000 of these are always present , however .
The remainder of any given E. coli bacterium 's genome is drawn from a pool of about 20,000 other genes that the organisms swap with gay abandon .
In only a tenuous sense , then , is E. coli a species in the way that , say humans or mice are species .
The same thing is true of other well - studied bugs , such as those that cause typhus and plague , and is likely to be true of most bacteria .
Thirty - four years ago Richard Dawkins , an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University , proposed the idea that “ selfish genes ” , not individual organisms or entire species , are the units on which evolution acts .
In the case of bacteria , which seem to exchange genes promiscuously , that seems an excellent way of looking at things .
In a sense , such profligacy extends to humanity , too .
Add in the genes of the bacteria that live in peaceable collaboration with the average human ( in his gut , on his skin and so on ) , and the “ human ” genome expands from 23,000 protein - coding genes to something more like 3 m , according to Francis Collins .
Nor is it pure sophistry to think of these genes as part of an extended human genome .
Many of the bacteria in question are genuinely mutualistic with their hosts , helping the process of digestion or warding off pathogenic bugs .
This is scarcely explored territory .
Dr Collins estimates that 90 % of these human symbionts cannot be cultured by normal laboratory methods .
America 's National Institutes of Health , which he heads , is backing yet another of genomics ' big collaborative efforts , the Human Microbiome Project , to help put that right .
Nor is the human microbiome merely of academic interest .
For example , some think that the mix of bacteria in a person 's gut can affect his chances of becoming obese .
If those studying the genetics of obesity concentrate all their efforts on the genes in human cells , they might thus be looking in the wrong place .
The other area where genomics is likely to have a big practical impact is agriculture .
At the moment , despite the brouhaha they have created in some countries , genetically modified plants are primitive things .
Most of them have had but a single gene tweaked , either to make them poisonous to pestilential insects or resistant to a particular herbicide so that it can be used freely .
Even so , GM crops are big business .
A recent report by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications , a not - for - profit outfit that monitors the use of GM crops , suggested that more than three - quarters of the world 's soyabean plants are genetically modified , along with half the cotton and more than a quarter of the maize .
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
The next generation will be bigger business still .
Ceres , a small biotech firm based in Thousand Oaks , California , is collaborating with Monsanto , a giant agribusiness company , to make crops better in all sorts of ways .
Their genes are being tweaked to increase the plants ' drought - resistance and improve their absorption of nitrogen .
Ceres 's collaboration with Monsanto involves traditional crops such as maize , but Ceres is also interested in the energy business .
Before fossil fuels became ubiquitous , plants — in the form of firewood — were one of humanity 's main sources of power .
Ceres hopes those days will soon return .
One way to release useful energy from plant matter is to ferment it into biofuels , as Synthetic Genomics , LS9 and Amyris are trying to do .
Ceres is involved in this business , too , but Richard Hamilton , the firm 's boss , is hedging his bets .
Whether biofuels have a big future is a moot point .
At the moment the car industry seems to view electricity as the motive power of the future .
But that does not worry Dr Hamilton because even if the cars of the future are electric , the electricity will have to come from somewhere — and if that somewhere is not fossil fuels , then it might be from burning plant matter .
Viewed in this light , plant matter is just an alternative form of solar energy .
In hot , dry parts of the world , turning sunlight into electricity directly with solar cells or indirectly with solar - powered steam turbines makes sense .
In places where it is cooler and wetter , the equation changes .
Growing plants and burning them may be a better way .
Moreover , plant matter , once grown , is available 24 hours a day .
It can thus provide an electrical baseload in a way that traditional solar power ( which goes off at night ) cannot .
To this end , Ceres is tinkering with three species of grass : Miscanthus , switchgrass and sorghum .
Its researchers have fiddled with the genes of these so - called energy crops to increase the amount of lignin in them , at the expense of carbohydrates like cellulose .
That makes them more “ woody ” , increasing their energy content .
Ceres is also applying to its energy crops the sorts of genetic modification that it has been developing in collaboration with Monsanto for use in food crops — in particular , improved drought tolerance and the more efficient use of nitrogen .
Ceres energy crops are already on sale and several pilot projects that use them are under way .
Genomics , and the new biology it is bringing , thus promise a bright , practical future .
But some scientists wish to understand things merely for the joy of it .
David Haussler , of the University of California , Santa Cruz , is one of them .
Dr Haussler wants to sequence 10,000 vertebrates , a sixth of the total number of species of fish , amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals .
Last month the BGI , in China , announced it would take on the first 100 of these , for delivery within two years .
Dr Haussler 's aim is to work out the core vertebrate genome and see how it has been modified to produce the incredible diversity of animals with backbones .
The Genome 10 K project will , he reckons , cost $ 50 m .
That is not small change , but it amounts to only $ 5,000 a species , showing , once again , how the price of sequencing has tumbled .
Dr Haussler has focused on vertebrates because he is one .
Uncovering the genomic essentials of this ancient group would be a coup .
But genomics can also help to answer more recent evolutionary questions , in particular about how humans emerged and why they are unique .
The hydrocarbon - rich Gulf countries are facing shortage of gas and might find themselves in a position where they have to import the fuel , a new report said .
Although the global economic slump has reduced the need for gas in most regions , demand in the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) for power generation has outpaced the region 's gas exploration and production .
" Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are facing a reversal of a decades - old status quo : an increasing gas shortage in the region amid a significant supply overhang in the rest of the world , " said the report .
" As a result , GCC find themselves in uncharted territory , an almost contradictory position of having to import gas , when they have exported gas for decades , " according to the report by Booz and Company .
" Importing gas into the resource - rich countries of the GCC seems counterintuitive .
The six member countries of the GCC collectively hold roughly 23 per cent of global gas reserves , " the report said .
" However , the extent of the gas supply - demand imbalance in the region has mandated that the countries of the GCC , with the exception of Qatar , at the very least consider importing gas to meet rapidly rising demand , " said George Sarraf a partner at Booz & Company .
According to the report , increasing power consumption and the share of gas in power generation : Between 1998 and 2008 , GCC economies grew at a rate of about 7.6 per cent per year .
Demand for both gas and electricity has kept pace with regional GDP growth and economic diversification , posting annual gains of 5.5 per cent and 6.1 per cent , respectively .
Depleting oil fields , where natural gas is used for re-injection to maintain reservoir pressure and oil production capacity , are another major source of gas consumption in the GCC.
GCC countries currently manage their gas shortage by reducing gas re-injection and directing gas to end consumers .
That strategy , however , is not sustainable over the long term .
" Although groundbreaking alternative technologies are currently being developed and deployed on a pilot basis , it is unlikely that they will significantly reduce the demand for gas , " said Dr Raed Kombargi , a partner at Booz & Company .
The emergence of the gas - based petrochemical sector has been one of the great GCC success stories over the last three decades .
Low gas prices provide a competitive edge for GCC businesses to increase investment and add significant new capacity within the next few years .
As a result , production of polyethylene and polypropylene in the Middle East will more than double between 2008 and 2012 and steel and aluminium production may increase as much as six - fold in the same period , the report said .
On my drive east earlier this month I read a bunch of audio books , including Isaac Asimov 's I , Robot .
It 's basically a collection of short stories built around the assumption that we create robots that obey three laws at their core .
The stories are mostly about the laws .
How they mold the relationship between humans and the robots , unforseen consequences of the laws , and what happens when we create robots with slightly different versions of the three laws .
The three laws :
1 . A robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm .
2 . A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings , except where such orders would conflict with the First Law .
3 . A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law .
It struck me , thinking about how the W3C and IETF are controlled by the big tech companies , and how they serve their interests , often in conflict with the interests of users , that perhaps a new kind of standards body is needed .
One which never takes money from tech companies , and has its own version of the three laws .
The restated laws :
1 . A standard may not injure users or , through inaction , allow users to come to harm .
2. Standard - compliant software must obey any orders given to it by users , except where such orders would conflict with the First Law .
3 . A standard must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law .
Okay I know this is a little crude .
But the point is this : Users are supreme .
Tech companies are not even part of the charter of a human - serving standards body .
They may use the standards , but we do n't care one way or the other if they continue to profit , or even exist .
Standards exist to protect the interests of users first .
As a second priority standards do what users want them to do .
And as a third priority , only after the first two are considered , does the standard perpetuate its own existence .
I think after all the years going round and round this loop I 've finally figured out what the bug is .
We let corporations push us around .
They 've made it so we serve them .
That 's what 's wrong with the way technology has been evolving .
Every so often we get back on track , just to have a fresh set of corporations come along and take us off track again .
It 's often necessary to estimate how much a sound level changes .
Our ears interpret a wide range of sound amplitudes , volume or loudness as change in level and change in loudness .
The decibel is a very convenient unit for measuring signal levels in electronic circuits or sound pressure levels in air .
However , changes in the loudness of sounds as perceived by our ears do not conform exactly to the corresponding changes in sound pressure level .
Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlation of physical strength ( amplitude ) .
Loudness , a subjective feeling , is often confused with objective measures of sound pressure level SPL such as decibels .
Definitions :
Sound level or noise level is a physical quantity measured with measuring instruments .
Loudness is a psycho-physical sensation perceived by the human auditory perception or the human ear / brain mechanism .
That is not the same .
We are told by psycho-acousticians that a level 10 dB greater usually means " double the loudness " or " twice as loud " .
A decibel is one - tenth of a bel , which is the logarithm of the ratio of any two energy - like quantities or two field - like quantities .
Ratio doubling means :
− a power level of +3 dB , or a sound intensity level of +3 dB
− an electric voltage level of +6 dB , or a sound pressure level of +6 dB
− a loudness level of about +10 dB
− 10 dB more SPL means 10 times increase in amplifier ( electric ) power .
In the newsgroups these often misunderstood statements are explained rather less accurately .
Decibels can also mean dBSPL or dBA , while a level change is always in dB .
The perceived loudness of the sound depends on several factors : the amplitude , the sound pressure level , the frequency , and the time behaviour of the sound .
A typical question on the internet : " Is 3 dB or 6 dB double the loudness ? "
The answer is : " It is neither 3 dB , nor 6 dB − it is closer to 10 dB " .
Caterpillar , the world 's largest maker of bulldozers and excavators , said in March that the health - care law would cost it $ 100 million , and it took a charge to earnings .
Farm - machinery maker Deere & Co. , of Moline , Ill. , said the law would cost it $ 150 million .
The companies pointed to an overhaul provision that ended a tax break for providing drug coverage to retirees .
Many other major companies , including AT&T , Valero Energy , and AK Steel , also have announced charges prompted by the new law .

Dear Credit Score Report ,
Is there any such thing as a free credit score ?
I ’ll be getting a new car in about three months .
— John M .
Hey John ,
Free credit scores do exist and are relatively easy to find , but the tricky part is getting the scores lenders actually use .
If you ’ve already applied for a loan or a credit card , it ’s not so difficult .
As of July 2011 , new regulations say you are entitled to a free score if you are rejected for a loan application or approved at less than the best terms .
But what if you want to find your score before you apply ?
While you can find websites and other businesses promoting free credit scores to consumers , these typically are n’t the scores banks look to when making lending decisions .
Instead , borrowers should seek out their FICO credit scores , which are used by most U.S. lenders , including the top 25 U.S. credit card issuers and auto lenders .
A non-FICO credit score can give you a rough idea of where you stand relative to other borrowers .
We offer one such tool ourselves : the CreditCards.com free Credit Score Estimator , which will approximate your score based on a few simple questions .
But if you have a loan you want , and especially if you think you might be a borderline case , make the extra effort to obtain your FICO score before you apply — even if you have to pay for it .
Otherwise , you ’re unlikely to see the same number that your lender is using .
If you ’re willing to pay , you can easily purchase your Equifax and TransUnion FICO scores for $ 19.95 each at myFICO.com .
That ’s up from a previous price of $ 15.95 each .
( There ’s no way for consumers to buy a FICO score from Experian , the third of the major credit reporting bureaus . )
However , if you ’re dead set on not paying for your FICO score , it may be possible , but it ’ll take some extra effort .
Under FICO ’s own Score View ( formerly Scores on Statements ) program , participating banks allow customers to see their FICO scores online each month at the lender ’s website .
FICO has previously stated the program makes free scores available to over 1.5 million U.S. consumers , with company spokesman Craig Watts noting that a “ small but growing number of lenders either are already using or are preparing to use Score View to benefit their customers . ”
As for exactly which banks are involved in this program , they ’d rather remain anonymous :
The Pennsylvania State Employees Credit Union is the only participating lender that currently allows itself to be publicly identified by FICO .
At least two other credit unions — Digital Federal Credit Union ( DCU ) in Marlborough , Mass. , and Partners 1st Federal Credit Union in Fort Wayne , Ind. — provide their members with free FICO scores .
DCU says its members can sign up to receive the free FICO scores once a month , via a service that began in March 2010 .
Meanwhile , Partners 1st has “ FICO scores on our computer system ( updated twice annually ) , and any member may ask us for their score , ” says Cindy Emmerich , the credit union ’s vice president of marketing , via e-mail .
As for major banks , in an informal poll conducted by the CreditCards.com editorial team , Bank of America , Chase , Citi , Capital One , Wells Fargo and USAA customer service representatives said they do not supply customers with free FICO scores .
That list obviously is n’t complete , so be sure to ask your own bank if it offers free FICO scores .
American Express offers its consumer and small business cardholders free online access to their credit scores once a year , although in the form of the Experian Plus score .
That scoring model is “ an educational credit score that can range from 330 to 830 , with a higher score indicating lower credit risk , ” explains credit bureau Experian ’s Renee Borsack .
AmEx admits that it does n’t use the Plus score in its lending decisions .
You can also get your FICO score during the home buying process .
Consumers “ who apply for a residential mortgage receive for free the FICO scores used by the lender in underwriting the loan application , ” Watts says .
As noted previously , consumers now also receive free credit scores following loan applications that are n’t approved at the best terms .
Final rules issued in July 2011 by the Federal Reserve and Federal Trade Commission mean that when a borrower ’s low credit score results in a credit denial or higher interest rate , the lender must share information about that score .
If the score used was from FICO , then the borrower may receive a free copy of their FICO credit score .
Of course , since loan applications can lower your FICO score , applying for credit just to get a look at your score is n’t a move I ’d recommend .
Good luck !

The Conversation : Hackers Often Work for Good Not Evil Dan Harris and Nick Bilton delve into the ambiguous world of hackers .
June 23 , 2010  -- AT&T suffered a major security breach two weeks ago when Gawker reported that Internet company Goatse had found a flaw in AT&T's iPad system that exposed more than 100,000 3G iPad owners ' e-mail addresses .
The flaw was quickly fixed , but the e-mail breach embarrassed AT&T , especially since it hit such high profile iPad owners as New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
Goatse is known in Internet security circles as a company that sees its hacking as somewhat of a harmless prank .
Goatse said when it uncovered the crack in AT&T 's system , it tried to alert AT&T .
When AT&T did n't respond to the alert , Goatse took its story to Gawker .
For its part , AT&T said no one from Goatse contacted AT&T , and that the company first learned about the security breach from a customer .
Embarrassing as it was , the hacking brought a larger question into play in the world of cybersecurity :
Can hacking serve a greater good by uncovering and drawing attention to security lapses before they cause even greater harm ?
In today 's Conversation , New York Times technology reporter Nick Bilton talked with Dan Harris about the complex world of hackers : the white hats , or good guys ; the black hats , or bad guys ; and the gray hats -- the guys just out to have fun and stir up trouble , and where Goatse seems to fall .
Weigh in the debate yourself , after watching today 's Conversation .

There is no " real " to dreams ; reality shifts , shapes start as one thing and become something else , the familiar becomes strange and unsettling .
Limbo , the upcoming Xbox Live Arcade release from Playdead Games , brings that world to gaming almost too well .
We 've played the game before , but after having a chance to dig into a preview build in our own home , with headphones , it 's clear that this is a game that rewards a long , deep swim through the gameplay .
The graphics look like hand - drawn charcoal , and the sounds are minimal .
There are no voices , and no clear explanation of what 's going on .
What 's clear is that dying is easy , and it will happen often .
There is no real penalty for losing your life — checkpoints are frequent — and many of the puzzles seem designed to kill you at least once before you understand the mechanic needed to move forward .
You play the part of a small boy trying to rescue his sister , and you can expect him to be impaled , dropped , drowned , poisoned , and crushed .
Our hero is not super , and is almost too vulnerable to his environment
You 'll be constantly scanning the screen for hints on how to move forward .
Are those branches of a tree , or the legs of a spider ?
How do you move a crate to a far - off area you have to flood to move forward ... without drowning ?
Why are these shadowy forms trying to kill you ?
At one point a parasite burrowed into my skull , changing the way the game played .
There are horrific things happening in the world of Limbo , and you 'll be fighting revulsion and the creeping sense of terror just as much as the puzzles .
Playdead is a small , independent studio based in Denmark , and the team has proven what a dedicated group can do in terms of attention to detail .
The physics included here feel different from other games , but they also feel incredibly right .
Everything looks and feels like it should .
The small touches show the level of love given to the game : in one section you ride a boat across a body of water , and walking to the front of the boat causes the little boy to rest his hands on the craft and peer forward .
This does nothing in terms of gameplay , but it sets the stage wonderfully .
It looked like a lost child trapped in a place he does n't understand ... which is of course the entire point .
A sense of dread flavors the entire game
The later puzzles will require some serious time and thought , which is not a bad thing ; this game rewards a dark room and a good pair of headphones .
If you have a weak stomach or spook easily , this may not be your thing .
For everyone else , this is proof that the worst nightmares come at you slowly .
At GDC this year I was able to sit close to the Playdead team as they won two Independent Games Festival awards ; they had just demoed the game for me that morning .
They were beaming at their good fortune , and at the early positive buzz their game was enjoying at the show .
One of them patted my shoulder as he walked by , as if to say " See , we told you . "
While we moan about paying to play games online or about $ 15 map packs and one - time use codes , it 's important to point out what modern gaming does well these days : interesting , smaller games like Limbo can very easily find an audience and acceptance , even on the mainstream consoles .
It 's a beautiful time to be a gamer .
At E3 I bumped into the team again , showing the game off at Microsoft 's booth .
" This is not the environment for Limbo , " I was told , as the developer shrugged at the noise and hustle of the show .
" But we 're able to introduce people to the game . "
I 'm very glad that I get to do the same thing .
There is no set date on the full version of the game yet , but after being given the chance to enjoy a longer look at the title , it 's clear that this will be a very special release .
While a few Republican lawmakers are backing away from Joe Barton 's remarks yesterday , the wingnut faction is embracing the " extortion " line .
Here 's potential 2012 Republican presidential primary candidate Newt Gingrich :

You 're doing grrrrrrreat !
Adding ...
It looks like " Chicago style shakedown " is becoming a popular line with Republicans .

Good to finally hear a response , a promising one at that , but I wo n't get my expectations all worked up just yet .
If you say " plz " because it 's shorter than " please , " I 'll say " no " because it 's shorter than " yes . "

I think it 's natural for Blizzard to collect their thoughts and respond in a comprehensive , thoughtful manner .
They have a much larger public persona to worry about and if they mistakenly say something such as , " Do you really want chat channels ? " when they might mean , " Do n't you want a tool to facilitate communication that 's even better than chat channels ? "
I 'm talking hypothetical here but I hope you get the point .
I think Blizzard 's response , if history is any indication , will be along the lines that they love the passion their fans have for the Starcraft universe .
They understand there are areas where Battle . net 2.0 is deficient but this is a work in progress and rest assured we will give you a tool to facilitate organizing and communicating with large groups of people .
We will implement some form of cross realm play .
To do this right it will take time and we appreciate your patience as we enhance Battle .
net 2.0 to be the awesome platform that we all want it to be .
At least that 's what I hope they say :-)

Now hopefully they actually mean what they say ...

Children have a right to be safe in their own homes .
Parents have a right to raise their children the way they see fit .
Those two rights collided in an ongoing El Mirage parental custody battle .
But the reason for the debate is n't a religious belief , an incident of sexual abuse or a question of health .
The reason is nudism .
The questions raised - whether parents have a right to practice nudism in their own home ; whether children need to be protected from it ; whether law enforcement can seek to stop it - put a new twist on a long - standing issue .
When El Mirage police found out that a mother and stepfather were naked around the woman's two adolescent boys , they investigated and recommended the parents be charged with a crime .
The case raised issues far beyond nudism .
Experts say the investigation illustrated a quandary that can apply to any lifestyle that society decides is controversial :
Which beliefs are outside the law ?
The case
Almost everyone would agree that authorities should step in when a child is being physically , sexually or emotionally abused .
A stranger will likely be arrested if he takes his clothes off in front of a child , even if there 's no sexual misconduct .
It gets murkier when the person stripping down is the child 's parent .
The El Mirage case started in Prescott Valley in November when a 13 - year - old told his father he was uncomfortable at his mother 's home .
The boy 's father had learned about his ex-wife 's visits to Shangri La Ranch , a nudist resort in New River , and questioned his son about life at his mother 's house .
The boy reluctantly said his mother and stepfather walked around their El Mirage home unclothed .
The 13 - year - old said the couple continued to be nude in the home even though he told them he and his 11 - year - old brother were unhappy with it .
His father called authorities .
El Mirage police interviewed the family and were certain there was no sexual misconduct .
The boys ' mother and stepfather said that they did not regularly practice a nudist lifestyle and that the boys had only seen them nude by accident .
Child Protective Services declined to intervene .
But police still pursued a possible criminal case .
Someone had to step in and advocate for the boys , Assistant Police Chief Bill Louis said .
Police turned the case over to the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office .
The case hinged on wording in Arizona 's indecent - exposure statute : someone is " reckless " about whether the other person would be " offended or alarmed " by nudity .
Indecent exposure is a felony when the victim is 14 or younger .
The law
Most indecent - exposure cases involve strangers .
Someone drops his pants near a park or is naked in his home but stands in front of an open window as children walk by .
The El Mirage case was unusual .
Robert J. Campos , a former Maricopa County sex-crimes prosecutor , was skeptical of the investigation .
" As far as a criminal case , I think it 's a real stretch , " said Campos , now a defense attorney .
Arizona 's indecent - exposure statute technically applies , but prosecutors had to decide whether they wanted to intervene when it was unclear the boys were traumatized and the couple did n't appear to have sexual motivations , Campos said .
" I just think it 's an issue of sensitivity as parents and using good judgment and realizing that this is very embarrassing for the boys , " Campos said .
" I think it 's a real slippery slope when the government wants to dictate to a parent that they can't be nude in their own home . "
Nudists ' rights
As police and prosecutors wrangled over the legal issue , the case raised questions about the nudist lifestyle and parenting .
" You do not know how familiar this story is , " said Bob Morton , executive director of the Naturist Action Committee , a non-profit that advocates for nudist legal issues .
He said battling ex-spouses and family members often try to use one parent 's decision to practice nudism as an issue in custody cases .
Parents have a right to decide what goes on inside their homes unless there 's criminal conduct , Morton said .
Nudism does n't apply .
Practicing nudists acknowledge it's a controversial lifestyle , especially when children have n't been raised in it .
" We do believe that respecting boundaries and communicating is critical to a successful nude - recreation experience , " said Erich Schuttauf , executive director of the American Association for Nude Recreation .
He said parents who decide to try out naturist activities or to visit a resort should talk to their children first .
If a child seems uncomfortable , parents should let the child 's views dictate their plans .
That could mean enjoying a nudist vacation without the child or stripping down only when the child is n't around , Schuttauf said .
Parents vs. children
The El Mirage case involves issues that extend beyond a parent 's decision to practice nudism .
Tough questions , legal and societal , arise when a parent promotes a certain lifestyle or makes a controversial choice for the child .
Members of a fundamentalist religion may encourage their young daughters to marry older men with multiple wives .
Parents may treat their child 's cancer with alternative medicine rather than chemotherapy because of religious beliefs .
Parents may opt to have their children skip flu shots .
A divorced parent may allow a significant other with a criminal history to move into the house .
Legal experts and child psychologists say it 's difficult to decide when authorities should intervene .
A child may be unaware his lifestyle is outside the norm and may be more traumatized if an outsider comments or if his parents are arrested , said Vicki Panaccione , a Florida - based child psychologist who specializes in parent - child relationships .
" ( That ) the kids feel safe , secure and taken care of is sometimes more important than the decision that 's made , " she said .
Still , a child 's discomfort should never be ignored , Panaccione said .
Alan E. Kazdin , a child psychologist and director of Yale University 's Parenting Center and Child Conduct Clinic , agrees .
Children who are uncomfortable with their parents ' lifestyles are more likely to engage in risky behavior , spend more time outside the home and keep secrets from their parents , he said .
Government regulations do n't exist for every possible aspect of being a good parent .
A mother might lay her baby on his stomach , despite studies that show it puts the child at greater risk for sudden infant death syndrome .
No law exists to stop or punish the parent .
But more government regulations for parents would be considered controversial in a nation that prides itself on myriad freedoms , said Campos , the former prosecutor .
" Part of being free means accepting the possible harm that comes with it , " he said .
" You just ca n't legislate the harm out of the world . "
Four months after police turned the nudist case over to the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office , prosecutors gave police their answer .
The mother and the stepfather will not be arrested or prosecuted .
A major new study by several Canadian universities suggests the use of omega - 3 supplements is effective among patients with major depression who do not have anxiety disorders .
According to the authors , this was the largest study ever conducted assessing omega - 3 ’s efficacy in treating major depression .
Initial analyses failed to clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of omega - 3 for all patients taking part in the study .
Other analyses , however , revealed that omega - 3 improved depression symptoms in patients diagnosed with depression unaccompanied by an anxiety disorder .
Efficacy for these patients was comparable to that generally observed with conventional antidepressant treatment .
From October 2005 to January 2009 , 432 male and female participants with major unipolar depression were recruited to take part in this randomized , double - blind study ( neither patients nor researchers knew which capsules patients received ) .
For eight weeks , half of the participants took three capsules per day of OM3 Emotional Balance , a fish oil supplement containing high concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) .
The other half took three identical capsules of a placebo consisting of sunflower oil , flavored with a small quantity of fish oil .
In contrast with typical clinical studies designed to assess the effectiveness of antidepressants , this study included a high proportion of patients with complex and difficult - to - treat conditions , including patients resistant to conventional antidepressant treatments and patients also suffering from an anxiety disorder .
The aim was to assess the value of omega - 3 supplementation in a group of individuals more like those treated in outpatient clinics .
Some 11 percent of men and 16 percent of women in Canada will suffer from major depression at some point in their lives , making this disorder a leading public health issue .
Depression , which is now the world ’s fourth leading cause of morbidity and death , is expected to move up to the number two position by 2020 .
“ Despite significant progress in neuroscience over the past two decades , depression is difficult to treat , ” Dr. Lespérance noted .
In view of the large number of patients who stop taking their medications in the first few months of treatment and those who refuse such treatment due to fear of stigmatization or side effects , it comes as no surprise that a large number of patients suffering from major depression use alternative treatments offered outside the health care system .
“ Many of these treatments have not been adequately evaluated .
That is why it was important to assess the efficacy of omega - 3 , one of the most popular alternative approaches , ” he added .
Epidemiological and neurobiological studies have suggested that a relative deficit in polyunsaturated fatty acids of the omega - 3 group may predispose individuals to psychological disorders such as depression .
Further , several preliminary clinical studies based on small numbers of patients have suggested that omega - 3 supplements with high concentrations of EPA can help to reduce symptoms of depression among patients who fail to respond to an initial antidepressant treatment .
These studies have not , however , convinced the entire scientific community .
A broader study was needed to acquire further knowledge about the properties and efficacy of high - quality omega - 3 supplements among patients suffering from major depression .
“ We are proud that OM3 Emotional Balance , with its high concentration of EPA at unexcelled levels of purity delivers the dose of EPA needed for effective treatment , ” said Claire Bertin , head pharmacist for isodisnatura , the laboratory producing the omega - 3 supplement used in the study .
It is important to note that the study assessed use of omega - 3 for eight weeks , at doses of 1050 mg of EPA and 150 mg of DHA each day .
It is currently unknown whether taking higher doses or taking supplements over a longer period would yield different results .
These encouraging results show that use of EPA is effective among patients with unipolar depression unaccompanied by an anxiety disorder .
Additional research directly comparing omega - 3 with conventional antidepressants could more clearly confirm their usefulness for patients suffering from depression .
The study was published in the online Journal of Clinical Psychiatry .

Omega - 3 Supplements for Depression
The BP Oil Spill is an environmental disaster and a serious blow to the businesses and property owners along the Gulf Coast .
But did you know it also was killing " McMansion " sales across the nation ?
Toll Brothers says worries about the spill has hit consumer confidence , and thus sales of homes .
Here , a house being built in Raleigh , N.C .
Toll Brothers , the nation 's largest luxury home builder , warned late Wednesday that its sales activity is running 20 % lower than a year earlier .
One reason : " worries about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and its effects on the economy and the environment have negatively impacted the outlook of American consumers , '' the company 's Chief Financial Officer Joel Rassman said in a statement .
( Other reasons include the expiration of the home buyer tax credit and the fiscal crisis in Europe )
This is n't the only time Toll has blamed the housing market 's problem on a disaster in the Gulf of Mexico ( where incidentally , the company builds relatively few homes ) .
Retiring CEO Bob Toll said in late 2006 that Hurricane Katrina , which made the U.S. look like " Bangladesh in a storm -- bodies floating upside down , the government seemingly unable to do anything about it " was the beginning of the end of the housing boom , because it shook American consumer confidence .
It would n't be a surprise if the oil spill becomes a convenient scapegoat for what ails businesses .
Consider the J. M. Smucker Co . That 's right , Smucker 's , the Orville , Ohio , jam and jelly maker .
In its quarterly earnings report today , the company states that one of the risks to jam sales are " accidents , including the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , and natural disasters , including crop failures and storm damage . "
Other companies ' problems from the spill seem to be less of a stretch .
In a recent survey , Bank of America said money managers have sold energy stocks in record numbers amid the spill 's aftermath .
Only 7 % of " global asset allocators " retain an overweight position on the sector , down from 37 % in May , BofA reported .
Omega Protein Corp. , a fish oil producer , said last month that " the oil slick has had an adverse effect on the Company 's ability to operate in the fishing grounds east of the Mississippi River Delta , near its Moss Point , Mississippi facility , '' forcing the company to focus on different fishing grounds .
There is likely to be a flood of such warnings when the second - quarter earning season kicks into gear next month .
Then we will get a sense about how far the plume spreads .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact : Dave Levinthal , Center for Responsive Politics , ( 202 ) 354-0111 ; Angela Bradbery , Public Citizen , ( 202 ) 588-7741
WASHINGTON — Organizations in the financial services sector have deployed at least 1,447 former federal employees to lobby Congress and federal agencies since the beginning of 2009 , according to a joint analysis of federal disclosure records and other data released today by Public Citizen and the Center for Responsive Politics .
( Download the full report here : FinancialRevolvingDoors.pdf )
This small army of registered financial services sector lobbyists includes at least 73 former members of Congress , of whom 17 served on the banking committees of either the U.S. House of Representatives or the Senate .
At least 66 industry lobbyists worked for these committees as staffers , while 82 additional lobbyists once worked for congressional members who currently serve on these key committees .
Further , at least 42 financial services lobbyists formerly served in some capacity in the U.S. Treasury Department .
At least seven served in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , including two former comptrollers .
“ Wall Street hires former members of Congress and their staff for a reason , ” said David Arkush , director of Public Citizen ’s Congress Watch division .
“ These people are influential because they have personal relationships with current members and staff .
It ’s hard to say no to your friends , but that ’s what Congress needs to do .
Listening to them would result in a bill that would fail to get the job done and would disappoint the American people . ”
Added Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics , “ Companies pay a premium for lobbyists who ’ve spun through the revolving door because it can be a small price to pay relative to the huge payoff if they can shape legislation .
These lobbyists tap insider knowledge and personal relationships , knowing that their old friends and former co-workers wo n’t want to let them down . ”
Prominent former congressional members now lobbying on behalf of financial services sector interests include two former Senate majority leaders ( Bob Dole , R - Kan. , and Trent Lott , R- Miss . ) , two former House majority leaders ( Dick Armey , R - Texas , and Dick Gephardt , D - Mo. ) and a former speaker of the House ( Dennis Hastert , R - Ill . ) .
The analysis is drawn from lobbying disclosure information filed with the secretary of the Senate , as well as the Center for Responsive Politics ’ data .
The report includes tables listing former members of Congress , former staffers for the banking committees and lobbyists who previously worked for current banking committee members .

Various answers by our contributors :
Eggs can remain edible for even longer than a month , but freshness ( egg yolk that sits firm and high , and a thick viscous egg white ) will be noticeably less after two weeks .
If eggs start out as Grade AA , they remain AA for only two weeks if properly refrigerated .
After that , they 'll be Grade A for another 2 weeks .
Here is a true test of freshness :
Get a bowl of cold water .
Put the whole egg in the water .
If it sinks , it 's fresh ; if it floats to the top , it is old .
It will kind of lay almost on its side .
You can see the age of it by how much it floats .
It 's a good idea to do this test before selling any eggs if you suspect they are older than two weeks .
However , by putting the eggs in water , you wash away the bloom from the egg , a protective layering that prevents bacteria from entering the egg .
Therefore , unless you are not expecting to keep the eggs for very long , you should not put them in water .
If you must wash the eggs , use HOT running water .
Farmers have 30 days from the day an egg is laid to get it to stores .
Then , the stores have another 30 days to sell the eggs .
The USDA recommends a maximum of 5 weeks in your refrigerator before you discard your eggs .
What does this all boil down to ?
On April 1 , you could be eating an egg that was laid on Christmas .
Many eggs in the U.S. get to market within a few days of laying .
If there is a USDA shield on the carton , it must have at least a Julian pack date .
A use - by is not required , but if used , it must not be more than 45 days from packing .
If the eggs are not distributed interstate , state laws will apply and are variable .
Keep in mind that farmers generally get their eggs to stores within a week , and both the " pack date " and " sell by " date are stamped onto the carton .
The numbers run from 1 -365 , depending on the day of the year .
Lastly , there is a big difference in taste between farm fresh eggs and week - old eggs .
If you want the freshest eggs , you can buy from a local farmer .
There is an expiration date on the carton .
If in doubt , put the egg in water .
If it floats , do not use it .
Eggs last about 4 - 5 weeks in your refrigerator .
If you do n't know how long the egg has been in the refrigerator , fill a cup with water ( enough to cover the egg ) , and put the egg in the cup .
If the egg sinks to the bottom , it is still good to eat ; if the egg floats , however , it is bad and should be discarded .
You can get more life out of eggs coating them with a light layer of Olive Oil which is much like the protective layer they come with out of the hen .
It can even keep eggs fresh for awhile without any refrigeration and extend refrigeration by a week at least .
Oil leaks and a crazy plan that just might work
Call it a quirk , call it a personality defect .
But when I hear of a problem , especially when it is an engineering problem , it will just get stuck in my head like a bad Barry Manilow song .
I cannot get rid of that inner brain demon until I at least give it a shot .
Well , here is my shot at this oil leak .
Before hand , let me say that I am not a petroleum , geological , or even a mechanical engineer .
It may be the stupidest thing ever to be sketched , not taking in account the ….. whatever .
But what the hell , at least it will be out there .
The problem is stabbing the hole from 1 mile away , remotely , with robots .
So you need something with a relatively small diameter .
Also the pressures involved are immense , and we have to assume that the flow of oil needs to still be there , flowing to the surface .
This idea is to have a pipe within another pipe .
Pipe is one resource that is readily available .
The diameters of the pipe can be scaled accordingly .
The outer pipe to inner pipe is used to inject mud down to the sliding bulkhead .
This applies tremendous pressure to the bulkhead , forcing the compression of the Vitron body .
Compressing to a oval shape , it expands to a much larger diameter , pressing a seal against the well head pipe walls .
It will also multiply the force applied by the mud several times over , so you could well have a compression of well over 30 k PSI .
Adjustment of the lateral force of the seal can be controlled by adjusting the injected Mud pressure .
Once it is sealed on the outside , the inner pipe allows the oil to be pumped to the surface and into a tanker .

A British television commentator at the World Cup has been sacked after he was found to have passed on tickets , which were allegedly used by a group of young women as part of an ambush marketing effort .
Robbie Earle lost his job with ITV , after the station said a substantial number of tickets allocated to him for the Netherlands - Denmark match were used by beer company Bavaria Beer .
Some 36 women dressed up as Dutch supporters entered the stadium and stripped off their Dutch outfit to reveal the Orange miniskirt designed by Dutch beer brewer Bavaria .

Budweiser , an official sponsor , is the only beer company allowed to advertise within the stadiums at the World Cup .
FIFA fiercely protects its marketing interests , which are a major cash spinner for the organisation .
FIFA lawyers are looking into the effort , in which 36 women wore orange miniskirts .
Yesterday we freed several hundred illegally caught bluefin tuna , just a week after our ship the Steve Irwin left Malta .
Having recently returned from an eventful anti-whaling campaign in Antarctic waters , I 've discovered the Mediterranean brings different challenges .
The engine room has turned into a sauna and sleeping is hard with the soaring heat radiating through the deck above .
We are in one of the most overfished seas in the world and have been patrolling the area south of Malta for illegal fishing operations .
In summer the waters of the Mediterranean are calm and warm .
Warming up from the east , once the temperature near the surface reaches over 20 C , it is an ideal spot for bluefin tuna populations to spawn .
The bluefin tuna is a highly prized fish , which finds its way into the Asian markets as a sushi delicacy .
But this increasing demand for the fish has taken its toll on the Mediterranean populations , of which 85 % has disappeared in the last 50 years .
Day and night we encounter fishing vessels .
Our radar is dotted with targets but until yesterday all of the French , Italian and Tunisian vessels we have come across had fishing permits and were frequently escorted by French or Maltese patrol ships .
It is no surprise they do n't take chances , with both Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace currently active in the area .
With European navy and coastguard vessels patrolling the waters around Malta and in the Tyrrhenian Sea , we decided to enter Libyan waters , an area known for illegal and unregulated fishing .
The country claimed a 62 mile fishing zone off its coast in 2005 and has since stopped any independent observers or patrol vessels from entering .
Inspectors from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) , which manages the bluefin tuna fishery , have been hindered from doing their work .
Illegal fishing is believed to be widespread in the area , with one important bluefin tuna spawning area in the Libyan zone of the Gulf of Syrte attracting many fishermen .
Greenpeace planned to head into Libyan waters a couple of years ago , but shelved the plan .
While neither the EU , nor other Mediterranean countries acknowledge Libya 's new fishing zone claim , no nation has dared to enter the disputed waters .
The situation is getting desperate for a fish that is set on a course towards extinction in the near future .
In recent years , many attempts to give bluefin tuna added protection through the conventional political processes have failed .
In this light , the willingness to directly intervene against illegal fishermen in this most lucrative type of fishing operations might be one of the last chances to get attention for the issue and get the species better protection to ensure its survival .
While the atmosphere on the ship is good , there is a slight hint of nervousness , not knowing what lies ahead .
We all realise we are in the waters of a country which has facilitated illegal fishing for many years and might not back down from using force to hinder us .
However , our crew is defiant and ready to take the risks necessary to see the mission through .
As the US senator and environmentalist Gaylord Nelson once said : " The ultimate test of man 's conscience may be his willingness to sacrifice something today for future generations whose words of thanks will not be heard " .

Not known for taking the demure route , researchers at DARPA this week announced a program aimed at building computers that exceed current peta - scale computers to achieve the mind - altering speed of one quintillion ( 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 ) calculations per second .
Dubbed extreme scale computing , such machines are needed DARPA says to " meet the relentlessly increasing demands for greater performance , higher energy efficiency , ease of programmability , system dependability and security . "
10 hot energy projects that could electrify the world
DARPA says its Omnipresent High Performance Computing ( OHPC ) systems will involve all manner of new research and development .
Specifically the outfit is looking for :
Hardware , software and algorithms for reducing and managing power requirements for high performance computing systems , including the memory and storage hierarchy
Hardware , software and language design that enables highly programmable systems , which reduces the need for users to be aware of system complexity , including heterogeneous cores , the memory hierarchy
Improved hardware and software for bolster system dependability , managing the component failure rate , and security compromises including approaches for shared information and responsibility among the OS , runtime system , and applications
Scalable I/ O systems , which may include alternatives to file systems
Self aware system software , including operating system , runtime system , I / O system , system management / administration , resource management and means of exposing resources , and external environments
According to DARPA : " Advances in Commercial Off - The - Shelf systems performances were enabled by increases in clock speed , decreases in supply voltage , and growth in transistor count .
These technology trends have hit a performance wall where increasing clock speed results in unacceptably large power increases , and decreasing voltage causes increasing susceptibility to transient and permanent errors .
Only increasing transistor count continues to drive performance increases , with value only if energy can be minimized while optimizing the ability to efficiently utilize available concurrency .
Increasing density has not helped reduce the energy costs of data transport across a chip , between neighboring chips , or between chips on disparate boards .
Current interconnect protocols are beginning to require energy and power budgets that rival or dwarf the cost of doing computation . "
The extreme machines are part of DARPA 's overarching Ubiquitous High Performance Computing ( UHPC ) program which is looking to develop low - energy architectures and protocols for logic , memory , data access , and data transport .
It also has as goals to develop dependable computer systems that place a high priority on resiliency and security at all system levels ; concurrent management and the efficient use of massively parallel resources ; and run a self - aware OS that manages real - time performance , dependability and system resources , DARPA says .
DARPA says it expects prototype UHPC systems by 2018 .

The whistleblower website that posted video of a US Army helicopter firing on unarmed civilians and killing two Reuters employees is ready to do it again , its founder says .
( A screenshot of the clip appears at right ; video available at this link . )
Wikileaks ’ founder Julian Assange says he has obtained video of a US “ massacre ” that took place in Afghanistan in 2009 .

The British newspaper The Telegraph claimed that the site had a copy of video from the attack in April .
“ The clip will show previously classified footage from US warplanes that had been tapped to bomb Taliban positions in Farah province , Afghanistan last year , ” the paper said .
“ The Afghan government said at the time that the strikes by F - 18 and B1 planes near Garani killed 147 civilians .
An independent Afghan inquiry later put the toll at 86 . ”
Former New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon reports :
While denying again that WikiLeaks has the State Department cables , Assange acknowledges in the email today that he is in custody of the May 2009 video that shows the airstrike on the Afghan village of Garani , believed to be the most lethal combat strike in AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â€ in terms of civilian deathsÃ¢â‚¬â€since the United States invaded the country in 2001 .
Assange writes that Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ we are still working onÃ¢â‚¬Â preparations for release of the video of Ã¢â‚¬ Å “ the Garani massacre .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
The State Department and Pentagon did not immediately comment on AssangeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s email message .
American officials have acknowledged in the past that they are concerned about the release of the Garani video , fearing that it could undermine public support for the American military campaign in Afghanistan both in that country and in the United States .
Pentagon officials were outraged by WikiLeaksÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ release of the Baghdad video this spring .
Shenon asserted last week that the Pentagon is “ desperately ” searching for the founder of the whistleblower website Wikileaks , out of concern he is about to publish classified US State Department cables .

Curiously , the piece cites an American diplomat as saying their chief concern is the leak of communications “ prepared by diplomats and State Department officials throughout the Middle East , regarding the workings of Arab governments and their leaders . ”
The concern over US communications about Arab governments seems slightly surprising in lieu of the fact the cables also “ contained information related to American diplomatic and intelligence efforts in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , ” which would , in theory , be of greater concern to Pentagon bosses running US war efforts .
Authorities are said to be seeking Wikilieaks founder Julian Assange , who allegedly came into possession of secret US cables after they were leaked by a 22 - year - old Army intelligence officer .
The Army specialist , Bradley Manning , was recently arrested and is being held in Kuwait .

Manning reportedly told authorities that he ’d leaked reams of State Department communiques .

Our story so far …
Back in the 1960s , TV shows took great pains to catch you up on what had happened so far .
Batman spent a minute or so recapping last week 's story .
So did The Fugitive .
The thought was that while most people had seen the show just seven days ago , what about the people who missed it ?
Fifteen years ago , someone coined the term , Eternal September .
Because each September sees an entire crop of freshman showing up at college , you need to assume that you have to start teaching protocols all over again .
Once a year , it 's a whole new audience , and they need to learn the ropes .
The Internet has been stuck in September ever since .
Every day , new people show up at your blog , on Facebook , everywhere .
Every day it 's a whole new crop that need to figure out what RSS is and how to subscribe .
Every day there are people who spam their address book because it feels like a fine thing to do , then learn their lesson and never do it again .
There are new people who need to learn the proper etiquette for interacting on your site .
Can you imagine if the real world worked this way ?
If people walking into your store had never been to a store before ?
If drivers on the highway had never driven on a highway before ?
It 's going to be a long time before the medium stabilizes enough for the newbies to catch up , so the only alternative is to accept that it 's always September .

Student - Teacher Relationships : Back to the Basics
A friend recently asked me this question : “ Tell me , what are you thinking about your students ? ”
Taken aback , I responded , “ Uh , to be honest , I ’m not thinking about them at all . ”
My mind was instead preoccupied — maybe overwhelmed is a better word — with concerns about curriculum development , scheduling , mentoring student - teachers , testing , and reviewing test data .
Somehow , in all my busyness , I had lost sight of the relational component of my teaching .
How had this happened after 20 - plus years of teaching ?
Jim Cummins , the respected University of Toronto educator , says that all learning is social , and he writes that “ human relationships are at the heart of schooling . ”
And yet this human element , which had been one of my strengths in the early years of my career , had all but disappeared by the time I fumbled for an answer to my friend ’s question .
Two other experiences this school year reinforced my new insight .
One was observing a particular student - teacher , the other was being introduced to the popular social - networking website Facebook .
In the fall , I mentored a student - teacher who became a real favorite with my students .
Why were they drawn to her ?
I wondered .
This was n’t always the case with student - teachers .
As I watched her interactions with these students of many cultures , backgrounds , and languages , one thing became clear :
She was interested in knowing all she could about each student , and she wanted to interact with them all .
As I thought about this , I recalled the early days of my teaching .
What had I cared about most when I first entered the classroom ?
I had close relationships with my students then , I remembered .
And at the end of every school year , I was sad to see them leave .
Yet I also recalled that when the previous school year had ended , I just felt numb .
What ’s worse , I knew in my heart that I ’d made few emotional connections with my students .
Another opportunity for reflection came during the Christmas holidays , when my sister - in - law helped me set up a profile page on Facebook .
Soon after that , I began getting requests from former students to be added to my list of online friends .
I had not interacted with these students in more than 20 years .
They were from my first two years of teaching .
And as they told me about their school experiences , I had a startling realization .
One former student , for example , wrote , “ Thank you for reading to us , and letting us do really cool book reports .
Mine was on Bunnicula , and I made a soap carving out of Ivory soap .
I had to do it again because I carved the ears off my first bunny .
I continued to read that book once a year for about six more years . ”
Another , from the same class , said , “ Occasionally , I will revisit my journal I kept when I was in the 3rd grade .
It is special to me because it was a safe , encouraging , and reflective way for me to express myself .
I treasure that you would always respond back in truth and love .
That is so dear to me , that you took the time to not only teach my mind , but my soul . ”
Through these exchanges , I began to realize the impact my teaching once had on students ’ lives .
So what happened ?
How had I gotten from there to here ?
Some comments written on one of my annual evaluations from years back gave me a clue :
“ The young new teacher is often more concerned with affect — having the students enjoy the class and like the teacher .
When affect gives some ground to effect — as in pedagogical effectiveness and best use of class time , that is a sign of maturation . ”
Pleased with a favorable review that said I was becoming a more experienced teacher , I plunged headfirst into delivering high - quality , content - based lessons with perfectly aligned objectives .
As the years progressed , I gradually became more focused on the task of teaching , and less on interpersonal relationships with my students .
No wonder I often felt so empty .
With all the demands and daily pressures of teaching , it ’s easy to drown in the details .
Finding balance is where my concentration lies now .
Reflecting on my own experience as a learner helps .
Who were the teachers and school leaders who influenced me most ?
When I look back , I remember those special mentors not because of their academic prowess or pedagogical skill , or even perhaps for what they taught me .
Mostly , I remember them because of how they reached out to me personally .
One leader from my middle school years stands out to me for passing on , in one of his lessons , this familiar quote : “ No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care . ”
So my goal now is not only to teach my students effectively , but to also let them know that they are special to me .
This has made a difference .
Just the other day , an advanced English - as - a - second - language student dropped by my classroom to ask if I would be teaching her this year .
As I talked with her , I became acutely aware of how much I missed seeing her every day .
It was a moment of warmth I felt deeply grateful for .
That feeling of genuine connection to those I shepherd through important years of their lives was finally finding its way back home , after being away for so long .

" There are already two strikes against you because you 're black or Hispanic and gay or transsexual .
They feel like they can do whatever they want to you , and many times they can . "
That 's Kira , a transsexual , on her prison experience .

Kira is a male - to - female transsexual who had already undergone several gender - reassignment surgeries , but had not yet had genital surgery .
She was arrested on drug - related charges — using and possessing ecstasy , meth , ketamine , and cocaine — and wound up serving three years in prison .
According to Kira 's conversation with Vice writer Vito Fun ( who refers to her as a friend ) , her gender identity made things more difficult from the start , when she was arrested :
I was wearing heels , a micro-miniskirt , and a tube top .
The cop felt he had the right to grab what he thought was my pussy .
When he felt a bulge , he freaked out .
He screamed , " This is a fucking faggot ! "
Once he realized I was a transsexual he tightened the cuffs .
He was going to be nice and let me keep my Burger King when he thought I was a girl , but after he realized I was n't , he just stomped on it .

Interestingly , at the station Kira says she was shown more sensitivity :
The cops at the police station did n't know what to do with me .
They were like , " We have never seen one as passable as you .
We do n't want to get in your business , but what do you have down there ? "
I was in shock .
I told them , " Look , I 'm a pre-op transsexual ; I have breasts and a penis .
Whatever the fuck you have to do , just make sure I 'm safe . "
A female officer strip - searched the top half of my body and a man searched my bottom half .

Kira had a physical at Riker 's Island and was offered " homo housing " by a doctor , only to find out that it had been shut down and she was to be placed with the general population — the general male population .
This is fairly common : according to the National Center For Lesbian Rights ,
Transsexual people who have not had genital surgery are generally classified according to their birth sex for purposes of prison housing , regardless of how long they may have lived as a member of the other gender , and regardless of how much other medical treatment they may have undergone [ 1 ] — a situation which puts male - to - female transsexual women at great risk of sexual violence .

Kira 's experience was certainly harrowing and painful , but it was n't all violence and harassment :
Here too , the cops showed Kira some kindness : " Thankfully , the cops gave me a triple - extra - large jumpsuit to hide my breasts . "
Another inmate helped her figure out a time to shower when the inmates were n't around to see her .
One of the gangs controlling the cell block " told me I had to pack up and leave or I would be stabbed or killed .
I guess I was lucky , because they told me that if I was n't a transvestite I would n't have received a warning . "
But in another situation , a man " was responsible for making a rule that only I could shower at 7:30 in the morning so ' nobody would bother me . '
But the real reason he made that rule was so he could watch me shower while he jerked his dick into a urinal . "

Harassment from guards was a staple of Kira 's experience : " They 'd show me off to other inmates and say stuff like , " Does n't this one look female ? "
It was so embarrassing . "
In Attica , where she was placed for dental treatment , a guard said , " Since you 're a fucking faggot , I 'm not going to put you in the cell with other men because you 're going to be too busy sucking dicks all day long . "
Kira is by no means alone in her experience , as indicated by the above trailer from Cruel And Unusual , a film about several transgender and transsexual people 's experiences in prison .
The film specifically argues that people who live as women on the outside should be allowed to serve their prison terms as women too .

TORONTO – The G - 8/G- 20 summit of finance ministers and heads of state gets under way this week in Toronto .
With the ongoing threat of a double - dip recession , the coordination of economic recovery policies is at the top of the conference agenda .
The economic crisis of the past few years has given special importance to the meetings of the G - 8/ G - 20 as governments have worked together to clean up their financial systems and prevent economic collapse .
The Toronto summit , though , could represent a crossroads determining the future of global economic recovery , as the U.S. and Europe take up opposing positions on spending and budget cuts .
With the recent election of right - wing governments in a number of countries across Europe , it seems the Obama administration will be playing the role of defender of public spending .
These new circumstances will mean new challenges for any future recovery efforts .
At last spring ’s G - 20 meeting in London , there was broad consensus on developing an international strategy focused on increasing public spending to reignite economic growth and reverse the recession .
In the U.S. , this resulted in the first Recovery Act , investments in public infrastructure , and help for homeowners .
When the G - 20 met at that time , the U.S. economy was still shrinking .
It has now begun a slow increase , though unemployment remains high .
On a global scale , trade increased 20 percent over the year .
In an open letter to the other G - 20 heads of state last week , Obama cautioned leaders not to become obsessed with budget cuts that could threaten the tedious recovery .
Curbing spending too quickly would likely prolong or worsen the economic crisis for millions of people around the globe .
The highest priority for the G - 20 , Obama said , is to strengthen the recovery and he urged other leaders to “ learn from the consequential mistakes of the past when stimulus was too quickly withdrawn and resulted in renewed economic hardships and recession . ”
These comments are especially directed at the new right - wing European governments .
Leaders like Britain ’s David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have taken advantage of the debt crisis in Greece and the threat of similar meltdowns to push for slashing budgets and cutting stimulus .
Merkel says she will be stressing the “ importance of budgetary consolidation ” to Obama .
Canada ’s conservative prime minister and the conference host , Stephen Harper , has also jumped on the budget cut bandwagon .
Obama ’s fight at the G - 20 is similar to the one he ’s facing with Republicans and conservative Democrats at home .
The Senate recently blocked a bill which would have put $ 120 billion toward job creation .
But the G - 20 leaders will not be the only ones meeting in Toronto this week .
Activists , academics and politicians have set a full schedule of workshops , meetings and protests to draw attention to the ongoing needs of working people .
A weekend “ People ’s Summit ” brought out several hundred to discuss struggles for more democratic economic and foreign policies , for gender equality , and against the big bank bailouts .
Thousands more are expected at demonstrations over the course of the summit .
The activists oppose any turn toward austerity and the imposition of more neoliberal policies , both of which Canadian and European leaders have been pushing for .
They are also critical of the undemocratic nature of these meetings , which often exclude poorer countries as well as input from the public .
“ I ’m not against countries meeting , but what we are seeing is the government colluding behind closed doors with business leaders , ” said Jen Hassum , a Toronto student .
“ It ’s a corporate agenda because the public is kept out of the process completely , with our government spending over $ 1 billion dollars on security to keep people out , ” she added .
“ If the G - 8/ G - 20 meetings were democratic , talks would focus on how to build equitable economies that foster good jobs , clean environments , health and education services . ”
The head of Canada ’s leftist New Democratic Party , Jack Layton , challenged the leaders to put global poverty and climate change on the summit agenda .
He also criticized the nearly $ 1 billion spent by the Canadian government on security for the conference , saying , “ The security barriers that will surround the G - 20 and G - 8 leaders are visual reminders of our greatest fear for these meetings – that wealthy countries will further isolate themselves and ignore their commitments to developing ones . ”
Layton also spoke in favor of a global financial transactions tax , which Canadian Prime Minister Harper has been arguing against among his fellow leaders .
Few observers are expecting there to be broad consensus at this meeting of the G - 20 since the U.S. and Europe have publicly stated opposing positions concerning stimulus measures .
Agreement on a global financial regulatory system has also been put in jeopardy with Europe ’s shift to the right and Harper ’s campaign in favor of Canada ’s big banks .
Whether the conference will produce any substantive results remains to be seen .

( AP / Cliff Owen )
I grew up in my parents ' pub in England , where there was always a lot of drama .
And all the drama — fights , , tears , tantrums — revolved around love .
I also watched my parents destroy their own love for each other .
Since that time I 've been on a mission to figure out exactly what love is .
My mother described it as " a funny five minutes . "
It 's also been called a mysterious mix of sentiment and .
Or a combination of infatuation and companionship .
Well , it 's more than that .
My personal insights , gleaned from researching and more than a thousand couples over 35 years , have now merged with a growing body of scientific studies , to the point where I can now say with that we know what love is .
It 's intuitive and yet not necessarily obvious :
It 's the continual search for a basic , secure connection with someone else .
Through this bond , partners in love become emotionally dependent on each other for nurturing , soothing , and protection .
We have a wired - in need for emotional contact and responsiveness from significant others .
It 's a survival response , the driving force of the bond of security a baby seeks with its mother .
This observation is at the heart of theory .
A great deal of evidence indicates that the need for secure attachment never disappears ; it evolves into the adult need for a secure emotional bond with a partner .
Think of how a mother lovingly gazes at her baby , just as two lovers stare into each other 's eyes .
Although our culture has framed dependency as a bad thing , a weakness , it is not .
Being attached to someone provides our greatest sense of security and safety .
It means depending on a partner to respond when you call , to know that you matter to him or her , that you are cherished , and that he will respond to your emotional needs .
The most basic tenet of attachment theory is that isolation — not just physical isolation but emotional isolation — is traumatizing for human beings .
The brain actually codes it as danger .
Gloria Steinem once said a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle .
That 's nonsense .
The drama of love that I saw played out at the bar each night as a child is all about the human hunger for safe emotional connection , a survival imperative we experience from the cradle to the grave .
Once we do feel safely linked with our partner , we can tolerate the hurts they will — inevitably — inflict upon us in the course of daily life .
Broken Connections
We start out intensely connected to and responsive to our partners .
But our level of attentiveness tends to drop off over time .
We then experience moments of disconnection , times when we do n't express our needs clearly .
He is upset and really wants to be comforted , but she leaves him alone , thinking that he wants solitude .
These moments are actually inescapable in a relationship .
If you 're going to dance with someone , you 're going to step on each other 's feet once in a while .
Losing the connection with a loved one , however , jeopardizes our sense of security .
We experience a primal feeling of panic .
It sets off an alarm in the brain 's amygdala , our center , where we are highly attuned to threats of all kinds .
Once the amygdala sends out an alarm , we do n't think — we act .
The threat can come from the outside world or from our own inner cosmos .
It 's our perception that counts , not the reality .
If we feel abandoned at a moment of need , we are set up to enter a state of panic .
It 's what we do next , after those moments of disconnection , that has a huge impact on the shape of our relationship .
Can you turn around and reconnect ?
If not , you 'll start engaging in fights that follow a clear pattern .
I call these " demon dialogues . "
If they gain momentum , they start to take over and induce a terrible sense of emotional aloneness .
Your relationship feels less and less like a safe place , and it starts to unravel .
You start to doubt that your partner is there for you , that he values you .
Or that she will put you first .
Consider a couple with their firstborn child .
Having a baby is a , sleep - depriving experience .
But it 's also a time when people 's attachment fears and needs are particularly strong .
The man might think something like , " I know it 's wrong , and I know it 's pathetic , but I feel like I 've lost my wife to my kid . "
And the woman might say , " When I had the baby I felt so fragile .
I was taking care of this little being , and I just needed extra comfort and caring myself , but he was out working all the time . "
Their intentions are good — she cares for the infant , he works hard to support his new family — but they fail to give each other what they really need .
Or think of a man who is doing just fine in his job while his wife flies high in a new .
She 's spending long hours on exciting projects while he is deprived of affection , , and sex .
in bed alone each night , waiting for her , he feels like a fool for needing her so much — and also angry that she can't see how deeply her absence affects him .
But we do n't talk about these conflicts in terms of deeply rooted attachment needs .
We talk about the surface emotions , the ire or indifference , and blame the other .
" He 's so angry ; I feel so attacked , " or " She 's so cold .
I do n't think she cares at all ! "
Each person retreats into a corner , making it harder and harder for the two to express their fundamental attachment needs , foreclosing the ability to gain reassurance from each other .
Women are often more sensitive to the first signs of connection breakdown than men , and their response is often to begin what I call the dance of disconnection .
Almost ritualistically they will pursue their partners in a futile attempt to get a comforting response .
But they do it in a way that almost guarantees their basic need will not be met — they blame their partner for failing in some essential way .
Men , on the other hand , have been taught to suppress emotional responses and needs , which inclines them to withdraw from the conflict .
But her rage and his withdrawal both mask what lies below the surface — an underlying vulnerability and need for connection , now compounded by sadness , , and , most of all , fear .
Too often , what couples do not see is that most fights are really protests over emotional disconnection .
Underneath all the distress , partners are desperate to know :
Are you there for me ?
Do you need me ?
Do you rely on me ?
Repairing Bonds
For years , therapists have viewed these demon dialogues as power struggles .
They 've attempted to resolve couples ' fights by teaching them problem - solving skills .
But this is a little like offering Kleenex as the cure for viral pneumonia .
It ignores the attachment issues that underlie the pattern .
Rather than conflict or control , the issue , from an attachment perspective , is emotional distance .
And what 's frustrating to people is not knowing how to bridge that emotional distance .
In my office , men sometimes tell me , " I do all kinds of things to show I care .
I mow the lawn , bring in a good salary , solve problems , and I do n't play around .
Why is it that in the end , these things do n't seem to matter , and all that counts with my wife is that we talk about emotional stuff and cuddle ? "
I tell them , " Because that 's just the way we are made .
We need someone to pay real attention to us , to hold us tight .
Have you forgotten that you need that , too ? "
When we fight with our partners , we tend to follow the ball as it goes over the net , paying attention to the last barb lobbed at us — and not whether we even want to be in the game at all .
It 's possible to break out of the demon dialogues , but the first step is to be aware of the game itself , not just the play - by - play .
Once you realize you are latched onto your pattern of arguing , you can agree to put the whole game on hold .
Disappointments are always part of relationships .
But you can always choose how you handle them .
Will you react defensively , out of fear , or in the spirit of understanding ?
Let 's say your partner says , " I do n't feel like having sex tonight . "
You can take a deep breath and think about how much she loves you , and say , " Gee , that 's too bad , I was really looking forward to that . "
Or you can spit out a sarcastic , " Right !
Well , we never make love anymore , do we ? "
Of course , you may not feel you really have a choice if your panic button has been pushed and your emotions are boiling over .
But just being aware that it has been pushed can help calm you down .
You can think to yourself , " What is happening here ?
I 'm yelling .
But inside , I 'm feeling really small . "
Then you can tell your partner , " I got really scared there — I 'm feeling hurt . "
If you take that leap of faith and respond with such a bid for reconnection , you have to hope your partner will , too , instead of saying something hurtful like , " Well , you 're being asinine and difficult . "
That 's the tricky part about relationships :
To change the dance , both people have to change their steps .
Simply accepting your attachment needs instead of feeling ashamed of them is a big and necessary first step , and it applies to single people as well as to those in relationships .
A single person might say , " I 'm because I 'm , and I know I should n't be lonely ; I know I should be independent . "
Well , of course you 're depressed if you 're feeling lonely and then you turn around and beat yourself up for it !
When you 're ashamed , you tend to hide from others , setting off a vicious cycle that nearly ensures you wo n't find the social connection you need .
Healing Touches
A man will often say to me , " Even if I do think that she really needs me or is feeling scared , I do n't know what to do ! "
He 'll end up making his wife a cup of tea , which is very nice — but it 's not what is called for .
Had he put his hand on her shoulder and pulled her towards him , however , his bid for connection would have been much more successful .
Men often say they do n't know what to do .
Yet men do know how to soothe — they do it with their children , tucking them in at night and whispering gently to them .
The difference is , they see their children 's vulnerability , and respond to it , but when they look at their wives , they see only someone who is judging them .
But she feels vulnerable , too .
Touch is the most basic way of connecting with another human being .
Taking your partner 's hand when she is nervous or touching his shoulder in the middle of an argument can instantly defuse and .
The world of has been obsessed with maintaining boundaries in recent years .
I say our problem is just the opposite — we 're all cut off from each other .
If you watch two people in love , they touch each other all the time .
If you watch two people finding their way back into a love relationship , after falling into demon dialogues , they touch each other more , too .
They literally reach for each other ; it 's a tangible sign of their desire for connection .
Secure ( and Saucy ) Sex
A big myth about love is that it 's got a " best before " date , that passion is a burning fever that must subside .
That 's pretty silly .
I do n't see any scientific or human reason why people can't have happy long - term love relationships .
Among people who do have affairs , they do n't do so because their sex lives are boring .
I 've never had anyone come to my office and tell me that they had an affair because they were bored in bed .
They have affairs because they 're lonely , because they can't emotionally connect with their partner .
Then somebody else smiles at them and makes them feel special and valued — and suddenly , they 're in this strange situation where they 're committed to one person but find themselves responding to another .
Passion is like everything else :
It ebbs and flows .
But sex is always going to be boring if it's one - dimensional , cut off from emotional connection .
On the other hand , if you 're emotionally involved , sex has a hundred dimensions to it , and is as much play as passion .
I call this kind of secure sex " synchrony sex , " where emotional and responsiveness , tender touch , and erotic exploration all come together .
When partners have a secure emotional connection , physical can retain all of its initial ardor and and then some .
Lovers can be tender and playful one moment , fiery and erotic another .
Securely attached partners can more openly express their needs and preferences and are more willing to experiment sexually with their lovers .
In a secure relationship , excitement comes not from trying to resurrect the novel moments of infatuated passion but from the risk involved in staying open in the moment - to - moment , here - and - now experience of physical and emotional connection .
With this openness comes the sense that lovemaking with your partner is always a new adventure .
Lasting Love
Once you 're reconnected with your partner , and both of you are getting your attachment needs filled , you have to keep working at being emotionally responsive to one another .
You can do that by helping each other identify the attachment issues that tend to come up in your recurring arguments .
If , for example , you always erupt over your girlfriend 's risky mountain climbing trips , talk to her about how your anger is born out of a fear of losing her .
Figure out how she can take more precautions .
Or , if you often feel abandoned when left with the brunt of childcare duties , plan out how you and your husband can be better parents together , so that you wo n't call him a deadbeat in a moment of pent - up frustration .
You should also celebrate positive moments together , both big and small .
Regularly and deliberately hold , hug , and kiss each other when you wake up , leave the house , return , and go to sleep .
Recognize special days , anniversaries , and birthdays in very personal ways .
These rituals keep your relationship safe in a distracting and chaotic world .
Stories shape our lives , and the stories we tell about our lives shape us in turn .
Create a future love story for you and your partner that outlines what your life together will look like five or ten years down the road .
It will prime you to keep your bond strong .
Arms Wide Open
Because attachment is a universal need , the attachment view of love can also help parents understand conflicts with their children .
I was recently in a cafe with my teenage son , yelling at him over the roar of the latte machine , while he sulked and huffed .
Then suddenly he said , " Mom , we 're doing that thing , where I feel like you are criticizing me , and you feel like I do n't care what you have to say . "
We both started and my anger melted away .
Now that we know what love is really about , we know how to sustain it .
It 's up to us to use that knowledge to nurture it with our partners and families .
And then , with the and courage it teaches us , we can search for ways to take it out into the world and make a difference .

World Cup 2010 : Bloemfontein
Nigeria midfielder Sani Kaita had the thousand - yard stare and weary , monotone voice of a man who had quickly grasped the impact of his actions as he answered questions about the red card he was given during Thursday 's match against Greece .
The match turned completely on his moment of madness after 33 minutes , with the Super Eagles 1 - 0 lead eventually becoming a bruising and costly 2 - 1 defeat .
" I am sorry for the whole of Nigeria , " said Kaita , who understandably looked like he would be just about anywhere else rather than in front of the semi-circle of journalists attempting to establish with almost forensic detail his version of events .
" It was not the right thing to do and I hope it will not happen again .
I made a mistake .
That is all . "

Highlights - Greece beat Nigeria Korea ( UK only )
Kaita had tangled with Vassilis Torosidis , who later scored the winning goal , as they competed for the ball close to the touchline .
The Nigerian aimed a kick in the direction of his opponent 's leg and Torosidis went down holding his face , in what was an unseemly if hardly surprising example of the win- at - all costs philosophy that besmirches the modern game .
The whole incident was regrettable and ended with Kaita taking a long and slow march across the pitch to the dressing room .
Kaita watched on television as Greece 's wily old coach Otto Rehhagel swiftly abandoned his ultra- defensive formation in favour of a rarely glimpsed attacking ambition that saw his team record their first victory at a World Cup .
Nigeria veteran Kanu revealed that the red card had left the 24 - year - old Kaita in tears .
Kaita himself said that he had been surprised to be dismissed but team - mate Yakubu , who failed to convert an excellent second - half chance , felt that it was the right decision .
" He was a little bit carried away but will learn from the mistake , " said the Everton striker .
There can be no doubt that playing for Nigeria brings huge expectations from a fanatical and expectant public .
" There are 150 million of them and all of them think they are a manager or a coach , " added Yakubu .
Shortly before the World Cup the Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan said : " I expect the Super Eagles to prepare well and win this trophy . "
However , this Nigerian team were always unlikely to be able to match Jonathan 's unrealistic ambition .
This is Nigeria 's fourth World Cup campaign but they only just scraped through qualification , needing a late Obafemi Martins goal to defeat Kenya , while Mozambique stunned Tunisia .
Nigeria have some excellent players , such as goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama , full - back Taye Taiwo and forward Peter Odemwingie .
They also have players with superb potential , such as 19 - year - old midfielder Lukman Haruna .
But they are without the injured John Obi Mikel in South Africa and are not of the same standard of many of the Super Eagles teams that have played with such flair over the last decade and a half .
They lack the creativity that was provided by the likes of Sunday Oliseh , Finidi George and Jay - Jay Okocha .
Their Swedish coach Lars Lagerback was appointed in February , but did not hold his first training session with his players until 20 May and had just three friendlies to settle upon a formation .
Nigerian managers such as Samson Siasia , Oliseh and Stephen Keshi would have been potentially interested but were overlooked , while Lagerback beat off competition from Glenn Hoddle and Sven - Goran Eriksson to land the role .
But if his appointment was based on his coaching experience with his native Sweden at the 2002 and 2006 finals , then I do n't think his decision making on Wednesday vindicated the decision .
Rehhagel , who presided over Greece 's remarkable Euro 2004 triumph , changed his side 's entire strategy four minutes after Kaita was dismissed by taking off a defender and bringing on a forward .
Lagerback waited until the break to make a change , replacing Odemwingie with Chinedu Obasi and sending his team out for the second - half with Yakubu as the lone striker and two banks of four behind him .
By that time , however , the damage had been done .
The momentum of the match had changed irreversibly and a Greek side that appeared to be slipping out of the tournament were reinvigorated - as well as on level terms .
I also think that Lagerback made a mistake in playing Yakubu for the entire 90 minutes .
Surely as the match wore on the striker should have been replaced by the fresh legs of the pacey Martins ?
" Every four years there is a World Cup and qualifying from the group is decided in just three games , " mused Lagerback , who knew the structure of the competition and indeed the composition of Nigeria 's group before he accepted the job .
However , all is not yet lost for the Super Eagles and their fanatical fans as Thursday 's result leaves Group B fascinatingly poised with one round of games left .
Argentina have six points and take on Greece , who have three thanks to their win over Nigeria .
South Korea , thumped 4 - 1 by Argentina in the group 's other match on Thursday , have three points after defeating Greece , and take on Nigeria .
" We have one more game to go and we will keep fighting and see how it goes , " added Yakubu , who clearly has not given up on the possibility of reaching the round of 16 .
But with Kaita suspended and Taye Taiwo , who possesses an excellent long - range shot , injured , it will take a remarkable upturn in fortunes if the rock - bottom Super Eagles are to soar up Group B and snatch second place .

The same Washington spinsters who have driven our country into the ground seem to be out in full force this morning , claiming that their latest policy “ victory ” is the most “ sweeping change ” of our financial regulatory since the Great Depression .
Actually , it is nothing more than window dressing .
The real sweeping change of our financial system took place over the past 20 years .
The irresponsible repeal of Glass - Steagall in 1999 .
The Commodities and Futures Modernization Act of 2000 by Larry Summers and Bob Rubin — the one that legalized the most destructive financial instruments of all , derivatives .
The leverage exemption at the SEC in 2004 , asked for ( in person ) and received by Hank Paulson and friends .
Of course , there are small victories here — there is better investor protection and , most importantly , an awakened citizenry .
What ’s not fixed ?
– The Cops ( regulators and ratings agencies ) working for the crooks .
– Banks still Too Big To Fail .
– Banks gambling with your deposits .
– Banks allowed to “ mark to myth ” and use off - balance sheet accounting to bonus themselves into the atmosphere , with the taxpayer taking the fall .
– Banks getting trillions from the Fed , Fannie and Freddie — AKA you , the future and present taxpayer .
What does it mean for us ?
It means that the same people who brought you these horrible changes — rising wealth discrepancy , massive unemployment and a crumbling infrastructure — have now further institutionalized the policies that will keep the causes of these problems firmly in place .
Meanwhile , all involved in the facade try to pretend that this should be considered a success because , gosh , real financial reform is just too hard and those crafty banksters will just outsmart us anyhow .
Many in the media are either too complicit , too confused or too lazy to contradict this spin , but the rest of us should n’t buy that BS .
Real and lasting financial reform is actually quite easy to implement — and the last time we had a crisis of this magnitude , we kept the banksters in check for 70 years .
Time and time again in America , they do n’t win — we do .
And I believe as we head towards election time with leaders whose only plan for creating new jobs is a few more workers manicuring soon - to - be even bigger Bankster bonus - fueled estates coupled with a few more government handouts , this lesson will be learned once again .
WASHINGTON  Burdened by lawsuits , criminal investigations and negative publicity stemming from its private security work in Iraq and Afghanistan , Blackwater Worldwide is being put up for sale , the company has announced .
Blackwater , which changed its name to Xe Services and brought in new management last year in order to remake its image , is pursuing a sale in part because that overhaul has failed to change perceptions of the company , most critically inside government , which is its main customer .
Erik Prince , the former member of the Navy Seals and heir to an automotive fortune who founded Blackwater , said in a statement given to The Associated Press late Monday that making the decision to sell the company was difficult , but that he no longer wanted to deal with the intense criticism the business has faced .
“ Performance does n’t matter in Washington , just politics , ” Mr. Prince said .
A separate statement from the company ’s headquarters , in Moyock , N.C. , said , “ Xe ’s new management team has made significant changes and improvements to the company over the last 15 months , which have enabled the company to better serve the U.S. government and other customers , and will deliver additional value to a purchaser . ”
Improve Your Mind - Reading : Focus on the Big Picture You
We are surprisingly poor at working out what others think of us .
Experiments suggest we rarely do better than chance at rating how likeable , intelligent or attractive others think we are .
So how can we be so bad at reading other people ’s minds and what can we do about it ?
Writing in the latest edition of Social and Personality Psychology Compass , Dr Nicholas Epley of the University of Chicago argues that the biggest obstacle to our understanding how we are viewed by others is our egocentric bias .
We are all stuck inside our own heads .
The egocentric bias means that when we try to imagine how we are seen by others , we ca n’t help but be biased by the way in which we see ourselves .
Effectively to read others ’ minds , we first read our own minds .
Unfortunately it turns out that we often do n’t see ourselves as other people see us .
Here are two major reasons why :
Attentional bias : we assume others are paying much more attention to us than they really are .
People usually do n’t notice the details we think they do .
Construal bias :
We see everything filtered through our own beliefs , attitudes and intentions , especially when situations are ambiguous or when our own beliefs , attitudes and intentions are very different from our mind - reading target .
How can we improve our mind - reading ?
The time - honoured approach for finding out what others think of us has been to try and take their perspective .
In a series of unpublished studies , though , Tal Eyal and Nick Epley found that this was not effective in increasing people ’s accuracy .
Instead three experiments they conducted suggested the answer was to think about yourself at a higher level of abstraction .
Participants in one condition were asked to focus on central and defining features of the self rather than low level details .
They were then able to judge what others thought of them more accurately .
Dr Epley explains : “ You can look at yourself from the street level or you can look at yourself from the satellite level .
Other people see you from the satellite level , so if you think of yourself from that big picture perspective , you ’ll tend to be more accurate . ”
“ While we live our own lives under a microscope and we are present all the time when we do things , other people are not there with us , ” notes Epley .
“ That ’s a problem for intuiting other people ’s thoughts because we tend to evaluate ourselves in much finer detail .
We look at ourselves from the street view , whereas other people are looking at us from space . ”

Many people in Southern California are rooting for the Mexican team in the World Cup .
The Times ' Hector Becerra examined how this has brought the Mexican flag out of political exile .
After years of activists urging immigration rights marchers to use the American flag , the Mexican flag is back in vogue as hundreds root for the Mexican team .
But there is now a controversy brewing in Big Bear .
The mother of a Big Bear Middle School student is demanding an investigation after she said a teacher berated her daughter for wearing a Mexican T - shirt to school .
According to the mother , the teacher asked if she was an illegal immigrant .
The girl , in fact , was wearing the shirt to support the Mexican team .

A sign project becomes the catalyst for larger plans to improve biking and walking throughout the city
Two years ago ,
wanted some advice on where to put a series of signs designed to help bicyclists and pedestrians find their way around town .
They got the signs , officially unveiled last week .
But in trying to figure out the best locations , the city also got -- courtesy of two volunteers and its transportation committee -- a new master plan on how to better incorporate bicycles and pedestrians into a suburban , commuter lifestyle .
The 113 signs , courtesy of a $ 50,000
grant , will be placed along bike trails and lanes and walking paths to show riders or walkers the distance to other trails and to direct them to parks , food , shopping districts and other points of interest .
The signs are green and 2 - by - 2.5 feet in size .
Unlike Portland , no one will confuse Gresham as a bicycling city .
It is a suburban commuter town with streets and traffic that historically have discouraged other ways of getting around .
Numbers show the difference .
A Metro-led count the evening of Sept. 8 , 2009 , found 19 bicyclists during a 15 - minute period on the popular Springwater Trail at Main City Park , the highest recording in Gresham .
By contrast , a 15 - minute count at 5:15 p.m. Sept. 10 , 2009 , on the Hawthorne Bridge in Portland tallied 272 bicyclists .
Numbers like those did n't discourage Jeff Corcoran and Greg Olson in 2008 , when the city had money for the bike signs but needed help figuring out where to put them .
City leaders preferred not to spend money to hire consultants to find the best locations , so they asked members of a city transportation subcommittee if they had any ideas .
Corcoran and Olson , both longtime city residents and avid bicyclists , volunteered .
" If somebody who does n't live in Gresham came up the Springwater Trail and found themselves in downtown Gresham , where can we direct them ?
What might they want to see , " Corcoran asked .
But they quickly found out that picking locations was n't that simple .
First they had to figure out where riders or walkers might want to go .
Then , taking another step back , they had to determine what bike lanes already existed and which streets were wide and safe enough for biking .
" The signs ended up being a catalyst for figuring out biking in Gresham , " said Corcoran , who works as a design consultant for churches .
" The sign project is just the tip of the iceberg . "
Work under way on trail section , bridge
Gresham is also working on two other major bike - pedestrian trails .
Paving has started on a two - mile section of the Gresham / Fairview Trail from Southeast Burnside Road to the Springwater Trail at Southeast 190th Avenue .
Paving of the 12 - foot wide trail is expected to continue to December .
And work has started on the pedestrian bridge that carries the Gresham / Fairview Trail over West Powell Boulevard .
The cost of those projects is $ 3.82 million .
The only paved portion of the multi-use trail is 1.25 miles from Northeast Halsey Street to Burnside .
The city is planning the final two phases of the trail , which will extend north from Northeast 201st Avenue to Marine Drive .
When completed , the 5.2 - mile trail will connect the Springwater Trail and the Marine Drive Trail and also intersect three other regional trails and one local - use trail .
In addition , starting this summer , the city will begin planning for a new multi-use trail along the MAX light - rail tracks between Gresham Town Center and Ruby Junction .
The trail will be no farther than 20 feet from the light - rail tracks , said Katherine Kelly , city transportation planner .
-- Quinton Smith
Corcoran and Olson spent 235 hours riding , driving and walking Gresham 's bike paths , lanes and streets .
In addition to where the signs should go , they came back with ideas to improve intersections , striping and where bike lanes could be widened slightly as the city repaves roads .
Their research and membership on the city 's Transportation Committee helped push the committee to include more thoughts about bicycling in its plans .
" This whole thing has caused this big snowball effect , " Corcoran said .
" Because we 're thinking and pushing ' bike - friendly ' it changes other approaches as well . "
Gresham is trying to take advantage of three large bike paths within its borders -- the popular Springwater Trail on its south , the Marine Drive Trail on its north and the slowly growing Gresham - Fairview Trail that will eventually link the two .
Olson and Corcoran say the key to getting people to move from those three big bike trails is the perception of safety .
Serious riders -- a small group -- will go anywhere anytime on anything .
But the pair want to attract what they believe is a huge group of people who will ride if dedicated trails or bike lanes help them feel safe .
" As people feel more safe on trails and lanes , then they may feel safer branching out to commuting and daily errands , " Olson said .
Both men think the next stage is identifying safe , quieter bike routes through neighborhoods to get people off busier arterials .
An example would be someone wanting to ride to or from Mt. Hood Community College .
Instead of taking Southeast Stark or Northeast Division streets from 242nd Avenue , a better route could be a bike lane on Northeast 23rd Avenue past Hall Elementary School .
" Use explodes once you build it , " Corcoran said .
" Gresham does n't use because people do n't feel safe . "
While acknowledging that Gresham is no Portland when it comes to bicycles , Katherine Kelly , the transportation planner who organized the sign project , sees more enthusiasm for bikes and to improve facilities .
" I think there 's a greater community desire , " she said , " to focus on bikes and make them safer . "

Alabama Republican : Cigarettes A Worse Environmental Disaster Than The Oil Spill
Doug Mataconis · · 1 comment
If you thought that Joe Barton and Michelle Bachmann had won today ’s prize for dumbest comment by a Congressional Republican , well you have n’t met Congressman Parker Griffith of Alabama :
In his opening statement at today ’s BP hearing in the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations , Alabama Republican Parker Griffith downplayed the oil spill :
The greatest environmental disaster in America has been cigarettes …
If we ’re gonna talk about the environment , let ’s be sure we do n’t leave that out …
The environment is an important concept , and we regret the loss of life , but there ’s much we can do .
We ’ll put this in perspective .
This is not going to be the worst thing that ever happened to America .
Video :
The other thing I ’d like to remind the committee is that the greatest environmental disaster in America has been cigarettes .
Sixty thousand Americans today , this year , will die from cigarette - related cancer .
So , if we ’re going to talk about the environment , let ’s be sure we do n’t leave that out .
I ’m a cancer specialist , by the way , by training , and I never fail to bring that up .
So , the environment is an important concept .
We regret the loss of life .
But there ’s much that we can do , and we ’ll put this in perspective .
This is not going to be the worst thing that ’s ever happened to America .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Griffith lost the Republican primary for his seat and will be leaving office when the current Congress gavels to a close
Technologists are promising that by 2020 , we ’ll have an “ Internet of things , ” where everything around us–from billboards to dining tables –will be able to respond to our whims .
So maybe it ’s not so ridiculous to imagine a world where our furniture has as much personality as a lovable dog or a neurotic friend .
That , anyway , was the conceit of a project by Adam Lassy , a student at NYU ’s ITP program .
Lassy bought a few pieces of furniture from Ikea , and then kitted them out with proximity sensors and motors , so they could move around and respond to their environment .
He then programmed them to behave with certain personalities — the chair , for example , was set to sometimes be shy ( moving away from sudden movements ) or doting ( rapidly approaching anyone in its vicinity ) and even… horny ( humping your leg ) .
The table , meanwhile , is downright needy –approaching someone sitting down , but requiring constant touching to stay in place .
It ’s potentially not all fun and games .
Among the more concrete uses that Lassy proposes for this sort of technology is furniture that moves around you , and adapts to your needs autonomously :
An appeal has been launched for donations of blankets and dry bedding as rain forces people out of Alice Springs town camps on what is likely to be the town 's coldest day on record .
The previous coldest day was in August 1966 when the maximum temperature reached just 7 degrees Celsius .
The temperature this afternoon has not gone above 6.3 degrees and almost 50 millimetres of rain have fallen since Monday .
The major service delivery agency for the town camps , Tangentyere Council , says it has run out of accommodation , dry firewood and blankets and does not know where people are going to go .
The council 's social services manager , Margaret Reilly , says some people are taking shelter under a bridge over the Todd River .
" There 's no firewood to be had in Alice Springs and there 's no blankets to be had in Alice Springs , " she said .
" People are in very , very damp , very , very cold situations at the moment .
" We 've actually had a family whose tin shed has collapsed and we 're trying to find a solution for them .
" So it 's pretty desperate . "
The council is asking that blankets be dropped off at the council , the Salvation Army or St Vincent de Paul offices .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
If a sports league set up a permanent office with a number of lawyers to write new regulations for its particular game ( basketball , for instance ) , what do you think would happen after a few years ?
The lawyer - regulators would know that if they stopped writing new regulations , whether needed or not , they would be out of a job .
Over time , the regulations would grow in both number and complexity , and the players would have a more and more difficult time understanding what the rules were and would increasingly , though unintentionally , run afoul of them .
The fans also would no longer understand all the rules and probably would begin to lose interest in the game .
Finally , the game would die under the weight of all the new regulations .
Professor Susan Dudley of the Regulatory Studies Center at the George Washington University and Melinda Warren of the Weidenbaum Center at Washington University in St. Louis have just published their annual report of the U.S. government ’s “ regulatory budget . ”
The bottom line is that the government ’s regulatory budget is about $ 52 billion per year and has been growing faster than the federal budget in general and also as a share of U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
If this trend continues , the United States will become one vast regulatory state and , eventually , the economy will become strangled by its own regulations .
The direct government costs of regulation are tiny compared to the costs on the private sector , which have been estimated by economists to be , on average , approximately $ 20 for each dollar the government spends , or something more than $ 1 trillion and roughly 15 percent of the U.S. GDP .
What do we get for this enormous cost ?
The only thing we know for sure is that most regulations reduce our freedom .
No individual can know the vast number of laws and regulations to which he is subject , and hence , the government ( if it chooses ) can target anyone and almost certainly be able to find some law or rule that the targeted person has violated .
According to Thomas Jefferson , the U.S. Constitution only gave Congress the power to punish criminally “ treason , counterfeiting the securities and coin of the United States , piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the laws of nations , and no other crimes whatsoever . ”
Yet the federal criminal code contains thousands of pages , making it impossible for individuals to know all of the violations for which they may be sent to jail .
Very few regulations are subjected to a real and independent cost - benefit analysis ; hence , there is every reason to believe that a very high percentage of regulations do not meet such a standard , let alone a human - liberty standard .
The budget for the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) grew tenfold ( to more than $ 1 billion ) in the past 25 years , but there is no evidence it has made us any safer from financial fraud .
In fact , the opposite seems to be the case .
The Madoff Ponzi scheme was the biggest financial fraud ever .
Yet when knowledgeable people presented evidence of the Madoff scheme to the SEC , they were just blown off .
Now the SEC wants a bigger budget as a reward for its failure , and the agency and members of Congress are demanding more power for the SEC .
The United States has many laws against financial fraud , so that is not the problem .
The problem may be - in addition to SEC incompetence - that the public assumes the SEC is looking out for it and consequently fails to do proper due diligence .
In other words , the existence of the SEC may be increasing rather than diminishing risk .
Much regulation sold as being in the consumer ’s best interest is really designed to benefit one competitor over another , or worse , government enterprise over private enterprise .
A good example of a failed attempt at this , fortunately , occurred last week when a federal court struck down as unconstitutional legislation by Sen.
Patty Murray , Washington Democrat , designed to prevent a small , woman - owned bus company from competing against Seattle ’s heavily subsidized King County Metro Transit .
If the growth of the regulatory state is not brought under control , we will lose both our liberty and our prosperity .
There are a number of constructive things that could be done , such as :
c Requiring that all regulations and even regulatory agencies have a sunset date when the regulation and regulatory agency will cease unless Congress takes specific action to renew it .
c Requiring all , not just some , regulations to be subject to real independent cost - benefit analysis and also allowing independent parties to legally challenge the analysis .
c Requiring that every regulation have an attachment showing the particular provision of the Constitution that gives Congress or the regulator the authority to issue the regulation .

NEW mums and dads will be eligible to receive $ 570 a week in parental leave from January 1 after a historic decision overnight .
The Senate last night brought Australia into line with most of the Western world by passing legislation setting up the nation 's first paid parental leave scheme .
The historic decision means eligible parents will be entitled to 18 weeks paid at the federal minimum wage -- currently $ 569.90 a week , or $ 15 an hour .
Expectant mums must earn no more than $ 150,000 a year to qualify and work at least 330 hours in 10 of the 13 months before their due date .
The successful Upper House vote delivered a welcome victory for the Rudd Government , which has weathered heavy recent criticism for a string of policy backdowns .
A delighted Families Minister Jenny Macklin hailed the passage as " a major win for Australian families " .
" This government - funded paid parental leave scheme will give thousands of new mothers the financial support to make their own choices about work and family responsibilities when their baby is born , " Ms Macklin said .
But the Opposition dismissed the scheme as " not good enough " and pledged to bring in its own 26 - week alternative scheme -- paid at a higher rate and financed by a tax on big businesses -- if it 's returned to office at the coming election .
" The poor - relation scheme offering only 18 weeks of the minimum wage does not go near covering the household expenses of two - income families working hard , " said shadow minister for status of women Sharman Stone .
And Family First senator Steve Fielding has defended controversial remarks made yesterday linking the scheme with abortion .
The senator was roundly criticised for suggesting some women may rort the scheme by deliberately falling pregnant and then having a late - term abortion
It is estimated 148,000 Australians will be able to claim the benefit every year .
Families will have the option of signing the benefit over to stay - at - home dads if mothers want to return to work .
Melbourne mum and TV presenter Andi Lew said passing of the legislation was a red - letter day for all parents , even if it comes too late to provide paid leave for her while she cares for son Beaudy .
" It 's a fantastic breakthrough and wonderful for mums and bubs everywhere , " she said .
After welcoming her first baby Courtney on Wednesday , Joanne Sutherland also welcomed news of paid parental leave yesterday .
The scheme comes too late to help Ms Sutherland and partner Robert Dodsley make ends meet after having to quit her job as a veterinary nurse , but she said it would be a huge boost if she had another child .
" It 's pretty tough without maternity leave , that 's why this coming out on January 1 is so important and will benefit a lot of people , " she said .
" It is an incentive and takes the weight off you knowing this has been approved . "

Well , that 's that .
Congratulations , Texas State Board of Education and the far - right creationist historical revisionists on it .
This outcome is not a surprise , but that does n't make it any less infuriating , or any less sad .
After all the fighting , all the negative publicity , and all the people -- including teachers and educational experts -- who showed them clearly why they were wrong , the antireality majority on the BoE did what we knew they would do .
If I were a parent of a school - age child in Texas , I would seriously consider moving to a different state .
Because ...
Tip o' the ten gallon hat -- with , apparently , nothing in it -- to Alan Buckingham .
The agreement reached at the 11th hour on the uncensored Afghan torture documents is hardly a victory for democracy .
It is precisely the opposite and it is the Liberals we have to thank for it .
We have come to expect nothing better from the Harper Conservatives -- the most dishonest , anti-democratic and arrogant government in living memory .
The Liberals -- fearing the possibility of an election and too cowardly to face down the bully Stephen Harper -- went along with what will be a terrible precedent : allowing three outside " experts " to vet the documents that MPs and Canadian citizens had a right to see .
The ruling of the Speaker was absolutely clear : MPs had an absolute right to view the documents .
Full stop .
No qualifications .
That 's what absolute means .
The Liberals and the NDP early on allowed the Conservatives to frame the argument as one involving national security and then further allowed them to suggest that MPs are so irresponsible that they can't be trusted to read the documents and not reveal national security secrets to the Taliban .
This is sheer idiocy on both counts .
First , if there are 10 pages out of the 40,000 in question that have anything to do with genuine national security I will eat all of them .
These documents were identified because they related to the torture of war prisoners -- not our strategic approach to the war .
Did any of the opposition parties do any kind of analysis of this spurious argument ?
Did they decide that Canadians were too dull - witted to understand the arguments ?
Had they immediately ridiculed this obvious red herring as they should have we would n't have been through this humiliating ( to our democracy and the opposition ) process .
The final result is a precedent that puts the judgment of MPs in their own House of Commons , second to so - called experts .
What experts ?
And who will define national security ?
The " experts " or Parliament ?
The whole question revolves around this definition and yet we have heard virtually nothing about what it might mean .
The fact that the Conservatives will very likely get to choose one , and the opposition another ( with a third to be agreed upon by both ) demonstrates that there is no such thing as neutral experts .
The whole process is totally political -- which is why it should have stayed in the House of Commons and the final decision made by MPs exclusively .
Now we have a new definition of the absolute right of Parliament -- the almost absolute , the not quite absolute , the nearly absolute , the absolute except when the executive branch of the day says no .
This is the fault of the Liberals .
The NDP and Bloc fought til the end against the panel of experts and finally caved in order to advance the Afghan torture issue .
It was a hard choice .
The NDP and Bloc knew that Harper was quite capable of calling an election on the issue -- one too distant from the immediate concerns of Canadians to fight an election on -- an election that would deny the NDP the opportunity to run on substantive issues .
Ultimately , of course the responsibility for this latest assault on democracy lies at the feet of Stephen Harper .
His efforts to emasculate parliament are legion -- including earlier appontment ofyet another third partry -- former SC Justice Frank Iacobucci -- to vet the documents .
It will take years for our tattered democracy to recover from the ruthless violations visited on it by this , the worst prime minister the country has ever had .

A growing reliance on imported food and other necessities is making First World nations such as the United Kingdom increasingly vulnerable to social collapse , warns Andrew Simms , policy director of the " think - and - do tank " of the New Economic Foundation , writing in " Events are revealing that many of the things we take for granted , like bank accounts , fuel and food , are vulnerable , " he writes .
" If we value civilization , the litmus test for economic success should not be short - term profitability , but resilience in the face of climatic extremes and resource shortages .
" Simms notes that the assumptions of the free market have led to an economic system focused on producing the greatest cost savings rather than the greatest sustainability .
This has led many First World countries to turn away from producing food domestically in favor of cheaper ( and more profitable ) imports .
"
The result is easily disrupted just - in - time supermarket food supply lines , and a risky assumption that anything we need can easily be bought on global markets , " he writes .
Yet recent worldwide food shortages -- such as the 2008 food crisis that affected at least 37 countries and produced riots around the globe -- have shown that when faced with a crisis , countries prioritize feeding their own populations over exporting food to other nations .
Some First World governments and corporations have responded by trying to seize control of up to 20 million hectares ( 50 million acres ) of arable land in poor countries .
Anger over such practices led to the toppling of Madascar 's government .
Simms notes that Britain has no food reserves to speak of and that its domestic food production continues to decline .
Similar patterns are at play for other essentials , such as fuel .
Meanwhile , declining worldwide fuel reserves and global climate destabilization are increasing the odds of a new food crisis .
" This year is the 10th anniversary of the fuel protests , when supermarket bosses sat with ministers and civil servants in Whitehall warning that there were just three days of food left , " Simms writes .
" We were , in effect , nine meals from anarchy .
Civilization 's veneer may be much thinner than we like to think .

Dr Murray faces up to four years in jail if convicted over Jackson 's death
The doctor accused of giving a fatal dose of anaesthetic to Michael Jackson has come to the rescue of a woman who fell unconscious on a plane .
Dr Conrad Murray responded when cabin crew asked if a doctor was on board a US Airways flight , US media said .
He put her on an intravenous drip from the plane 's emergency kit after finding her pulse was weak , reports said .
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson last year .
' You probably know me '
Dr Murray was flying from Houston to Phoenix when the 23 - year - old woman fainted .
" We 're not surprised , " said a spokeswoman for Dr Murray .
" He 's a good doctor , we 've always said he was a good doctor , and that 's what good doctors do is save people , " Associated Press news agency quoted Miranda Sevcik as saying .
The plane diverted to Albuquerque , New Mexico , where the woman and her 11 - month - old baby were taken off the flight for further treatment .
The story was first reported by entertainment website TMZ and later confirmed by Dr Murray 's legal team .
US Airways said a doctor on the flight had helped stabilise a woman who had had a medical emergency but did not name the doctor , AP said .
The woman , who has not been named , told TMZ that when she regained consciousness the doctor was standing over her and said : " You probably know me ... I was Michael Jackson 's doctor . "
Dr Murray is alleged to have administered a lethal dose of Propofol and other drugs , which resulted in the pop star 's death on 25 June last year .
He remains free on bail pending his trial .

To mark the start of production of new series The Walking Dead , AMC just released this first look photo of “ The Walkers ” — the series ’ titular flesh - eating creatures .
The six - episode drama , an adaptation of the Robert Kirkman comic , is written , produced and directed by Frank Darabont and executive produced by Gale Anne Hurd .
It follows a group of survivors , led by police officer Rick Grimes ( Andrew Lincoln ) , traveling in search of a safe and secure home after a zombie apocalypse .
THE Dalai Lama has marked his 75th birthday with celebrations in his hometown - in - exile .
Under relentless rain , the Tibetan spiritual leader addressed a packed crowd of 5000 followers at his temple in McLeod Ganj , a hill station in the Indian Himalayas where he has lived since fleeing Tibet in 1959 .
Smiling and in apparently fine health , the Buddhist spiritual leader sat at the centre of a stage in front of thousands of school children , fellow Tibetans in exile and foreign tourists .
Staring out at a banner depicting him at various stages over the last three - quarters of a century , he declared :
" When I see those pictures and see the development , I know my life has not been wasted . "
In a speech delivered in his native language , he regretted that Tibetans in Tibet would not be allowed to mark his birthday due to oppression from the Chinese authorities , which vilify him as a separatist .
Stressing that studying Buddhism enabled him to be happy in adversity , he urged the crowd to show compassion in their own lives and finished with some practical advice .
" Be careful of the weather .
Do n't get ill , " he said , as many shivered in the downpour .
At an age when most others are putting their feet up , the Dalai Lama keeps up a globe - trotting schedule that would tire someone half his age , travelling to countries willing to defy Chinese pressure not to grant him a visa .
In an average year , he is away from home for about half the time and in the past 12 months has visited France , Switzerland , the Czech Republic , Germany , Poland , the United States ( twice ) , Taiwan and most recently Japan .
As the years go by , however , thoughts are inevitably turning to the issue of succession .
The Dalai Lama has been in hospital twice in recent times - for a pinched nerve in February last year and for surgery to remove stones from his gall bladder in October 2008 .
While decades of on - off negotiations with Beijing have seen no tangible progress , the Nobel peace laureate has been extremely successful in keeping the Tibet issue alive with a campaign that continues to attract global sympathy .
There is concern , however , that his death might prove a blow to the cohesion and momentum of the Tibetan movement that has relied for so long on his leadership and the reverence in which he is held by sympathisers .
" It will be a completely different ball game when His Holiness is no longer with us , " the president of the Tibetan Youth Congress , Tsewang Rigzin , said .
" We need to be prepared for that day when it comes and that means having a strong government in exile and a good education system for the young generation . "
The prime minister of the government - in - exile , Samdhong Rinpoche , urged the Dalai Lama to slow down to preserve his energy as his endeavours " are certainly taking a great toll " .
" We would like to implore him to kindly see to it that his daily programs do not come in the way of his good health , " he added .
China has already indicated that it will take a hard line on the selection of a successor , with Qiangba Puncog , Tibet 's former governor , insisting in March that final approval lies with Beijing .
Traditionally , the search for a new Dalai Lama is conducted by high lamas who fan out across Tibet to find the reincarnation .
One senior figure tipped to assume the spiritual leadership of Tibet after the Dalai Lama , the 26 - year - old Karmapa Lama , was seated conspicuously next to the 75 - year - old current leader at the front of the stage .
Elsewhere , Tibetan communities in North America , Europe and Australia organised cultural events to celebrate the day , while numerous Internet campaigns collected birthday tributes .
In McLeod Ganj , people arrived hours in advance to secure prime positions to witness the two - hour ceremony of speeches and traditional Tibetan dance and song .
" This is fabulous , you really need to be here , " said 61 - year - old American Jan Owen from California , a member of a tour group put together by a Buddhist leader in the US .
" There 's a lot of good energy here , do n't you think ?
It 's great fun . "

FROM the earliest days of the credit crisis , the nation ’s big financial institutions have been less than forthcoming about ballooning loan losses buried inside their books .
To some degree this is understandable : denial is a powerful thing , after all , and writing off troubled loans during a period of severe stress is , for bankers , the equivalent of getting a root canal .
As profits rebound at many of these institutions , however , artful dodging becomes more disturbing .
And when disguising problems winds up harming the taxpayer  the same folks who rode to the rescue of banks with billions of dollars  the denial is downright exasperating .
Among the more glaring bookkeeping fictions on big banks ’ balance sheets today are the values they assign to all of the bounteous second mortgage loans .
doled out during the mortgage bonanza .
As any realist will attest , many of these loans are worth little , and yet there they sit , at fantasy levels , on banks ’ ledgers .
Refusing to face reality on second liens ultimately hurts shareholders .
But taxpayers are the ones holding the bag when institutions try to avoid losses by refusing to buy back problem loans they have sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the mortgage finance giants that are wards of the state .
If you 're wondering why this taste of the planned Pac - Man television show looks a little blurry , it 's because you 're supposed to be experiencing it in dazzling 3D , an effect hard to capture in internet video .

Namco Bandai and ex-Marvel Studios producer Avi Arad unveiled their vision for the new Pac - Man TV series at an E3 event last week , reportedly before they 'd shown it to studios .
This is Pac - Man as a high school teenager , an overeater who must protect the three - dimensional world from ghosts .
Given the short list of networks that broadcast content in 3D and the fact that this four - minute - long appears to be the extent of the project thus far , do n't think we 'll be seeing kid Pac - Man on Saturday morning cartoons for a while ( if ever ) .
Not sure if that 's a bad thing ...
A giant planet lurks in the dust and debris surrounding a young , nearby star – and astronomers have finally seen it in action .
Using the Very Large Telescope in Chile , astronomers took infrared images of the planet in two different positions around its star in 2003 and late 2009 .
" It 's so exciting that we can see it , " said astronomer Paul Kalas of the University of California , Berkeley , who was not involved in the new work .
" We 've been looking a long time . "
The discovery , announced June 10 in Science , proves that giant planets can form quickly around young stars and suggests that dust disks are signposts for stars hosting giant planets .
Beta Pictoris , a star almost twice the mass of the sun and located 63 light - years away , has been a celebrity among planet hunters since the 1984 discovery of a wide halo of dust and rocky debris that could eventually coalesce into planets .
Later observations showed that the disk was oddly warped , and that it had a big hole near the center .
Theoretical models predicted that a planet around five to 10 times the mass of Jupiter could make both the warp and the hole .
But when Anne- Marie Lagrange of the Grenoble Observatory in France , first author of the new paper , and her colleagues observed the star in 2003 , they saw nothing .
" The tools we had in 2003 were not precise enough , " she said .
After Kalas 's group and another team released images of planets around the stars Fomalhaut and HR 8799 in November 2008 , Lagrange and colleagues tried again .
They used newer techniques to cancel out the light from the star , allowing the planet to shine through .
The image showed a bright object next to Beta Pictoris , but whether it was a planet or another star in the background was unclear .
" Frankly , if I had a bet on whether or not they 'd actually seen a planet back in 2003 ...
I would definitely bet it was not a planet , " said astronomer Ben Zuckerman of the University of California , Los Angeles , who was involved in imaging the planets around HR 8799 .
Follow - up observations in late 2008 and early 2009 also came up empty .
Finally , in October 2009 , the planet re-emerged on the other side of the star .
Lagrange and colleagues kept taking images until March 2010 to confirm that the object was a planet .
" We spent a really long time , nights and days , to check it , " she said .
" It really shows that when we see disks , we have to look at every detail , because they can indicate the presence of a planet . "
Because Beta Pictoris is such a young star – about 10 million years old , or two thousandths the age of the solar system – studying its planetary system can help astronomers decide between competing models of planet formation .
For instance , earlier theoretical work showed that debris disks around stars broke up fairly quickly , within a few million years .
Some theorists worried that massive planets would n't be able to form fast enough , but the planet around Beta Pictoris is proof that they can .
" It 's taking a snapshot of another solar system right after it 's born , " Kalas said .
" The other alternative is to invent a time machine and go back 4.5 billion years and look at our own Jupiter when it just formed .
But obviously we can't do that . "
The planet weighs in between six and 12 times the mass of Jupiter , similar to the models ' predictions .
It orbits its star at about the orbit of Saturn , between eight and 13 times the distance from the Earth to the sun , making it the closest planet to a star ever imaged .
It also means the planet makes a complete circuit around its star every 17 to 30 Earth years , well within human lifetimes .
" Eventually , we 'll have a movie of this planet going around Beta Pic , " Kalas said .
By contrast , the planets around HR 8799 and Fomalhaut take between 100 and 870 years to complete an orbit .
The next step is to observe the planet in more wavelengths to get an idea of what its atmosphere is made of , Lagrange said .
And with new instruments like the Gemini Planet Imager coming online , the next few years should see even more direct images of extrasolar planets .
" The future is really bright , " said astronomer Christian Marois of the National Research Council of Canada ’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics .
" It 'll be a really interesting field in the next two or three years . "

THE SINGULARITY IS NEAR :
When Humans Transcend Biology
By Ray Kurzweil , Viking Press About the Book
At the onset of the twenty - first century , humanity stands on the verge of the most transforming and the most thrilling period in its history .
It will be an era in which the very nature of what it means to be human will be both enriched and challenged , as our species breaks the shackles of its genetic legacy and achieves inconceivable heights of intelligence , material progress , and longevity .
For over three decades , the great inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil has been one of the most respected and provocative advocates of the role of technology in our future .
In his classic The Age of Spiritual Machines , he presented the daring argument that with the ever - accelerating rate of technological change , computers would rival the full range of human intelligence at its best .
Now , in The Singularity Is Near , he examines the next step in this inexorable evolutionary process : the union of human and machine , in which the knowledge and skills embedded in our brains will be combined with the vastly greater capacity , speed , and knowledge - sharing ability of our own creations .
That merging is the essence of the Singularity , an era in which our intelligence will become increasingly nonbiological and trillions of times more powerful than it is today — the dawning of a new civilization that will enable us to transcend our biological limitations and amplify our creativity .
In this new world , there will be no clear distinction between human and machine , real reality and virtual reality .
We will be able to assume different bodies and take on a range of personae at will .
In practical terms , human aging and illness will be reversed ; pollution will be stopped ; world hunger and poverty will be solved .
Nanotechnology will make it possible to create virtually any physical product using inexpensive information processes and will ultimately turn even death into a soluble problem .
While the social and philosophical ramifications of these changes will be profound , and the threats they pose considerable , The Singularity Is Near maintains a radically optimistic view of the future course of human development .
As such , it offers a view of the coming age that is both a dramatic culmination of centuries of technological ingenuity and a genuinely inspiring vision of our ultimate destiny .

When it comes to health , it is important that you are able to obtain medical attention when needed .
From a broken bone to infectious diseases , being able to obtain urgent care services when you realize it will help you to get the condition under control so that you or your loved one will be able to properly heal from it .
Urgent Care Center
First of all , some hospitals today have urgent care centers that are separate from the emergency room .
These allow patients to get quick services but not be in competition for emergency room doctors .
Of course , if you have uncontrolled bleeding or some similar situation , the emergency room might be the best option for you to explore .
However , many urgent care centers have staff capable of handling these types of issues .
Community Clinics
In addition to seeking urgent care through your local hospital , you might find a wide range of clinics in your community that offer these services .
Some are stand alone agencies that offer exclusively urgent care while others are part of a larger practice .
For instance , you might have clinics where multiple practitioners across various specialties have offices .
One or more of them might participate in the urgent care program .
You can find out more of the participating clinics over at Urgentcarenearme.me .
Who Needs Urgent Care
How do you know if you are going to need urgent care ?
Well , it will depend on several things .
One indicator can be a really high fever .
This is particularly the case when children are involved .
These youngsters have a much more difficult time when their temperatures spike over one hundred degrees .
If you are in doubt , you can always call your pediatrician and ask for guidance .
Another option that you have is to call the urgent care center or check out their website to see what type of services are offered .
They will often advise you as to what services are not provided and tell you a more appropriate venue for your needs .
When you go to an urgent care center , you will be responsible for the bill .
This is a part of the paperwork that you will be filling out when you first arrive .
If you have insurance , including Medicaid , make sure that you bring along proof .
However , you might not be covered for the services .
There are various factors involved , including the type of coverage that you have and the rules regarding care .
If you are financially responsible for the entire bill , you will need to be able to pay at least a substantial portion .
In some cases , you might even have to pay it all the same day .
Make sure that you understand and are ready to handle whatever may come your way in regards to the medical bills .
Urgent Care Center Opening Hours
Urgent care service clinics have differing hours of operation .
While some are open around the clock every day of the year , others are not .
Always confirm that the facility will be open before you travel to it .
This way , if it is not , you can reroute your plans to the nearest urgent care center that is open at the time of your need .
Although you might be frightened by the situation , panicking is the worst thing that you can do , for yourself and the injured party .
Instead , keep a calm head and get yourself to the closest urgent care facility that is open and can handle your case .
Once you have everything under control , then you can let yourself have a good cry if needed .
Until then , let the professionals take care of you and your loved ones .
These facilities are great and cheaper than emergency room visits .
If you live in a state with a bottle deposit law , you may have encountered Reverse Vending Machines ( RVMs ) at supermarkets or recycling centers .
For consumers , RVMs provide a simple , clean and convenient way to recycle used beverage containers .
For retailers and recycling centers , RVMs provide a streamlined platform to automate the collection , sorting and compacting of recyclables .
As public sentiment continues to shift in favor of businesses with strong sustainability initiatives , consumers are beginning to look for better recycling options beyond the traditional supermarket and recycling center venues .
Facilities managers in universities , entertainment arenas , public parks , and hospitals are beginning to seek out new options for automated recycling programs .
Blue recycling bins are a fixture in many institutions and public spaces .
However , these blue bins lack the interactive element and ability to provide incentives that RVMs have ; members of the public often automatically pass them by or throw non-recyclable trash in them .
Many organizations are realizing that to take their recycling programs to a new level , automated recycling machines can be an effective way to not only incentivize people to recycle , but also show that the organization or facility is serious about reducing litter and stress on landfills .
The introduction of RVMs in institutions and public spaces is showing that automation can improve the rate of recycling in busy facilities .
With the right kind of arrangements in place , RVMs can even forge a valuable link between business and the public , providing innovative ways for the machines to help pay for themselves .
Cleaning Up on Campus
Last year , Sacred Heart University in Connecticut was looking for ways to eliminate litter , reduce its trash volume , and cut the university 's waste hauling expenses .
To address these challenges , the university installed RVMs to capture the thousands of used bottles thrown away on campus each month from the regular trash .
{related_content}
To help finance these RVMs , the university tied its recycling initiative with sponsorships provided by consumer product companies .
Students and faculty who returned their empty plastic and aluminum beverage containers to the RVMs on campus received coupons to redeem goods from key sponsors , including BIC ( stationery products and shavers ) , FUJIFILM ( digital cameras ) , as well as items from the university 's food service provider .
" Our previous recycling program -- utilizing simple blue recycle bins around campus -- though effective in encouraging students , faculty and visitors to recycle , was not enough to get the job done , so we were looking for a more interactive solution , " says Floyd Young , Director of Facilities / Campus Operations at Sacred Heart University .
The RVMs can accept up to 20 containers per minute and have a total capacity of 500 containers per machine , depending on the material .
At Fairfield University , also in Connecticut , a similar program offers students the opportunity to recycle bottles using an RVM , and then get an automatic receipt for their deposit credit on their university " Stag " card , which can be used to pay for food , books , laundry and other campus expenses .
Sustainable Entertainment Venues
The Dunkin ' Donuts Center , a SMG managed facility in Providence , R.I. that hosts sporting events , major concerts and other large entertainment attractions , is using RVMs as the centerpiece of a program to improve recycling in the facility .
The RVMs are installed in the facility 's food courts , providing the public with a clean , easy way to dispose of their glass , plastic and aluminum beverage containers responsibly .
The new recycling initiative is largely driven by pressure from entertainers who appear at the center .
" Many of today 's top performers are insisting that venues have sustainability and recycling programs , and are only willing to appear at arenas that make a serious effort to provide event - goers with high - quality recycling , " says Larry Lepore of the Dunkin ' Donuts Center .
He adds : " The RVMs will also save the facility $ 1400 in trash haulage costs monthly . "
The center is using the RVMs to interact directly with their patrons , offering prizes to build greater incentives to recycle .
Every 100th recycler wins complementary tickets to upcoming events and many other prizes .
Reducing Litter in Parks and Public Spaces
RVMs are also being used in national parks and other public spaces , to reduce litter and promote environmentally responsibility among patrons and in the community .
At Forever Resorts ' Grand Canyon Lodge - North Rim in Grand Canyon National Park , the lodge has an RVM installed on the rim of the canyon at the General Store and Campground area .
They have established their own deposit system for beverage containers :
Its shop sells drinks with a high deposit , to encourage patrons to bring the bottles back for recycling and cash redemption .
In another example of RVMs used in public spaces to reduce litter , machines were temporarily installed at Madison Square Park in New York City for a daytime concert series .
The RVMs , provided by TOMRA , in partnership with the Glass Packaging Institute ( GPI ) and VOSS Water , allowed park visitors to dispose of their glass , aluminum , and plastic beverage containers in RVMs , with a chance to win prizes .
Prizes included iPod Shuffles and t- shirts .
All deposit refund monies collected were donated to the Madison Square Park Conservancy , a non-profit organization that supports the park .
Hospitals Make Use of RVMs
Every day , hospitals generate hundreds of used plastic and aluminum beverage containers from patient meal trays , staff break rooms and visiting areas .
Two New England health providers -- Milford Regional Medical Center in Milford , Mass. , and Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven , Conn. -- recently acquired RVMs to improve their recycling efforts , reduce trash haulage costs and promote healthy , environmentally sustainable facilities .
According to Joseph Boczanowski , Director of Facilities , Milford Regional Medical Center , RVMs offer clean , space - saving technology that is easy to use by the Food and Nutrition staff , medical personnel and visitors .
Yale New Haven Hospital is leveraging its RVMs to support its Employee Hardship Fund .
Each time a staff member or visitor inserts a used beverage container in one of the hospital 's RVMs , proceeds from the value of the state bottle deposit will be contributed to the Employee Hardship Fund .
Linking Business with their Communities
Interest in using automated recycling machines at various public facilities is growing , in great part due to the fact that the machines are capable of hosting innovative programs , promotions and fundraisers that incentivize people to recycle .
Today 's RVMs are easy to install and maintain ; some models have no special electrical requirements to run , so they 're an easy addition to any number of venues .
As organizations and institutions seek to respond to public demands for more environmentally friendly facilities , automated recycling machines have a key role to play in linking business with the people in their communities , as they work together for a greener future .
Warren Stoll is Vice President of Marketing and Business Development at TOMRA , which provides solutions that improve the economics and convenience of beverage container recycling .
The Wagon Wheel Effect describes a phenomenon witnessed by over 90 % of adults in the Western World as they move from childhood into adolescence and adulthood .
It usually works like this : one day you enter your local sweet shop and happen to notice they sell Wagon Wheels - those delicious chocolate and marshmallow treats .
Overcome by nostalgia for when your mother used to buy them for you , you get some but are horrified to discover they have shrunk .
Not just shrunk , in fact , they seem to be tiny .
It used to take you the best part of an hour to eat a Wagon Wheel ; it was a meal in itself .
Now you can pop the whole thing into your mouth in one go .
Your mind fills with disgust at the greedy confectionery corporations who have conspired to make smaller and smaller sweets as you have gotten older .
As if inflation is n't bad enough , they have to go and do this as well ...

You can pick one up today for $ 101,500 USD which makes it the cheapest option here and when you remember the gas money you wo n’t be spending it almost seems like a bargain .
KANDAHAR , Afghanistan ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ NATO on Thursday blamed the Taliban for a suicide attack that killed at least 40 Afghan wedding guests in an area where US - led troops are massing to drive insurgents from their fiefdom .
Officials said a suicide bomber strapped with explosives had walked into Wednesday ’s wedding party — which relatives said was attended by members of an anti-Taliban militia — and unleashed a deadly hail of ballbearings .

The Taliban , who are leading a nearly nine - year insurgency against the Western - backed government and the estimated 142,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan , denied responsibility and blamed a NATO airstrike for the deaths .
More than 70 people were wounded when the explosion ripped through the celebrations in Arghandab district , 20 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of Kandahar city , local officials said .
Most of the victims were male as the explosion occurred in an area of the wedding festivities reserved for men , they said .
The groom ’s brother , Mohammad Zanif , told AFP : “ My brother was wounded .
We do n’t know what happened .
There was an enormous explosion and as a result everyone there was either killed or injured . ”
The groom is a policeman and his colleagues were attending the wedding , Kandahar Governor Turiyalai Wisa told a news conference Thursday .

“ A suicide attack was the cause of this bloody incident , ” he said .
“ The casualties are massive but so far we have been able to confirm 40 people killed and another 78 wounded , which includes 14 children , ” the provincial governor said .
“ Our investigation is ongoing and the casualty toll might rise .
Most of the wounded are in critical condition , and some of them unfortunately may lose their lives . ”

NATO Lieutenant General Nick Parker said : “ This ruthless violence brought to the Afghan people at what should have been a time for celebration demonstrates the Taliban ’s sickening and indiscriminate tactics . ”
But the Taliban , who routinely deny causing civilian casualties , blamed the bloodshed on NATO bombing and offered condolences .

“ This is a disaster .
We blame the foreign forces and the Afghan government for this calamity .
We pray for the quick recovery of the wounded and patience for the families of those martyred , ” Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP .
Kandahar is the focus of a massive build - up by US - led military forces trying to drive the Taliban from their spiritual homeland and end their bloody insurgency .
Wednesday ’s explosion came during a particularly bloody week for foreign forces with 23 international soldiers killed , including four US servicemen who died when a NATO helicopter was shot down in neighbouring Helmand province .

US military chief Admiral Mike Mullen offered condolences after the wedding attack and warned that more bloodshed was expected .
“ We will succeed in Afghanistan .
We will prevent that country from ever becoming a safe haven again , but it will be a slow , messy and often deadly business , ” he said in Washington .
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the military expected a “ high level of violence , particularly this summer ” as coalition forces move into areas controlled by the Taliban .
Relatives told AFP that the groom and other wedding guests were members of an anti-Taliban militia set up with the support of US Special Forces .

Brigadier General Ben Hodges , head of US forces in the south , told AFP that US Special Forces were helping villages organise their own protection against Taliban militants .
“ There are some programmes where special forces units are out in a village stability programme where they might find a large village and then help train the locals to defend themselves , ” Hodges said .
The Taliban rejected a “ peace jirga ” hosted by President Hamid Karzai last week with a view to coaxing militant fighters to lay down their weapons .
The jirga was marred by a rocket attack for which the Taliban claimed responsibility , prompting two of Karzai ’s top security officials to resign .

These cervical photos are from a 25 years old woman who has never given birth .
She has a copper Paraguard IUD which was placed inside her uterus about a year ago .
This is not a hormonal form of birth control , so she ovulates , which you can tell from the changes in her discharge .
You can see the strings of the IUD protruding through the os in the photos .
The IUD sometimes causes her occasional cramps or heavier bleeding .

The Princeton University scientists and others in the Borexino Collaboration have detected geoneutrinos at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics .
The discovery could explain how reactions taking place in the planet 's deep interior affect events on the surface .

An international team including scientists from Princeton University has detected subatomic particles deep within the Earth 's interior .
The discovery could help geologists understand how reactions taking place in the planet 's interior affect events on the surface such as earthquakes and volcanoes .
Someday , scientists may know enough about the sources and flow of heat in the Earth to predict events like the recent volcanic eruption in Iceland .
The finding , made by the Borexino Collaboration at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics , was reported in a paper published in the April issue of Physics Letters B .
The work builds on earlier evidence of so - called " geoneutrinos " obtained during a Japanese experiment in 2005 .
" This is an important result , " said Frank Calaprice , a professor of physics at Princeton and one of the study 's authors .
" It shows that geoneutrinos have been detected and firmly establishes a new tool to study the interior of the Earth . "
Neutrinos , which are chargeless , inert , fundamental particles , are emitted by the sun and cosmic rays entering the Earth 's atmosphere .
Geoneutrinos are antineutrinos -- neutrinos ' antimatter counterparts .
Geoneutrinos originate from the radioactive decay of uranium , thorium and potassium in the Earth 's crust and mantle -- the thick layer extending to 1,800 miles below the surface .
At laboratories like Gran Sasso , researchers are using instruments that act as geoneutrino " telescopes , " looking into the Earth 's interior by detecting these curious particles .
Scientists expect that geoneutrinos will aid them in better identifying what constitutes matter deep within the Earth .
" It 's a very significant discovery and holds much promise for better understanding the composition of the Earth and how the Earth operates , " said Thomas Duffy , a professor of geosciences at Princeton , who was not involved in the research .
Earth scientists would like to know more about the crucial role that decaying elements such as uranium and thorium play in heating up the Earth and causing convection in its mantle -- the slow , steady flow of hot rock in the interior carrying heat from great depths to the Earth 's surface .
Convection , in turn , drives plate tectonics and all the accompanying dynamics of geology seen from the surface -- continents moving , seafloor spreading , volcanoes erupting and earthquakes occurring .
No one knows whether radioactive decay dominates the heating action or is just a player among many factors .
The origin of the power produced within the Earth is one of the fundamental questions of geology , according to Calaprice .
The definite detection of geoneutrinos by the Borexino experiment confirms that radioactivity contributes a significant fraction -- possibly most -- of the power , he said .

The Borexino experiment actually was designed to detect low - energy solar neutrinos , not geoneutrinos .
" As we were building the experiment , we realized we had the capability of detecting particles that were coming at us from the radioactivity deep inside the Earth , " said Cristiano Galbiati , an assistant professor of physics and another of the 13 Princeton collaborators among the 88 scientists involved in the research .
The Borexino project is located nearly a mile below the surface of the Gran Sasso mountain about 60 miles outside of Rome -- an ideal spot for studying neutrinos because the rock shields the detector from other types of radiation and particles that would overwhelm the sensing device .
Much of the Borexino experiment is a process of eliminating the " noise " of background radiation .
Neutrinos are notoriously difficult to detect because they usually pass straight through matter , rarely interacting with it .
The detector is composed of a nylon sphere containing 1,000 tons of a hydrocarbon liquid .
An array of ultrasensitive photodetectors is aimed at the sphere that is encased within a stainless steel sphere .
All of this is surrounded by 2,400 tons of highly purified water held within another steel sphere measuring 59 feet .
Solar neutrinos produce one type of signal when they come into contact with the detector , and geoneutrinos produce another type .
Because there are a thousand times fewer geoneutrinos striking the detector , there are only a few events that occur per year .
The paper describes two years of results , running up to December 2009 .
The experiment is continuing .
The importance of geoneutrinos was pointed out by scientists in the 1960s , and a seminal study by Lawrence Krauss , Sheldon Glashow and David Schramm in 1994 laid the foundation for the field .
In 2005 , a Japan - U.S. collaboration called KamLAND operating an experiment at a mine in Japan reported an excess of low - energy " antineutrinos . "
Scientists can envision a day when a series of geoneutrino - detecting facilities , located at strategic spots around the globe , can sense particles to get a detailed understanding of the Earth 's interior and the source of its internal heat .
This data could provide enough information to predict the occurrence of events such as volcano eruptions and earthquakes .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and Italy 's National Institute for Nuclear Physics .
Updates : AIPAC urges members to support “ Israel ’s right to self defense ” and contact lawmakers regarding the flotilla incident ; maintains list on congressional statements ; attempts to link activists to Qaeda
Senator Harry Reid ( D - NV ) is facing a bruising battle this election year , and probably needs all the help he can get .
According to Maplight.org , the Senate Majority Leader has received $ 179,640 in pro-Israel campaign contributions .
ADVERTISEMENT
Update : The Hill reports : “ AIPAC has also been urging people to contact their lawmakers and ask them to issue statements of support for Israel . ”
At its website , AIPAC writes ,
Urge your members of Congress to issue statements in support of Israel ’s right to self - defense .
As Israel faces international criticism over its response to the flotilla seeking to break its blockade of Hamas - controlled Gaza , it is vital for lawmakers to show their support for the Jewish state .
Israel has legitimate self - defense reasons to inspect the cargo going into Gaza , where the U.S. - designated terrorist group has smuggled in thousands of munitions and rockets for use in attacks against Israeli civilians .
AIPAC has compiled a list of Congressional statements on the Flotilla .
Interestingly , one of the few congressional members quoted in the press as critical of Israel , Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass ) , walks back some of his criticism , as quoted in AIPAC ’s rapidly growing pdf ( 35 pages long at presstime ) .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The article in todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Boston Herald is inaccurate in saying that I ‘ had harsh words yesterday for the Israeli Navy , ' ” Frank stated .
“ The harsh words I spoke were specifically aimed at some non-governmental settlers in the West Bank who I believe have treated Arabs very badly , and , it should be noted , in contradiction to official Israeli government policy .
But I had nothing critical to say about the Israeli Navy .
Indeed , I noted that I was not familiar with the specifics of the incident , and I talked about the U.S. experience in Afghanistan as an example of the difficult problems that occur when military organizations are required to use force . ”
A background memo linked on the page , titled “ Who Was Behind the Gaza Flotilla ? ” , claims that the group is linked to al Qaeda .
The Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation ( IHH ) was responsible for dispatching the Gaza flotilla .
IHH was founded in Istanbul in 1995 .
It has well documented ties to Hamas and has been linked to other Islamic terrorist organizations , including alÃ¢â‚ ¬ÂQaeda . ….
A French examination of IHHÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 1996 phone records showed repeated telephone calls to an alÃ¢â‚ ¬Â Qaeda guesthouse in Milan and to various Algerian terrorist operatives active throughout in Europe . ….
In a 1996 report , the CIA identified IHH as a radical Islamic humanitarian organization , according to The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¢ French counterÃ¢â‚ ¬Âterrorism magistrate JeanÃ¢â‚ ¬ÂLouis BruguiÃƒÂ¨re testified during the trial of failed Millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam that IHH had played an “ important role ” in the alÃ¢â‚ ¬Â Qaeda terrorist plot .
He further stated that in relation to the MontrealÃ¢â‚ ¬Âbased alÃ¢â‚ ¬Â Qaeda cell : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The IHH is an NGO , but it was kind of a type of coverÃ¢â‚ ¬Âup in order to obtain forged documents and also to obtain different forms of infiltration for mujahedeen in combat .
And also to go and gather these mujahedeen .
And finally , one of the last responsibilities that they had was also to be implicated or involved in weapons trafficking .
Ã¢â‚¬Â

However , a Turkish paper notes , “ Despite its expressions of concern over the connections of a Turkish charity that helped organize a relief flotilla that suffered a deadly raid by Israeli commandos , Washington has conceded that it has no hard evidence to prove any ties between the Humanitarian Aid Foundation ( Ã„ Â°HH ) and al - Qaeda . ”
Speaking at a daily press briefing on Wednesday in Washington , D.C. , US State Department spokesperson Philip J. Crowley was reminded of allegations that the Ã„ Â°HH Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ supports terrorist organizationsÃ¢â‚¬Â and was urged to make a statement clarifying this issue .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We know that Ã„ Â°HH representatives have met with senior Hamas officials in Turkey , Syria and Gaza over the past three years .
That is obviously of great concern to us .
That said , the Ã „ Â°HH , which stands for the Humanitarian Relief Foundation , has not been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Crowley said in response .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We cannot validate that , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he replied when posed the question , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ So the US does not believe it has connections to al - Qaeda ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
The Ã „ Â°HH , which is not among some 45 groups listed as terrorist organizations by the US State DepartmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism , vehemently denies ties to radical groups .

Following the lead of the Obama administration , and nearly all elected US politicians on both sides of the aisle , Reid is firmly defending Israel ’s interception of a “ freedom flotilla ” headed for Gaza , which resulted in the death of at least nine activists , including a US citizen , based on the grounds that the country has a right to defend itself .
Despite widespread condemnation from the world , and even from elements of the US media , few Democrats are willing to go against Israel , more for the sake of donations from AIPAC than votes , as many liberal Jewish Americans side with the activists .
“ Israel is one of our strongest and most important allies , and the United States stands firmly with Israel at this critical time , ” Reid ’s statement says .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Senate Majority Leader notes , “ I deeply regret the loss of life in the flotilla incident , including the death of an American citizen . ”
Reports claim that Furkan Dogan was shot at close range , with four bullets in his head and one in his chest .
Reid then states that Israel acted to stop shipment of “ weapons , ” but nothing was found on the boat except for a few slingshots and knives that the IDF highlighted in a series of videos on YouTube .
Without a word about the controversial Israel blockade of Gaza , Reid also mentions fears of “ terrorists , ” and then essentially blames activists for what happened for failing to accede to Israel ’s instructions while they were in international waters .
Israel has an obligation to protect its citizens and therefore has a clear right under international law to prevent weapons from getting in the hands of terrorists determined to target them .
Israel indicated it was willing to put in place a process to ensure that legitimate humanitarian relief reached Gaza .
Unfortunately this offer was rejected .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Israel has pledged to carry out a transparent and thorough investigation of this incident , and I look forward to its findings , ” Reid ’s statement concludes , without mentioning that Israel has rejected any international probes undertaken by independent bodies .
At the Washington Post ’s Plumline , an outraged Greg Sargent wrote ,
Notice that there ’s only “ regret , ” no hint of condemnation , over the American citizen ’s death .
Notice that the statement comes close to blaming the flotilla activists for provoking the incident by rejecting the offer by Israel to transport the aid over land .
And notice the blanket endorsement of Israel overseeing the probe of the incident , with no call for any international involvement .
Behold the mainstream of your Democratic Party .
There ’s no balance here whatsoever .
At Salon , Steve Kornacki writes , “ Even when Israel gets itself in trouble , Democrats and Republicans in Washington sound identical .
During Israel ’s brutal destruction of Gaza in 2009 , the Senate ’s Republican leader , Mitch McConnell , said simply that ‘ the Israelis have every right to defend themselves against these acts of terrorism . ’
The Democratic leader , Harry Reid , said the same thing . ”
While BP may be suggesting that oil is flooding out of the underwater leak at the rate of 5,000 barrels a day , the reality is far , far worse .
A professor of engineering told Congress that the reality is 95,000 barrels of oil are gushing out of the oil leak daily .
That 's 4 million gallons a day .
And now that oil is heading for Florida .
In yet another horrible illustration of what happens when the slavering corpocrats get behind the wheel of anything whatsoever , Gary E. Strong , the UCLA University Librarian , passed around a letter yesterday outlining the need for a possible UC - wide boycott of Nature Publishing Group .
The letter , signed by Laine Farley , Richard A. Schneider and Brian E.C. Schottlaender , three of the top UC library honchos , is harsh .
NPG has insisted on increasing the price of our license for Nature and its affiliated journals by 400 percent beginning in 2011 , which would raise our cost for their 67 journals by well over $ 1 million dollars per year .
[…]
UC Libraries have already taken a stand against NPG .
After recently acquiring Scientific American , NPG doubled the institutional site license fee and raised the price of an institutional print subscription seven - fold .
In response , UC Libraries , along with numerous other institutions throughout the country , discontinued their license to the online version and reduced the number of print subscriptions .
As a first response to the current NPG proposal , UC Libraries plan to forgo all online subscriptions to any new NPG journals .
But more drastic actions may be necessary .
Since California in general and the UC system in particular have been going through a , erm , rough patch lately , the academics are extremely , albeit decorously , pissed off .
But these LOLLibrarians have got an ace up their sleeve , it turns out , because NPG is highly dependent on the efforts of their own colleagues :
UC Faculty and researchers author a significant percentage of all articles published in NPG journals and are a major force in shaping the prestige of its publications .
In the past six years , UC authors have contributed approximately 5300 articles to these journals , 638 of them in the flagship journal Nature .
Using NPG ’s own figures , an analysis by CDL suggests that UC articles published in Nature alone have contributed at least $ 19 million dollars in revenue to NPG over the past 6 years - or more than $ 3 million dollars per year for just that one journal .
Moreover , UC Faculty supply countless hours serving as reviewers , editors , and advisory board members .
Which is Academese for SUCK ON THAT .
The boycott would ask UC faculty and researchers to refuse to peer review any manuscripts for NPG journals , to resign from NPG editorial and advisory boards , and , most interestingly , to go elsewhere in order to publish their own work .
The exciting thing about that is that there really is an “ elsewhere ” in the world of academic publishing : open access journals and repositories for scholarly work , such as the Public Library of Science ( PloS ) , “ a nonprofit organization of scientists and physicians committed to making the world ’s scientific and medical literature a public resource . ”
PLoS journals require the researcher to foot some of the cost of publication ( usually covered by the institutions by which they ’re employed , ) but copyright rests with the author .
PloS journals are published entirely under a creative commons license , so that anyone can read , reprint and distribute their content for free .
This means real access to leading - edge scholarship for everybody with an Internet connection , which , Yay !
The letter also encourages recipients to “ [ t ] alk widely about Nature Publishing Group pricing tactics and business strategies with colleagues outside UC , ” which I AM .
Even though I do n’t work for UC , I think everybody should know about the chilling effect of vampirically profit - driven academic publishing practices on scholarship and the free flow of information .

In addition to crystallized cholesterol , atherosclerotic plaques always contain large quantities of immune cells but , surprisingly , no bacteria or viruses .
It was previously unclear just how the body 's own defence forces are called into action .
Even animals that are kept in an absolutely sterile environment can suffer from " clogging " or " furring " of the arteries when their food contains high levels of cholesterol .
The same relationship is found in humans .
The higher the blood cholesterol level , the greater the risk of atherosclerosis and the greater the likelihood of suffering a heart attack .
" We have known this for a long time , " points out Professor Dr. Eicke Latz from Bonn University , " but nobody understood exactly why . "
Professor Latz has been exploring this question in collaboration with Dr Peter Düwell from LMU Munich , Professor Veit Hornung , also from Bonn University , and research colleagues based in the US .
The researchers have succeeded for the first time in identifying the molecular trigger for inflammation in large blood vessels .
" We 've found that , given a certain type of nutrition , cholesterol crystals are deposited in the arterial walls after a relatively short time , " says Dr Düwell .
" These crystals are then taken up by the immune system 's scavenger cells . "
This becomes the starting signal for a catastrophic chain reaction .
The unhealthy food results in the accumulation of cholesterol crystals that activate an " inflammasome " complex within the scavenger cells .
One of the functions of this multi-protein complex is to induce the release of inflammatory mediators .
The mediators then attract more and more immune cells to the site where the problem is occurring .
The growing invasion ultimately destabilizes the vessel walls -- with potentially life - threatening consequences .
Gout in the arteries
" Very similar processes are observed with cases of gout , " explains Professor Latz , " although that mainly occurs in the joints . "
Extremely painful attacks of gout can also be triggered by an unhealthy diet .
This time however , the culprit is not fat but nucleic acids from , for instance , muscle tissue ( meat ) .
The uric acid formed in the digestion process then crystallizes .
These crystals can unleash a powerful inflammatory reaction .
Professor Latz has recently been recruited by the University of Bonn after working ten years in basic research in the United States .
Here , he heads the new Institute for Innate Immunity ( Institut für Angeborene Immunität ) , which has a research focus on the immune mechanisms that cause inflammatory reactions .
The innate immune system forms part of the body 's own defence mechanism and is able to respond rapidly and directly to a number of alarm signals that appear in the tissue environment .
These triggers not only include viruses , bacteria and fungi but also certain crystals and other substances that occur during infections of in stress situations .
The strength of the innate immune system is that it can respond very quickly to situations that are of danger to the host .
The problem , however , is that it can also overshoot the mark .
This type of overreaction is also seen in the case of pneumoconioses such as the black lung , a disease which frequently affects miners .
In these lung diseases , a chronic inflammatory reaction is triggered by inhaled crystals made of silicates or asbestos .
The molecular mechanisms of crystal recognition are similar to those triggered by cholesterol crystals in blood vessels .
Starting point for developing new drugs
There is still a piece of the jigsaw puzzle missing which researchers need to complete the overall picture .
" We do n't know precisely how the cholesterol crystals activate the inflammasome , " says Professor Latz .
The findings of this study however , offer some starting points for developing new drug therapies .
At present , statins are widely used in therapy .
Statins reduce the synthesis of endogenous -- i.e. the body 's self - produced cholesterol and diminish the risk of heart attack or stroke , but they cannot inhibit the absorption of cholesterol from ones diet .
Estimates by the World Health Organization put the number of people now dying from cardiovascular diseases at almost 17 million per year .
This means that one in four deaths worldwide is caused by atherosclerosis .

People who are considered Vegan need all the same essential nutrients that people who are not vegan do .
However , to be Vegan , one not only does not consume meat or meat byproducts , one also has cut out all dairy products , as well .
This , at times , can force people who are Vegans to become rather creative on how they receive their calcium and other essential nutrients .
This is why Vegans have their own food pyramid .
This helps guide those who choose this lifestyle to the path to receiving all the vitamins and minerals they would need to stay healthy .
In a Vegan food pyramid , there are six main food groups .
Like a non-Vegan food pyramid , breads , fruits , and vegetables are still a vital part of a regular diet .
However , instead of receiving servings of meat and milk everyday , Vegans search for calcium - rich foods and protein - rich foods to supplement these courses .
Also , another part of the Vegan food pyramid is to take vitamins , such as Vitamin D , Vitamin B - 12 , and Omega - 3 fatty acids .
This adds to the necessary daily minerals one needs to receive .
While a Vegan may receive some amount of calcium and protein in calcium - rich and protein - rich foods , this helps them reach the correct amount .
Calcium - rich foods are foods are not only restricted to dairy - like foods , such as soy , soy milk , and tofu .
Calcium can also be found in the darker leafy green vegetables , such as artichokes , green beans , and broccoli .
All of these things can bring much needed calcium to the body .
Since the recommended in take for calcium is 1,000 milligrams per day , incorporating these foods in with one ’s vegetables may be an easier tactic than trying to fit in several meals a day .
It is very important , however , to make sure that one does in take a great deal of calcium per day to prevent the risk of fracturing bones and to create stronger overall bone health .
Protein - rich foods can include some of one ’s comfort food favorites .
For example , peanut butter is a great source of protein and vegan - friendly .
The Vegan food pyramid suggests that one receives two to three services of protein - rich foods per day .
Following the “ nut ” trend , all sorts of nuts , such as cashews , macadamias , peanut nuts , and pecans , all are a great source of protein , and a low - fat finger food , containing many healthy Omega - 3 fatty acids , as well .
Tofu can also double as a protein - rich food and a calcium - rich food .
It only takes four ounces of tofu to equal 20 percent of one ’s daily protein intake .
The Vegan food pyramid requires Vegans to receive the same essentials as a non-Vegan person , just in a different and more creative fashion .
When one is Vegan , it is sometimes a challenge to retrieve the correct nutrients , but is not , by far , impossible .
This lifestyle is not only animal - friendly , but also , very healthy and tasty .
It is just a matter of one knowing where to retrieve all of the essential required food items for daily health .

On this long 4th of July weekend , here is an Email from " KC " regarding the costs of education .
" KC " writes ...
Hi Mish ,
I 've emailed you before on this subject .
Today , I came across an article where a small company has started recruiting directly out of high school .
If education costs soar , I believe this is the future .
I 've been suggesting to many people for a while now that it's a win - win for both employer and student to hire straight out of high school .
The student gets four years of work experience and income which is a tremendous head start compared to the debt of a four - year degree .
As the author suggests , after two years the quality of work is indistinguishable between one of his recruits and someone with a degree .
For the company , the benefit is lower salaries and a more stable work force , at least until other companies start hiring directly out of high school also .
With fewer students , education costs must come down and this will make it possible for those who want to become academics to pursue a meaningful and rewarding career ; academic salaries are just not high enough to compensate for the debt burden while retaining the talented .
Keep up the good work .

Recruiting at Zoho / AdventNet
I was recently interviewed on Fox Business News .
The anchor Liz Claman told me one of the things that interested them about Zoho / AdventNet is our recruitment model .
It is a subject I am passionate about - in fact , I spend about as much time on it as our products or technology .
After all , AdventNet has about 700 people , and we are hiring at a steadily increasing pace , so recruitment , motivation and retention are important topics for us .
Our company in India always faced trouble recruiting , because most college graduates , particularly from well - known colleges , would prefer big - brand - name firms .
Simply out of sheer necessity , we started to disregard the kind of college a person graduated from , and the grades they obtained .
In India , that task was made even easier , because much of the Indian industry is boringly conventional , and job advertisements that specify things like " Must have a minimum of 80 % average in college " are fairly common ( so if you got only 79 % , do n't bother to apply ) .
As a result , we get a lot of the arbitrarily - cut - off category applicants .
What we found over time was that there is a lot of really good talent in that pool , which the industry had overlooked .
Based on a few years of observation , we noticed that there was little or no correlation between academic performance , as measured by grades & the type of college a person attended , and their real on - the - job performance .
That was a genuine surprise , particularly for me , as I grew up thinking grades really mattered .
Over time , that led us to be bolder in our search for talent .
We started to ask " What if the college degree itself is not really that useful ?
What if we took kids after high school , train them ourselves ? "
That proved to be an outstanding success .
Within 2 years , those students would become full time employees , their work performance indistinguishable from their college - educated peers .
We have since expanded the program , with the latest batch of students consisting of about 20 , recruited not just from Chennai but smaller towns and villages in the region .
Keeping the US Education Bubble Alive
Campaign to Break up Belgium Gathers Pace : Secession In Our Midst
Large countries can emulate free markets within their borders because , within a single nation , barriers to trade are few and transaction costs are low .
Regional protectionism has few supporters , particularly in the U.S.
–
No one in California , for instance , raises much sand about jobs getting out - sourced to Nevada , even though it happens every day .
Or at the very least , no one argues against interstate competition with the same vehemence as they might over trade between nations .
The greater the extent of the market , the greater the wealth created .
So you might expect a country to maximize its wealth by increasing its size , but the great trade - off in the size of nations fractures and flags that impetus , because the greater the size , the greater the diversity in values .
Things fall apart .
The center can not hold .
Some micro-cultures cannot be homogenized .
In their book on the optimal size of nations , Alberto Alesina and Enrico Spolaore present a thorough analysis of the trade - off and it seems that Belgium is playing out this dramatic dilemma in its current election .
I know little about Belgian politics , even less about the tensions between the Flemish in the north and the socialist French - speakers to the south , but I dare say the future of Belgium waffles .
From today ’s NYTimes :
A stunning electoral success for Bart de Wever ’s Flemish nationalist party , which won the most parliamentary seats , is a significant new challenge to the fragile unity of a federal country where tensions between French and Dutch speakers run deep , and where voters in one region cannot vote for parties in the other .
It has also injected a new element of uncertainty into Europe at an especially difficult time for the European Union , struggling with serious problems over its finances and currency .
Belgium is due to assume the rotating presidency of the European Union in less than three weeks .
But it is likely to take months to negotiate a new coalition , raising the prospect that Belgium will be struggling to assemble its own government at precisely the time it is supposed to be steering Europe out of a deep crisis .
​ Joseph Casias said on Tuesday that it was unfair of WalMart to fire him for legally using marijuana to treat his cancer pain .
With the backing of state and national branches of the American Civil Liberties Union and his attorney , Daniel Grow , Casias said he filed a lawsuit Tuesday morning in Calhoun County Circuit Court against WalMart Stores Inc for wrongful termination last November , reports the
​​The 30 - year - old Battle Creek , Mich , cancer patient had undergone a routine drug screening after hurting his knee on the job last year .
The test showed that Casias had marijuana in his system and he was fired , even though he is registered as a legal medical marijuana patient in Michigan .
“ I really cared and I wanted to become something there , ” Casias told Toke of the Town .
“ I gave them everything .
Anything they asked me to do , I did .
More than they asked me to do . ”
“ I tried my best ; I gave all I could to them and they always talked about ‘ family . ’
And they threw me away after all I did , ” Joseph told us .
“ For some people , working at WalMart is just a job , but for me , it was a way of life , ” Casias said .
“ I came to WalMart for a better opportunity for my family and I worked hard and proved myself .
I just want the opportunity to continue my work . ”
“ I feel like I ’m being treated like a felon , ” he said .
According to Casias and his attorney , WalMart did not have the authority to overstep Michigan law .
The medical marijuana law allows patients with specific conditions to register with the state to grow , possess and use marijuana or designate a caregiver to help them grow the medicinal herb .
“ Medical marijuana has had a life - changing positive effect for Joseph , but WalMart made him pay a stiff and unfair price for his medicine , ” said Scott Michelman , staff attorney with the ACLU .
“ No patient should be forced to choose between adequate pain relief and gainful employment , and no employer should be allowed to intrude upon private medical choices made by employees in consultation with their doctors , ” Michelman said .
“ WalMart is a very large corporation , but it is not above the law , ” said Daniel Korobkin , staff attorney with ACLU of Michigan .
In 2008 , Michigan voters enacted the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act , which provides protection for medical use of cannabis under state law .
After the law was passed , Joseph ’s oncologist recommended he try marijuana , as permitted by state law , so Casias obtained the appropriate registry card from the Michigan Department of Community Health .
The results were immediate and profound ; his pain decreased dramatically .
The new medicine did not induce nausea like the pain medication he ’d been prescribed , and Casias was able to gain back some of the weight he ’d lost during treatment .
“ Joseph is exactly the kind of person whom Michigan voters had in mind when they passed the state ’s medical marijuana law , ” Grow said .
“ Medical marijuana is legal in this state because voters recognized its ability to alleviate the pain , nausea and other symptoms associated with debilitating medical conditions , and no corporation doing business in Michigan should be permitted to flout state law . ”
Michigan ’s medical marijuana law protects patients registered with the state from “ arrest , prosecution , or penalty in any manner ” for the use of medicinal cannabis as authorized by a doctor , and also protects employees from being disciplined for their use of medical marijuana in accordance with the law .
The law does not protect workers who use marijuana while on duty , but Casias and his attorney said he only used pot at home after work .
Casias said prescription pain medication made him nauseous , but marijuana relaxed him without uncomfortable side effects so that the had energy to work hard the next day .
“ I get up the next morning , I do n’t feel so bad , ” Casias said .
Casias had worked at the Battle Creek WalMart for five years , and he loved his job .
Due to good performance at work , he had been promoted to inventory stock manager .
Out of 400 employees , Casias was one of only two people named Associate of the Year in 2008 according to his attorneys .
Casias said he is seeking financial compensation and would like to have his job back , but he doubts that is possible now .
He said he gets unemployment benefits , but has no other income .
“ I feel it is unfair to me and my family , ” he said .
Casias , a sinus cancer survivor with an inoperable brain tumor , lost his health insurance when he was fired and is struggling to pay for his medical treatments .
“ I just wish it did n’t have to be this way , ” Casias said .

Nokia confirmed on Thursday that it plans to use the Linux - based MeeGo operating system instead of Symbian for its N - series smartphones .
The move is a sign of Symbian 's declining relevance in the high - end market as Linux continues to gain traction .
The upcoming Symbian ^3 - based N8 is said to be the last Symbian handset that Nokia will offer in the N - series .
MeeGo is an open source project that was formed when Intel and Nokia merged their respective Linux mobile operating systems to create a unified platform .
MeeGo development is a collaborative effort that is coordinated by the Linux Foundation with the involvement of other companies in the mobile Linux ecosystem .
The platform is quite modern and uses Nokia 's sophisticated Qt development framework to simplify application development .
Nokia 's dependence on the aging Symbian operating system has been a serious weakness in recent years as Android and the iPhone emerged with modern Web- centric features , rich development platforms , and stronger usability .
Nokia acquired Symbian , opened the operating system , and transitioned it to a vendor - neutral development model with its own foundation .
These steps were taken with the hope of revitalizing the platform and making it more competitive .
The Symbian Foundation has worked hard to address the platform 's limitations and has made serious progress , but not enough to make the OS a compelling choice for future high - end smartphones .
The Foundation has consequently taken steps to shift its focus to markets where it can succeed and deliver value — particularly the developing world , where there is high demand for low - cost Internet - enabled phones .
Unified development with Qt
Nokia is embracing MeeGo as the platform for its flagship N - series devices , but will continue using Symbian on its mass - market handsets .
The unifying force that will make this dual - platform strategy work is the Qt development toolkit , an open source programming framework that Nokia obtained in its acquisition of Trolltech .
Qt offers a compelling solution for cross- platform development , with support for building software that will run on Windows , Linux , Mac OS X , Symbian , and MeeGo .
The Nokia Qt SDK 1.0 , which provides a complete set of tools for building mobile Qt software , was officially released this week .
It includes mobile simulators , a full build toolchain , and an integrated development environment ( IDE ) that facilitates coding , debugging , and user interface design .
As our readers know , we have been keeping a close eye on the SDK and have tested its features in several prereleases .
A key part of the Qt mobile programming ecosystem is the Qt Mobility framework , a set of libraries that supply high - level APIs for interacting with mobile platform functionality .
Some of its features include support for handling messaging and contacts , geolocation , and accessing device sensors .
In a recent announcement on the MeeGo developer mailing list , Nokia revealed that MeeGo would be the default platform going forward for developing Qt Mobility APIs .
This further cements the growing dominance of MeeGo in Nokia 's product lineup .
Nokia is gearing up to deliver its first MeeGo - based smartphone , and possibly some tablets .
The underlying technology is profoundly impressive , but we still do n't know yet if the basic user experience will be competitive with the latest and greatest offerings from Nokia 's rivals .
We should know soon , though , because the MeeGo project plans to unveil its smartphone environment at the end of the month .
Boise State has given the Mountain West Conference a 10th program .
Boise State is leaving the Western Athletic Conference , a league the Broncos have dominated for a decade in football , the MWC confirmed with a statement Friday .
" We are pleased and excited to welcome Boise State University to the Mountain West Conference , " commissioner Craig Thompson said in the news release .
" Since our inception just 11 short years ago , the Mountain West has experienced tremendous success , and the addition of Boise State will further enhance that strength .
The MWC continues to strategize regarding potential membership scenarios and bringing Boise State into the Conference is an important part of that evolution . "
Boise State becomes the second institution to join the Mountain West in the past six years , after TCU was added in 2005 .
The conference was founded in 1998 with eight members .
The Mountain West also includes Brigham Young , Utah , Air Force , Wyoming , UNLV , San Diego State , New Mexico and Colorado State .
" It will be a privilege to compete and partner with such a successful group of member institutions , " Boise State president Robert Kustra said in a statement .
" This move is in the best interests of Boise State 's future , and the university is excited to be part of one of the nation 's most outstanding conferences . "
Thompson had said Monday the Mountain West would hold off on expansion until the dust settles in the other conferences .
WAC commissioner Karl Benson figured Boise State was bound to bolt for the Mountain West .
So much so that as the WAC board of directors and athletic directors assembled in Las Vegas for the conference 's annual meeting this week , they discussed contingency plans .
The conference did n't want to be caught off guard .
" I think everyone was anticipating and expecting it , " Benson said in a conference call Monday night .
" All the signals out there were pointing in the direction that any invitation would come today .
...
This is an unbelievably volatile period .
The poker playing that is going on I think is unprecedented .
" Regardless of what changes might occur , we are poised to move forward either with our existing membership or with any membership changes that may occur . "
Benson said there was n't any bitterness toward Boise State officials at the meeting , the relationship remaining quite cordial .
The WAC is keeping its options open , too , scouring for schools .
Benson said there are five or six candidates from the Football Championship Series the conference is keeping an eye on .
However , Benson would n't elaborate on which schools might potentially be in the mix .
" Regardless of what the Mountain West might do , or Boise State might do , the WAC is going to continue to be a credible and recognizable conference , " Benson said .
Broncos football coach Chris Petersen , who has compiled a 49 - 4 record and won three WAC titles in four years , said Monday the decision does n't change anything about his plans for next season .
" We have a very challenging nonconference and conference schedule ahead of us and we are not planning to change our goals because of today 's decision , " he said .

" The Austrians were right " is a phrase we hear often now , and for good reason .
The housing bubble and bust were called by the Austrians and , essentially , no one else .
The Austrians were right about the dot com bubble and bust .
The Austrians were right about the 1970s stagflation and the explosion in the price of gold after the gold window was closed .
You can tick through the issues and see that the Austrians have been right again and again throughout history : on price controls , on protectionism , on bailouts , on wars , on regulation , on prohibitions and civil liberties , and so on .
But issues concerning fiat money and the business cycle stand out because the Austrians possess unique insight .
Only the Austrians have consistently warned that fiat money creates the wrong incentives for the banking industry , that central - bank manipulation of interest rates distorts the structure of production , that the combination of paper money and central banking leads to economic calamity .
These insights are not new , though many people are discovering them right now for the first time .
From the moment Mises 's 1912 book , The Theory of Money and Credit , made its appearance , and warned about the grave danger to free enterprise represented by paper money and central banking , the Austrians have been right .
That 's 100 years of " we told you so . "
Right in the middle of these years , there is a forgotten episode in monetary history that teaches us lessons today .
It concerns the controversial role that Henry Hazlitt played in battling the Bretton Woods monetary system enacted after the Second World War .
Under Mises 's influence , Hazlitt used his editorial position at the New York Times to warn against the plan , predicting correctly that it would lead to world inflation .
For saying what he said , he was pushed out of his position at the Times .
He paid a high price for being right , but this did not stop him .
He kept going in his work of speaking truth to power .
The Times should offer an official apology and admit that their one - time editorialist was 100 % correct .
I 'm not expecting that anytime soon .
Let us recount the events .
At the end of World war II , the monetary condition of all nations was deplorable .
The Unites States faced a massive debt overhang from the war and yet this country was still a creditor nation to the world .
The United States also had huge stockpiles of gold .
Most everyone else was flat - out bankrupt , as only a gargantuan government program can accomplish .
The main currencies had been wrecked and the main economies along with them .
As was the fashion , world elites assembled to plan some gigantic coordinated solution .
They met from July 1 to July 22 , 1944 , at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire , and drafted the Articles of Agreement .
It was nearly a year and a half later , in December 1945 , that the agreement was ratified .
On March 1947 , one of the monstrosities created during event , the International Monetary Fund , began operations .
What was the goal of the plan ?
It was the same goal as at the founding of the Federal Reserve and the same goal that has guided every monetary plan in modern history .
The stated idea was to promote economic growth , encourage macroeconomic stability , and , most absurdly , tame inflation .
Of course , it did none of these things .
There are other analogies to the Fed .
In the same way that the Fed was to serve as a lender of last resort , a provider of liquidity in times of instability , so too the Bretton Woods Agreement obligated all member nations to make their currencies available to be loaned to other countries to prevent temporary balance of payment problems .
There was to be no talk at all about what created these balance of payment problems .
The assumption was that they were like bad weather or earthquakes or floods , just something that happens to countries from time to time .
The unspoken truth was that monetary problems and related problems with balance of payment are created by bad policies : governments inflate , spend too much , run high debts , control their economies , impose trade protections , create gigantic welfare states , fight world wars , and otherwise undermine property rights .
As with all government plans , Bretton Woods was dealing with symptoms rather than causes and treating those symptoms in a way that enables and even encourages the disease .
It pegged currencies at unrealistic levels , provided a bailout mechanism for governments and banking establishments to continue to do what they should not be doing , and thereby prolonged the problems and made them worse in the long run .
Governments have been throwing our good money after bad for a very long time .
The plan , just as with the latest round of bailouts in the United States or Europe , was to dump money on near - bankrupt countries and thereby encourage them to continue with the very policies and practices that created the problem to begin with .
The core problem of the world monetary system after World War II was essentially that the gold standard had broken down , or rather , government had destroyed what remained of the old - fashioned gold standard through relentless inflation , debt , and devaluation .
Economists in the Keynesian tradition had encouraged this , viewing money creation as some sort of panacea for all that ailed the world economy .
Keynes , the maestro of the Bretton Woods Conference , had recommended this and celebrated the results .
To him , a flexible and standardless currency was the key to macroeconomic manipulation of his beloved aggregates .
In a perverse way , he was right about this .
A government on the gold standard is seriously constrained .
It ca n't take a sledgehammer to aggregate supply and aggregate demand .
It can't spend beyond its means .
It must pay for the programs it creates through taxation , which means having to curb the appetite for welfare and warfare .
There can be no such thing as a Keynesian state on the gold standard , any more then a cocaine addict or compulsive gambler can be on a strict budget .
Keynes 's message at Bretton Woods , in Mises 's summary , was that the world elites could turn stones into bread .
And so under the influence of Keynes , the target at the Bretton Woods meeting was liberalism itself , which was widely assumed to have failed during the Great Depression .
The elites also came out of World War II with a more profound appreciation for the role of central planning .
They had reveled in it .
" There can be no such thing as a Keynesian state on the gold standard , any more then a cocaine addict or compulsive gambler can be on a strict budget . "
The Bretton Woods plan for monetary reconstruction did not go as far as Keynes would have liked .
He proposed a full - scale world central bank and a single paper currency for all nations , which he wanted to be called the " bancor , " so there could be no escaping inflation .
That plan is still awaiting implementation .
As it was , the Bretton Woods conferees , under pressure from the United States — which wanted the dollar to be the bancor — took a compromise position .
They would create not a gold standard — though it was called that for reasons of credibility — but Instead a global gold dollar standard .
Or , more precisely , a phony gold standard .
The Bretton Woods system established a gold dollar that was fixed at $ 35 per ounce .
But it was the only currency so fixed .
Every other currency could be a fiat currency based on the dollar .
What this obligated the United States to do , as the main creditor nation to the world , was ship out dollars to the world while somehow maintaining the dollar 's connection to gold .
It was a prescription for disaster , as should be obvious .
To be sure , there is nothing wrong with having a gold standard in one country .
The United States could do that now .
But that was not what Bretton Woods established .
The dollar was not convertible into gold at the domestic level .
You could not go into your bank and exchange dollars for gold .
It was only convertible on an international level , and only for governments , so that the United States was obligated to ship out gold instead of paper when it was so demanded .
This established some limit on credit expansion at home but not enough of one .
Few were courageous enough to demand gold from the empire .
Yet it is clear just from this description of the plan that the pressure to spend and redeem would eventually lead the United States to go back on its word .
It took some twenty years , long after the original crafters of the deal had left the scene , but economic logic could not be gainsayed .
The breakdown really began soon after the plan was implemented .
But most of the effects were disguised through currency controls .
Once the 1960s came , and the expenses of LBJ 's welfare - warfare state mounted , the Fed played its traditional role as the financier of big government .
Pressure on the dollar mounted , foreign governments became more interested in the gold than the paper , and the whole cockamamie scheme unraveled under Nixon 's welfare - warfare state .
When the world entered the all - paper money regime , most economists said than the price of gold would fall from $ 35 .
The Austrians predicted the opposite .
From the very beginning , Henry Hazlitt saw it all coming and warned against Bretton Woods .
He took the job of editorial writer for the New York Times in 1934 , after having been drummed out of the editorial spot at the post - Mencken American Mercury because he was Jewish .
Mencken had called Hazlitt " the only economist who can really write , " and the Times job was a good position for him , one for which he was well prepared .
He would write mostly unsigned editorials , speaking for the paper and not for himself .
" When the world entered the all - paper money regime , most economists said than the price of gold would fall from $ 35 .
The Austrians predicted the opposite . "
In fact , when many years later his editorials were collected in a book edited by George Koether , called From Bretton Woods to World Inflation , his archives were the only place that revealed his authorship .
Because he was writing them in an institutional voice , his tone was moderated to some extent , a fact he later regretted .
Even so , anyone today has to stand in amazement when reading the New York Times editorializing against loose money , paper currency , central banking , and the like .
But that was what Hazlitt accomplished .
He began his editorials in 1934 with a major call for the reinstitution of the gold standard .
He urged that the United States and Britain jointly agree to a fixed gold standard .
He said that this action would " symbolize a return to international collaboration in a world that has been drifting steadily toward a more and more intense nationalism . "
And truly , if one thinks about it , a world that had heeded Hazlitt 's advise might have avoided the incredible calamity of World War II , the tens of millions of dead , the communization of Europe , and the bankruptcy and horrors the followed .
And why ?
Because the nationalism about which he warned in 1934 would have abated , and all governments would have sought diplomatic rather than murderous solutions .
Of course , his advice was not heeded , and the drive to destroy money and prosperity continued , all the way to the globalized holocaust of World War II .
Now let us jump ahead , ten years after Hazlitt had written his first blast .
Hazlitt was still advocating the same thing , not a system in which strong currencies subsidize bad policies , but a system in which each nation maintains the integrity of its own currency .
That requires not centrally planned integration but the opposite .
Instead of promising to intervene to bail out bad debt , nations should swear not to intervene .
Only this path prevents moral hazard and maintains the gold standard .
He wrote as follows : " the belief that only a rich nation can afford a gold standard is a fallacy . "
Gold is suitable for every nation , he explained , provided it has something to sell .
He concludes with these words before the Bretton Woods conferees gathered :
The greatest single contribution the United States could make to world currency stability after the war is to announce its determination to stabilize its own currency .
It will incidentally help us , of course , if other nations as well return to the gold standard .
They will do it , however , only to the extent that they recognize that they are doing it not primarily as a favor to us but to themselves .
It is remarkable to realize that these words appeared in a New York Times editorial !
We have here a world far removed from the Keynesian drivel of Paul Krugman .
Put simply , there is no justice in this world when Hazlitt , who was correct , gets shoved out and his successors are of a school of thought that was completely wrong .
Keep in mind , too , that this was written one month before the opening of the conference .
In the weeks that followed , Hazlitt was hot on the trail for news on what was coming .
He seized on the statement of principles .
It expressly permitted a change in the gold value of member currency on a unanimous vote from government .
Hazlitt spoke with a passion as follows :
This is a provision which would permit world inflation .
Experience has shown that it is extremely unlikely that any government will wish to raise the unit gold value of its currency …
The political pressures from time immemorial , and particularly in the last three decades , have been in the direction of devaluation and inflation .
Even before the delegates met , he correctly saw that the uniformity provision was not a limit to inflation but rather a license .
If one country devalues , it sees the value of its currency fall on the international exchange .
But if this is done in cooperation with everyone else , the country can avoid the penalty .
This is precisely what accounts for the decades - old drive for international cooperation in monetary affairs .
It is the same driving force behind why the Fed was concocted .
So long as the system is decentralized , each bank or each country must deal with the fallout from its own bad policies .
But if you centralize the system , bad policies can be more easily swept under the rug , with the costs widely dispersed throughout the system .
Or as Hazlitt wrote , " it would be difficult to think of a more serious threat to world stability and full production than the continual prospect of a uniform world inflation to which the politicians of every country would be so easily tempted . "
Two days later , still before the conference opened , Hazlitt nailed it and explained precisely why Bretton Woods could not last .
Under the plan , the creditor nations — meaning the United States and Britain — would pledge themselves to buy the currency of net debtor nations in order to keep the currency value at parity .
Even if other countries devalued their currencies , the United States would be on the hook for buying it to maintain the fixed paper - to - gold ratio .
This is precisely what led to the undoing of the entire system from 1969 to 1971 .
This , my friends , is prophetic .
" It would be difficult to think of a more serious threat to world stability and full production than the continual prospect of a uniform world inflation to which the politicians of every country would be so easily tempted . "
Hazlitt was not just speaking for a sector of opinion here .
So far as he could tell , and so far as anyone has been able to discern since these days , Hazlitt was completely alone in speaking these truths .
No one else joined him , at least not in the United States .
France had Jacques Rueff , who famously denounced the entire scheme .
Switzerland had Michael Heilperin , who stood firm for the gold standard .
Hayek in London actually submitted to the Bretton Woods delegates a draft plan for a real gold standard for every nation .
It was completely ignored .
Only Hazlitt was on the front lines in the United States , by himself , writing constantly and passionately day by day to make a difference .
More remarkable still , he was able to voice these lone opinions via the institutional voice of the New York Times .
That was quite the accomplishment , a real testament to his own power to persuade .
All of his thoughts that I 've so far reported were penned before the monetary conference had even met .
He had already spotted the core problems of the proposed plan and explained how it would unravel .
On July 1 , 1944 , when the representatives first gathered , he greeted them with a punch in the nose .
He questioned their competence , employing what would later be called the Hayekian knowledge problem .
Here are his words from the editorial written the day the conference opened :
it would be impossible to imagine a more difficult time for individual nations to decide at what level they can fix and stabilize their national currency unit .
How could the representatives of France , of Holland , of Greece , of China , make any but the wildest guess at this moment of the point at which they could hope to stabilize ?
The delegates must have read that passage and spewed their morning coffee across the table .
Too bad that more of them did n't choke on their crumpets .
Hazlitt further said that the conference was planning to solve a problem by not realizing what the problem was .
The issue , he said , is not a lack of currency value parity but rather the policies that are driving down the value of the currency in weak countries .
He writes that it is of course possible to temporarily fix any price .
But in the long term , it proves impossible .
He offers the analogy of a stock share that is worthless but nonetheless sells for $ 100 each .
It is possible to maintain a high price , but when the resources of the buyer run out , the stock price will drop .
There is no force on the planet that can keep a falling price from dropping once the resources to maintain it are gone .
Of course , this insight is a short summary of nearly all economic policy of our times .
Whether the subject is houses , stocks , or wages , the goal of the stimulation packages has been to maintain high prices that cannot be maintained .
As for the resources to make the high prices stick , in our day , the answer is to create ever more phony money to engage in this make - believe program .
" There is no force on the planet that can keep a falling price from dropping once the resources to maintain it are gone . "
In the midst of the Bretton Woods proceedings , Hazlitt hit the American delegates with another punch in the nose .
He made fun of how the Americans , in particular , are under the impression that they can solve any problem in the world by setting up a machinery in the form of an organization .
It could be an organization to make water run uphill or to keep rocks from falling , but the Americans are under the belief that if the president is behind anything , anything can be accomplished .
He states the contrary truth very bluntly .
The restoration of peace and prosperity will not come from setting up another organization but rather by abandoning protectionism , capital export restrictions , important quotas , and competitive depreciation of currencies .
America 's greatest contribution , he wrote , would be to further balance its budget and halt deficit financing .
As for the American love of machinery , he writes that " genuine international economic cooperation after the war will be possible only if there is a profound change from the ideology of the Thirties . "
As the proceedings dragged on , Hazlitt turned out to have foreshadowed the newest development .
The delegates had not only planned to create the IMF but also create what was then the predecessor to the World Bank : the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development .
The whole project , wrote Hazlitt , " rests on the assumption that nothing will be done right unless a grandiose formal intergovernmental institution is set up to do it .
It assumes that nothing will be run well unless Governments run it . "
Toughening his rhetoric , Hazlitt goes after Keynes by name , drawing attention to his preposterous claim that it would be invidious to discriminate between member nations based on their credit worthiness .
Hilariously , Hazlitt sums up the plan for the World Bank with this general observation : " world economic revival will not necessarily flow from a plan under which taxpayers are saddled by their own Governments with losses from huge foreign loans made regardless of their soundness . "
After the meetings closed , the debate on ratification began .
Hazlitt made it clear what was really at stake : the freedom of the individual vs. the plans of government .
" These agreements presuppose , " he wrote , " a world in which the type of government controls developed in the Twenties and Thirties are to be expanded and systematized .
What is contemplated is a world in which international trade is State - dominated . "
Hazlitt must have felt intense pressure in these days .
There are times in politics when the state and its paid experts make everyone feel as if some proposed plan is absolutely necessary for survival , and to be against it is tantamount to treason .
In our own times , it was this way during the NAFTA debate , the WTO debate , and the debate on the creation of such bureaucratic monstrosities as the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration , or the drive for wars in the Middle East , or the hysteria for TARP et al .
To be the outlier is to elicit heaps of scorn and derision .
It was the same with Bretton Woods during 1944 and 1945 .
No one ever found a logical problem or a factual error in what Hazlitt was writing .
They did n't bother to .
The point was that this was a mega priority for the international elite and no respectable paper could really oppose the plan .
As a way of showing that he was not a lone critic , Hazlitt began to write about other critics , who were very few in number .
He seized on a small criticism offered by any journal or any association and highlighted it .
But the critics were thinning , and every time one reared its head , he was summarily slapped down .
All the while , the defenses of Bretton Woods were getting more extreme , with claims that if it did n't pass , the world would fall apart .
The supporters were more and more open about their antimarket ideology , as when Secretary Morgenthau openly said that business can't run foreign exchange .
It is up to the governments of the world to do it .
Hazlitt drew attention to these statements and also the open statements by Keynes that Bretton Woods amounted to the opposite of a gold standard .
Hazlitt wrote his most poignant rhetoric in these days , claiming that the result of the monetary plans would be world inflation and massive economic instability .
The internal pressures were increasing on him , as letters started arriving from London and DC to object to what the paper was saying .
Hazlitt clearly saw the writing on the wall but still stuck to his guns all throughout the spring of 1945 as Congress was debating and preparing ratification .
Finally , the publisher of the New York Times had had enough .
Arthur Sulzberger came to him and said , " When 43 governments sign an agreement , I do n't see how the Times can any longer combat this . "
Hazlitt began to pack his bags .
After he left , his revenge was a massive article on the subject in the American Scholar , published later that year .
Then he wrote the book that would become the biggest selling economics book of all time : Economics in One Lesson .
His goal with this book was to propagate the core principles of economics , so that anyone could do what he had done , which was see the fallacies of the logic behind crazy government schemes .
He wrote the book in record time and got it out the door as soon as possible .
Of course it was a blockbuster .
It remains to this day our bestseller book .
In 1967 , Hazliltt also had a last laugh , if it is a laughing matter to see your worst predictions come true .
Hazlitt was now a syndicated columnist with the Los Angeles Times .
He wrote about the unraveling of the system , which finally happened in 1969 .
By 1971 , the entire world was on a fiat - money paper standard and the result has been nothing short of catastrophic for societies and economies , which have been thrown into unrelenting chaos .
To be sure , Hazlitt was not , as he said , the " seventh son of the seventh son . "
He was n't born with some amazing prophetic power .
What Hazlitt did was read Mises and come to understand monetary economics .
It sounds easy until you realize just how rare these talents were in his day and in ours .
There is another aspect to what Hazlitt did .
He could have very easily relented or just stayed silent .
It took moral courage and incredible intellectual stamina to tell the truth as he did when the whole world seemed to be against him .
But so far as he was concerned , this was why he was put on the earth and why he got into writing in the first place : to tell the truth .
He was n't threatened with jail or violence .
The only thing he had to fear was the derision of his colleagues .
What truth teller in the history of the world has n't faced that ?
" Hazlitt was n't born with some amazing prophetic power .
What he did was read Mises and come to understand monetary economics .
It sounds easy until you realize just how rare these talents were in his day and in ours . "
We might ask ourselves : why is it important to revisit this history now ?
As regards the details of Bretton Woods , it is extremely important to understand that this was not a genuine gold standard .
It was a fake gold standard managed by an unworkable plan cobbled together by governments .
It is the height of absurdity that supply - siders and others have for years been pining for a return to Bretton Woods and calling it a return to the gold standard .
A new Bretton Woods would fail as surely as the first one did .
It would certainly not be a step in the right direction to reinstitute Bretton Woods .
That Bretton Woods was called a gold standard was an exercise in obfuscation .
It happened for the same reason that NAFTA was called free trade or the FTC is said to protect competition .
The state has long used the language of liberalism and the market economy as a plow to push through its opposite .
The gold standard was an early victim in this war over words .
A genuine gold standard is implemented currency by currency .
It provides for domestic , on - demand convertibility .
It allows for banks to fail on their own .
It has no central banks .
It surely has no international monetary institutions for lending bankrupt governments money .
This is the only way toward real stability .
Hazlitt said it in the New York Times and it remains true today .
If we want an impenetrable system of money and banking , we would follow Rothbard ( Hazlitt once told me that the greatest schievement of the Mises Institute was to give Murray a " suitable platform . " ) and completely privatize the system , permitting private coinage of any money .
This would be all the more viable in our own times , with digital payment systems and global communication .
In fact , I 'm quite sure that had the state not intervened , the internet would have already put together a competitive system of currency and banking that would exist completely outside the state 's purview .
A very viable means of reform we could undertake right now is for the state to simply do nothing .
The dollar might be beyond salvation at this point , but money itself is not , of course .
Money is an essential part of the market economy , so therefore let us let the market make it and manage it .
The stakes are impossible to overstate .
Fiat paper money is destroying civilization right now .
It has fueled the predator state .
It has destabilized markets .
It has wrecked balance sheets and distorted financial markets .
It has wrecked the culture by leading the whole world to believe that prosperity can come as if by magic , that stones can be turned into bread .
It might yet unleash a ravaging inflation that will be welcomed by dictators , despots , and cruel tyrants .
How important is sound money ?
The whole of civilization depends on it .
We must accept no compromise .
Down with government plans .
Down with international commissions .
Down with attempts to manipulate and control that always end in robbing us and making us poorer than we would otherwise be .
We should embrace no more and no less than what the old liberals of the 18th and 19th centuries championed .
All we ask is laissez - faire .
The sad thing about today 's new YouTube / Viacom document dump ?
That the e-mails cited in it were written by adults .
Neither side comes out looking terrific — which was also true the first time the two sides aired their dirty laundry in public .
So here you have it — a short course in becoming a media mogul :
Viacom quotes YouTube employee Maryrose Dunton telling an engineer to " ' forget about the email alerts stuff ' precisely because ' I hate making it easier for these a - holes ' - referring to copyright owners - and ' we ’re just trying to cover our asses so we do n’t get sued . ' "
Viacom complains that YouTube employees " sneered at rights holders as ' copyright bastards ' and ' a - holes . ' "
Google retorts that Viacom can't complain about this language , and it quotes numerous Viacom execs to make its point .
Sample outbursts include , " fuck you , you Google bastards , " " bastards at Google are harassing me , " and the eloquent " fuck those mother fuckers . "
A Viacom VP even complained about the " fucking assholes " at YouTube — because the company " enforced its repeat - infringer policy concerning a Viacom marketing account that had received multiple take - down notices from Viacom 's legal department . "
The lulz , they are here in spades .
Viacom top brass wrote e-mails with more exclamation points than my niece would even consider decent .
They also had what Google calls an " obsession " with buying YouTube .
Case in point : " I WANT TO OWN YOUTUBE .
I think it 's critical , and if it goes to a competitor .....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
That was from MTV Networks head Judy McGrath .
Viacom CEO
Tom Freston wrote , " If we get UTube I wanna run it . "
McGrath responded , " You 'll have to kill me to get to it first . "
Freston on his own mergers & acquisitions team : " No M&A team in recent history could have a poorer record than us .
We are a joke ... and our failed judgments and heavy handed behavior have cost us HUGELY . "
Perhaps most interesting , out of all this juvenile nonsense , was a document dug up by YouTube .
It came from a training manual targeted at user - generated content ( in which Viacom sites have their own interests ) .
The first lines read : " User generated content should never be monitored .
Something that can't bear enough repeating is that the User Abuse Team and Atom Entertainment in general , does not and should not , actively monitor any of its web sites for content violations regarding content submitted or generated by its users . "
[ Update : Viacom says that this policy was drafted by a site it acquired and that the policy was changed after the acquisition .
Viacom 's current policy is to screen uploaded content . ]
As for the main arguments here , they look like a lot more of the same , with each side trying to prove that the other 's " smoking guns " are actually irrelevant drivel .
If one thing emerges from the documents , it 's that the two sides do not like each other .
Now that the case has really gotten ugly , kissing and making nice looks decreasingly likely .

Wading through the year - end newspaper and magazine digests of politics and culture usually makes for dreary reading , and last year was no exception .
Some writers struggled to wring a drop of good news from the decade .
Others strode to the bar and leveled indictments .
Either way it was a bad patch , an impossible task .
Glossing ten years of history in snippets of 300 or 500 words , the writers performed an exercise bound to turn any observation about a low , dishonest decade into the perfect expression of it .

Seeking some solace I picked up a book , and in a matter of minutes I read the following passage :
Now that anyone is free to print whatever they wish , they often disregard that which is best and instead write , merely for the sake of entertainment , what would best be forgotten , or , better still be erased from all books .
The sense of impoverishment before an overabundance of information ; of helplessness before the need to spot relevant material in a slurry of ephemera ; of vertigo provoked by the realization that " the present " is becoming overwhelmingly , annoyingly accessible — many of us , I ’d wager , have had these reactions after reading those year - end digests or spending just a modicum of time online .
Now anyone is free to print whatever they wish .
This could be someone kvetching about blogs , Facebook , Flickr , YouTube or Twitter , and in not 500 words or 300 but nine .
Except it was n’t .
The jeremiad was the handiwork of Niccolò Perotti , a learned Italian classicist , writing to his friend Francesco Guarnerio in 1471 , less than twenty years after the invention of the printing press .
This anecdote does not suggest that past is prologue but rather underscores the importance of thinking historically , of taking a long view when trying to understand changes in deeply engrained patterns in literary culture .
I stumbled upon Perotti ’s plaint in Robert Darnton ’s essay collection The Case for Books : Past , Present , and Future ( 2009 ) .
Rejecting the commonplace notion that digital technology has ushered in a new era , " the so - called information age , " Darnton argues that every age in which a new technology has altered forms of writing and communication has been an age of information , and that in every such age " information has never been stable . "
There is continuity to the history of technological transformations , Darnton suggests : what is everpresent is the experience of rupture .
Anthony Grafton , another historian of the book , makes a similar point in " Codex in Crisis , " from his recent essay collection Worlds Made by Words ( 2009 ) : " The current drive to digitize the written record is one of a number of critical projects in the long saga of our drive to accumulate , store , and retrieve information efficiently .
It will result not in the infotopia that the prophets conjure up , but in one more in a series of new information ecologies , all of them challenging , in which readers , writers , and producers of text have learned to survive and flourish . "
The point impresses because one of its implications is that a technological innovation , whether the printing press , the telegraph , the television or a digital device , though it delivers information in a new form , is not necessarily the root cause of problems with — or controversies about — reading and writing that have arisen in its wake .
I ’d like to talk about a meltdown , one that ’s occurring not on Wall Street but Grub Street , that storied realm of writers , booksellers , bohemians and hacks .
Though the problems on Grub Street are slight compared with the hardships that have befallen millions of people thanks mostly to Wall Street , they are matters of cultural importance .
On Grub Street , for nearly a decade , and especially during the past four years , people have been wailing , rending their garments and otherwise voicing their displeasure over the deterioration of books coverage in the United States .
( The meltdown on Grub Street coincided with the release of the Kindle in 2007 , but the gales of anxiety and gusts of delirium stirred up in book publishing by digital readers are a different story . )
The laments have focused mostly on newspaper books coverage because , rightfully or not , it has long been regarded as an accurate barometer of the delicate climate of literary life .
Who has n’t heard someone in a bookstore or a friend ask , " Have you read that novel the Times Book Review raved about " ?
That a steep erosion in newspaper books coverage has occurred is undeniable .
Newspapers that have killed or drastically reduced coverage during the past few years include the Los Angeles Times , the Washington Post , the Chicago Tribune , Newsday , the Minneapolis Star Tribune , the Boston Globe , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution and the Cleveland Plain Dealer , to name just a few .
But this decline , though severe , has not been sudden , nor limited to newspapers .
With the exception of The Nation , The New Yorker , The New Republic , The Times Literary Supplement , The Atlantic and Harper ’s Magazine , weeklies and monthlies began rolling back books coverage in the 1990s .
As for newspapers , there ’s no better example of the long contraction than The New York Times Book Review .
When the critic and novelist John Leonard edited the Book Review in the early 1970s , an era generally regarded as its golden age , on some Sundays he could count on having a canvas of at least eighty pages .
In 1985 the Book Review averaged forty - four pages ; two decades later , it was averaging thirty - two to thirty - six , and in recent months its average size has vacillated between twenty - four and twenty - eight pages .
The Book Review is still the country ’s most visible newspaper books section , but there is not much to read in it .
Some questions , then , to serve as boundary stones for the ramble ahead :
Is it true , as many people who have commented on the matter have claimed , that the recent decline in newspaper books coverage is a problem for the culture at large , and also representative of larger cultural problems ?
Are review sections disappearing or shrinking because they can’t turn a profit ?
Or is it because they can’t compete with material originating on the web ?
Why are weekly and monthly magazines , despite producing a bounty of thoughtful essays and reviews about books , generally left out of the conversation about books coverage ?
And finally , as for quality books coverage — by which I mean not reviewery but scrutiny , the deliberate , measured analysis of literary and intellectual questions without obvious or easy answers — can such coverage originate online and also find a loyal audience there ?
The newspapers that many of us , or many of our parents , grew up reading were a product of the sweet spot of the twentieth century — the postwar boom .
By midcentury , the occupation of newsgathering had been thoroughly professionalized , and during the following three decades abundant ad revenue enabled newspapers to expand their newsrooms and to increase the quality and quantity of news coverage .
Between 1964 and 1999 , the volume of news published by some metropolitan papers doubled .
The dimensions of the news changed too .
As Leonard Downie and Michael Schudson explained last year in the Columbia Journalism Review , during the boom years newspapers began to gravitate away from a longstanding preoccupation with government and with pegging coverage to specific political events ; papers still worked those beats , but they also began to cultivate " a much broader understanding of public life that included not just events , but also patterns and trends , and not just in politics , but also in science , medicine , business , sports , education , religion , culture , and entertainment . "
In some cases newspaper editors were reacting to the lessons of the civil rights and women ’s movements : politics is n’t the exclusive domain of white men ; the personal is political .
In other cases editors were reacting to changes in the media market .
They had to slow or reverse the loss of readers turning to broadcast or cable television for news , or to magazines that offered depth instead of breadth ; they also had to renew their appeal to readers whose news diet had changed since leaving the city for the suburbs .
And so newspapers endeavored to broaden their readership by adding or expanding coverage of business , sports , health , real estate , food and film .
And books .
The Los Angeles Times Book Review was launched as a twelve - page Sunday tabloid section in 1975 .
The Washington Post Book World debuted as a Sunday tabloid section in the 1960s ; it was folded into the paper in the mid-1970s , only to be resurrected as a stand - alone publication in the early 1980s .
( Neither exists today . )
The New York Times Book Review is not a boomer but a centenarian .
It has been a section of the paper since Adolph Ochs bought the Times in 1896 .
Nevertheless , the rest of the Times is a boomer .
In the early 1970s managing editor Abe Rosenthal redesigned the paper to expand arts , science and business coverage and to introduce ad - friendly service sections .
Although newspapers , in print or online , remain the country ’s primary source of news , their economic base has been undermined by the Internet .
Obviously , the digital realm ’s pernicious culture of free content as well as low barriers to entry for businesses and low - cost advertising have broken the grip of newspapers on audiences and advertisers .
Newspapers began losing national and retail advertising with the advent of broadcast television ; as a response they doubled down on classified ads .
During the past decade they lost much of the classified market to websites like Craigslist .
Instead of charging for news online , newspapers pillaged themselves and offered news for free as a way to attract readers and advertisers .
There was an uptick in ad revenue in the early to mid-2000s , but it leveled off with the recession ; and even at its peak the tiny sums from online ads fell short of recouping the lost revenue from print advertising .
With their balance sheets in turmoil , newspapers began to scale back news coverage and reduce the size of the newsroom .
The postwar newspaper has n’t gone the way of the carrier pigeon .
A few large metro and national dailies still devote considerable resources to investigative features and accountability reporting .
They still cultivate a news judgment focused on a public agenda and oriented toward the general reader .
Such journalism is essential — and expensive .
Paying for it means deciding not to pay for something else , and at many papers that something else is books coverage .
It ’s necessary to explain these broad economic trends to understand a crucial and overlooked point — namely , that it is disingenuous for newspaper executives to justify the elimination or reduction of the book beat by claiming that books sections do n’t turn a profit .
Undeniably , the executives ’ math is correct .
A newspaper books section , if one were to total up its costs , loses money .
But does not the sports section or the metro section ?
Yet of all the sections that fail to turn a profit on their own , it ’s the books section that is most often killed or pinched .
Claims that books sections are eliminated or downsized because they can’t earn their keep are bogus .
It is indisputable that newspapers have been weakened by hard times and a major technological shift in the dissemination of news ; it is not indisputable that newspaper books coverage has suffered for the same reasons .
The book beat has been gutted primarily by cultural forces , not economic ones , and the most implacable of those forces lies within rather than outside the newsroom .
It is not iPads or the Internet but the anti-intellectual ethos of newspapers themselves .
" Anti-intellectual " is a hefty allegation , but bear with me as I substantiate it with a few stories from the newsroom and observations about the response of newspaper books sections to some important publishing trends of the past several decades .
First , a definition .
In a news context , " anti-intellectual " does not necessarily mean an antipathy to ideas , though it can be that too .
I use the word " anti-intellectual " to describe a suspicion of ideas not gleaned from reporting and a lack of interest in ideas that are not utterly topical .
In 1999 Steve Wasserman was three years into his tenure as the editor of The Los Angeles Times Book Review , and that July he published a review of Richard Howard ’s new translation of Stendhal ’s The Charterhouse of Parma .
The reason was simple : Howard is among the best translators of French literature .
As Wasserman explained several years ago in a memoir of his days at the Los Angeles Times published in the Columbia Journalism Review , the review of the book , written by Edmund White , was stylish and laudatory .
The Monday after the piece ran , the paper ’s editor summoned Wasserman to his office and admonished him for running an article about " another dead , white , European male . "
But the paper ’s readers in Los Angeles thought otherwise .
Soon after the review appeared , local sales of the book took off ; national sales did too when other publications reviewed the book .
The New Yorker ended up printing a " Talk of the Town " item that traced the book ’s unexpected success to The Los Angeles Times Book Review .
In his memoir , Wasserman relates a similar story about Carlin Romano , then the books critic at the Philadelphia Inquirer , who was scolded by an editor for running as the cover story of his section a review of a new translation of Tirant Lo Blanc , a Catalan epic beloved by Cervantes .
" Have you gone crazy ? " the editor asked .
" Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of America ’s newspapers in the 1990s , " Romano reflected , " is their hostility to reading in all forms . "
The taboo still exists , and it is sometimes enforced not by other editors but by newspaper books sections themselves .
In August 2008 The New York Times Book Review published a piece by Walter Kirn about James Wood ’s How Fiction Works .
Wood is one of our liveliest critics of fiction , and How Fiction Works is his attempt to write something like E.M. Forster ’s Aspects of the Novel .
Kirn ’s review drips with contempt for Wood ’s knowledge of his subject .
Irked by Wood ’s readings of great novels by great novelists like Joyce , Proust and Balzac , Kirn attacked Wood for his alleged " genteel condescension , " " his donnish , finicky persona , " his preference for novels that offer " precision and clarity over mere vigor and potency " and for wearing his knowledge on his sleeve .
Kirn belittled
Wood ’s learning , which is to say , his reading ; he sounded like a restaurant critic chastising a chef for spending too much time in the kitchen .
But there ’s another twist .
Kirn ’s piece was the cover story of that week ’s Book Review .
An attack on reading was the lead review in the nation ’s one remaining Sunday books supplement .
Kirn wrote the piece , but he did n’t put it on the cover .
The editors of the Book Review did that , and their decision was a reminder that in its current incarnation the publication resembles the version of the Book Review criticized by Elizabeth Hardwick in Harper ’s in 1959 : " a sort of hidden dissuader , gently , blandly , respectfully denying whatever vivacious interest there might be in books or in literary matters generally . "
Wasserman ’s and Romano ’s clashes with their editors point to another symptom of the anti-intellectualism of many newspaper book reviews : their lack of curiosity about works in translation .
Translations are occasionally reviewed by newspapers , but generally only if the author of the title under review is a Nobel laureate or a well - known personality in her native country , or when the translation rights to a book were purchased during a bidding war .
Being an author from an impoverished , war - torn country or with a melodramatic life story helps too .
The latter is one of the reasons the work of Chilean author Roberto Bolaño has been widely reviewed in the United States whereas that of many of his peers in Latin America has not .
There is a translation renaissance occurring in the United States , in both fiction and poetry , of likes unseen since the 1960s and ’ 70s , when American poets translated the work of a great number of European Modernists and Latin American Surrealists .
Today ’s renaissance has been sparked and sustained not only by stalwarts like New Directions , Grove , Dalkey Archive , Metropolitan and Farrar , Straus and Giroux , as well as university presses like Nebraska , Northwestern , Yale and California , among others , but also by a number of small presses launched during the past decade , most notably Archipelago , Ugly Duckling , Melville House and Open Letter .
This bears emphasizing because great ages of literature have often been periods of intense translation ; as Eliot Weinberger has said , " With no news from abroad , a culture ends up repeating the same things to itself .
It needs the foreign not to imitate , but to transform . "
But today ’s translation revolution has n’t been televised ; it has barely been reported , at least by newspaper books sections .
In his memoir Wasserman explains that enthusiasts of The Los Angeles Times Book Review were always in the minority of the paper ’s overall readership .
Over the course of four Sundays in 2004 , of the newspaper ’s 6.4 million readers , some 1.2 million had read the Book Review .
That ’s 19 percent of the paper ’s readership , and it made the Book Review the least - read section of the Sunday paper .
However , among the paper ’s well - educated and best - read demographic , the section was a must - read .
That readership was small , about 320,000 , or 27 percent of the total readership of the Book Review , but it was avid and loyal , and delighted to learn about a new translation of The Charterhouse of Parma .
And so , like John Leonard at The New York Times Book Review in the early 1970s , Wasserman brazenly edited against industry prejudices when he ran The Los Angeles Times Book Review from 1996 to 2005 .
His experience there taught him two lessons .
First , that a mass readership will elude any newspaper section in the United States dedicated to the review of books .
Second , the lack of mass appeal makes even a vibrant newspaper book review hard to sell to book advertisers because the cost of a single full - page ad in a large newspaper exceeds the promotional budgets for most books .
The near - extinction of newspaper books coverage , and the mediocre quality of what little coverage remains , is indeed a cultural problem , but one that stems more from cultural prejudices and structural problems within newspapers than from any within the culture at large .
Indeed , the demographics of Wasserman ’s readership at the Los Angeles Times are proof that there is a keen appetite for books coverage that offers depth , not breadth ; that is selective , not a full - service consumer guide ; that is indispensable , not ephemeral ; that is of general interest but not mass - market ; and that is committed to cultivating an informed , critical community of readers .
There is a demand , in other words , for exactly the kind of books coverage offered by magazines .
Nearly five decades ago , a savvy group of writers and editors , among them Robert Silvers , Elizabeth Hardwick and Edmund Wilson , saw the newspaper crisis of their day as an opportunity to capitalize on readership demand .
In December 1962 a prolonged printers ’ strike in New York City removed The New York Times Book Review from circulation .
Weary of the tepid fare served by newspaper books sections , Silvers and company took advantage of the Book Review ‘s absence to launch The New York Review of Books in February 1963 .
Similarly , in 1979 a prolonged lockout at the Times of London kept the Times Literary Supplement out of circulation , its absence creating an opportunity for the launch of the London Review of Books , first as an insert to the NYRB and six months later as a stand - alone publication .
The New York Review of Books perseveres as a biweekly magazine of politics and ideas , and last year the LRB , also a biweekly , celebrated its thirtieth anniversary .
We are in the throes of another newspaper crisis , yet nothing comparable to the NYRB or the LRB has emerged , in print or online , even though there is , I believe , a genuine hunger for serious books coverage .
There is also a deep sense of inertia .
For example , in early 2007 , as each week or month brought more bad news about a newspaper books section being downsized or killed , the National Book Critics Circle , the professional association for book reviewers , announced a Campaign to Save Book Reviewing .
Panels were convened in New York City , Washington and other cities .
The lasting result of all this group therapy has been the launch of a dismal blog called Critical Mass , which is used primarily to promote the work of NBCC members published in other venues .
It ’s as if the NBCC had noticed a hole in a dike , and instead of trying to repair it or leading the charge to high ground , it offered swimming lessons at a deep discount .
A century ago , newspapers were the new media of the era , and they upended the presentation of words as much as the web has in our own time .
Newspapers appeared in multiple editions , tracking the developments of a story throughout the day .
Multiple headlines on the front page competed for a reader ’s attention ; images jostled against text , and ads against articles .
Magazines like The Atlantic , Harper ’s and , by the 1920s , The New Yorker , were not as protean as newspapers , but they also mixed commerce with culture , and their substantial advertising revenues and weekly or monthly frequency provided their editors and art directors with creative liberty and time enough to devise combinations of word and image more artful than the layouts of any newspaper .
As Grafton writes in " Codex in Crisis , " the " newspapers and magazines of the early years of the century did not have the near - total flexibility of the modern Web site , and their readers could not skip from one hot link to the next [ but ] their juxtapositions of serious and trivial contents , and their ability to confront readers with the shock of the new were as widely noticed — and sometimes as forcefully deplored — by contemporaries as similar features on the Web . "
In some ways , Grafton points out , " the world of writing has not so much been transformed " by the web as restored to a ghostly , hyperactive version of the newspaper world of the early twentieth century .
Despite the great newspaper die - off , the newspaper sensibility is experiencing a second life online .
Scandals , economic meltdowns , political gaffes , policy debates , data in the form of polls or government agency releases , campaigns and elections — such are the beats and resources of news sites like Talking Points Memo , which combines narrative journalism and aggregation with reporting , some of it investigative , and relies on the involvement of a loyal audience with a lot of enthusiasm and expertise .
In the world of politics , newsworthy stuff happens every hour of every day ; there ’s a lot to cover , and the web allows someone like Josh Marshall , the editor of Talking Points Memo , to publish what is essentially a rolling edition of a small daily newspaper devoted to politics .
By contrast , writing about books and ideas that favors deliberate and measured analysis of questions without obvious or easy answers is an approach best suited to magazines , which is one reason nothing like the NYRB or the LRB has originated on the web .
In her 1959 Harper ’s essay about book reviewing , Elizabeth Hardwick called for books sections to welcome " the unusual , the difficult , the lengthy , the intransigent , and above all , the interesting . "
That is a wonderful , immodest proposal , one I never let out of my mind .
It does not describe the books coverage available at Tina Brown ’s Daily Beast or many books blogs , where when people are n’t posting capsule reviews they are writing about book deals , price wars over e-books between Amazon and publishers or the latest industry gossip .
Journalists have long been enthralled by the buzz and glamour of book publishing , but as a subject it is a poor substitute for quality books coverage .
One exception is the Barnes & Noble Review , a web - only venture that generally avoids gossip and trade talk .
It is better edited than any newspaper books section , but it also happens to be owned by the country ’s largest corporate chain bookstore .
Neither the quality of its reviews nor the generosity of its writers ’ fees can expunge from its pages its innate commercialism .
There is reason to worry about the future of literary journalism , and magazine journalism in general .
One reason is the economics of electronic publishing , that delirious world of commerce into which many print magazines have channeled time , money and expectations for the past decade .
Speed is king in the digital realm , the theory being that maximizing traffic by posting a daily flurry of stories is the best way to attract readers and , in turn , advertisers .
But according to " Magazines and Their Web Sites , " a survey undertaken by the Columbia Journalism Review of 665 consumer magazines with websites , speed can warp journalistic standards .
" Most magazines have less rigorous copy - editing and fact - checking online than in their print editions , " explain Victor Navasky and Evan Lerner , the report ’s editors .
The mindset of these publications is that " if the number of ‘ eyeballs ’ trumps the quality of copy presentation , and produces minor factual errors , so be it . "
On the web , the value of speed is commercial more than journalistic .
Quantity beats quality ; being first beats being the best .
Speed is confused with timeliness , and the value of timeliness is debased by the obsession with mere speed .
But speed , it turns out , is commercially overrated .
According to the CJR study , the financial dividends of speed have been lackluster : 68 percent of the magazines surveyed reported that advertising is the primary source of revenue for their website , yet only a third of those websites earn a profit .
Well into the second decade of magazines ’ online existence , websites have expanded the readership of magazines without , in the large majority of cases , improving their balance sheets , and the added visibility has been purchased on the cheap with inferior journalism .
The CJR survey raises a fundamental question about magazine websites : does a failing business model centered on advertising suggest that there is no viable business model ?
Aggravating matters is the culture of free .
Readers are accustomed to viewing content gratis on the web , but free is not a good price for publishers , editors or writers .
Of course , newspapers and magazines are partly to blame for having taught the public to expect free material online .
Equally culpable are editors who justify not paying online contributors on the grounds that their articles provide them with invaluable exposure .
( Try paying rent with exposure . )
As James Rainey remarked several months ago in the Los Angeles Times , " the technology providing the world entree to an unimaginable trove of art , images and information is also obliterating the boundaries that once allowed the creative class to make a living . "
On the web , we are all interns now .
A second reason for worry is changes in reading habits .
Grafton explains in " Codex in Crisis " that " the newspapers and magazines of the years around 1900 coexisted with more stable forms of writing — above all the serious book — and presupposed the superiority of engaged , informed study of texts even when they did not promote it .
By contrast , the hot link and the search engine seem to symbolize a particular postmodern way of approaching texts : rapid , superficial , appropriative , and individualistic . "
On the web , the prevailing practice among readers , especially young ones , is dipping , cross-checking and power skimming .
" Most students begin their searches for information at Google , rather than a library Web page that lists more refined search engines , " Grafton explains .
" Those who consult e-book sites stay on them for an average of four minutes . "
I confess to asking more than four minutes of readers .
Quality books coverage is based in the sensibility of print — what the book editor Elisabeth Sifton calls " its relative slowness , " and its scope , complexity and authority .
For me that involves editing a magazine section about books that is like a library : a disciplined but welcoming locale , its columns stocked with resources that allow for deliberation and raucous debate and sustain a diverse public of serious , passionate readers .
It aims to be up - to - date without necessarily being topical , and unscarred by the arcane discourses of academic theory or the patronizing platitudes of punditry .
It aims to ask important questions rather than propose easy answers ; to abjure posturing and mere position - taking in favor of analyzing the twisted arcs of suffering and liberation that span modern history and politics ; to treat the realm of imagination no less seriously than the realm of fact , never forgetting that imagination is not free from fact even though it may resist its pressures .
It aims to be a meeting place for writers aspiring and established , each an inspiration for the other .
Despite the turmoil and doubts , I think there ’s no better time than the present to be covering books .
The herd instinct is nearly extinct : newspapers inadvertently killed it when they scaled back on books coverage en masse ; and the web , for all its crowds and their supposed wisdom , is a zone of unfederated cantons .
The field is wide open .
If you ca n’t take chances now , if in such a climate you ca n’t risk seeking an air legitimate and rare , when can you ?
The immigration issue has been brewing in Arizona for many years .
Over the past 10 years , the public has expressed growing frustration with a lack of action from the federal government , concern over reports of violence committed by illegal immigrants in Arizona , and support for efforts that attempt to solve the problem .
The new law goes into effect July 29 .
It makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally and requires law enforcement to question an individual 's legal status if an officer has reasonable suspicion the person may be in the country illegally .
Here is a look at how the state got to be where it is today .
Photos by The Arizona Republic and the Associated Press .
Loading list ...
Driver 's licenses 1996 : The Legislature passes a law requiring proof of citizenship to get a driver 's license .
Writing the law was Russell Pearce , then the director of the state Motor Vehicle Division .
Chandler roundup 1997 : Chandler police and federal agents spend five days rounding up suspected illegal immigrants in downtown neighborhoods .
They make 340 arrests , taking some legal residents into custody .
City officials later pay $ 500,000 in legal settlements and spend years apologizing .
Bill for ID at polls 1998 : Rep. Tom Smith , R - Phoenix , proposes a bill to require ID be shown at the polls .
It fails in the Senate .
Another bill requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote does n't get out of committee .
Ranchers ask for help 1999 : Arizona ranchers ask lawmakers to call on the National Guard to come to the border to suppress an " invasion . "
Ranchers such as Roger Barnett ( in a 1999 photo ) were armed and protecting their property .
But the effort goes nowhere , beyond some lawmakers reading a proclamation about border violations .
Prop 203 2000 : Despite protests , voters endorse a requirement for English immersion in schools , banning bilingual education .
It passes 63 percent to 37 percent .
Pearce in office 2001 : Pearce begins first term as state representative .
During his first year as a lawmaker , Pearce proposed two illegal - immigration - enforcement bills .
Both failed .
Over the next few years , Pearce 's political clout grew , as did his legislative effort to combat illegal immigration .
Sean Pearce shot 2004 : Pearce 's son Sean , a Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office deputy , is shot and wounded by an illegal immigrant .
Russell Pearce in 2005 told The Republic that the shooting did not make him anti-Latino or anti-Mexican .
" Those were bad guys , " he said .
If anything , it made him more passionate about locking up criminals and gang members , no matter the race .
Prop 200 2004 : Voters approve Proposition 200 , which denies public benefits to people not in the country legally .
Passes 56 percent to 44 percent .
Also in 2004 , moderate Republicans lose in GOP primaries , giving Legislature a more conservative tilt .
The number of immigration measures proposed by the Legislature began to escalate in 2006 and 2007 , and more of them made it through the GOP - dominated Legislature and onto the governor 's desk .
Immigration bill vetoed 2006 : Pearce introduces a bill to make it a state crime to be in the country illegally and to allow peace officers to question an individual 's immigration status .
It also includes measures to restrict employers from hiring illegal immigrants .
Gov. Janet Napolitano ( in a 2006 photo ) vetoes the bill .
Massive march 2006 : More than 100,000 march to the state Capitol to support comprehensive immigration reform on the national level .
Similar large rallies are held in cities across the U.S. Also in 2006 , voters endorse a trio of ballot measures related to illegal immigration , including requiring out - of - state college tuition from Arizona residents who can't prove citizenship and denying bail to illegal immigrants charged with a crime .
They also approve a measure that makes English the state 's official language .
All four ballot measures pass with 70 percent - plus of vote .
Officer killed 2007 : Phoenix Officer Nick Erfle is shot and killed by a fugitive who is an illegal immigrant .
In May 2010 , Erfle 's widow , Julie , spoke out against the bill , saying it would not have prevented her husband 's death .
Arpaio begins sweeps 2008 : Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio begins conducting immigration sweeps .
Since the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in October 2009 stripped Arpaio of an agreement that authorized deputies to perform street - level immigration screenings , the crime - suppression operations have relied on a pair of state laws that target illegal immigrants .
Businesses have also been targeted , using Arizona 's employer - sanctions law to conduct worksite raids and arrest employees suspected of committing fraud and identity theft .
Officer dies in DUI crash 2008 : Phoenix Officer Shane Figueroa dies in a collision with a drunken driver in the country illegally .
Like other crimes caused by illegals , it stirred anger .
Members of an anti-illegal immigrant group protested outside Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon 's home after learning the culprit was an illegal immigrant .
The members of United for a Sovereign America branded Phoenix a " sanctuary city " despite steps taken by the city earlier this year to ensure more people stopped by police were questioned about their immigration status .
Brewer becomes governor 2009 : Republican Jan Brewer ascends to the Governor 's Office when Napolitano resigns to join the Obama administration as Homeland Security secretary .
Birth of SB 1070 January 2010 : Pearce introduces Senate Bill 1070 .
In February , SB 1070 passes Senate , 17 - 13 .
Racher 's slaying March :
The murder of southern Arizona rancher Robert Krentz fueled a nationwide political furor over border violence , security and illegal immigration .
His death also became a crucial factor in the debate over and passage of Senate Bill 1070 .
Bill becomes law April : After Senate gave final approval to an amended SB 1070 , the bill went to Gov. Brewer , who signed it into law .
Later that month , three separate lawsuits challenging law 's constitutionality are filed in federal court .
Other lawsuits would be filed later .
Protests May : Protests in that state and across the U.S. take shape .
Al Sharpton is shown at May 5 march in Phoenix wearing a Los Suns jersey .
The Suns ' decision to wear the jerseys during a game that night caused a controversy of its own .
The outcry over Arizona 's law has revived talks of national immigration - reform efforts , though the federal government has yet to take action .
Brewer goes to DC June : Brewer has a meeting with Obama to discuss immigration and border - security issues .
Feds challenge law July 6 : U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder defends a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Arizona .
The suit lays out why the government believes that immigration laws passed by Congress and enforced by a range of federal agencies must take precedence to any passed by a state Legislature .
BRITAIN'S highly successful satellite - television operator , BSkyB , is habitually talked of as if it were an integral part of Rupert Murdoch 's media empire .
In fact , although News Corp effectively controls the firm , it owns only 39 % of it .
Now Mr Murdoch , along with Chase Carey , News Corp 's chief operating officer , wants to get his hands on the rest , making an informal offer of £ 7.8 billion ( $ 11.5 billion ) to buy out the remaining 61 % .
Assuming he can get the necessary clearances from British and European Union regulators , Mr Murdoch 's main challenge will be to agree on a price with BSkyB 's independent directors .
His offer is worth 700 p a share ; their response so far has been : nice try Rupert , but come back with something above 800 p and then we 'll see .
It 's not hard to see why the media mogul wants Sky ( as it is known to viewers ) all to himself .
It has had a terrific recession , not only adding many more subscribers but extracting more money from each user .
It is closing in on 10 m subscribers , and its revenues in the nine months to the end of March grew by an impressive 10 % , to £ 4.4 billion .
It has done extremely well out of high - definition TV and PVRs ( Sky+ boxes ) and hopes to repeat the trick with 3 - D broadcasting , in which it is a world pioneer — its 3 - D screens are now popping up in pubs across the land .
Rights to broadcast football and other sports remain the foundation of the company but it has moved well beyond sport into broadband delivery and telephony .
It probably makes sense for News Corp to bring
Sky fully into the company if it can get it at a decent price .
News Corp could do with some more geographic diversity ( it has Star India , Sky Italia , etc , but they are n't worth nearly as much as BSkyB ) .
Although Sky has shown itself to be recession - resistant , Fox 's American television business is not , and neither are News Corp 's newspapers .
The purchase , if it goes through , is part of a trend towards media companies looking more like , well , media companies .
Forget the splashy purchases of supposedly synergistic online businesses like AOL and MySpace ( the big media firms would certainly like to forget them ) .
These days they are all doubling down on media , especially content , and shearing off everything else .
Hence Disney 's acquisition of Marvel , TimeWarner 's divorce from AOL , Comcast 's in - process merger with NBC Universal , and now this .

How do I witness to my peers when they seem to have knowledgeable answers against all of my beliefs ?
Answer
“ God is all - loving .
He would never send me to Hell . ”
“ Friend , God is not all loving .
The Bible does n’t say he is ‘ all loving . ’
It says that God is love .
He ’s not a slave to love .
The Bible says that He ’s also just , holy and righteous .
When people say that God is all - loving , they are implying that God is so loving that He would n’t send people to Hell .
Let me ask you a question .
If a man sexually abused children , tortured them , cut their throats and said that he would do it again if he had half a chance , should a judge punish him ?
Of course he should .
If the judge is a loving man , would n’t he still punish that wicked person ?
Of course , and God will punish all wicked men , even though He is ‘ love ’ . ”

You have made a god to suit yourself .
Your god would never send anyone to Hell , because he could n’t .
He does n’t exist .
He ’s a figment of your imagination .
You have made a god you feel comfortable with .
I did the same for many years before I became a Christian .
You believe that because the god you have conceived in your mind has a low standard of morality .
Did you know that the God of the Bible — the God you have to face on the Day of Judgment — commands you to be perfect ?
He is perfect , and He will judge you with a perfect Law that demands perfection . ”

Mark Spence : “ I ’m often asked why God would send people to a place of torment .
Since God is loving , why would He send people to Hell ?
Why should we think God has a less sense of justice than mankind ?
God is loving , but that ’s not all He is ;
He ’s also a good judge .
Should a loving human judge allow criminals to go free ?
Of course not .
If we , with our finite justice system , think it ’s necessary to punish criminals in civil court , how much more should an infinite God judge our crimes , our sins against Him ?
The Bible tells us God alone is holy .
He is the standard of all that is right and good .
His nature is pure .
Think of it like this :
If I were to light a match and place the flame next to a dried - out leaf , what would happen ?
The fire would consume the leaf .
Why ?
Because they ’re different , their natures are opposed one to the other .
In the same way , God and man have opposing natures .
On the Day of Judgment , sinful man will not be able to stand in the presence of a holy God because of their opposing natures .
God is not unloving ;
He is holy .
He is described as a “ consuming fire who dwells in unapproachable light . ”
In our sinful state , we do n’t stand a chance .
Our only hope is to somehow take on the same nature as God .
We must be born again .
When we turn from our sins and place our faith in the resurrected Christ , God imputes
His righteousness to us .
It ’s imperative that we are given this new nature since each of us are headed toward our own personal Judgment Day .
The Bible says in Psalm 96:13 , “ He is coming to judge the Earth .
He shall judge the world with righteousness . ”
So the next time someone tells you a loving God would never send anyone to Hell , simply explain the difference between God and man ’s opposing natures .
The problem is n’t with God ; the problem is our sin . ”
How can a God of love send anybody to Hell ?

“ Do n’t judge me !
The Bible even says ‘ Judge not lest ye be judged ’ . ”
The world often takes this verse ( out of its context ) and uses it to accuse Christians of being “ judgmental ” when they speak of sin .
In the context of the verse Jesus is telling His disciples not to judge one another , something the Bible condemns ( see John 21:21 - 23 , Romans 14:10 , and James 4:11 ) .
He speaks of seeing a speck in a brother ’s eye .
In John 7:24 He said , “ Do not judge according to appearance , but judge with righteous judgment . ”
If a man steals , lies , commits adultery or murder , etc. , the Christian can make a ( righteous ) moral judgment and say that the actions were morally wrong , and that these sins will have eternal consequences .
Chuck Colson said : “ True tolerance is not a total lack of judgment .
It ’s knowing what should be tolerated — and refusing to tolerate that which should n’t . ”

“ God made me like this .
Sin is His fault ! ”
If this argument wo n’t work in a civil court , it certainly wo n’t work on Judgment Day .
Even with today ’s crafty defense lawyers , it would take a rather moronic judge to fall for the old “ God made me do it ” defense .
We are responsible moral agents .
The “ buck ” stopped at Adam .
He tried to blame both God and Eve for his sin , and it did n’t work .

“ Religion has caused more wars than anything else in history . ”
It is true that sinful people have used religion for political gain .
Hitler had “ God with us ” engraved on the belts of Nazi soldiers .
America said , “ Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition . ”
The law may even allow you to start the Christian Nazi Party , if you so desire .
You can become a “ reverend ” for a few dollars through the tabloid classifieds and then further your political agenda with the world ’s blessing , no matter how much it smears the name of Christ .
If Jesus told His followers to love their enemies , and someone puts a knife into someone ’s back in the name of Christianity , it does n’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that something is n’t quite right .
If we human beings can detect it , how much more will God ?
He will deal with it on Judgment Day .
“ Does Christianity Cause Wars ? ”
length : 2 minutes
Show video text »
Mark Spence : “ Some skeptics say Christianity has caused more wars than anything else in history .
They paint a picture of Christians as the most murderous group of people , and somehow this objection is supposed to discredit the claims of Christ and debunk the Bible in one single jab .
Now I certainly agree that man has used ‘ religion ’ for political gain .
But then again , sinful man has used everything under the sun for political gain .
Just because a politician or a military leader uses the name of God to further his agenda , does not mean God approves .
In John 16 , Jesus tells us that there will be some who will murder in the name of God .
He says , “ The hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God . ”
John 16 goes on to say , “ They will do these things because they have not known the Father , nor Me . ”
These are not true Christians .
The Bible explains that hypocrites and deceivers will always be in and around the Christian church until God punishes them on the Day of Judgment .
Jesus told
His followers to love their enemies .
So if a man puts a knife into someone ’s back in the name of Christianity , something obviously is n’t right .
Let ’s not forget that the Bible tells us all murderers , including those who have had murderous thoughts in their hearts , will not make it to Heaven .
Following the teachings of the Bible will not lead you to start a war .
In fact , it ’s the Bible that teaches us to be at peace with all men . ”
“ How can you say that Jesus it the only way to God ?
How arrogant ! ”
“ If I told you that there were other ways I would be lying to you .
While you may think I am full of hatred or have no respect for other religions , we must look at what the Bible teaches .
The Bible says , ‘ Neither is there salvation in any other .
There is no other name under Heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved . ’
Even if those of other faiths are sincere , what would happen if I sincerely believed that I was on a plane flying to Hawaii , but in truth I was heading for Afghanistan ?
You are forgetting that someone can be sincerely wrong .
The only way to God is through Jesus Christ .
There is one mediator between man of God , the Man Christ Jesus .
Here ’s the Big difference between Christianity and other religions .
Jesus said , ‘ The Son of Man has power on Earth to forgive sins . ’
No religion can forgive sin— only Jesus … because of the Cross .
The Bible also says ‘ Nor is there salvation in any other , for there is no other name under Heaven given among men by which we must be saved ’ ( Acts 4:12 ) , ‘ For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men , the Man Christ Jesus ’ ( 1 Timothy 2:5 ) .
Do I believe they will go to Hell because of being a different religion ?
Only if they have broken the Commandments .
If they are perfect in thought , word and deed on the Day of Judgment , they will be fine .
If they have lied , stolen , lusted , fornicated , etc. they will be in big trouble — no matter how religious they are .
The Bible says , ‘ Whoever transgresses , and abides not in the doctrine of Christ , has not God . ’
You preach tolerance of other religions , but do you practice that as well ?
Are you tolerant about Christianity ?
Are you tolerant of the claims of Christianity — that Jesus is the only way to God ? ”

I do not believe in an afterlife and would never consider a religion so restrictive and exclusive as Christianity anyway . ”

Doubts about God
For numerous archaeological and scientific evidences for the accuracy of the Bible , see these two large sections of our site .
Many skeptical questions answered .
His Existence | His Nature | His Justice
“ So , who made God ?
Where did he come from ? ”
To one who examines the evidence , there can be no doubt that God exists .
Every building has a builder .
Everything made has a maker .
The fact of the existence of the Creator is axiomatic ( self evident ) .
That ’s why the Bible says , “ The fool has said in his heart , ‘ There is no God ’ ” ( Psalm 14:1 ) .
The professing atheist denies the common sense given to him by God , and defends his belief by thinking that the question “ Who made God ? ” ca n’t be answered .
This , he thinks , gives him license to deny the existence of God .
The question of who made God can be answered by simply looking at space and asking , “ Does space have an end ? ”
Obviously , it does n’t .
If there is a brick wall with “ The End ” written on it , the question arises , “ What is behind the brick wall ? ”
Strain the mind though it may , we have to believe ( have faith ) that space has no beginning and no end .
The same applies with God .
He has no beginning and no end .
He is eternal .
The Bible also informs us that time is a dimension that God created , into which man was subjected .
It even tells us that one day time will no longer exist .
That will be called “ eternity . ”
God Himself dwells outside of the dimension
He created ( 2 Timothy 1:9 , Titus 1:2 ) .
He dwells in eternity and is not subject to time .
God spoke history before it came into being .
He can move through time as a man flips through a history book .
Because we live in the dimension of time , logic and reason demand that everything must have a beginning and an end .
We can understand the concept of God ’s eternal nature the same way we understand the concept of space having no beginning and end — by faith .
We simply have to believe they are so , even though such thoughts put a strain on our distinctly insufficient cerebrum .
Read our detailed answer : If God made everything , who made God ?
“ Seeing is believing — if I ca n’t see God , why should I believe in Him ? ”
“ So if you ca n’t see something , you do n’t believe it exists ?
Have you ever seen your brain ?
We believe in many things that we have n’t see .
Have you ever seen the wind ?
Have you seen history ?
We see the effects of the wind , but the wind is invisible .
We have records of history , but it is by ‘ faith ’ we believe that certain historical events happened .
Television waves are invisible , but an antenna and a receiver can detect their presence .
Do you know that you have a receiver ?
Your ‘ receiver ’ ( your spirit ) is dead because of sin ( see Ephesians 2:1 ) .
You need to be plugged into the life of God , and then you will come alive and be aware of the invisible spiritual realm .
Do you think that you have kept the Ten Commandments ?

“ If God knows I am hurting , why does n’t He help me ? ” Answer
“ If God is perfect , why did He make an imperfect creation ? ”
The Bible tells us that the Genesis creation was “ good . ”
There was no sin and therefore no suffering or death .
Why then did God give Adam and Eve the ability to sin , knowing full well that they would sin and bring death and pain to the human race ?
Some believe that if Adam had been created without the ability to choose , then he would have been a “ robot . ”
A father cannot make his children love him .
They choose to love him because they have a free will .
Others point out that humanity would never have seen the depth of the love of God , as displayed in the cross , unless Adam had sinned , and that fact could be one reason why God allowed sin to enter the world .
Also see Christian Answers ’ Gospel presentation If God is all - knowing , all - powerful , and loving , would He really create a world like this ?
“ God is unfair if Hitler and a dear old lady ( who never accepted Jesus ) will both go to Hell . ”
Sinners often accuse God of being unjust , because they assume that everyone will receive the same punishment in hell .
God ’s judgment , however , will be according to righteousness ( Acts 17:31 ) .
This verse shows that there will be degrees of punishment .
See Mark 6:11 .
“ Is God biased ?
How can
He save some and not others ? ”
Answer
“ How can God be a god of love if there is so much pain and suffering in the world ? ”
Answer
“ I ’m basically a good person . ”
If you can get your listener to admit that they have broken the moral law ( ever lied , stolen , etc. ) then they will be forced to realize that they are a lawbreaker .
Or , if they say they used to break the law but no longer do , mention to them that time does n’t forgive sin .
If a man commits murder on Monday , but on Tuesday he is kind to others , he is still a murderer .
If a man lies and steals , unless he comes to the Savior , his sins remain with him until he stands before God in Judgment .

“ God made me a homosexual … ”
Some homosexuals argue that they did not make a conscious decision to be that way , so it must be natural .
They are born that way - just as all of us are born with a sin nature and sinful desires ( Ephesians 2:1 - 3 ) .
Tell them that it is natural for them , and for all of us , to be tempted to do things that God says are wrong .
In the same way , pedophiles and adulterers ( alcoholics , drug addicts , etc. ) do n’t make a conscious decision to “ choose ” that self - destructive lifestyle ; they simply give in to their sinful desires .
However , although sin is natural for unbelievers , that does n’t mean God wants them to remain that way .
God can set them free from their sinful nature ( Romans 7:23 - 8:2 ) , give them new desires ( Ephesians 4:22 - 24 ) , and help them withstand temptations ( 1 Corinthians 10:13 ) .
Response : “ I too was born with homosexual tendencies …
I was also born with a tendency to lie , steal , commit adultery and fornicate .
It ’s called ‘ sin ’ and it ’s in every one of us . ”
You can then proceed to use the law to awaken the conscience .
The Bible tells us that the Moral Law was made for homosexuals ( see 1 Timothy 1:8- 10 ) .
If you use the Law when you witness to them you wo n’t even have to touch on their “ sexual orientation , ” and therefore be accused of hating homosexuals .
The Law will show him that he is damned , despite his sexual preference .
When he finds a place of true repentance and faith in Jesus , God will take away his unclean spirit and give him a new heart with new desires .
See : Can a gay person go to heaven ?
“ I was once a ‘ born - again ’ Christian .
Now I believe it ’s all rubbish ! ”
Simply ask him the question , “ Did you know the Lord ? ”
If he answers , “ I thought I did , ” gently say , “ So you did n’t .
You had a false conversion .
You were a stony - ground hearer who received the word with joy and gladness , but in a time of tribulation , temptation and persecution , fell away . ”
If he answers the question with “ Yes , ” gently say , “ So you admit that He is real and that you are in rebellion to His will . ”
What is being born - again ?
Answer
“ Yup , I ’ve broken every one of the Ten Commandments . ”
Do not take this statement to mean that the person has seen the gravity of their sinful state before God .
It is often used as a way of throwing off conviction .
Pharaoh said that he had sinned , but his repentance was superficial .
Say to him , “ Well let ’s take the time to go through them one by one and see if you have . ”
“ God ca n’t forgive me .
I ’ve sinned too much ! ”
Nobody is too big a sinner .
The love of God and the sacrifice of Jesus is capable of cleansing the worst of all sin .
Even Hitler could have been saved if he would have turned to Christ .
You have sinned the same as anyone else .
It is just that your sins are yours .
They are n’t too big for God to wipe away .
Sin has no power over God , only over you .
Let me ask you something .
Do you think murder and adultery are serious sins ?
Yes ?
Well , David , a man in the Bible who was called by God a man after His own heart ( Acts 13:22 ) , was a murderer and an adulterer .
He even tried to hide his sin from everyone .
But God knew his sins and exposed them .
David repented and threw himself on the mercy of the Lord .
God forgave him and loved him .
God loves you and He will forgive you if you put your trust in Jesus and ask Him to forgive you of your sins ( Rom. 10:9-10 ) .
“ Morality is relative ” “ There are no absolutes ! ”
An example conversation :
Larry : “ I heard you say that pornography is wrong .
I disagree . ”
Christian : “ Why ’s that ? ”
Larry : “ There ’s nothing wrong with it . ”
Christian : “ Do you think child pornography is right or wrong ? ”
Larry :
It ’s wrong . ”
Christian : “ So you have drawn a moral line between what you think is right and what you think is wrong .
At what age then does child pornography become respectable pornography ?
Is it when the child turns 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 years old ? ”
Larry : “ 16 . ”
Christian : “ Ca n’t you see what you are doing ?
You are judging whether something is morally acceptable by when it gives you pleasure . ”
Larry : “ But … ”
Christian : “ God gave you a conscience .
You know right from wrong .
Is n’t that true ? ”
Christian : “ So if someone steals your wallet you do n’t mind because you have no idea what ’s right and what ’s wrong ? ”
Larry : “ Okay .
So I know right from wrong . ”
Christian : “ You are like a man who has removed the batteries from his smoke detector because he does n’t want it to alarm him .
Listen to your conscience .
It is trying to warn you of danger .
If you do n’t repent and trust the Savior you will end up in Hell .
On Judgment Day you will be without excuse .
Jesus said , ‘ Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her , has committed adultery already with her in his heart . ’
You are in big trouble . ”
Those who say that that there are no absolutes are often very adamant about their belief .
If they say that they are absolutely sure , then they are wrong because their own statement is an absolute statement .
If they are not 100 % sure , then there is a chance that they are wrong and they are risking their eternal salvation by trusting in a belief that could be wrong .
“ If Christianity is true , why are there so many denominations ? ”
In the early 1500s , a German monk named Martin Luther was so conscious of his sins , he spent up to six hours in the confessional .
Through study of the Scriptures he found that salvation did n’t come through anything he did , but simply through trusting in the finished work of the Cross of Jesus Christ .
He listed the contradictions between what the Scriptures said , and what his church taught , and nailed his 95 Theses to the church door in Wittenberg , Germany .
Martin Luther became the first to “ protest ” against the Roman church , and thus he became the father of the Protestant church .
Since that split , there have been many disagreements about how much water one should baptize with , how to sing what and why , who should govern who , etc. , causing thousands of splinter groups .
Many of these groups are convinced that they are the only ones who are right .
These have become known as Protestant “ denominations . ”
Despite the confusion , these churches subscribe to certain foundational beliefs such as the deity , the death , burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ .
The Bible says , “ … the foundation of God stands sure , having this seal — the Lord knows those that are His ” ( see 2 Timothy 2:19 ) .

DETROIT -- The Detroit Red Wings ' Brian Rafalski did not practice Monday , but coach Mike Babcock said the defenseman will play in Game 4 of the team 's Western Conference quarterfinal playoff series against Phoenix on Tuesday .
Rafalski apparently hurt his back in Game 3 , although he came back to finish the game .
Babcock said Rafalski took a " maintenance day ' ' Monday .
" He 'll play ( Tuesday ) , '' Babcock said .
Babcock said he does not anticipate any lineup changes .
" Not at this point , '' Babcock said .
" But the good thing about being the coach is you have the right to change your mind . ''
With his team trailing the series 2 - 1 , Babcock said it boils down to his players needing to outwork the Coyotes .
" You can talk about skill level all you want , '' Babcock said .
" In the end , normally , we have real good structure and we out - determine you .
We just keep on coming .
So far in this series , they 've done a better job of that part of the game than we have . ''

Or : Why the Heritage Freedom Index is a Damned Statistical Lie
This guest post was contributed by StatsGuy , a frequent commenter and occasional guest on this blog .
It shows how quickly the headline interpretation of statistical measures breaks down once you start peeking under the covers .
Recently , a controversy raged in the blogosphere about whether neo-liberalism has been a bane or a boon for the world economy .
The argument is rather coarse , in that it fails to distinguish between the various elements of neo-liberalism , or moderate deregulation vs. extreme deregulation .
But if we take the argument at face value , one of the major claims of neoliberals is that countries in the world which are more neoliberal are more successful ( because they are more neoliberal ) .
I disagree .
My disagreement is not with the raw correlation between the Heritage Index and Per Capita GDP .
A number is a number .
My disagreement is with the composition of the index itself , and interpreting this correlation as causation between neo-liberalism and ‘ good things . ’
My primary contention below is that many of these measures used in the composite Heritage Index have nothing to do with less government , and a lot more to do with good government .
It is these measures of good government that correlate to economic growth and drive the overall correlation between the “ Freedom Index ” and positive outcomes .
Secondarily , I will argue that many of the other items in the index ( like investment freedom ) are not causes of growth , but rather outcomes of growth .
The Heritage Index weighs ten items equally , and these items are derived using very different mechanisms ( many subjective ) :
Business Freedom
Trade Freedom
Fiscal Freedom
Government Freedom
Monetary Freedom
Investment Freedom
Financial Freedom
Property Freedom
Freedom from Corruption
Labor Freedom
Here are the top twenty countries on the index , and their overall scores .
Hong Kong 89.7 Singapore 86.1 Australia 82.6 New Zealand 82.1 Ireland 81.3 Switzerland 81.1 Canada 80.4 United States 78 Denmark 77.9 Chile 77.2 United Kingdom 76.5 Bahrain 76.3 Mauritius 76.3 Luxembourg 75.4 The Netherlands 75 Estonia 74.7 Finland 73.8 Iceland 73.7 Japan 72.9 Macau 72.5
It strikes many that some countries we do not normally consider very libertarian rank quite high – Singapore ( with the government actively manipulating the property market through its monopoly on land sales , or deploying investments through its massive sovereign wealth fund , etc. ) , Canada ( with its state run health system ) , and others .
Likewise , on the negative side of the equation , we can observe several countries that score in the upper third on the Heritage Index that strike us as weak states .
It turns out that Jamaica scores a rank of # 58 , and Colombia a # 57 .
This is well above a lot of other countries like Argentina ( # 135 ) , and even slightly above relatively successful nations like France ( #63 ) , Poland ( #70 ) , and Italy ( #73 ) .
These types of scores tend to raise questions .
If we look under the hood , it turns out that Jamaica would score even better on the Heritage Index if it were n’t for two components on which it scores miserably .
Here are Jamaica ’s scores :
Overall Score 65.5 Business Freedom 87 Trade Freedom 72.2 Fiscal Freedom 74.8 Government Spending 61.8 Monetary Freedom 68.4 Investment Freedom 85 Financial Freedom 60 Property Rights 45 Freedom From Corruption 31 Labor Freedom 70
Those two scores are massively dragging down the average .
This immediately makes one wonder how the various components relate to each other .
Let ’s take a look at the simple correlations :
Overall Score Business Freedom Trade Freedom Fiscal Freedom Government Spending Monetary Freedom Investment Freedom Financial Freedom Property Rights Freedom From Corruption Labor Freedom Overall Score 1.00 0.80 0.66 0.04 - 0.12 0.60 0.83 0.85 0.83 0.79 0.45 Business Freedom 0.80 1.00 0.46 - 0.06 - 0.27 0.43 0.57 0.61 0.72 0.69 0.44 Trade Freedom 0.66 0.46 1.00 0.00 - 0.22 0.36 0.61 0.58 0.49 0.51 0.15 Fiscal Freedom 0.04 -0.06 0.00 1.00 0.43 - 0.30 - 0.16 - 0.09 - 0.28 - 0.32 0.13 Government Spending - 0.12 - 0.27 - 0.22 0.43 1.00 - 0.12 - 0.27 - 0.23 - 0.38 - 0.40 - 0.13 Monetary Freedom 0.60 0.43 0.36 - 0.30 - 0.12 1.00 0.51 0.56 0.59 0.56 0.13 Investment Freedom 0.83 0.57 0.61 - 0.16 - 0.27 0.51 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.68 0.13 Financial Freedom 0.85 0.61 0.58 - 0.09 - 0.23 0.56 0.80 1.00 0.72 0.67 0.24 Property Rights 0.83 0.72 0.49 - 0.28 - 0.38 0.59 0.70 0.72 1.00 0.94 0.29 Freedom From Corruption 0.79 0.69 0.51 - 0.32 - 0.40 0.56 0.68 0.67 0.94 1.00 0.29 Labor Freedom 0.45 0.44 0.15 0.13 - 0.13 0.13 0.13 0.24 0.29 0.29 1.00
Wow , there are some peculiar things about this table !
Note , for instance , that Government Spending is negatively correlated with just about everything ( except Fiscal Freedom ) .
Note , also , that Property Rights and Freedom From Corruption have the highest bivariate correlation on the table ( 0.94 ) .
What if we were to try to visualize the relationships between the Heritage Index components , for example using a tool like MDS ?
We might get this ( depending how you run it ) :
At first glance , it looks there are three groups of items : one focusing on property rights , corruption , and financial “ freedom ” ; one focusing on structural factors in the economy ( trade , business , labor , monetary ) ; and one focusing on government spending ( with fiscal freedom somewhere between government spending and the structural factors ) .
Let ’s dig even deeper .
If we open up the criteria for Financial and Investment Freedom , we find that both of these are subjective measures – using a point system in which Heritage deducts points depending on government interference with investments and finance .
Subjective measures are problematic , because the individuals assigning points probably have a high bias to ( unintentionally ) favor countries that are successful overall .
( That ’s why drug trials require double blind tests . )
But let ’s give them the benefit of the doubt .
For Investment Freedom , Heritage penalizes points for several reasons , but half of the measure relates to legal recourse against appropriation of investor funds , bureaucratic controls over capital movement , and lack of transparency in investment law .
. . .
These sure sound a lot like Property Rights and Freedom From Corruption .
For Financial Freedom , Heritage uses a 0 - 100 scale that is subjectively assigned based on the reviewer ’s perceived influence of the government on finance .
On this scale , the United Kingdom , which unleashed massive Quantitative Easing ( not that I ’m critical ) and has tight links between large banks and Parliament scored an 80 , near the top of the chart .
What about the variables in the lower left quadrant ?
Well , some of them we can probably ignore , like Monetary Freedom , which basically measures inflation and price controls .
If we look at the standard deviation of these 10 measures across all countries , we get an idea of the typical influence of each variable on the final index score .
Measure Standard Deviation Business Freedom 18.0 Trade Freedom 12.1 Fiscal Freedom 12.7 Government Spending 20.4 Monetary Freedom 6.9 Investment Freedom 22.0 Financial Freedom 19.0 Property Rights 24.0 Freedom From Corruption 21.0 Labor Freedom 17.2
Monetary Freedom is flat , meaning that on average it accounts for little variation in the index score among countries .
Property Rights and Freedom from Corruption typically account for three times as much variation in the final index .
Even Trade Freedom and Fiscal Freedom are relatively flat compared to Property Rights and Freedom From Corruption .
As one can see , the final index is ( empirically ) heavily weighted toward what I will call the ‘ Good Government ’ variables , rather than the ‘ Less Government ’ variables .
But let ’s go just one step further .
Let ’s pull a measure of quality of life from the World Bank that uses something other than GDP .
We ’ll use Life Expectancy .
While this is surely influenced by genetics , one must imagine it ’s a pretty decent measure of quality of life as well .
How does this measure correlate with the ten ‘ Freedom ’ measures above ?
Measure Correlation With Life Expectancy Overall Score 0.59 Business Freedom 0.60 Trade Freedom 0.53 Fiscal Freedom - 0.01 Government Spending - 0.27 Monetary Freedom 0.30 Investment Freedom 0.46 Financial Freedom 0.47 Property Rights 0.61 Freedom From Corruption 0.64 Labor Freedom 0.17
Wow . . .
Fiscal Freedom and lower Government Spending negatively correlate with life expectancy , even without controlling for other variables !
A purist might observe that government spending could be an outcome , rather than a cause ( i.e. , government spending is a luxury good that wealthy societies engage in by mistake , but it does n’t improve mortality rates ) .
That sounds fishy , but even so , it still undercuts the neoliberal argument ( less government = always better ) .
Likewise , we observe very low correlations with Labor Freedom and Monetary Freedom , and one could argue that most of that correlation is spurious ( that is , working through other factors ) .
Where are the highest correlations ?
Property Rights and Freedom from Corruption . . . .
Again , our best measures of ‘ Good Government ’ in this index .
The second strongest pair of measures – Business Freedom and Trade Freedom – does seem to support the neo-liberal case .
I will note , however , that Business Freedom is primarily determined by the speed / cost of starting , licensing , and closing a company .
I will further note that this is heavily influenced by the efficiency of licensing agencies and the court system ( especially bankruptcy courts ) .
Again , these are measures of ‘ Good Government . ’
The neo -liberals do seem to have a case for lower trade barriers ( ‘ Trade Freedom ’ ) , although a huge part of this correlation is driven by the fact that the entirety of Europe has relatively low trade barriers .
Conclusion
The Heritage Freedom Index is really a composite of measures that get at two different things : Good Government , and Less Government .
Overall , the Good Government factors tend to dominate , and drive a lot of the correlation with good economic and quality of life outcomes .
When one splits out the factors , the case for Less / Weaker Government weakens substantially , and the case for Clean / Non-Corrupt / Efficient government strengthens considerably .
This does not support many of the conclusions that are often drawn using the overall Heritage Index .

JOHANNESBURG ( Reuters ) - South African police are using World Cup rules and regulations to harass homeless people , foreign migrants and street hawkers ahead of this month ’s finals , Amnesty International said .
“ This harassment has included police raids , arbitrary arrests , ill - treatment and extortion , as well as destruction of informal housing , ” the London - based human rights group said in a statement .
In particular , vagrants and informal street vendors were being booted out of “ controlled access sites ” and exclusion zones demanded around World Cup venues by the sport ’s world governing body FIFA , Amnesty said .
“ The requirements under the ‘ FIFA by - laws ’ which create extensive exclusion zones for informal economic activity are seen as particularly prejudicial , ” Amnesty said .
Police spokesman Vish Naidoo defended the action by police and local authorities , saying Amnesty was trying to link the World Cup to a perennial problem in South Africa , where millions live in grinding poverty and shanty towns .
“ Just because the World Cup is happening , must we ignore laws and by - laws that are being broken ? ” he said .
Amnesty also said the deployment of huge numbers of police at World Cup - related sites would mean fewer officers in poorer neighborhoods , where the largest part of South Africa ’s notoriously high levels of crime occur .
It added that it was worried about police getting trigger - happy in their zeal to protect the 350,000 foreign visitors who are expected for the month - long tournament , which kicks off on June 11 .
Security and crime have been one of the biggest issues ahead of the first World Cup on African soil .
South Africa has 50 murders a day , almost the same rate as the United States , which has six times as many people .
( Reporting by Ed Cropley )
Hooters , a restaurant chain known more for its waitresses ' outfits and hot wings than environmental efforts , is helping to clean up British Petroleum 's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by donating used pantyhose .
The company 's Project Pantyhose initiative will collect donated torn pantyhose from Hooters employees , with the goal of gathering more than 100,000 pairs .
The pantyhose will be used to make booms , which are filled with materials like hair , fur , feathers and fleece that absorb oil .
If the donation drive hits its goal , the pantyhose will be able to make 15 miles of booms , enough to collect 1 million gallons of oil if they all are reused eight times , the average boom lifespan .
Hooters will collect the pantyhose over the coming four weeks and hand over all donations to Indigo Oceanic and Matter of Trust , which will make the booms .
Last month , Hanesbrands said it would donate 50,000 pairs of pantyhose to oil spill cleanup efforts .
In addition to making booms stuffed with hair , Matter of Trust creates mats made with hair , which were used in the San Francisco Bay after the Cosco - Busan bunker oil spill in 2007 .

Heap remortgaged her flat to fund her second album in 2005
When singer - songwriter Imogen
Heap tweeted last week that she may stop touring because it is too expensive and it was " not easy keeping afloat in this climate " , it was an unexpected message of gloom from one of the UK 's most acclaimed artists .
It was more surprising because Heap has just won a Grammy and a prestigious Ivor Novello songwriting award , and her substantial fanbase is among the most devoted and active in music .
And it pricked the music industry myth that live music is drawing more punters and dollars than ever , making up for the ongoing slump in album sales .
So if Heap is struggling to make ends meet , what chance do other musicians have ?
" I need to feed myself and this is n't going to help me , if I keep touring till the end of the year like I wanted to , " she says , speaking on the phone before a gig in Miami , part of her current US tour .
" I just ca n't afford it .
I 'm going to be broke . "
Image caption Heap won a Grammy for best engineered album , non-classical
In her revealing tweets , she told fans " this may be the last tour in a while " , that it was " so expensive to tour ! " and " record sales low ( across the industry ) really impacting me " .
She was on " a downer " , she says , after being told by her manager that she needed to find an extra £ 20,000 to stage the European tour she was hoping to play later this year .
" At this point in my life , I just about break even when it comes to touring , " she explains .
" But with the European tour that I was about to do , it turns out that even just doing it at a basic no - frills level , I would still be £ 20,000 out of pocket . "
Heap remortgaged her flat to set up her own record label and release her second album , Speak for Yourself , in 2005 .
The follow - up , Ellipse , reached number five in the US chart last year .
During our conversation , she is keen to look on the bright side and not appear to moan .
But she does point to several factors that have made life tough as a working musician .
First , the slide in record sales in recent years has left a noticeable dent in her bank balance .
" Even though the popularity and the fanbase is much much greater , and more people have heard about me through things like the Grammys and the Ivors and touring and word of mouth , it does n't reflect in he sales of the record and does n't go into my pocket . "
I 'm not Britney and not playing stadiums - I 'm in the middle , and there are a lot of bands like me where it really is hard to get over the hump
Then there is the recession .
Some fans have been unable or unwilling to pay $ 40 ( £ 27 ) a ticket for her current tour , and she blames venue owners , ticket agencies and promoters for bumping up the fees .
Of that price , she will get around $ 16 ( £ 11 ) per person to cover all touring costs , she says .
" So many venues are owned by these various different ticketing and promoting people , and they 're all in bed with one another .
It 's no secret over here , " she says .
Although she is reluctant to name names , the newly merged Live Nation and Ticketmaster owns half the venues on her 23 - date North American tour and is selling tickets for most .
Heap is playing in mid-sized venues , holding mostly between 2,000 - 3,000 people .
The only other option is to play more shows in more intimate , independent venues .
" But it would take three or four times as long to do the tour and that 's just not feasible " , she says .
Image caption Imogen Heap :
The fans really are behind her
The extra time required would give her less chance to write new material .
" And the writing of songs for me or other people , or producing other people , that 's where the cash comes in .
It was a decision I was having to make . "
The singer deftly sums up the predicament : " I 'm not Britney and not playing stadiums .
I'm in the middle , and there are a lot of bands like me where it really is hard to get over the hump . "
In fact , Heap 's biggest money - spinner of recent years has come from a sample of her song Hide and Seek , which was used in US R&B star Jason Derulo 's chart - topping hit Whatcha Say .
" He 's sold , like , two - and - a - half million copies of that song , " Heap says .
" Which is fantastic for me because I get half of it . "
Production costs
In the wake of her comments on Twitter , some have suggested she cut down the production costs for her elaborate live show .
For her part , she says she wants to give fans the gig of their lives .
Another blunt explanation for Heap 's situation is that not enough people like her music .
But given her status and success , it would be a disaster if artists like her were unable to ply their trade .
So she is looking to more innovative solutions to stay on the road .
A recent gig in Indonesia showed a possible way forward .
The singer had never visited or paid attention to the country - until a deluge of tweets from Indonesian fans .
That was the first she knew of the large fanbase there , and resulted in a sold out gig to 4,000 fans in Jakarta .
My biggest asset is not cash - it's a large , growing , devout fanbase
" That was the power of what I need to harness , this incredible word of mouth , " she says .
" That one did make money .
That one we got it right . "
The singer now wants to put a map on her website so fans can ask her to come to their country or city , pledging money in advance .
" Eventually I will get to you , but I need to know that you 're there for me when I get there , " she says .
And her 1.5 million followers on Twitter helped out again after her recent comments about touring .
One fan pointed her towards Pledge Music , a service that lets artists raise money for new projects by selling exclusive goodies such as backstage passes , access to rehearsals and signed merchandise .
She is now likely to go down that route to raise the £ 20,000 she needs to tour Europe .
" My biggest asset is not cash - it's a large , growing , devout fanbase , " Heap says .
" It 's not about making tonnes of cash .
It 's just about being able to go and do a show for the people that really want to see it . "
After almost ten weeks : no end to BP oil spill devastation
By David Walsh
26 June 2010
The BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , now nearly 10 weeks old , is doing untold damage to ecological and economic life .
Entire industries in the region have been shut down , tens of thousands of jobs affected , and lives ruined as the result of BP ’s criminal actions and the Obama administration ’s impotence in the face of corporate profit hunger .
On Thursday , a beach in Florida was closed for the first time — in Pensacola , some 130 miles northeast of the oilrig explosion site .
According to a local television station , “ Sheets of oil blanketed Pensacola beaches for several miles Wednesday . ”
The area has been renowned for its white - sand beaches and “ emerald waters . ”
No more .
NorthEscambia.com , a local online newspaper described the reality : “ It was the day that the World ’s Whitest Beaches were no more .
It was the day that the oil began to wash onto the shores of Pensacola Beach .
It was the day the sands were stained black with oil ; it was the day the tears of the locals stained the remaining sugar white sand .
“ It was Wednesday , June 23 , 2010 .
Masses of oil began to wash onto Pensacola Beach from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . ”
A lifeguard , wearing a red handkerchief over his nose and mouth to block the oil smell , told the media , “ It ’s enough to knock you down . ”
Health advisories suggesting people should not fish or swim had been posted along 33 miles of Florida ’s Panhandle beaches , but Thursday was the first day people were kept off one of them .
Pensacola , the westernmost city in the Florida Panhandle , with a population of 53,000 people , is thoroughly dependent on tourism .
WALB television reported that the Pensacola beach “ looked like a black blanket covered the sand . ”
The Pensacola News Journal reported that despite the efforts of 1,100 workers and heavy equipment overnight Wednesday , “ massive sheets of oil remained buried in the sand . ”
NorthEscambia.com bitterly reported that 44,955 pounds of tar balls and oil material were collected June 23 on Pensacola area beaches , including 10,245 pounds from a stretch of the Gulf Islands National Seashore and 7,500 pounds at West Perdido State Park ; that BP has so far paid 18,694 claims in Florida at an “ Average payout per claim ” of $ 902.08 ; and that BP ’s approximate profit “ in the first three months of 2010 ” was $ 6 billion .
In nearby Alabama , reporters from the Press - Register in Mobile noted the presence Thursday afternoon of “ dark sheets of oil washing ashore ” in state recreation areas on the Coast not far from the Florida border .
Oil also washed up at Alabama ’s popular Orange Beach .
Double red flags warned swimmers to stay out of the water .
The same treatment Pensacola received is predicted for Orange Beach and Perdido Key in Alabama .
“ It is following the track of the land , ” said one expert , speaking of the spill .
According to the News Journal , “ Large red and orange plumes of thick oil streaked the water 's surface just south of Orange Beach , covering at least 10 square miles of the Gulf .
In places , the oil was as close as 100 yards to the beach . ”
Alabama Department of Public Health officials are investigating claims that the spill has affected people ’s health at 20 sites in Mobile and Baldwin counties , which lie on the Gulf .
Thirty - one individuals in the area have sought medical treatment in emergency rooms , urgent care facilities and clinics , complaining of ailments connected to the spill , via inhalation , contact or ingestion .
Oil is expected to wash onto mainland Mississippi beaches within the next days , according to Trudy Fisher , of the state ’s Department of Environmental Quality .
“ I think we all need to be mentally prepared to see some impact on our beaches , ” she said .
The oil has been closer to Alabama , “ but winds shifted and began blowing it toward Mississippi over the last few days , ” reported a Biloxi , Mississippi newspaper .
A developing storm in the western Caribbean threatens to dramatically worsen the situation .
On Friday , the Nation Hurricane Center reported the development of what could be the season ’s first tropical depression in the region .
Moving at speeds of 35 - miles per hour in a northwesterly direction , the storm system could pass over the Yucatan Peninsula and into the Gulf of Mexico .
If this happens , high winds and waves could wash the oil on shore .
Oil collection operations and the drilling of relief oil wells would have to be suspended , with some experts warning that cleanup operations could be offline for several days .
BP and the federal government continue to minimize the impact of the oil spill , but estimates on its far - reaching economic consequences are coming in from various sources .
In a preliminary analysis , an economist from the University of Central Florida argued recently that the Gulf oil spill could put nearly 200,000 workers in Florida alone out of work , and cost the state some $ 11 billion .
A report issued by the University of West Florida last week estimated 45,000 jobs associated with tourism were at risk in the Florida Panhandle .
In Grand Isle , Louisiana , only 50 miles from the rig explosion , oil has “ seeped into the island ’s bayous , ” notes USA Today .
Grand Isle ’s population of some 1,500 people “ normally grows from roughly 1,500 to more than 10,000 during the summer , ” but now “ locals count only about 100 tourists .
The local camps and motels are filled instead with contract workers and members of the military , here to help with the spill cleanup effort . ”
A local sports bar operator told the newspaper , “ The tourism business is shot … This place is wiped out .
It ’s going to kill this little island . ”
Tourism is big business on the Gulf Coast .
“ Louisiana saw $ 1.36 billion of its more than $ 8 billion in tourism dollars generated by its Gulf region last year .
Alabama 's beaches produced 25 % of the $ 9.2 billion in tourism dollars reaped by the state in 2009 .
And of the 19 million visitors who flocked to Mississippi July 2008 through June 2009 , 5.5 million traveled to the state 's three coastal counties . ”
Much of that is now threatened .
“ In Mississippi , the spill could result in a $ 120 million loss to non-casino tourism in the state 's coastal areas this summer , according to a study released this month by the University of Southern Mississippi . ”
Those are some of the direct results .
But the loss of tax receipts , claims Alabama ’s State Superintendent of Education Joe Morton , could be devastating for the state ’s Education Trust Fund , composed of 10 different taxes collected at the state level and dedicated to funding public education from elementary to medical school .
In a press release June 10 , Morton noted , “ As tourism diminishes along Alabama ’s Gulf Coast , as the seafood industry is crippled due to the ‘ no fishing ’ areas of the Gulf of Mexico , as oyster and shrimping areas are decimated by the oil spill , tax receipts to the ETF will suffer . ”
He explained that because of “ the BP tragedy ” and corresponding loss of tax revenues , present and future , “ I am declaring that I will charge BP with restoring the revenues lost so far , as well as future lost revenues to the ETF . …
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is wreaking havoc on our environment and gulf coast economy .
We cannot allow it to also undermine our public schools by reducing the very tax receipts that pay our teachers ’ salaries and help our classrooms keep the learning environment alive daily .
Stateline.org comments that budget officials in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida , “ who badly overestimated revenue in the last two years as the national economic downturn deepened , now are facing the unexpected challenge of forecasting tax collections in the midst of a fickle environmental calamity that could last several years . ”
It notes that accurate estimates are “ crucial so state officials can send the bill to BP …
Alabama revenue officials , among others , are trying mightily to document the costs , which include salaries and expenses of state workers involved in the cleanup .
‘ Nothing of this magnitude has been done before , ’ says veteran Alabama finance chief Bill Newton . ”
BP , however , has no intention of paying for even a fraction of the damage its disaster will ultimately produce .
Not only does it have lawyers , accountants and other highly paid experts working around the clock to come up with means , legal and otherwise , of avoiding such payouts , it can rely on the full complicity of the federal , state and local governments , and the judicial system , to connive in its efforts .
Google released the source code for Android 2.2 , aka " Froyo " , was released on Wednesday , and it 's using an over - the - air update to load the new version on existing Nexus One phones .
" Today is one of those days that has my heart racing ; we ’ve just released the source code for Android 2.2 , " wrote Google software engineer Jean - Baptiste Queru in a post on the Android Developers blog .
" Please do n’t melt the servers down again while trying to download that latest source code . "
Over on the xda-developers.com site , a fast - developing thread began right after the announcement , with sundry developers frantically searching impatiently waiting for the OTA .
According to some , the latest build will not work if you 're already updated your Nexus One to a previous build .
Over on AndroidSpin , developer Alex Smith writes : " It seems like some of us Nexus One users received an OTA update that updates the build number to FRF83 .
Unfortunately , if you are currently running the FRF72 update , you are going have to downgrade to FRF50 to install the latest build . "
A posting on Android and Me notes that " A new over the air update began hitting Nexus One phones [ Wednesday night ] and it appears to deliver the official version of Android 2.2 . "
The same post provides a link to the upgrade for users not wanting to wait for the OTA , plus helpful instructions .
Upgrades for other Android phones will follow .
The just - released Motorola Droid X for example , is scheduled to move up to Android 2.2 in late summer .
While waiting for your Android phone to be Froyo - fied , remember the sage advice from one poster on Google 's Android forum : " Everyone relax .
You can't rush software .
Well , you can , and it's called Windows Vista . " ®
Researchers remain fascinated by the relationship between money and happiness .
Perhaps it ’s because of the observation that money alone does n’t appear to “ buy ” happiness , unless you give it away or spend it for experiences more than for material things .
A new study out last week ( Quoidbach et al. , 2010 ) suggests that money ’s effects on our well being and happiness may be even more subtle than previously realized .
Simply seeing a picture of money — which appears to prime our brains , increasing the concept of money at a level below awareness — seems to impede our ability to enjoy life ’s little pleasures .
How did the researchers arrive at such a stunning conclusion ?
The researchers conducted two experiments in order to test their hypotheses about the effects of money on our ability to savor an experience .
In the first experiment , researchers recruited 351 adults who were employees at the University of Liège in Belgium .
Subjects were divided into two groups to answer a set of questionnaires .
In the experimental group , a stack of euro bills was displayed in a photograph , while in the control group the photograph was blurred beyond recognition .
The questionnaires asked about income , happiness , and desire for wealth .
The researchers found that both the subjects who had higher incomes as well as those who were primed by the photograph of the stack of euro bills reported a significantly lower ability to savor positive emotions than did volunteers who did not have as much money or were in the control condition .
The researchers suggest that this demonstrates that “ wealth may fail to deliver the happiness one might expect because of its detrimental consequences for savoring . ”
In a nutshell — wealth reduces our ability to savor .
In a separate experiment conducted at the University of British Columbia with 40 volunteers , the researchers set out to see if they could replicate and extend the previous experiment ’s findings :
Participants completed a brief questionnaire that requested their demographic information and assessed their attitudes toward chocolate .
The questionnaire was presented to each participant in a binder , and the adjacent page showed materials from an “ unrelated study , ” including a picture of Canadian money or a neutral photo .
Next , participants were instructed to eat a piece of chocolate and , when ready , to complete a brief follow - up questionnaire .
Hidden observers using stopwatches measured the time each participant took to eat the chocolate .
These observers also rated the extent of positive emotions each subject displayed while eating the chocolate .
The researchers found that females spend significantly more time savoring the chocolate than males did .
Not surprising .
So they had to tease out the gender variables in the data and then found that the subjects who saw a picture of money ate chocolate faster ( i.e. , did not savor the experience ) .
These subjects also exhibited less enjoyment of it than did volunteers who viewed a neutral picture .
I ’ll let the researchers summarize their own findings :
Taken together , our findings provide evidence for the provocative and intuitively appealing — yet previously untested — notion that having access to the best things in life may actually undermine one ’s ability to reap enjoyment from life ’s small pleasures .
Moving beyond past theorizing , our research demonstrates that a simple reminder of wealth produces the same deleterious effects as actual wealth on an individual ’s ability to savor , suggesting that perceived access to pleasurable experiences may be sufficient to impair everyday savoring .
In other words , one need not actually visit the pyramids of Egypt or spend a week at the legendary Banff spas in Canada for one ’s savoring ability to be impaired — simply knowing that these peak experiences are readily available may increase one ’s tendency to take the small pleasures of daily life for granted .
Intriguing .
I ’m not certain what action item we can take away from this , though , since our knowledge already seems to impact our ability to enjoy life ’s smaller pleasures .
Perhaps we need to mindfully and consciously remove “ money ” from the equation of our lives altogether .
The less we think about it — even unconsciously — the more likely we may be able to more fully enjoy life ’s little pleasures .

Money Impedes Our Ability to Enjoy the Little Pleasures in Life
The White House says Obama has worked hard to achieve the goals of his progressive agenda , especially health reform .
Left to Obama :
We 're not happy
The left has a message for Barack Obama : Shape up , or we ’re shipping out .
A high - profile conclave of progressives , which served as a platform for supporting Obama in years past , opened in Washington on Monday amid growing disenchantment with the president over the Gulf oil spill , health care , jobs , immigration and political deal cutting .

Liberal activists warned that Obama can no longer count on a progressive base that was supposed to protect Democrats from a mass wipeout in the midterms in 2010 and propel him to reelection in 2012 .
“ We are not apathetic , we are not depressed — we are willing to get out and fight for the people who fight for us , ” said Ilyse Hogue , MoveOn.org ’s campaign director , at the Campaign for America ’s Future annual meeting .
“ But no longer can they count on us for a solid Democratic vote .
We are getting more sophisticated to understand that not all Democrats are created equal . ”
The criticism of Obama during the lightly attended opening day was more visceral than issue specific and more in the vein of familial disapproval than open revolt .
It ’s also not clear where liberals , who helped fueled Obama ’s ascent to the presidency , might turn in 2012 if Obama is on the ballot .
But the left 's lack of enthusiasm for its representation in Washington — the " enthusiasm gap " between dispirited liberals and hyperenergized conservatives — is palpable and poses a real danger to Obama and his congressional allies , said veteran progressive Robert Borosage , who organized the conference .
“ We have the energy and the willingness to mobilize ; we can be a huge ally or a huge obstruction , ” he warned .
“ No president wants trouble in the base , and Obama does n’t want trouble in his base . ”
Sterling Newberry , an economist and consultant who has attended the event for years , said the mood of the left could be read by the several dozen empty chairs in the ballroom during the opening session of the conference .
“ It was n’t always like this , ” he said of the turnout .
“ The Republicans out of power are fired up to vote , and the Democrats who are in power are de-motivated . ”
The White House said Obama has worked hard to achieve the goals of his progressive agenda , especially health reform .
“ During his first 500 days in office , President Obama has fulfilled his commitment to bring the change we need to Washington by signing historic health care reform legislation that will reduce costs for millions of families and small businesses , implementing education reforms that will lay the foundation for our nation ’s long - term economic strength and reducing the influence of special interests that has changed business as usual in Washington , ” said White House spokesman Joshua Earnest .
Obama took a bit of beating at the conference last year – after it was renamed “ America 's Future Now ” from the catchier , pre-Obama “ Take Back America ” – for his early compromises on health care .
His aides have always viewed the conference with some ambivalence , considering its leadership as more aligned with red-meat populists like Howard Dean and John Edwards .
But Obama got the hero ’s welcome during appearances in 2006 and 2007 , when he bashed Bush , reveled in a long standing ovations and delivered a speeches not too dissimilar from the red-meat addresses delivered on Monday .
“ These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything 's possible - they just do n't think their leaders do , ” Obama said in 2006 .
“ These are Americans who still dream big dreams - they just sense their leaders have forgotten how . ”
Answers for solving the problem were in shorter supply :
Those in attendance said there was n't a magic solution but demanded progress on ending the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and proof that Obama was willing to expend political capital to pass immigration reform despite dim hopes of passage on the Hill .
And like Obama ’s critics on the right , many progressives seized on the administration ’s response to the Gulf oil spill to vent their larger frustrations .
“ We thought that an election was victory .
We forgot that candidates do n’t deliver change , that they become part of the system , ” said Phaedra Ellis - Lamkins of Green for All , a progressive environmental group that opposes Obama ’s loosening of offshore oil exploration restrictions .
“ While I voted for Barack Obama and I would again , he is not enough and we [ need to ] push him and say that his handling of BP is atrocious at best , ” she said to applause at the Omni Shoreham Hotel .
“ I believe in the president , but I believe in the needs of the people of the Gulf more .
... I believe in holding people accountable , even people we love . ”
Despite the subcapacity attendance on the first day , the event , sponsored by unions and progressive groups , is still a big draw to liberals , with planned Tuesday appearances by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean .
Former SEIU President Andy Stern , a major Obama supporter who serves on his deficit reduction commission , cast the conflict in slightly different terms , saying the left needed to provide “ the wind ” in Obama ’s sails — to propel his agenda leftward .
Arianna Huffington , founder of The Huffington Post , said most of Obama ’s problems stem from Obama ’s quest for bipartisanship with Republicans on almost every issue , including offshore oil drilling .
“ Bipartisanship is not the way to find American change .
So far bipartisanship has brought us a no-strings - attached bailout .
It has brought us the freedom from the burden of an affordable public option [ in health care reform ] .
It has also brought us an ongoing war in Afghanistan , … and every day we see more penguins and dolphins covered in bipartisanship , ” she said .
Huffington said she still backs Obama but called for “ Change 2.0 . ”
All presidents grapple with satisfying their base : George W. Bush ’s political team , led by Karl Rove , spent much of its time quelling potential revolts from the religious right , whose leaders accused the White House of slow - walking its anti-abortion and pro-school - prayer agenda .
With white independents deserting in droves , Obama and Democrats desperately need the party ’s fractious core of liberal supporters .
Recent polls show that progressives are far less willing to turn out to back Democrats this year — and far less energized than the GOP base and conservative tea party activists .
Obama ’s relationship with the left took a big hit on health care reform when the administration agreed to major deals with drug companies and signed off on a deal to strip the public option from the Senate bill .
And the left also was rankled by administration efforts to stop progressive Rep. Joe Sestak ( D - Pa. ) from challenging Obama ’s hand - picked candidate , Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa . ) .
Obama ’s decision to back Sen. Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) , however anemically , against Lt. Gov. Bill Halter in the Democratic primary has pitted him against Big Labor .
Halter supporter Markos Moulitsas , founder of the Daily Kos blog , never called out Obama by name but said that a Lincoln loss would send a message to the D.C. establishment .
“ We ’re going to take out Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas , ” said Moulitsas .
“ It ’s an unprecedented alliance between netroots labor and the environmental movement … to realize that we have to hold people in D.C. accountable .
...
They are immune to reason , they are immune to public opinion .
...
They are not immune to losing elections , and that ’s where it hurts . ”
But even Moulitsas acknowledged the difficulty in getting progressives to speak with one voice on the issues .
He suggested that Democrats , like Republicans -- and Obama circa '08 -- stress broader principles and eschew specific policy platforms :
“ What you get is irrelevant and scary to the American people .
...
If we ’re talking to people , the less details the better . ”

The team has nearly reached the peak of Chalon Sombrero
Slowly but surely an extinct glacier in a remote corner of the Peruvian Andes is being returned to its former colour , not by falling snow or regenerated ice sheets , but by whitewash .
It is the first experimental step in an innovative plan to recuperate Peru 's disappearing Andean glaciers .
But there is debate between those who dismiss the idea as just plain daft and those who think it could be a simple but brilliant solution , or at least one which should be put to the test .
The World Bank clearly believes the idea - the brainchild of 55 - year - old Peruvian inventor , Eduardo Gold - has merit as it was one of the 26 winners from around 1,700 submissions in the " 100 Ideas to Save the Planet " competition at the end of 2009 .
Mr Gold , who has no scientific qualifications but has studiously read up on glaciology , is enthused that the time has come to put his theory into practice .
Although he is yet to receive the $ 200,000 ( £ 135,000 ) awarded by the World Bank , his pilot project is already underway on the Chalon Sombrero peak , 4,756 metres above sea level , in an area some 100 km west of the regional capital of Ayacucho .
The area has long been denuded of its snowy , white peaks .
Four men from Licapa , the village which lies further down the valley , don boiler suits and mix the paint from three simple and environmentally - friendly ingredients : lime , industrial egg white and water .
The mixture which has been used since Peru 's colonial times .
There are no paint brushes , the workers use jugs to splash the whitewash onto the loose rocks around the summit .
It is a laborious process but they have whitewashed two hectares in two weeks .
They plan is to paint the whole summit , then in due course , two other peaks totalling overall some 70 hectares .
' Cold generates cold '
Mr Gold may not be a scientist but his idea is based on the simple scientific principle that when sunlight is reflected off a white or light - coloured surface , solar energy passes back through the atmosphere and out into space , rather than warming the Earth 's surface .
The US Energy Secretary , Steven Chu , has endorsed a similar idea using white roofs in the United States - possibly more pragmatic than painting mountains .
Changing the albedo ( a measure of how strongly an object reflects light ) of the rock surface , would bring about a cooling of the peak 's surface , says Mr Gold , which in turn would generate a cold micro-climate around the peak .
Image caption Real snow on Chalon Sombrero - not paint
" Cold generates more cold , just as heat generates more heat , " says Mr Gold .
" I am hopeful that we could re-grow a glacier here because we would be recreating all the climatic conditions necessary for a glacier to form . "
The 900 - strong population of Licapa , the village which depends on Chalon Sombrero for its water supply , did not think twice about accepting Mr Gold 's proposal and the funding it would bring .
" When I was around 15 - 20 years old , Chalon Sombrero was a big glacier , all white , then little by little it started to melt , " says 65 - year - old Pablo Parco , who is one of the project 's supporters .
" Forty years on and the river 's never been lower , the nights are very cold and the days are unbearably hot .
It was n't like this when I was growing up ... it was always bearable .
" So we 're happy to see this project to paint the mountain .
I can tell you this morning there was snow on the ground , something we rarely see .
" Up here we live from our animals , up here there 's no work , there 's no crops , when there 's less water , there 's less pasture and that means less livestock . "
Finding solutions
In Peru , home to more than 70 % of the world 's tropical glaciers , global warming has already melted away 22 % of them in the last 30 years , according to a World Bank report of 2009 .
Image caption Pablo Parco remembers when there was a glacier where he 's sitting
The remaining glaciers could disappear in 20 years if measures are not taken to mitigate climate change , it adds .
The impact would go way beyond Andean communities , with dramatic consequences for the water supply on Peru 's populous coast and hydroelectric power .
In May , Peru 's environment minister , Antonio Brack , said Peru would need $ 400 m a year to mitigate climate change .
He is one of the sceptics who is not prepared to give Mr Gold 's idea the benefit of the doubt .
" I think there are much more interesting projects which would have more impact in mitigating climate change and that 's where this money should be invested , " he told the BBC .
But the ministry 's climate change chief , Eduardo Durand has said : " Every innovative idea has the right to be heard " and has given the pilot project the green light .
" On a local scale , it might have an impact , it might change a trend , improve things a little , " says Thomas Condom , a glaciologist and hydrologist working at the French Institute for Research and Development , which has been monitoring tropical glaciers in the Andes for the past 15 years .
" But the impact is bound to remain local , it is not going to reverse or stop a trend on the scale of a whole region .
It would be very difficult to do something similar on a very big scale in the Andes . "
A report by the UK's Royal Society in 2009 said the technology of " geo-engineering " projects was still " barely formed " and governments should continue to focus on cutting carbon emissions .
But if Mr Gold 's pilot project proves successful in pushing down the temperature , he envisages expanding it to Peru 's most threatened glacial regions on a large scale .
" I 'd rather try and fail to find a solution than start working out how we are going to survive without the glaciers , as if the situation was irreversible , " he says .
-- Chicago forward Adam Burish said before Game 2 that the best way to rattle Vancouver goaltender Roberto Luongo was to run him or to spray snow in his face .
True to his word , he and Ben Eager sprayed enough snow on Luongo after a first - period whistle to make a snow blower jealous .
Whether the tactic of driving the net and getting under Luongo 's skin worked or not , the Blackhawks came away with a 4 - 2 victory to even their best - of - 7 series at one win apiece -- and the Canucks came away upset with the tactics that resulted in their goaltender getting knocked down on more than one occasion .
Defenseman Shane O'Brien spoke Tuesday afternoon at GM
Place about the bumping and spraying of Luongo , and he did n't hold back with his disgust over the entire situation .
" I'm only speaking for myself here , but I think we 're being a little too soft on them definitely in front of the net , " O'Brien said .
" The refs seem to be letting them do whatever they want to Lu .
Their guys are going hard to the net and snowing him and bumping and slashing him .
So we need to do better job of getting in front of him .
We have to play a lot grittier and a lot meaner .
" The Blackhawks controlled the play in Game 2 after falling behind 2 - 0 in the first 5:02 of the game .
But O'Brien was far more concerned with the Canucks ' intensity and how tough it is to toe the line between turning the other cheek and letting another team push them around .
" I was upset more with the way we did n't respond back physically and emotionally , " O'Brien said .
" There 's been a lot of talk of the fine line of not scrumming it up and this and that .
But at the end of the day , we 're playing for the Stanley Cup here .
You got to push back and show them that you want it .
Whistle to whistle , we have to be a lot meaner and a lot grittier .
They put their meat in the lineup last game and they did their job .
" That " meat " -- Eager , Burish and Andrew Ladd -- was grilling Luongo all night in Game 2 .
Besides the spraying , Eager gave Luongo a shot to the head after he left his crease to gather the puck .
How hard is it for O'Brien to keep his cool when he sees that sort of thing ?
"
It 's very tough , " he admitted .
" I talked to Lui and he said that stuff does n't bother him .
He 's our captain and he's our leader , so if he says it 's not bothering him , it 's not bothering him .
I 'm having a hard time with some of the stuff they 're doing , but we 're all a team here and we got a game plan and we 're going to stick to it .
" I do n't like any of it to be honest with you .
They 're not calling it right now and obviously they 're going to do whatever they can to get in Lui 's face .
Lui 's playing pretty good right now , so you have to get them credit .
That 's their job .
That 's Ladd 's job , that 's Eager 's job , that 's Burish 's job .
"
O'Brien did n't put a bounty on Blackhawks goalie Antti Niemi or make any threats the way Burish did before Game 2 , but he said some sort of reciprocation might be necessary of the Blackhawks continue to take liberties with Luongo .
"
If the refs are going to let it go , we 're going to have to do what we can to get in ( Niemi's ) face down there , " O'Brien said .
" We have to be as tough as we can on him because right now they 're letting them go to the net and get their bumps and whacks in . "
Blind people think about manipulating tools in the same regions of the brain as do people who can see , according to a new study .
The researchers say this adds to evidence that the brain has a fairly defined organization , while still being able to adapt to unusual conditions , such as not having any vision .
When you look at a glass in front of you on the desk , it sets off a lot of reactions in your brain .
Part of your brain categorizes it : " That 's a glass ! "
Another part of the brain thinks about the glass 's shape and size , its exact location , and what you would have to do with your hand and arm if you were going to reach out and grab it .
All that activity goes on even if you just look at the glass .
This is a complicated set of thoughts , linking visual information and motor control .

Mahon , Jens Schwarzbach , and Alfonso Caramazza of the University of Trento in Italy investigated the first part -- categorizing the item -- and found that blind people did this in the same part of the brain as people with vision , even though it seems on the surface to be linked directly to visual information .
For the new study , the researchers wanted to see if the same was true of the second part -- thinking about how to manipulate the object .
To do that , they scanned the brains of blind and sighted volunteers while they thought about tools and other objects .
Each person laid in an MRI scanner while they heard a set of words from a category -- either tools , like saw , scissors , and fork ; animals , like butterfly , turtle , and cat ; and objects you do n't manipulate , like bed , fence , and table .
Functional MRI scanning showed which parts of the brain are active when the volunteer heard each word .
Blind people , even people who were born blind , tended to think about a tool in the same part of the brain as a sighted person .
And , like visual people , a non - tool like a cat or a fence generally did n't spark those same regions of the brain .
" I think the exciting implication is that the way that our brains process the world may be less dependent on our experience than previously thought , " says Mahon .
" It does n't mean experience is not important .
Experience is critical for providing all of the content that we represent about the world .
But how that content is organized in our brain seems to be highly constrained , and the interesting possibility is that those constraints are built in by genetics . "
The research is published in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science .
The article is titled , " The Representation of Tools in Left Parietal Cortex Is Independent of Visual Experience . "
Belgium 's Planckendael Zoo is proud to announce the debut of Laila , the first Snow Leopard cub ever to be born in the country .
A short while after her birth in April , Laila 's mother Maili 's health declined rapidly and , sadly , she did not survive .
Planckendael keepers stepped in and have raised the orphaned cub by hand .
It is believed that only between 4,000 and 6,000 Snow Leopards remain in the wild .
Laila represents an invaluable new bloodline for the European Snow Leopard Breeding Program .

Researchers from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science have unveiled a new class of reverse - osmosis membranes for desalination that resist the clogging which typically occurs when seawater , brackish water and waste water are purified .
The highly permeable , surface - structured membrane can easily be incorporated into today 's commercial production system , the researchers say , and could help to significantly reduce desalination operating costs .
Their findings appear in the current issue of the Journal of Materials Chemistry .
Reverse - osmosis ( RO ) desalination uses high pressure to force polluted water through the pores of a membrane .
While water molecules pass through the pores , mineral salt ions , bacteria and other impurities cannot .
Over time , these particles build up on the membrane 's surface , leading to clogging and membrane damage .
This scaling and fouling places higher energy demands on the pumping system and necessitates costly cleanup and membrane replacement .
The new UCLA membrane 's novel surface topography and chemistry allow it to avoid such drawbacks .
" Besides possessing high water permeability , the new membrane also shows high rejection characteristics and long - term stability , " said Nancy H. Lin , a UCLA Engineering senior researcher and the study 's lead author .
" Structuring the membrane surface does not require a long reaction time , high reaction temperature or the use of a vacuum chamber .
The anti-scaling property , which can increase membrane life and decrease operational costs , is superior to existing commercial membranes . "
The new membrane was synthesized through a three - step process .
First , researchers synthesized a polyamide thin - film composite membrane using conventional interfacial polymerization .
Next , they activated the polyamide surface with atmospheric pressure plasma to create active sites on the surface .
Finally , these active sites were used to initiate a graft polymerization reaction with a monomer solution to create a polymer " brush layer " on the polyamide surface .
This graft polymerization is carried out for a specific period of time at a specific temperature in order to control the brush layer thickness and topography .

" In the early years , surface plasma treatment could only be accomplished in a vacuum chamber , " said Yoram Cohen , UCLA professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and a corresponding author of the study .
" It was n't practical for large - scale commercialization because thousands of meters of membranes could not be synthesized in a vacuum chamber .
It 's too costly .
But now , with the advent of atmospheric pressure plasma , we do n't even need to initiate the reaction chemically .
It 's as simple as brushing the surface with plasma , and it can be done for almost any surface . "
In this new membrane , the polymer chains of the tethered brush layer are in constant motion .
The chains are chemically anchored to the surface and are thus more thermally stable , relative to physically coated polymer films .
Water flow also adds to the brush layer 's movement , making it extremely difficult for bacteria and other colloidal matter to anchor to the surface of the membrane .
" If you 've ever snorkeled , you 'll know that sea kelp move back and forth with the current or water flow , " Cohen said .
" So imagine that you have this varied structure with continuous movement .
Protein or bacteria need to be able to anchor to multiple spots on the membrane to attach themselves to the surface -- a task which is extremely difficult to attain due to the constant motion of the brush layer .
The polymer chains protect and screen the membrane surface underneath . "
Another factor in preventing adhesion is the surface charge of the membrane .
Cohen 's team is able to choose the chemistry of the brush layer to impart the desired surface charge , enabling the membrane to repel molecules of an opposite charge .
The team 's next step is to expand the membrane synthesis into a much larger , continuous process and to optimize the new membrane 's performance for different water sources .

" We want to be able to narrow down and create a membrane selection system for different water sources that have different fouling tendencies , " Lin said .
" With such knowledge , one can optimize the membrane surface properties with different polymer brush layers to delay or prevent the onset of membrane fouling and scaling .
" The cost of desalination will therefore decrease when we reduce the cost of chemicals [ used for membrane cleaning ] , as well as process operation [ for membrane replacement ] .
Desalination can become more economical and used as a viable alternate water resource . "
Cohen 's team , in collaboration with the UCLA Water Technology Research ( WaTeR ) Center , is currently carrying out specific studies to test the performance of the new membrane 's fouling properties under field conditions .
" We work directly with industry and water agencies on everything that we 're doing here in water technology , " Cohen said .
" The reason for this is simple :
If we are to accelerate the transfer of knowledge technology from the university to the real world , where those solutions are needed , we have to make sure we address the real issues .
This also provides our students with a tremendous opportunity to work with industry , government and local agencies . "
A paper providing a preliminary introduction to the new membrane also appeared in the Journal of Membrane Science last month .
Outgoing newspaper editor Sean Cudahy and incoming editor Ellie Leech learned the limits of student free speech after an offending editorial .

In Texas , a high school newspaper 's last issue was pulled because of an editorial advocating legalization of marijuana .
In Fredericksburg , the Massaponax High yearbook was reprinted because of anonymous confessions of sex and drug use .
And even in the land of Jefferson , Albemarle High School has pulled the last issue of its student newspaper .
The controversy ?
An editorial suggesting cost - saving changes to the state 's physical education requirements and letting student athletes opt out of P.E. classes .
" The reason they decided not to let us publish was because they felt it would be disruptive to physical education classes , " says Sean Cudahy , outgoing editor - in - chief of The Revolution whose last issue was scheduled to come out May 20 .
" The principal grabbed one , " says Cudahy , " showed it to the P.E. teachers , and they did n't like it .
Cudahy , citing the 1988 student newspaper case , Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier , says that administrators can censor publications due to " legitimate pedagogical concerns , " says Cudahy .
What he does n't understand is how an editorial questioning the curriculum could be considered disruptive .
And to make sure he understood Hazelwood , he called the Student Press Law Center , and spoke to attorney Adam Goldstein , who 's worked at the center since 2003 and says he 's seen thousands of student censorship cases .
" This has got to be one of the goofiest I 've ever seen– - it 's not even controversial , " says Goldstein .
" Nobody thinks making the star quarterback play dodgeball teaches them a damn thing . "
The Revolution 's adviser , Kim Aust , says there were a lot of reasons behind her decision to pull the issue , including the principal 's offer to reprint without the alleged offending editorial .
She also notes typographical errors in the story , including a misspelling in the headline : " Students ' P.E. groans might be warrented . "
" If I have to go to court about a story , I 'm not going with one that has misspelled words , " she says .
Cudahy confirms that there were typos that he , as editor , was responsible for , but says , " When I was in that meeting , that was n't the reason for holding the issue . "
And Aust concurs .
" It was a disruption to the educational process , " says Aust , " not because of the students but a huge disruption to the P.E. teachers .
They came up yelling at me .
They emailed .
They said they were n't going to be able to conduct class . "
Aust suggests the P.E. teachers had a litany of complaints about the editorial , and pointed out that if it appeared in the last issue of the year , then they would n't have an opportunity to respond .
That 's why she decided to pull the editorial and run a news article in August on the topic , and she says she already has student reporters working on that .
Principal Jay Thomas left the decision to pull the editorial to Aust , but clearly favored that decision .
" He asked me repeatedly to not distribute it , " says Aust .
" The results were not going to be good .
It was the P.E. teachers .
They were very upset . "
And she calls the censored editorial " a good learning experience " for the student journalists .
The head of the Albemarle P.E. department , Terry Midolo , did not respond to phone calls from the Hook .
" I am sorry the P.E. teachers found it offensive , " says the article 's author who is also the incoming editor - in - chief , Ellie Leech .
" The fact is , it was an editorial , " says Leech .
" It was my opinion . "
And she thinks calling the editorial a " disruption " goes too far .
" If I 'd called for quitting P.E. or made a personal attack , that would be called for , but I did n't and I would n't . "
Leech recalls her first year of journalism class , and learning about student rights , and that articles had to be a " material disruption " to be censorship - worthy .
" I do think my rights were violated , " she says .
John Whitehead , founder of the Rutherford Institute , agrees , and says the axing of the editorial " tips the line on viewpoint discrimination , " which he says the Supreme Court has ruled a no - no .
" This stifles free speech , stifles creativity , and promotes conformity , " he says .
And if school policy is that you can't criticize curriculum or the school or teachers , says Whitehead , it has to be a written policy .
" This is censorship , " he reiterates .
" This is a government institution .
You'd think they 'd want to uphold free speech . "
" If you ask do we censor student opinion , " says Principal Thomas , " no , because I value the input of students . "
And he insists that Aust did the right thing in pulling the paper .
" Her job as adviser is to maintain the quality of the publication and standards and to better address issues . "
" It 's a tough line for a newspaper adviser to follow , " says Albemarle schools spokeswoman Maury Brown , who notes that the multiple typographical errors " did n't reflect well on the paper . "
Brown describes the incident as " a lesson where students can see the power of the media . "
Cudahy , who is going to American University to study journalism , and Leech have posted the editorial on Facebook .
And both students speak favorably of their adviser and school principal , despite their disappointment in the decision .
" As a newspaper , it 's not our job to be cheerleaders and make everyone happy , " says Leech .
" Our job is to be fair and balanced , to inform and entertain .
The school newspaper is an important component of student experience . "
“ Among all the swirl of different ideas of how to raise the money and how to regulate carbon , ” he said , “ there is no way either in this country or internationally you ’re going to come close to meeting an 80 percent reduction unless you have an immense breakthrough . ”

He said that the only way to find such disruptive new technology was to pour large sums of money at the problem , with the clear understanding that any number of ventures would fail before the eureka moment arrived .
Mr. Gates and his fellow executives are stepping forward at what may prove a pivotal moment in American energy policy .
Oil continues to spew from a crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico , the Obama administration is pushing for a new approach to energy and climate policy and the Senate is about to embark on a debate on a set of conflicting proposals that pit not only Republicans against Democrats but different regions of the country against each other .
There is no assurance that this latest effort will produce new ideas or bear fruit .
The executive group , which calls itself the American Energy Innovation Council , will propose a series of measures that it hopes will transcend the politics of the moment and put the nation on a path to a different energy future .
The group notes that the federal government spends less than $ 5 billion a year on energy research and development , not counting one - time stimulus projects .
About $ 30 billion is spent annually on health research and more than $ 80 billion on military R.& D.
They advocate a jump in spending on basic energy research because the private sector cannot provide that level of capital for unproven technologies , but do not say where the new money can be found .
Bill O'Reilly slanders 82nd Airborne
So why did Bill O'Reilly slander these men ?
Fox and O'Reilly : 82nd like Nazis
by miholo [ Subscribe ] From Crooks and Liars .
There was an exchange on Fox News last night between Bill O'Reilly and Wes Clark .
The issue was the release of further Abu Ghraib pictures and video .
O'Reilly was incensed that it " puts our troops at risk " .
Clark responded that what 's putting the troops at risk is the chain of command letting , or even making , this happen in the first place .
O'Lielly was saying that it happens just like this in every war , with Clark rebutting that those were isolated incidents which were court - martialed .
And then , this :
Clark :
And let me explain something .
You go all the way up the chain of command ...
And let me explain something .
You go all the way up the chain of command ...
O'Reilly : General !
You need to look at the Malmedy massacre in World War Two , and the 82nd Airborne who did it !
Video of the exchange here .
The Malmedy massacre ?
Well , about that on the flip ...
From the Wikipedia :
On December 17 , 1944 , near the hamlet of Baugnez on the height half - way between the town of Malmédy and Ligneuville in Belgium , elements of Waffen - SS Kampfgruppe Peiper encountered the American 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion .
After a brief battle , the Americans surrendered .
About 150 of the prisoners of war were disarmed and sent to stand in a field near the crossroads .
Peiper and his leading armoured units then continued their advance .

Peiper and his leading armoured units then continued their advance .
A tank pulled up , and a truck shortly thereafter .
A single SS officer pulled out a pistol and shot a medical officer standing in the front row , and then shot the man standing next to the medical officer .
Other soldiers joined in with machine guns .
It is not known why this happened ; there is no record of an order by an SS officer .
While the shooting of POWs was common on the Eastern front , such incidents were rare on the Western front .
Another good account : History Net ( w/ thanks to AaronBa ) .
Why do Bill O'Reilly and Fox News believe that American troops used to behave , and ought to behave now , like Nazis ?
Well , it 's nice to see him pick up where Joe McCarthy left off up .
But somehow she neglects to mention McCarthy 's first moment in the national spotlight .
That was his infamous 1949 campaign on behalf of Nazi S.S. officers who were convicted of war crimes for the massacre of American troops in the town of Malmedy during the Battle of the Bulge .
On their orders , 83 American prisoners of war had been murdered by Waffen S.S. machine - gunners .
The S.S. officers were sentenced to death , but McCarthy insisted that the entire case was a frame - up , with confessions obtained by horrific torture .
He intervened in Senate hearings on the case and lied repeatedly during his defense of the Nazi murderers .
His most spectacular claim was that the American investigators had crushed the testicles of German prisoners as an interrogation technique .
McCarthy was later shown to have served as the pawn of neo -Nazi and communist provocateurs who were using the Malmedy case to whip up anti-American sentiment in postwar Germany .
The main source for his false charges concerning Malmedy was a Germany lawyer named Rudolf Aschenauer , whose closest ties were to the postwar Nazi underground and to American right - wing isolationists , but who has also been identified as a communist agent .
Aschenauer testified at U.S. Senate hearings in Germany that he had passed information about Malmedy to McCarthy .
The S.S. officers were guilty , as the Senate report confirmed -- although most of them later got their death sentences commuted in a gesture to former Nazi officials who aided the West in the Cold War .
But McCarthy had succeeded in his larger purpose , winning publicity for himself and casting a negative light on the war - crimes trials .
By Coulter 's loose definition , his involvement in the Malmedy incident proves that McCarthy was a " traitor . "
He lied publicly to advance totalitarian forces in Europe against American interests .
He sided with enemy forces against American soldiers .
He falsely accused American officials of crimes .
Moreover , he took up this tainted cause at least in part because of heavy financial support from an ultra- right - wing German - American businessman in Wisconsin .
He managed to help both Nazis and communists at once , a feat rarely seen since the end of the Hitler - Stalin pact
Yeah , I wrote about this on Kos two years ago .
Oddly enough , Mr. O'Reilly , in his current attack on blogs and our " secret agenda " , slandered 6,993 wounded and 1,509 dead .
You know , in all my reading of WWII and the Battle of the Bulge , I never read about how the 82nd ABN killed Americans in combat .
I mean , O'Reilly went to graduate school .
He could have searched the internet for the relevant facts .
But no , why not slander American soldiers instead .
I think if this was in the same room , Clark would have strangled him with his bare hands .
Just amazing .
