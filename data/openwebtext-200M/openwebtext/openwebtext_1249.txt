The subject of money comes up a lot , especially for those real food newbies who are not quite sure how to make the transition from a standard American diet of prepackaged , convenience foods to wholesome , real foods .
The cost of grass - fed meat , raw milk , wild - caught fish and organic vegetables can really add up over time .
Of course , our perception of the expense of food might be a bit skewed .
After all , about five decades ago , the average American family had a garden and still spent approximately 17 % of their disposable income on food in the home .
In 2010 , the average American family spent just 5.5 % of their budget on food in the home .
It seems like other expenses , consumer goods , housing and the rising cost of health care , command most of our budgets while the budget for food is simply what ’s left over at the end of the month .
That said , many of you have asked me time and time again to share a our monthly food budget .
So here it is : we typically spend $ 750 per month .
That averages to spending about $ 2.75 per person , per meal each month .
Many of you make do on less ( and we did too ) , and many of you spend much more .
I feed two adults and a six - year old who eats like two adults .
All of the animal products we purchase are grass - fed or pasture - raised , and all of the plant foods we purchase are organic .
We buy almost all of our food directly from the farms and ranches that produce them .
Most items , I make from scratch and we do n’t typically purchase convenience foods .
And if you ’re looking for more information on what to purchase and where to purchase it , definitely take the time to read this post on how to stock a traditional foods pantry .
Our Monthly Budget : $ 750
Milk and Dairy : $ 50 to $ 140 per month
Raw Milk and Cream Herd Share ( $ 90 ) : Our dairy is a seasonal dairy ; that is , all cows calve in the spring and are dried off in the autumn .
The drawback is that we do not have access to the fresh jersey milk throughout most of the fall and winter ; the benefit is , of course , that the milk we do receive is drawn when the cows are grazing on a lush and fast - growing pasture .
The result is that when we do get milk , it is of the highest quality .
We drink this milk primarily raw and I use it to make yogurt , kefir and cheese , occasionally .
When we ’re not receiving milk , I save the money we would have spent for bulk purchases .
We typically go through 1 1/ 2 gallons of raw milk , plus 1 quart of cream each week .
Raw Goat ’s Milk Herd Share ( $ 50 ) :
We also participate in a goat ’s milk herd share which delivers raw goat ’s milk to us weekly , regardless of the season .
I ’m not particularly fond of raw goat ’s milk unless it is very fresh , and still warm from milking .
I primarily use this milk to make yogurt , kefir and cheese .
Eggs : $ 44 per month
Pasture - raised Eggs ( $ 44 ) : Each week we purchase two dozen eggs , usually through a herd share arrangement which uses Joel Salatin ’s model of moving egg - laying hens from pasture to pasture .
The resulting eggs are beautifully rich in flavor and appearance .
A dozen eggs typically runs us $ 5.50 when we purchase from our favorite farm , and $ 6.75 at the local health food store .
Other local farms offer eggs for as little as $ 4 per dozen , but do n’t follow the same method of moving hens to fresh pasture ; as a result , the hens rely less on forage for their food and more on supplementary feed .
For us , the difference in quality is worth the additional expense of $ 1.50 per dozen .
Meat : $ 165 per month
Mixed Meats ( $ 70 ) : Our local ranch offers a CSA that provides assorted meats : veal , lamb , beef , whole chickens and pork .
In addition to a variety of meats , the CSA also offers a variety of cuts : stew meat , sausages , steaks , ground meat and roasts .
Our CSA provides us with about 10 pounds of grass - fed and pasture - raised meat each month .
Currently , we have an overabundance of meat in our freezer and have halted our CSA while we consume what we already have .
Offal ( $ 25 ) :
We also participate in an offal CSA which provides us with suet and leaf lard for rendering , bones for making broth , as well as nutrient - dense organ meats like liver and heart .
This CSA provides us with a further 10 lbs of organ meats , bones and fat each month .
Chickens ( $ 80 ) : I always have a pot of perpetual soup bubbling away on my counter .
For this , I purchase one chicken a week – especially since chickens arrive in our CSA only sporadically .
I purchase pasture - raised chickens when they ’re available , and organic free - range chickens when they ’re not .
Chickens , both pasture - raised and organic , typically cost me $ 15 to $ 25 each .
Were the need arise to reconsider our food budget , I ’d drop the weekly chickens and focus exclusively on beef bone broth as beef bones are plentiful in this area .
Produce : $ 300 per month
Fresh Produce ( $ 300 ) : Our largest expense , my family relies heavily on fresh produce for the bulk of our meals .
Sauteed Greens and Garlic for breakfast , huge salads and vegetable soups at lunch , plenty of fermented vegetables , vegetable side dishes and both fresh and cooked fruit as snacks and desserts .
We earmark $ 165 each month from April to December for our vegetable CSA which provides us with vegetables .
With what ’s remaining after the CSA we purchase supplementary produce , usually fruit which is relatively scant in the CSA .
We also count seed purchases in this category since they will ultimately produce vegetables to feed us in the summer .
In the summer time , when we rely on our garden , we save a good amount of this budget and divert it to bulk purchases of grains , pulses and fish or boxes of root vegetables , fruits and winter squash which we preserve for winter use .
Dry Goods & Bulk Purchase : $ 90 to $ 150 + per month
Supplements : We take Cod Liver Oil .
It ’s not available locally , so we purchase it online ( see sources ) .
We also take dessicated liver capsules ( see sources ) , especially when I have n’t made a conscientious effort to include organ meats in my family ’s diet .
I also make an effort to give my family a therapeutic - grade probiotic like Bio- kult ( find it here ) , even though we do consume several fermented foods .
For us , this extra bit of nutritional insurance is non-negotiable .
You can read more about my take on supplements here .
I buy supplements in bulk to save money .
Grains and Pulses :
If we ’ve under - budgeted in any area , I add that money to our dry goods and bulk purchases .
I like to purchase large amounts of dry goods like coconut flour , beans and lentils , whole grains and almond flour in bulk which will typically save us 20 % to 30 % over purchasing them at retail .
I store them in mylar - lined , food - grade plastic buckets which you can purchase from many emergency supply companies online .
Sweeteners :
We do n’t consume a lot of sweeteners , and a single quart - jar of honey can last us several months .
Occasionally , I make a treat with molasses or unrefined cane sugar .
A bulk purchase for us is about five pounds which will last us a year ( or longer ) .
Wild - caught Fish : I purchase wild - caught fish online ( mostly from these folks ) .
The prices are excellent : sardines sell for as little as $ 5.88/ lb , and with a purchase of $ 250 , shipping is only $ 5 .
For that reason , we order large amounts and only purchase a few times a year .
Fats and Oils : I also purchase cooking fats like ghee and coconut oil in bulk online ( see sources ) .
Olive oil comes by the gallon .
Coconut oil comes by the bucket and ghee arrives by the case .
Healthy fats tend to be expensive , which is why we make bulk purchases – saving about 10 - 20 % over retail prices .
You can read more about the fats I stock in my kitchen and why I love them here : My Favorite Fats .
Herbs and Spices : I also serve quite a few herbal infusions and love using exotic spices in my cooking .
I purchase these in bulk online .
I like to support Mountain Rose Herbs because they carry herbs and spices I can’t find locally , use high quality sources and have reasonable prices and bulk discounts .
So I purchase all my teas , culinary herbs , medicinal herbs , and spices from them .

What is there to distinguish your intolerance from that of a religious fanatic ?
TONY REYNOLDS , By e-mail
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It would be intolerant if I advocated the banning of religion , but of course I never have .
I merely give robust expression to views about the cosmos and morality with which you happen to disagree .
You interpret that as ' intolerance ' because of the weirdly privileged status of religion , which expects to get a free ride and not have to defend itself .
If I wrote a book called The Socialist Delusion or The Monetarist Delusion , you would never use a word like intolerance .
But The God Delusion sounds automatically intolerant .
Why ?
What 's the difference ?
I have a ( you might say fanatical ) desire for people to use their own minds and make their own choices , based upon publicly available evidence .
Religious fanatics want people to switch off their own minds , ignore the evidence , and blindly follow a holy book based upon private ' revelation ' .
There is a huge difference .
You fail to make any distinction between organised religion ( which can be dangerous ) and an individual 's ' belief in God ' ( which harms no one ) .
Why do you seem incapable of separating the two ?
GARY HOWE , By e-mail
Of course I am capable of separating the two .
But whether beliefs are dangerous or harmless is not the only interesting basis for separating them .
There is also the little matter of whether they are true .
Scientists care about such things .
Terrible things have been done in the name of Christ , but all he ever taught was peace and love .
What 's wrong with that ?
CHRISTOPH ALEXANDER , London SW19
Nothing is wrong with peace and love .
It is all the more regrettable that so many of Christ 's followers seem to disagree .
I once wrote an article called " Atheists for Jesus " , ( see www.RichardDawkins.net ) and was delighted to be presented with a T - shirt bearing the slogan .
Do you consider parents forcing children to accept their religion a form of child abuse ?
JAMES MACDONALD , Bronte , New South Wales
Yes .
What would you think of parents who forced their children to accept their politics , or their taste in architecture ?
Have you ever heard anyone speak of a " Leninist child " or a " Postmodernist child " ?
Of course not .
Why , then , do we all go along with " Christian child " and " Muslim child " ?
Such labelling of children with their parents ' religion is child abuse .
Do you get a real kick out of arguing with believers ?

Does your wife ever say " Bless you " after you sneeze , just to annoy you ?
DOUG MACKENZIE DODDS , Reading
Bless you , I 'd have to be dreadfully literal - minded to be annoyed by that .
What do you take me for , one of those people who sends Christmas cards to The Archers ?
Like you , I am an atheist but could there be a place for the metaphor provided by religion - and particularly mythology - in human life ?
STEPHEN PALMER , Shrewsbury Sixth Form College
Metaphors are fine if they aid understanding , but sometimes they get in the way .
It can be better to cut straight to the real thing and bypass the metaphor altogether .
Einstein , Newton , Bacon , Kepler , Pascal , Boyle and Faraday all believed in God .
Does it bother you that such eminent scientists might not have been " deluded " ?
BEN TAYLOR , by e-mail
It was hard to be an atheist before The Origin of Species .
Einstein is the only member of your list who was born into the post - Darwinian world , and it is no accident that he was also the only one who did n't believe in God .
He declared : " It was , of course , a lie what you read about my religious convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated .
I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly . "
Do you not worry that ultimately most of humanity simply can't cope with the idea of there being no God ?
JAMES SPIERS , New York City
I hope you are wrong , because it seems a rather patronising insult to humanity .
Anyway , I think there is a higher nobility - and greater solace - in coping with what is true , even if it is frightening or painful .
See http://richarddawkins.net/
Your campaign to expose the irrationality of religious belief seems to have given y ou a higher profile than your work in evolutionary biology .
Would you rather be known as Richard Dawkins the scientist or Richard Dawkins the militant atheist ?
CLIVE ROBERTS , Rhyl
Bertrand Russell called himself the Passionate Sceptic .
It 's aiming high , but I 'll shoot for that .
How should an atheist compassionately respond to someone who says that without a belief in a spiritual afterlife he would not have been able to endure the death of a much - loved child ?
GORDON PETER DUFF , Sheffield
Compassionate doctors sometimes lie to patients about the severity of their condition , and it is not always wrong to do so .
I prefer not to follow the precedent , however .
Instead , I would point out how lucky we are to have lived at all , however briefly .
I developed the thought in the opening words of Unweaving the Rainbow , ( see www.RichardDawkins.net ) which I hope will be read at my own funeral .
What do you think happened to the body of Jesus , and how does that tally with the accounts of the resurrection ?
GRANVILLE SYKES , By e-mail
Presumably what happened to Jesus was what happens to all of us when we die .
We decompose .
Accounts of Jesus 's resurrection and ascension are about as well - documented as Jack and the Beanstalk .
Our pub quiz team is named The Church of Richard Dawkins .
At a recent Oxford quiz night , we were told to change our name in case it was deemed offensive to any churchgoers present .
Have you any suggestions for a " less offensive " name ?
RICHARD O SMITH , Oxford
And they call me intolerant !
I am shocked that this happened in Oxford , of all places .
I hope you win the tournament so resoundingly that you can dictate terms and call yourselves whatever you like .
" Offensive " my foot .
Are people who advocate intelligent design stupid , and do you think natural selection will operate to remove them from future generations ?
ADAM KHAN , The Hague , Netherlands
The majority are ignorant , which is not the same thing as stupid .
Natural selection will not remove ignorance from future generations .
Education may , and that is the hope to which we must cling .
Mary Midgley , the philosopher , has taken you to task for using words such as " selfish " to describe the unconscious entity of the gene .
Has she a point and is there still personal bitterness between the two of you ?
DECLAN ELLIS , Cambridge
Oh yes , what a good point .
And how about physicists talking about quarks as having " charm " ?
Is n't that terrible ?
Or doctors talking about an " aggressive " cancer ?
Or economists talking about the European monetary " snake " ?
I dealt with Mary Midgley in an article called " In Defence of Selfish Genes " in the same journal that published her unprovoked attack .
For the text , see www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org
Why have you not engaged in public debate with Alister McGrath , Mary Midgley , Michael Ruse , Keith Ward , or indeed anyone else who would present you with a serious challenge ?
JAMES RADFORD , By e-mail
The producers of my Channel 4 documentary [ Root of All Evil ? ] invited the Archbishop of Canterbury , the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster and the Chief Rabbi to be interviewed by me .
All declined , doubtless for good reasons .
I do n't enjoy the debate format , but I once had a public debate with the then Archbishop of York , and The Observer quoted the verdict of one disconsolate clergyman as he left the hall : " That was easy to sum up - Lions 10 , Christians nil . "
Should men submit to their selfish genes , dump their wives and go for younger , blonder models ?
CAROLYN SANCHEZ , Manchester
No .
We gave up submitting to our selfish genes long ago , when we took up clothes , contraceptives , sonnets , cubism , astronomy , snooker , bungee - jumping and other things that our selfish genes would at best consider a waste of time .
Scientific facts about the world do not translate into moral " shoulds " .
I have huge respect for you as an evolutionary biologist and free thinker but my admiration was greatly enhanced when I discovered you were married to the fabulous Lalla Ward .
Forgive me , but has she still got that fetching sailor suit she wore on Doctor Who ?
STEVE DODDING , Peterborough
Alas , no , it has gone to the great wardrobe mistress in the sky .
But Lalla does n't need a costume to fetch me .
You have been an incredible force in popularising Darwinism .
What original research would you like to be remembered for ?
IRENE TAL , Cambridge
The Extended Phenotype , although you could say it 's philosophical rather than scientific research .
How did a science geek like you get such an attractive wife ?
GARY HAMMOND , London
I suggest you go to " The Sexiest Man Living " at salon.com and eat your words .
But seriously ( of course you knew there had to be a " but seriously " ) , science has an image problem with young people , and phrases like " science geek " do n't help .
Is n't it a bit like " kraut " or " dago " ?
You backed an anti-war candidate in the last election .
Would you be happier if Saddam Hussein were still in power ?
ANTHONY SHEEN , Macclesfield
Oh , how silly of me .
You see , I had this foolish memory that Saddam Hussein was given an ultimatum on the eve of war that if he surrendered his weapons of mass destruction war would be averted .
Silly me , I thought that meant the purpose of the war was to remove his WMD .
Oh , so now I understand .
All along , the purpose of the war to to remove Saddam Hussein .
Oh , I see ( copyright : J Cleese ) .
Now the Taliban are coming back to power , because Bush and Blair took their eye off Afghanistan and charged into Iraq instead .
You know , horrible as Saddam Hussein was , I believe I 'd rather have him than the Taliban .
Last week in Afghanistan , a teacher was disembowelled and torn to pieces by four motorbikes pulling in opposite directions , for the religious crime of teaching girls algebra .
I do n't think even Saddam Hussein executed people for teaching girls algebra .
Is global warming a threat to the human species ?
ROBIN THOMPSON , Oxford
Yes .
You could say that the human species is a threat to the human species .
I recommend Al Gore 's film on global warming .
See it and weep .
Not just for the human species .
Weep for what we could have had in 2000 , but for the vote - rigging in Jeb Bush 's Florida .
I salute your courage in questioning Christianity , but what do you do on Christmas Day when everyone is celebrating ?
I presume you do not send or receive cards or give / receive presents .
BRENDA EVANS , Dorset
Why do you presume that ?
Do you seriously imagine that all - or even a majority of - the people who send cards and presents are followers of Jesus ?
Why , even the music we have to endure in shops is usually " White Christmas " , " Rudolph the Red- Nosed Reindeer " , and the nauseating " Jingle Bells " .
What 's religious about that ?
If you died and arrived at the gates of Heaven , what would you say to God to justify your lifelong atheism ?
VALERIE JACKSON , Richmond
I 'd quote Bertrand Russell : " Not enough evidence , God , not enough evidence . "
But why is God assumed to care so much about whether you believe in him ?
Maybe he wants you to be generous , kind , loving , and honest - and never mind what you believe .
You ask the questions

LastGraph is now closed .
Thank you all so much for using LastGraph for these past seven years - it 's been great , and I 'm glad so many of you have made so many lovely graphs .
I only hope that I can make one of my future visualisations this popular and long - lasting .
Why is it closed ?
The last . fm API has stopped returning data and now just returns errors , and without it the website will no longer function .
Will it ever come back ?
Perhaps if the API is ever fixed , but it's also probably just time that it was retired ; people have moved on from last .fm .
What about using Spotify / Rdio/etc .?
If these services had an API to retrieve what music you 'd played , and if I had free time , then perhaps - alas , neither is the case .
Can I get the code ?
I 've open - sourced the code on GitHub - if you 're interested in how it worked , go take a look .
I 'm not able to help anyone out with running their own copy , though , as you 'd need to port it off the last .
fm API .
If you have further questions , you can always contact me , or just peruse my blog .

Thanks to everyone who visited !
Cnet reported today that Nintendo has made the Internet Channel free again for all Wii owners .
The Internet Channel , which has n't been free since June 2007 , has since cost new adopters 500 Wii Points to download .
This change is likely part of an effort to help more Wii owners get their consoles online , noting in a press release , " Effective immediately , people who want to browse the Internet using their Wii consoles will be able to do so at no added cost . "
Those that have paid for the Internet Channel will be reimbursed in the form of a free download .
Sadly , that free download wo n't come until October : " Starting at the end of October , consumers who have previously exchanged 500 Wii Points to download the Internet Channel will be able to download , at no cost , one NES game of their choice valued at 500 Wii Points from Virtual Console . "
Look at that !
Nintendo is working on getting Wii owners online and downloading Virtual Console titles .
Smart move , Nintendo .
Flash update
Also according to Cnet , the Internet Channel received a code update as well , with newly added support for Adobe Flash Lite 3.1 .
According to Adobe 's site , " Adobe Flash Lite® 3 is a highly optimized implementation of the Flash runtime for mobile phones , consumer electronic devices , and Internet - connected digital home devices . "
Looking at the feature set of Flash Lite 3.1 compared to what was previously available on the Internet Channel ( which had Flash 7 ) , one big change stands out : Flash 8 , and even partial Flash 9 support for files developed in ActionScript 2.0 instead of 3.0 .
Other improvements include faster performance , complex language support ( Thai , Arabic , Hebrew , etc. ) , high quality video , and more .
However , not everything is supported in Flash Lite 3.1 ; you wo n't be seeing extra graphical effects like realtime blurring and drop shadows , image blending filters , and advanced video streaming .
But from the looks of it , performance should be increased all around , and hopefully some less - accessible games and Flash pages will be available for use on the Wii .
We 'll report back on more Internet Channel changes .
Is there anything you are noticing that is now available on the channel to use ?
Every time a new release of Ubuntu is out , Canonical servers get pounded and the download speed for regular updates as well as new release upgrades falls into the two - digit zone .
At that speed , a new release download , which can easily go over 1GB , will take a full day .
When Karmic RC was released last week , I could n't download anything at more than 50 KB /s .
No reason to panic though , there are many Ubuntu mirrors out there that are not very well known but can deliver much higher speeds than the overloaded us.archive.ubuntu.com .
The full list of mirrors is available on ubuntu.com .
The easiest way
There is a good description of the easiest way at addictivetips.com .
It 's a perfectly fine method .
Be careful about the automatic test that tries to figure out what the fastest mirror is : in my case , the fastest it found was 12000 kms away from where I live .
The manual way
You can also change the settings by hand , you have to edit /etc/apt/ sources .
list ( make sure to create a copy of the original first ) and replace every occurrence of us.archive.ubuntu.com by the mirror hostname you chose , optionally followed by a path prefix like " pub " .
I picked the Argonne National Laboratory mirror and the string I used was " mirror.anl.gov / pub " .
So for example you change every occurrence of
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
karmic main restricted
deb http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu/
karmic main restricted
by
At this point you can start the update tool of your choice : aptitude , apt - get , update - manager .
All packages will be downloaded from the mirror .
When updating a desktop to Karmic from home today , I got a steady download speed of about 320 K Bytes / s which is the most I can get from my ATT DSL line .
And from my workplace I got 3 MBytes /s downloads !
Be aware that mirrors can sometimes be lagging and when that happens you may not get your updates exactly at the same time they are published on Canonical servers .
You can check the " freshness " of the mirror by downloading the SYNC_STAMP .
txt file .
For example : http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu/SYNC_STAMP.txt
Happy Karmic upgrade !
Ich nehme mir die Gelben Seiten und schreibe mir eine Adresse auf .
Nein , ich nehme doch gleich die ganze Seite und lege sie auf den
Fotokopierer .
Ach was , ich nehme das ganze Telefonbuch , kopiere es
einmal und gehe damit zu Dumrath & Fassnacht , dem Verleger und
erpresse ihn .
Gebt mir
Geld und ich überlasse euch , nein , nicht die
gesamten Fotokopien , sondern meinen Fotokopierer , den ich mir gerade
selbst gebastelt habe .
Es handelt sich hier um Daten , die jeder Teilnehmer freiwillig ,
wissentlich ob der Öffentlichkeit , dort eingestellt hat .
Ich bin 16 ,
habe Pickel , wohne in Dortmund und bin grade in Mathe durchgefallen .
Aha .
Alles freiwillig .
Hingegen sammelt ein Google
Bot sämtliche
Daten über mich ein und behält sie dreist im Cache , selbst wenn ich
die Sites längst vom Netz genommen habe .
Längst bestimme ich nicht
mehr , welche Informationen über mich im Netz verfügbar sein sollen .
Hausbau .
Ausschreibung .
Ich suche mir ein Verzeichnis für das Gewerk
Dachstuhl , lasse einmal den Crawler drüber laufen , der mir flux 40
Email Adressen einsammelt und schreibe die Firmen an .
Und nun gehen
wir mal auf Telefonbuch .de und lassen den Crawler los .
Pustekuchen .
Datenorientierte Portale lassen sich so programmieren , dass der
Crawler mit dem Einsammeln nicht weit kommt .
SchülerVZ hat einen lausigen Server gestrickt und offensichtlich
einen erheblichen Makel .
Unser Naivling glaubt , er könne nun seinen elektronischen
Fotokopierer an die Betreiber verkaufen , hat hunger und möchte Kohle
( wahrscheinlich hätte er bei 2.000 Euro abgenickt ) .
Droht gar den
Datensalat nach Osteuropa zu verkaufen , wo längst findige
Programmierer einen Crawler in fünf Minuten auf dem Klo mit dem
Laptop geschrieben haben .
Wie wäre es mit Zielgruppe „ Pickel im
Gesicht “ und wie kommt Clerasil unbemerkt an die Klientel .
Alles
längst in Arbeit .
Unser SchülerVZ bemerkt schnell , dass man wohl gepennt hat .
Ein
handfester Skandal steht ins Haus .
Also drehen wir den Spieß einfach
um und machen den Schenkelklopfer „ Kopiertes Telefonbuch “ zum
Datenklau und die Naivität des Programmierer zum Erpresser und zeigen
ihn an .
Angriff ist die beste Verteidigung .
Die deutsche Justizfabrik hat gerade eine große Nachfrage mit
Kinderschändern und Datenklauern .
Liegt im Trend .
Also wird
geliefert , was von Oben bestellt wird .
An dieser Stelle interessiert
mich nur noch die Lobbyistische Verflechtung der SchülerVZ Betreiber .
Der geständige Naivling „ Ja , habe einen Kopierer gebastelt und will
ihn verkaufen ( Probeausdruck anbei ) “ kommt in U - Haft .
Schließlich
droht er mit dem Verkauf der Daten ins Ausland .
„ Hallo China , willste ne CD mit 15 Mio. Schülern aus Deutschland ? “
„ Nee du , dauert 14 Tage mit der Post , gehe ins nächste Internet Cafe
und lass selbst den Browser drüber laufen , geht schneller . “
Unser gemein gefährlicher Naivling hält den Psychischen Druck
deutscher U - Haft Bedingungen keine zehn Tage durch .
Vor 25 Jahren saß ich mal in Hamburg Eimsbüttel in einer Runde , wo
mir ein bärtiger Mann gerade das Pfeifchen rüber reichte und mir
genau ein solches Szenario vor Augen hielt .
Er hieß Wau Holland .
UPDATED :
The Senate debate on Majority Leader Harry Reid ’s health care bill will kick off Friday on the floor and rage until an 8 p.m.
Saturday vote that will test the Democrats ’ 60 - member supermajority .
That is , unless one Republican senator gets his way .
The 2,074 - page Senate health care bill would take 34 hours to read cover to cover — and that ’s just what Sen .
Tom Coburn wants done on the Senate floor .
The Oklahoma Republican has threatened to invoke parliamentary rules to force the Senate clerk ( or more likely , a team of clerks ) to read the massive bill before the full Senate begins formal debate on the legislation .
The move is strictly according to Senate rules , which say any senator can demand a bill be read in its entirety before debate begins .
While Democrats could , if they wish , repeatedly make motions to end the soliloquy , Republicans on the floor could object , and the reading would continue .
What ’s even more interesting is that Senate Rule XIV ( paragraph 2 ) states that every bill and joint resolution “ shall receive three readings prior to its passage . ”
TWT RELATED STORIES :
• Senate Dems release $ 849B health plan
• Work site arrests of illegals fall dramatically
• EXCLUSIVE : McCain : ‘ Grateful ’ that Palin was VP choice
“ Upon demand of a senator , these readings shall be on three different legislative days , ” the rules say .
A little quick math shows that at a minute a page — an easily achieved pace since the pages are double spaced and in a rather large type face — it would take 34.5 hours to read straight through the measure put together this week by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Republican leadership and gallery staff say the reading — with occasional pauses and sips of water for parched throats — could take more like 48 to 54 hours .
Pity the poor Senate clerks .
Democratic leaders do n’t yet have the 60 votes required to start formal floor debate on the health care reform bill , but they hope that pledges to lower the deficit , improvements to affordability and , in one case , a home - state sweetener , could seal the deal .
All but three Democrats - Sens. Ben Nelson of Nebraska , Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana - are expected to support the procedural vote required to start debate on the bill that Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada introduced this week .
The holdouts , all moderates , want a chance to review the 2,074 - page bill as debate is scheduled to begin Friday and the first votes are planned for Saturday night .
The first vote - normally a procedural formality to start debate - is going to be far more important on the health care legislation as Democrats have to come up with all 60 votes themselves .
Republicans have pegged the procedural measure as a vote on the merits of the legislation in an attempt to up the ante .
They say that the legislation is far too flawed to be repaired through the amendment process , so they plan to vote against starting debate .
See how fast you can read the bill .

A lot of the information below is out of date .
Please see the new framework shootout page for the latest benchmarks .
This post is the continuation of a series .
Please read Round 1 and Round 2 first if you are just now joining .
As I mentioned briefly in Round 1 , this whole thing came about as an experiment to satisfy my own curiosity .
Unfortunately , I was n't expecting these posts to draw the amount of attention they have been getting , and several people informed me of a few " issues " with the first round .
Since my initial approach to this topic was somewhat casual , I did n't really take the time to perform each test in a " proper scientific fashion . "
Although this was clearly stated in the introduction to round one , it unfortunately resulted in performance estimations that were somewhat less than accurate .
After input from various people much smarter than myself , I quickly went to work tweaking my test environment and building " proper " test apps .
In the midst of this , a conversation about PHP accelerators prompted me to put PHP under the spotlight , which brought about Round 2 as an interim round .
This gave me a chance to demonstrate the necessity of PHP acceleration , and only continued to solidify my opinion of PHP as an inferior web development language ( remember , I just said my opinion ) .
Which brings us to Round 3 .
A lot of work has gone into " doing it right " this time , so I am fairly confident that these results are a much more accurate representation of each test subject 's performance estimations .
Remember , benchmark test code typically has no real - world value , so " performance estimations " are about all I can promise here .
Your mileage * will * vary .
As a wise person once said :
" All this benchmarking is doing is proving what we already know : More code takes longer to execute . "
- Ben Bangert ( dev lead of Pylons )
What you should know about Round 3 :
The hardware / software platform is the same as in Round 1 .
Python v2.5.4 was used for all the Python tests .
Ruby v1.8.6 was used for the Rails test .
Apache v2.2.3 was used , with mod_wsgi v2.5 for the Python tests and Phusion Passenger v2.2.5 for the Rails test .
Note that while the mod_wsgi tests in Round 1 were using " daemon mode " , the mod_wsgi tests here are using " embedded mode " which is often faster ( although not necessarily the recommended configuration ) .
The Python component versions used here were : SQLAlchemy v0.5.6 , Genshi v0.5.1 , Mako v0.2.5 , and Jinja 2.2.1 .
ApacheBench was run with -n 10000 -c 10 .
Each test was run several times to make sure that there were no anomalies , with the " optimum average " chosen as the numbers represented here .
In an attempt to try to make these tests more scientific , I am now including the source code for each test .
Plain WSGI – wsgi_test_src.zip
Let 's start with a basic " hello world " WSGI test to set the baseline :
The ' hello world ' test : WSGIServer / 0.1 Document Path : / Document Length : 12 bytes Requests per second : 1532.76 [ #/sec ] ( mean ) Apache / 2.2.3 ( mod_wsgi ) Document Path : / Document Length : 12 bytes Requests per second : 5549.73 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
As you can see , mod_wsgi allows Apache to put some serious muscle into Python 's WSGI .
It 's no wonder that mod_wsgi is quickly becoming the de-facto standard for Apache Python deployment .
TurboGears v2.0.3 – tg2_test_src.zip
As I mentioned in Round 1 , TurboGears has quickly become my web framework of choice .
Building a " best - of - breed " component stack on top of Pylons may not be easy , but when it works I believe it pays off immensely .
The ' hello world ' test : Document Path : / Document Length : 12 bytes Requests per second : 935.13 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) Genshi template test : Document Path : / genshi_hello / Document Length : 923 bytes Requests per second : 601.07 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Mako template test : Document Path : / mako_hello / Document Length : 932 bytes Requests per second : 723.18 [ #/sec ] ( mean ) Jinja2 template test : Document Path : / jinja_hello / Document Length : 937 bytes Requests per second : 764.35 [ #/sec ] ( mean )
Database query tests : Document Path : /raw_sql / Document Length : 1270 bytes Requests per second : 569.71 [ #/sec ] ( mean ) Document Path : / genshi_sql / Document Length : 2409 bytes Requests per second : 388.96 [ #/sec ] ( mean ) Document Path : / mako_sql / Document Length : 2418 bytes Requests per second : 515.07 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) Document Path : / jinja_sql / Document Length : 2472 bytes Requests per second : 535.06 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
TurboGears v2.1a1 – tg21_test_src.zip
The TurboGears community is alive and well , and just before finishing this post the release of v2.1 Alpha 1 was announced .
Significant improvements were made to TG 's object dispatch , so I was excited to see what the new numbers would look like .
The ' hello world ' test : Document Path : / Document Length : 11 bytes Requests per second : 1118.92 [ #/sec ] ( mean ) Genshi template test : Document Path : / genshi_hello / Document Length : 923 bytes Requests per second : 713.97 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Mako template test : Document Path : / mako_hello / Document Length : 932 bytes Requests per second : 812.64 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) Jinja2 template test : Document Path : / jinja_hello / Document Length : 937 bytes Requests per second : 1000.98 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Database query tests : Document Path : /raw_sql / Document Length : 1270 bytes Requests per second : 673.04 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) Document Path : / genshi_sql / Document Length : 2409 bytes Requests per second : 433.45 [ #/sec ] ( mean ) Document Path : / mako_sql / Document Length : 2418 bytes Requests per second : 601.89 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) Document Path : / jinja_sql / Document Length : 2472 bytes Requests per second : 630.66 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
As you can see , the future of TurboGears looks very bright , and I only expect these numbers to get better as the final 2.1 release approaches ( expected in Q1 2010 ) .
Pylons v0.9.7 – pylons_test_src.zip
Pylons is the foundation which TurboGears is built upon , and for those who do n't need all " the extras " it is an excellent choice .
The ' hello world ' test : Document Path : / hello / index Document Length : 12 bytes Requests per second : 2593.47 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Mako template test : Document Path : / hello / hello Document Length : 932 bytes Requests per second : 1737.03 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Database query tests : Document Path : / hello/ raw_sql Document Length : 1270 bytes Requests per second : 964.07 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) Document Path : / hello / hellodb Document Length : 2418 bytes Requests per second : 831.26 [ #/sec ] ( mean )
Django v1.1 – django_test_src.zip
While Django is probably Python 's most popular web framework , I have never really clicked with it .
Its way of doing things is significantly different than TG / Pylons , but if you do n't mind its " MTV " architectural pattern and can survive without SQLAlchemy ( although there are hacks ) , it is a very capable framework .
The ' hello world ' test : Document Path : / hello Document Length : 12 bytes Requests per second : 3376.48 [ #/sec ] ( mean ) Django template test : Document Path : / hellos Document Length : 936 bytes Requests per second : 1781.43 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) Database query test : Document Path : / hellodb Document Length : 2476 bytes Requests per second : 972.11 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Bottle 0.5.8 – bottle_test_src.zip
Bottle caught my attention a few months ago while surveying the WSGI landscape for an alternative to PHP when building websites that only require a few pieces of dynamic functionality .
As a " micro- framework " , it does an excellent job at bridging the gap between " pure WSGI " and its " feature - rich " big brothers .
The ' hello world ' test : Document Path : / Document Length : 12 bytes Requests per second : 5545.96 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Mako template test : Document Path : / hello Document Length : 923 bytes Requests per second : 3588.04 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) Database query test ( SQLAlchemy ) : Document Path : / hellodb Document Length : 2413 bytes Requests per second : 1479.54 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
As you can see , there was practically no difference in speed between Bottle and pure WSGI in a basic " hello world " test .
Even with the addition of Mako and SQLAlchemy , Bottle performed significantly faster than a bare Pylons or Django setup .
( Note : Mako template inheritance was not used in the Bottle Mako test . )
Ruby on Rails v2.3.3 – rails_test_src.zip
What web technology shootout would be complete without Rails ?
Although I am not a Rails fan ( mostly because I can't stand Ruby ) , I believe that in many ways we owe much of the popularity and success of the web framework movement to Rails .
The ' hello world ' test : Document Path : / hello / hello Document Length : 12 bytes Requests per second : 1048.18 [ #/sec ] ( mean )
Rails template test : Document Path : / hello / hellos Document Length : 937 bytes Requests per second : 949.54 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) Database query test : Document Path : / hello / hellodb Document Length : 2482 bytes Requests per second : 734.18 [ # /sec ] ( mean ) ( Note : I think my version of Ruby was using a newer version of the SQLite3 library than my version of Python .
This may or may not have given Rails an advantage on the database query test . )
For those of you who like charts , here 's a comparison of the " return hello world " test results for each framework :
And here 's a comparison of the template test :
Finally , here 's the template test with the database query added :
The bottle of beer is one of six that survived the Hindenburg crash A blackened bottle of beer found in the wreck of the Hindenburg zeppelin is expected to fetch thousands of pounds at auction .
The bottle was found by a fire - fighter cleaning up the American airfield where the German airship exploded in 1937 .
The bottle will be the most expensive ever bought if it meets its estimated price of £ 5,000 ( $ 8,337 ) on Saturday .
The airship was engulfed by flames as it landed in New Jersey , killing 38 people and injuring 60 .
Secret find New Jersey firefighter Leroy Smith found six bottles of Lowenbrau beer and a pitcher intact on the scene of the crash .
You would n't want to drink it - it is probably quite putrid to taste
Andrew Aldridge
Auctioneer
He buried his secret find so he could collect them later , as the area had been sealed off by the authorities .
Mr Smith gave the other five bottles to his colleagues .
Most of the others are now lost , although one was given to the Lowenbrau company after the death of Mr Smith 's friend .
The silver - plated pitcher , which bears the logo of the Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei , the zeppelin airline company , is expected to reach £ 12,000 ( $ 20,000 ) .
Evaporated
The bottle and jug were passed on by Mr Smith to his niece in 1966 and are now to be put on sale by auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son .
The Hindenburg disaster was captured on film
The beer would have gone off within a year of being bottled .
" You would n't want to drink it - it is probably quite putrid to taste , " auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said .
Some of the liquid has evaporated from the bottle and the label is burned , but the logo is still visible .
The previous record price for a bottle of beer was a limited edition sale of a Carlsberg lager which cost £ 240 ( $ 400 ) .
The flammable hydrogen that kept the giant zeppelin in the air exploded as the ship came in to land on a voyage across the Atlantic from Frankfurt .
The precise cause of the fire is not known , but it is thought that friction in the mooring ropes could have been responsible .

Marseillevirus at different stages of its formation in an amoeba .
© Raoult / URMITE
Scientists in France have isolated a new giant virus that lurks inside amoeba and whose gene pool includes genetic material from other species .
After Mimivirus , Mamavirus and the virophage , the group of giant viruses now has a new member called Marseillevirus .
Discovered in an amoeba by the team led by Didier Raoult at the Unité de Recherche sur les Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales Emergentes research group ( CNRS , France ) , a description of this new virus was published this week on the website of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
These findings suggest the exchange of genes in amoebae that may lead to the constitution of different gene repertoires that could be a source of new pathogens .
Amoebae are single - cell , eukaryote ( possessing a nucleus ) living organisms , some of which are human or animal parasites and may cause a variety of pathologies .
Most amoebae live in water , damp soils or mosses .
They are mobile and capable of ingesting a wide variety of different organisms ( for example , viruses or bacteria with extraordinarily broadly ranging sizes and lifestyles ) .
Thus amoebae provide a site for numerous exchanges of genetic material arising from the many organisms that " colonize " them .
The team led by Didier Raoult at URMITE has recently discovered , in an amoeba , a member of a new family of giant viruses , which it has called the Marseillevirus , smaller than Mimivirus , which is the largest giant virus known at present .
With a chimeric genome ( containing both DNA and RNA ) of 368,000 base pairs , Marseillevirus is indeed the fifth largest viral genome to be sequenced .
It has an icosahedral shape and a diameter of about 250 nanometers ( or 250 millionths of a millimeter ) .
In addition , the researchers discovered that it contained genes from markedly differing sources , i.e. of bacterial , viral or eukaryote origin , or arising from Archae .
The genome of Marseillevirus , a mosaic of genes from very different organisms , thus demonstrates the exchange of genes between the organisms that " colonize " amoebae .
These studies have also revealed the role of amoebae , and more generally phagocytic protists ( or single - cell eukaryotes ) that feed on microbes in the environment , in the constitution of new gene " repertoires " which may be capable of generating new agents that will be pathogenic to multicellular organisms such as animals , plants or humans .

Military commanders are expected to tell the inquiry into the Iraq war , which opens on Tuesday , that the invasion was ill - conceived and that preparations were sabotaged by Tony Blair 's government 's attempts to mislead the public .
They were so shocked by the lack of preparation for the aftermath of the invasion that they believe members of the British and US governments at the time could be prosecuted for war crimes by breaching the duty outlined in the Geneva convention to safeguard civilians in a conflict , the Guardian has been told .
The lengths the Blair government took to conceal the invasion plan and the extent of military commanders ' anger at what they call the government 's " appalling " failures emerged as Sir John Chilcot , the inquiry 's chairman , promised to produce a " full and insightful " account of how Britain was drawn into the conflict .
Fresh evidence has emerged about how Blair misled MPs by claiming in 2002 that the goal was " disarmament , not regime change " .
Documents show the government wanted to hide its true intentions by informing only " very small numbers " of officials .
The documents , leaked to the Sunday Telegraph , are " post- operational reports " and " lessons learned " papers compiled by the army and its field commanders .
They refer to a " rushed " operation that caused " significant risk " to troops and " critical failure " in the postwar period .
One commander said the government " missed a golden opportunity " to win support from Iraqis .
Another commented : " It was not unlike 1750s colonialism where the military had to do everything ourselves " .
One , describing the supply chain , added : " I know for a fact that there was one container full of skis in the desert " .
Some troops were deployed in civilian flights to countries neighbouring Iraq with their equipment " brought in by hand baggage " .
Items considered dangerous , including penknives and nail scissors , were confiscated from them .
Interviewed for the postwar report drawn up by the MoD , Brigadier Bill Moore , commander of 19 Brigade , was asked : " Did you receive the correct level of advice for the nation - building you faced ? "
He replied : " We got absolutely no advice whatsoever .
The lack of advice from the FCO [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] , the Home Office and DFID [ the Department for International Development ] was appalling . "
The " lessons learned " report stated : " Never again must we send ill - equipped soldiers into battle " .
However , many of the failures recounted in leaked documents and given in evidence to Commons committees , notably relating to equipment , were repeated in Afghanistan as inquests have shown .
Significantly , the documents support what officials have earlier admitted – that the army was not allowed to prepare properly for the Iraq invasion in 2002 so as not to alert parliament and the UN that Blair was already determined to go to war .
The documents add : " In Whitehall , the internal operational security regime , in which only very small numbers of officers and officials were allowed to become involved [ in Iraq invasion preparations ] constrained broader planning for combat operations and subsequent phases effectively until Dec 23 2002 . "
Blair had in effect promised George Bush that he would join the US - led invasion when , as late as July 2002 , he was denying to MPs that preparations were being made for military action .
The leaked documents reveal that " from March 2002 or May at the latest there was a significant possibility of a large - scale British operation " .
Documents leaked in 2005 show that , almost a year before the invasion , Blair was privately preparing to commit Britain to war and topple Saddam Hussein , despite warnings from his closest advisers that it was unjustified .
They also show how Blair was planning to justify regime change as an objective , despite warnings from Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , that the " desire for regime change was not a legal base for military action .
Chilcot says he and his team would not shrink from making criticisms of individuals or organisations if they were justified .
But he stressed the inquiry was not a court of law set up to determine issues of guilt and innocence .
This is an old - fashioned recipe from the Depression days of the 30's .
It contains no eggs .

As many of you know , this is a set of data I 've followed closely over the years ( as has Don Boudreaux among others ) .
The Census Bureau just released the 2005 data on what households have ( HT : Ariel Goldring ) and it has allowed me to update my data .
In addition , I 've also rendered the data more consistent .
Each column on the poor below reflects households below the poverty line .
In previous iterations I had said it was the " lowest quintile . "
I 've discovered that some of my data was that , but the older stuff was " below the poverty line . "
I 've now made it all poverty line as the cutoff .
Here 's the historical data :
% Households with : Poor 1984 Poor 1994 Poor
2003 Poor
2005 All 1971 All 2005 Washing machine 58.2 71.7 67.0 68.7 71.3 84.0 Clothes dryer 35.6 50.2 58.5 61.2 44.5 81.2 Dishwasher 13.6 19.6 33.9 36.7 18.8 64.0 Refrigerator 95.8 97.9 98.2 98.5 83.3 99.3 Freezer 29.2 28.6 25.4 25.1 32.2 36.6 Stove 95.2 97.7 97.1 97.0 87.0 98.8 Microwave 12.5 60.0 88.7 91.2 1.0 96.4 Color TV 70.3 92.5 96.8 97.4 43.3 98.9 VCR 3.4 59.7 75.4 83.6 0.0 92.2 Personal computer 2.9 7.4 36.0 42.4 0.0 67.1 Telephone 71.0 76.7 87.3 79.8 93.0 90.6 Air conditioner 42.5 49.6 77.7 78.8 31.8 85.7 Cellular Telephone
34.7 48.3 0.0 71.3
One or more cars 64.1 71.8 72.8 ( 2001 )
79.5
source : http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/extended-05.html and prior years
I think these data largely speak for themselves .
The only categories where the poor have become " worse off " are in freezers ( likely due to more being built into fridges ) and now telephones , which is , of course , explained by the gains in cell phones .
Stoves are down slightly , but that too could be due to swapping regular stoves for microwaves or even toaster ovens .
In any case , it 's a pretty small decline .
The overall lesson is clear : lives for Americans below the poverty line continue to get better in terms of what they are able to put in their households and have to make use of everyday .
And do note that the average American household in 2005 was doing much better than its 1971 counterpart .
MUCH better - and this does n't even count medical advances and the like .
So whatever one hears about stagnating wages and the like , the bottom line is ultimately what we can afford to buy and have in our households to improve our lives .
By those measures , life for the average American is better today than 35 years ago , life for poor Americans is much better than it was 35 years ago , and poor Americans today largely live better than the average American did 35 years ago .
Hard to square with a narrative of economic stagnation or decline .
What the current policy regime holds for the future remains , of course , to be seen .
But to use Pete 's terms : as long as the Schumpeterian horse of innovation and the Smithian horse of the gains from trade outrun the Government horse of stupidity , the winners will continue to be you , me and our children and grandchildren , even if the stupid horse is running a bit faster than it used to .
Ms Phillips with daughters [ l - r ] Georgia , Kiera and Kelsey A Christmas card has been withdrawn from two Tesco stores in York after complaints that it makes fun of children with ginger hair .
The card shows a child with ginger hair sitting on the lap of Santa Claus , and the words : " Santa loves all kids .
Even ginger ones . "
Davinia Phillips , 30 , of York , whose three daughters are redheads , said she found the card offensive .
Tesco said it was sorry if the card had " caused any upset " .
Ms Phillips , of Dringhouses , York , spotted the card while visiting her Tesco store in the city 's Tadcaster Road .
She said : " I picked it up and I could n't believe it .
" I just thought ' What is so funny about that ? '
I did n't really get the joke .
" I thought I would buy it , because I wanted proof that I had seen it . "
Ms Phillips , herself a natural redhead , added : " The more I thought about it , the more annoyed I got and I told the lady who worked in the store I was not happy . "
' Absolutely disgusted '
When Ms Phillips returned to the shop later that evening she said the card had been removed .
She added that the card had also been withdrawn from the Tesco branch at Clifton Moor , York , after her sister - in - law complained .
" I thought maybe it was just me because I am a mother of kids with red hair , but a lot of my friends and other people I know , we are absolutely disgusted , " Ms Phillips said .
It is never our intention to offend any customer and we are sorry if this card caused any upset
Tesco spokesman " Society comes down hard on how people look and there are so many children these days who are bullied because of how they look .
" If the card had been about an overweight child then the shop would have been shut down , and so would the people who made the card . "
A Tesco spokesman said : " We sell a large range of Christmas cards , including some which are intended to be humorous .
It is never our intention to offend any customer and we are sorry if this card caused any upset . "
He added that they were still deciding whether to remove the card from other Tesco stores .
Card manufacturer , Essex - based Quitting Hollywood , said it had no comment to make .

I 'm hoping that we 'll package python 3 versions of as many modules as possible in Fedora 13 , so the easier it is to port them , the better .
To that end , I 've written a tool to help people port their C python extensions from Python 2 to Python 3 .
It uses the Coccinelle tool to apply a series of " semantic patches " to .c files .
I also had to code one of the refactorings in python with regular expressions ( due to the need to manipulate preprocessor macros containing commas ) .
Sample session , running on a tarball of dbus - python :
You can see the full patch it generated here : http://dmalcolm.fedorapeople.org/dbus-python.patch
It has n't done all of the work , there are some places involving the preprocessor where it did n't quite generate correct code , and there are some remaining issues - for example , a human is going to have to decide whether the strings are bytes or unicode .
However , I think this ought to save a lot of time : it takes care of a lot of the tedious parts of such patches .

The humiliation of having teepeedee2 play second fiddle to C implementations was weighing heavily on my mind , so today I spent a few hours squeezing a bit more fat out of the HTTP processing .
One of the major motivating factors for making tpd2 was the idea from the C10 k website that it should be possible to get much better performance out of a webserver than is currently normal .
The 10 k goal looked very far away at the beginning of the project , and many people said it was impossible from Lisp , which after all is a very dynamic language .
Yes , tpd2 has broken the 10 k requests /s barrier on one core .
This is a big moment for me psychologically ( and a testament to the excellent work done by the SBCL hackers on their Lisp implementation ) .
The significance is that teepeedee2 presents a new level of speed for dynamic websites .
The processing of GET parameters , building up of dynamic HTML and so on take less than 0.1 ms — on my laptop , probably even less on a modern server CPU .
Additionally , because of its scalable timeouts and use of epoll , teepeedee2 can handle many AJAX polling clients extremely efficiently .
This opens up a world of opportunity for interactive web applications that simply can't be implemented on traditional platforms .
The two competitive ( but slower ) web application frameworks — ULib and kloned are based on custom template languages with the possibility to embed arbitrary C++ code .
The biggest obstacle was that the automatic code transforms from cl- cont mean that simply using local functions ( i.e. flets and labels ) causes memory to be allocated at runtime ( inefficient funcallable / cc objects are created ) .
Therefore I fiddled with the HTTP parsing to do more inside a without - call / cc .
The result was a huge match - bind for cl- irregsexp .
Given a program has a ( correct ) performance orientated design , it 's generally not very useful to look at profiling data .
except to locate performance bugs where the implementation does not meet the design ( e.g. this issue with cl- cont ) , or to do micro-optimizations .
I had mostly concentrated on getting a good architectural design for teepeedee2 , and had n't done much micro-optimization based on profiles till now .
Based on the profile output from sb-profile , I inlined a few timeout related functions , a few miscellaneous functions and rewrote the IP address to string routine ( these changes boosted about 10 % or so ) .
The result is this

The hardware is my aging Panasonic Y7 laptop — an Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) 2 Duo CPU L7700 @ 1.80GHz , running Linux 2.6.31-5-generic # 24- Ubuntu , and SBCL 1.0.29.11.debian .
The ( now ) fastest is an awesome framework called ULib by Stefano Casazza .
It is in C++ , uses select for portability ( ! ) to MS Windows , and of course compiles dynamic pages to machine code .
It once scored 11169.22/s , which is just a smidgeon less that teepeedee2 , but normally scores much less ( about 9k/s ) — teepeedee2 is the fastest in my book .
However , I hope to be able to blog more about Ulib because it 's quite interesting and maybe Stefano will be able to improve it to topple teepeedee2 from the top spot .
I guess this means mission complete for teepeedee2 .
The external APIs need to be designed and documented if anybody wants to use it , and I would be delighted to accept patches .
UPDATE 20090819 — Kloned and Ulib do not use limited scripting languages .
They can embed arbitrary C++. ( Thanks to Stefano Barbato . )
UPDATE 20091028 —
Added nginx 's perl mode .

Note that ULib is now the winner — dammit ! :-(

Australian Fight To Include More Mature Game Rating Runs Into Brick Wall
According to an article on the Australian news website , news.com.au , Australian Attorney General Michael Atkinson has stated that he will not support calls to create a mature rating for video games in Australia .
Recent concerns have been raised about the wisdom of Australia ’s ratings classification system .
The most mature rating available in Australia is an MA15 + that classifies mature games as suitable for ages 15 and older .
Many gamers in Australia believe that the ratings system is restrictive and irresponsible .
Because the MA15 + rating makes game available to teens as young as 15 years old , many games with mature themes have been censored and banned .
Gaming advocates in Australia feel that the current rating system ignores the growth of video games as a storytelling medium .
As gaming technology has become more advanced , the ability for game developers to create emotionally - driven stories that deal with difficult situations and conflicts has grown .
Popular games such as Mass Effect and Modern Warfare 2 have dealt with themes such as racism , sex , terrorism , war , and the consequences of reprisal .
These mature subjects are either being stamped out by Australia ’s ratings system , which Australian gamer groups say is a form of censorship , or , on the other side of the argument , they are being classified as suitable for ages 15 and up when their content warrants a classification geared at 18 +.
Rated MA15 + in Australia , the massively popular Modern Warfare 2 was classified 17 + in the US and 18 + in the UK , and is a prime example of a game that has been classified as suitable when many feel it ’s subject matter is not appropriate for teens .
According to the article , Mr. Atkinson commented on the situation by saying that , “ There may be games some people consider too violent for for the MA15 + classification , but the solution is not to create a classification to permit even more violent games . ”
In addition , Mr. Atkinson challenged any opposition to run against him in the next elections in his country , stating , “ I am next up for election in March 2010 .
The state district I represent is called Croydon .
I would welcome advocates of R18 + computer games testing public acceptance of my policy by standing a candidate against me .
I think you will find this issue has little traction with my constituents who are more concerned with real - life issues than home entertainment in imaginary worlds . ”
Mr. Atkinson also said that he believes the problem with video gaming is that , regardless of classification , they cannot be restricted once they are in a home .
Mr. Atkinson ’s comments suggest that adding an R18 + rating would only prevent younger teens from purchasing the games , but not from playing them .
In maintaining a MA15 + rating , he believes that Australia is able to restrict the most mature content from reaching any homes at all , saying that the lack of an R18 + rating , “ restricts adult liberty to a small degree ” , but , “ it was worth it to protect children from violent games . ”
In response to Mr. Atkinson ’s comments as well as to his challenge , the Gamers4Croydon political party has been founded , announcing that they will run a candidate against Mr. Atkinson in the March 2010 election .
They settled upon their name after Left4 Dead 2 was originally banned in Australia .
Andrei Dumitrescu :
This weekend can have only one game dominating it : Dragon Age : Origins .
The BioWare epic has been downloading for the better part of today and , after messing around with the Character Creator and finishing Dragon Age : Journeys twice , I feel that I am ready to sink about 20 to 30 hours in the coming two days into the role - playing game .
I 'm pretty sure that the tactical combat and the party - development options alone will keep me up late at night and will give me nice dreams afterwards .
If I need a break ( and that is a very big “ if ” ) , I think I might actually jump into something like ArmA 2 .
I found Operation Flashpoint : Dragon Rising a bit disappointing and the most recent beta patches seem to have fixed , at least on paper , most of the problems that plagued the military shooter when it first came out .
The shooting will probably nicely complement the more cerebral nature of Dragon Age : Origins .
Florian Totu :
I must confess , I too have been subjugated by Dragon Age : Origins .
Last week , it was Borderlands , and now it 's this .
For two weeks in a row now , all that I 've been doing is come home from work only to plant myself in front of the PC and play until things suddenly go dark and I blank out .
I need a change of pace , but I do n't really see one in sight .
After spending four hours in the Dalish ruins so I could finally defeat a few werewolves and ghosts , four hours that were dedicated to the second level of the ruins alone , I really do n't see myself stopping .
It 's not that I 'm a sucker for punishment , which I am , it 's just that I really want to collect the fruits of my hard labor .
The mystical forest from Neverwinter Nights 1 turned me into a fairytale - forest fanatic .
In every single BioWare game that had a forest , regardless of context , I rushed to it in hopes of reliving the experience of the first title .
The problem in Dragon Age was that the difficulty of the level was in no way explained , so I ended up facing a challenge well beyond my level .
Still , nature has blessed me with an intellect that has an affinity for messing with the AI , so I have n't found a single game in which I can't exploit this skill .
Oh , and spoiler alert , Whiterfang is hot .
On the other hand , I still have the Ultimate Sith Edition from Star Wars The Force Unleashed lying around , so I might try to give that a spin too , but I 'd love to find time for a more rustic R&R , I might even try a bit of reading ( have n't done that in a long time ) .

Beyonce accepts the award for Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards at the 02 Arena in Berlin , Germany .
As Egypt gears up for pop diva Beyonce Knowles ' first performance in North Africa , Islamic conservatives are branding her show an " insolent sex party " that threatens the Muslim nation 's " social peace and stability " .
On giant posters plastered across the Egyptian capital advertising this evening 's concert , Beyonce sports a revealing , flame - covered outfit and grips a set of motorcycle handlebars extending from her hips -- a sharp contrast to Cairo streets , where most women wear the traditional Muslim headscarves .
TV ads promoting the show , part of Beyonce 's " I Am ... " world tour , have run on Egyptian and Arab satellite stations .
The tour , which took Beyonce to the United Arab Emirates last week , had grossed $ 53.5 m ( €36 m ) by October , said ' Billboard ' magazine .
But in Egypt , Islamic lawmakers and their supporters have waged campaigns on social networking websites , accusing the government of encouraging debauchery and calling for the concert 's cancellation .
" Why are you encouraging this insolent sex party ? " lawmaker Hamdi Hassan of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood wrote in a letter to the government .
" You are accused of disturbing social peace and stability , encouraging vice and debauchery . "
Lawmaker Ali Laban called for the " nudity concert " to be banned .
A Facebook campaign against the concert collected nearly 10,000 supporters .
But the war of words has not derailed the concert in the Red Sea resort , Port Ghalib .

Capturing light ( Image : Tom and Steve / Flckr / Getty )
The rainbow trap is a gilded 4.5 - millimetre - wide lens perched atop a gold - coated glass slide ( Image : Vera Smolyaninova / Towson University , Baltimore , Maryland )
Oh , to catch a rainbow .
Well , it ’s been done for the first time ever – and with just a simple lens and a plate of glass at that .
The technique could be used to store information using light , a boon for optical computing and telecommunications .
Advertisement
All - optical computing devices promise to be faster and more efficient than current technology , but they suffer from the drawback that signals have to be converted back and forth from optical to electrical .
The ability to “ slow ” light to a crawl or even trap it helps , as information in the light can then be manipulated directly .
In 2007 , Ortwin Hess of the University of Surrey in Guildford , UK , and colleagues proposed a technique to trap light inside a tapering waveguide , which is a structure that guides light waves down its length .
The waveguide in question would use metamaterials – exotic materials that can bend light sharply .
The idea is that as the waveguide tapers , the components of the light are made to stop in turn at ever narrower points .
That ’s because any given component of the light cannot pass through an opening that ’s smaller than its wavelength .
This leads to a “ trapped rainbow ” .
Gilded waveguide
While numerical models showed that such waveguides would work in theory , making them out of metamaterials remained a distant dream .
Now Vera Smolyaninova of Towson University in Baltimore , Maryland , and colleagues have used a convex lens to create the tapered waveguide and trap a rainbow of light .
They coated one side of a 4.5 - millimetre - diameter lens with a gold film 30 nanometre thick , and laid the lens – gold - side down – on a flat glass slide which was also coated with film of gold .
Viewed side - on , the space between the curved lens and the flat slide was a layer of air that narrowed to zero thickness where the lens touched the slide – essentially a tapered waveguide .
When they shone a multi- wavelength laser beam at the open end of the gilded waveguide , a trapped rainbow formed inside .
This could be seen as a series of coloured rings when the lens was viewed from above with a microscope : the visible light leaked through the thin gold film .
Simply amazing
Shorter - wavelength green light was trapped at a point where the taper became too thin for it to penetrate the waveguide .
Longer - wavelength red light was trapped further out , where the taper was thicker , with intermediate wavelengths in between ( www.arxiv.org/abs/0911.4464).
“ I think it ’s beautiful that we can create such complex phenomena using a very , very simple configuration , ” says Smolyaninova .
“ It ’s amazing . ”
Hess agrees .
He is delighted to see his theoretical prediction validated and impressed by the simplicity of the experiment .
Setting the lens on the slide , he says , “ is a very , very elegant way of tapering ” .
Police have arrested Randolph Forde , a teacher at Mundy 's Mill High School in Jonesboro , Georgia for allegedly putting a " hit " on a student after an incident in which he asked the student if he was gay , WSBTV reports :
" Forde was charged after , officers said , he held up a piece of paper with the alleged victim ’s name on it saying he had a hit on him .
The student ’s mother said her son came home frightened when he found out . '
He says , ‘ Ma , you ’re not going to believe this but Mr. Forde offered another student money to kill me , ’' said mother Marcia Killebrew .
Killebrew told Channel 2 Action News reporter Tom Jones that she was shocked when her 16 - year - old son told her his substitute math teacher at Mundy ’s Mill High School was trying to hire a hit man to kill him .
' I was extremely upset .
I called the school at that moment , ' said Killebrew .
Killebrew ’s attorney said the incident began when Forde called the student out of the classroom one day .
' ( Forde ) asked him if he was gay , ' said attorney Terrance Madden .
Madden said the student became angry at the suggestion and the next day the two had a verbal altercation .
Weeks later , police said , Forde got a Mundy ’s Mill student off a school bus and told him he had a hit on someone and needed him to take care of it .
Officers said the student asked who it was and Forde said he would let him know .
' The teacher held a piece of paper up with the victim ’s name on it , ' said Otis Willis III of the Clayton County Police Department . "
According to the teen 's attorney , after questioning the student 's sexuality , Forde " threatened to hit him in his ‘ f - ing mouth . "
Forde reportedly also planned on paying another student to take out the " hit " .
The AJC : " Forde told police he 'had no interaction with the witness or the
victim , and he never made a statement regarding the victim , ' according
to the report .
Forde 's attorney , Borquaye Thomas , said the 16 - year - old only complained after he got in trouble for another incident .
' The allegation is he made a hit on him , but that was not what was
said nor what was intended , ' Thomas said .
' The student only complained
after he was getting suspended . '
Forde asked the student about being gay after he saw the boy dancing
inappropriately with another male student in class , Thomas said .
' All of the students knew Mr. Forde was joking , ' Thomas said .
' The
other students said Mr. Forde always plays around with them like that . ' "
Forde was reportedly arrested last month , charged with making terrorist threats , and released on $ 10,000 bond .
He is on administrative leave without pay .

Is Jon Stewart the only man on television willing to hold Fox News accountable ?
Tonight on The Daily Show , Stewart called out FNC ’s Sean Hannity for not only inflating the attendance number from Michele Bachmann ’s healthcare protest , but also for trying to pass off footage from the 9/12 protest as evidence of the crowd size .
Check out the video .
Here is the video from Media Matters :

In response to Hannity ’s claim that 20,000 people were at the protest , Stewart said , “ Anywhere between twenty and forty thousand people or as The Washington Post put it 10,000 .
The biggest catch was when Stewart caught Hannity using old video from the 9/12 rally .
Stewart said , “ That was weird , because when that clip started it was a clear fall day in Washington , D.C. , not a cloud in the sky , the leaves have changed .
It ’s well attended , but sparse .
All of the sudden the trees turn green again , and its cloudy and it looks like thousands and thousands of people of more people arrived .
If I did n’t know any better I would think they just put two different days together and acted like they did n’t …
It seems Sean Hannity used footage of a bigger crowd from a totally different event to make last week ’s GOP healthcare rally appear more heavily attended . ”
Why is it that Jon Stewart and The Daily Show seem to be the only people on television who caught Hannity ’s bit of trickery ?
Is Stewart that much brighter than everyone else , or are the other networks not really paying attention ?
The thing that always strikes me about FNC ’s manipulation of video is how amateurish it is .
You would think that with all the resources that Fox News has , they would make a better effort to cover up their deception .
If they respected the intelligence of their audience at all , you would think that they would at least make a serious effort to fool them .
Instead , they keep providing evidence that they really are n’t all that interested in being a news network .
Heck with efforts as poor as this one , they are n’t even a good propaganda machine .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration created a new task force on Tuesday to crack down on financial fraud , an increasingly important political issue after a spike in mortgage scams and big Wall Street trading scandals .
President Barack Obama signed an executive order directing the task force , led by the Justice Department , to investigate and prosecute financial crimes connected to the past year ’s financial crisis and to try to deter future fraud .
The stakes are high for the administration , particularly with a weak economy , anger about huge Wall Street bonuses and outrage that securities regulators missed one of the biggest frauds in U.S. history involving Bernard Madoff , who bilked investors of as much as $ 65 billion in a decades - long scheme .
“ We will be relentless in our investigation of corporate and financial wrongdoing and we will not hesitate to bring charges , where appropriate , for criminal misconduct on the part of businesses and business executives , ” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told a news conference .
The administration has long pledged to be more aggressive in fighting financial crime , but has faced a few setbacks like Madoff and losing a high - profile case against two hedge fund managers accused of fraud in the early days of the crisis .
The task force replaced a similar one established by the Bush administration in 2002 after corporate scandals like the collapse of Enron Corp , the giant energy trader .
Asked how this one would be different , Holder said the “ breadth ” of the task force , with a wide range of federal government agencies coordinating action among themselves and with state and local law enforcement authorities .
The task force also includes the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development departments and the Securities and Exchange Commission , among other government agencies .
It will hold its first meeting in the next 30 days .

TIME TO PUT PIECES TOGETHER
Asked why the administration which took office in January had not created the task force earlier as the financial crisis has ebbed , Holder said , “ It took a great deal of time to put all the pieces together . ”
Robert Mintz , a former U.S. prosecutor who now does white - collar criminal defense work , said , “ The formation of this new task force is likely more than mere symbolism , but it may take some time before we see any tangible results . ”
“ While this is clearly a reaction to the public ’s continued frustration with Wall Street , in the past we have seen a real impact from these types of task forces when they are targeted at specific types of crime , ” he said .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said that in addition to prosecuting fraud , the financial system must also be overhauled to address the problems that created the crisis .
Congress is now weighing a package of reforms .
“ We ca n’t wait for problems to peak before we respond , ” Geithner said .
“ We ’re seeking a comprehensive financial reform to create a more stable , safe financial system and stepping up our enforcement strategy . ”
He also took a swipe at the Bush administration , saying “ enforcement resources were not mobilized on a major scale until extensive damage had already been done . ”
No new cases were unveiled in the task force announcement .
The task force comes a week after the Justice Department lost a pivotal criminal fraud case in New York against two managers from Bear Stearns whose hedge funds collapsed at the early stages of the financial crisis .
Securities regulators still plan to pursue their own charges against the two men .
“ We analyze cases like that and learn from them and that analysis is underway , ” Holder said .
“ That should not be seen in any way as something that ’s going to deter us from being very forceful in going after the kinds of fraud that we alleged occurred in those cases . ”
Rob Khuzami , head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission , said specialized units at the agency would focus on derivatives and securities , insider trading and market manipulation , and fraud among hedge funds and investment advisers .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Sprint Nextel Corp. said Monday that it plans to cut between 2,000 and 2,500 jobs as part of a restructuring plan aimed at reducing labor costs by at least $ 350 million , on an annual basis .
The third - largest wireless provider in the country said most of the positions will be eliminated by the end of this year .
The job cuts will affect all levels of the company across all geographic locations .
Severance benefits and outplacement services for all impacted employees will result in a one - time charge of between $ 60 million and $ 80 million in the fourth quarter , Sprint said .
The job cuts are the latest action the company has taken to trim costs .
Sprint slashed 8,000 poistion in the first quarter of 2009 in an effort to save $ 1.2 billion annually .
Sprint , based in Overland Park , Kan. , has recently seen a higher level of customer satisfaction and " is taking this action in a careful manner to ensure that there is no impact on the improved customer experience , " the company said in a statement .
Sprint ( S , Fortune 500 ) shares fell 1.5 % in after - hours trading .

Registration does not necessarily guarantee getting a ticket
Tickets for 2010 's Glastonbury festival have gone on sale to music fans who registered with organisers by Friday .
Next year will be the 40th anniversary of the festival and its organiser Michael Eavis has said " expectations are really high " .
Fans were able to buy tickets from 0900 BST on Sunday .
The registration system , which does not guarantee a ticket , was set up in 2007 to stamp out touting .
Last year fans were able to extend their registration for three years .
A spokesman for the event said the system was a " good , open scheme " .
The ticketing system has been a success because " we know all tickets are going to festival - goers " , he added .
If anyone is uncertain whether their previous registration is still valid , they are able to check online .
Customers can also participate in the Glastonbury deposit scheme , which allows the buyer to pay a £ 50 deposit which reserves them a ticket .
The final balance can be paid at a later date .
Meanwhile , it has been revealed that Michael Eavis is planning to extend the current four - year licence to 2011 .
It is expected that in 2012 the event will not take place to allow the Somerset site to recover .
Can renewable energy save the world ?
Geoffrey Heal
Can renewable energy save the world from climate change , and do so at a reasonable cost ?
This column says we can replace some fossil fuel power with renewable power without a major cost increase , but we cannot hope to replace a major fraction of our fossil power with intermittent power sources such as wind and solar energy unless we can develop energy storage technologies .
Can renewable energy save the world from climate change and do so at a reasonable cost ?
President Obama suggests that it can .
In his Inaugural Address , he promised to “ … harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories . ”
Along these lines , the US Department of Energy asserts that 10 % of US electricity should come from renewable sources by 2012 and 25 % by 2025 .
Other industrial countries have similar goals .
Are they feasible , and , if so , at what cost ?
The baseline cost of non-renewable electricity
The cost of electricity from a modern efficient coal power station is :
Between 6 and 7 cents / kWh , that from natural gas costs about the same ;
Nuclear electricity costs between 8 and 9 cents ( Du and Parsons 2009 ) .
To provide benchmarks against which to judge renewable sources0 , we need to adjust the fossil fuel costs for the costs of greenhouse gases emitted .
Coal is particularly sensitive to these , as a large coal - fired power station uses about 10,000 tons of coal per day , each ton generating between 2 and 3 tons of carbon dioxide .
At $ 25 to emit a ton of CO2 , we are adding over half a million dollars to the daily operating costs – a consequence of emissions that can run to millions of tons annually per power station .
No wonder environmentalists are hostile to coal !
$ 25 permits add about 2 cents to the cost of electricity from coal , and about 1 cent to the cost from gas , for total of around 8.5 and 7.5 cents respectively .
As an aside , a recent report of the US National Academy of Sciences estimated the external health costs of coal - based electricity , leaving out the greenhouse gas effects , as 3.6 cents / kWh ( National Academy 2009 ) .
How do renewables compare ?
The cost of wind power depends on the strength and reliability of the wind , the latter being measured by the wind turbine ’s capacity factor .
A 30 % capacity factor means that a wind turbine rated at 1 megawatt maximum capacity will on average over the course of a year produce at 30 % of that level .
Capacity factors in the range 25 – 40 % are typical for wind .
At a capacity factor of 25 % you have to install 4 megawatts to be sure of getting on average 1 megawatt , which of course boosts the cost of wind power .
There is also an issue with transmission costs , as locations with strong and reliable winds are often distant from sources of demand for electricity , and extending a grid can cost in the range of $ 2 million per mile .
Leaving aside the transmission costs , wind from a good site can cost in the range of 6 to 10 US cents / kWh , certainly competitive with coal after including the cost of greenhouse gas emissions , perhaps even before .
Solar power is more expensive .
It comes in two varieties :
Solar photo voltaic ( PV ) , and
Solar thermal or concentrated solar power ( CSP ) .
Solar photovoltaic panels exploit the photoelectric properties of silicon and generates an electric current as a result of photons of sunlight knocking electrons out of silicon films .
Power from this source has typically cost a lot – over 20 cents per kWh .
But the price of silicon film has fallen by 50 % during 2009 and is still falling , largely as a result of a huge increase in production capacity in China .
The cost of electricity from solar photovoltaic technology will probably be in the teens when the new film costs are reflected in new power stations .
Experts expect solar film prices to fall even further , so there is some prospect of solar photovoltaic being competitive with coal after allowing for CO2 costs within a few years .
Solar thermal or concentrated solar power concentrates the sun ’s heat to generate steam and drive a turbine , the usual method of generating electricity .
This is currently the less costly of the two solar technologies , costing about 12 US cents per kWh .
Intermittency problems
Solar and wind power in all their forms are intermittent :
The output of a solar photovoltaic plant can drop from 50 megawatts to close to zero in seconds if a cloud passes over the sun , and then surge up again when the sky is clear .
The output of a wind power plant can drop from 100 megawatts to 10 or less in a few hours if the wind dies down ( see MacKay 2009 ) .
This poses problems for grid managers , who have to match the supply of electricity to the demand on a minute - by - minute basis .
They have two lines of response – signing interruptible contracts with some of their customers , who agree to be disconnected at short notice if there is an excess demand for power , and constructing generating capacity that can be turned on or off at very short notice .
Gas turbines are popular for this purpose , though some grids use hydropower as the swing power source to compensate for variations in the output of renewable sources .
The need to build flexibility into demand and supply imposes an additional cost on grids that use wind or solar power .
The size of this cost seems to increase with the proportion of the power that comes from intermittent sources ; for 30 % of power from such sources , the cost could be about 3 US cents / kWh .
Concentrated solar power is preferable to wind and solar photovoltaic from an intermittency perspective .
Concentrated solar power stations can store heat and continue to produce electricity even after the sun has set .
They do this by heating a heat - retaining substance – molten salt is currently popular – and storing it .
New Chinese concentrated solar power stations are said to be able to store heat for several days using ceramics .
Biofuels
Biofuels are another source of renewable , carbon - free energy .
About 17 % of Brazil ’s ground transportation fuels are biofuels , mainly bioethanol from sugar .
Competitive with oil at an oil price of around $ 60 - 70 per barrel , a level at which prices currently seem stable , the downside of biofuels is that they require land and water , both of which are scarce and likely to become scarcer as the global population moves towards 9 billion and the climate change alters hydrological cycles and agricultural productivity ( Schlenker et al. 2006 ) .
Although the issue is far from settled , studies are beginning to suggest that it will not be possible to meet world ’s demand for food and also supply a significant fraction of its energy from biofuels ( Deutsche Bank 2009 ) .
Meeting our energy needs with renewable sources
There are other renewable sources of energy – geothermal , wave , tidal , in - stream hydro and waste - to - energy .
Currently none of these seems likely to be available on a sufficient scale to meet a useful fraction of our energy needs in the next two decades .
Where does this leave us with renewables as a solution to the problem of climate change ?
We can replace some fossil fuel power with renewable power without a major cost increase , but we cannot hope to replace a major fraction of our fossil power with intermittent power sources such as wind and solar – unless we can develop storage technologies .
Being able to store power and smooth the output of intermittent power sources would greatly enhance the attractions of renewable power .
Without such storage technology , we will have to rely on non-renewable but carbon - free power sources – such as nuclear power and coal with carbon capture and storage – to provide a significant part of our power .
As noted earlier , nuclear is no more expensive than coal with a carbon charge , although of course there are risks that are specific to nuclear power ( Heal and Kunreuther 2009 ) .
The cost of capturing and storing CO2 emissions from coal power stations are not yet known , though we do know that this can be done from successful pilot projects .
It will probably take the cost of electricity from coal above 10 cents / kWh .
To replace 25 % of current electric capacity in the US by wind power would require an investment of at least $ 2 trillion ( Heal 2009 ) , more for solar , without allowing for extensions and enhancements to the grid .
To do this over the next 15 years would require allocating about 1 % of current GDP to renewables each year – a large but feasible number .
The bottom line is that neither costs nor capital requirement will prevent us from decarbonising the electricity supply .
The real obstacle to doing this largely with renewables is our current inability to store power , and as long as we cannot store power we will need to use non-renewable sources like nuclear and coal with carbon capture and storage .

About Sarah Palin , you 've written that " All we know for sure is that whatever she says is n't true .
It never is . "
I 'd argue that what she says has no relation whatsoever to the truth - you can't count on it to be false anymore than you can count on it to be true .
What you can generally count on is that it will be hastily conceived and self serving .
I know you 've invested a great deal of time proving her to be a liar , but to my mind Palin 's a bullshitter , as defined by Harry G. Frankfurt in his book , On Bullshit .
According to Frankfurt , a bullshitter is the greater enemy of truth than a liar .
The liar , by acting in opposition to truth , at least has some sense of what it is .
The bullshitter , on the other hand , says only what he or she thinks will serve their immediate agenda and therefore pays little attention to what actually " is . "
Over time their ability to recognize truth becomes attenuated .
Sound like anyone you 've seen in shorts on the cover of Newsweek lately ?
I always found the term " liar " a little crude or insufficient for her , hence the use of the term " odd lies " to characterize a very particular form of delusional thinking .
Having now read the book , I have to say I feel , yes , sadness .
The same sadness I felt in a huge wave at the beginning of September 2008 .
For the innocent people dragged into this whole farce .

In light of last night ’s vote on H.R. 3962 , the Affordable Health Care for America Act , we decided to calculate a few numbers on the current bill .
Based on the Library of Congress ’s XML representation of the bill ( which can be obtained here ) , we have calculated a number of linguistic and citation properties of the Bill .
The House of Representative approved HR 3962 by a 220 - 215 margin .
The New York Times features a useful analysis of the vote including a breakout by party and region here .
On the Sunday morning talk shows as well as in other outlets , there has been significant discussion regarding the size of H.R. 3962 .
Specifically , many critics have decried the length of the bill citing its 1990 pages .
The bill is indeed 1990 pages as you can see if you choose to download a PDF copy of the bill .
The purpose of this post is to provide a perspective regarding the length of H.R. 3962 .
Those versed in the typesetting practices of the United States Congress know that the printed version of a bill contains a significant amount of whitespace including non-trivial space between lines , large headers and margins , an embedded table of contents , and large font .
For example , consider page 12 of the printed version of H.R. 3962 .
This page contains fewer than 150 substantive words .
We believe a simple page count vastly overstates the actual length of bill .
Rather than use page counts , we counted the number of words contained in the bill and compared these counts to the number of words in the existing United States Code .
In addition , we consider the number of text blocks in the bill– where a text block is a unit of text under a section , subsection , clause , or sub-clause .
Basic Information about the Length of H.R. 3962
Number of words in H.R. 3962 impacting substantive law :
234,812 words ( w/ generous calculation )
Number of total words in H.R. 3962 : 363,086 words ( w/ titles , tables of contents …)
Number of text blocks : 7,961
Average number of words per text block : 24.18
Average words per section : 267.03
Is this a Large or Small Number ?
Comparison to Harry Potter
Number of substantive words in H.R. 3962 : 234,812 words
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix – 257,000 words
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire – 190,000 words
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – 198,000 words
Is this a Large or Small Number ?
Comparison to Other Legislation
Number of substantive words in Energy Bill of 2007 : 157,835 words
Number of substantive words in Defense Authorization Act for 2010 : 119,960 Words
H.R. 3962 is roughly 2 x the Size of Medicare Rx Bill of 2003 ( Given there is no public XML version of the bill , the Exact “ Substantive Words ” Number is not available )
Is this a Large or Small Number ?
Comparison to the Full U.S. Code

A weird concatenation of events – the Ft. Hood shoot - up , the decision by the Obama administration to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other 9/11 plotters , and the seizure of a mosque and other properties said to be owned by a front for the Iranian government – has once again brought the question of domestic terrorism to center stage .
This underscores a remarkable fact : that the 9/11 attacks , even more than the Japanese strike at Pearl Harbor , have influenced , even dominated , our domestic politics as well as our foreign policy .
We are still standing in the long shadow of that event , and nothing , it seems , can haul us out of the dark and back up into the light .
The upcoming trial in New York of KSM and his confreres promises to be a media circus unparalleled in the history of this nation : think of the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O. J. Simpson trial , and then imagine if Lee Harvey Oswald had lived to be tried – and then multiply that by 10 .
This promises to be more than a show trial ; it is going to be high drama in the courtroom , not a stylized Kabuki theater ritual , in which control of the narrative will be fiercely fought over as both sides try to dominate the proceedings and imprint their own " spin " on the drama as it unfolds .
What fascinates me , however , is not the prospect of the trial itself , but the reasons behind the Bush administration ’s refusal to get this over with as soon as they got their hands on the defendants .
Here they had a perfect opportunity to stage a show trial , control the narrative , and show for all the world to see the unspeakable evil of the 9/11 plotters – so why did n’t they do it ?
Why , now , are we left , all these years later , to clean up their mess ?
I do n’t buy the official story , which is that the Bush Justice Department , under orders from the White House , was unwilling to do it as a matter of high principle , the principle being that these guys were not and are not ordinary criminals , but " enemy combatants " who did n’t deserve the legal forms reserved for U.S. citizens and legal residents .
Since when would any " principle " stop them from using a public trial as a weapon in their " war on terrorism " ?
And since KSM admits his guilt – indeed , proclaims it – there does n’t seem to be any problem reaching a guilty verdict .
The end result would seem to be preordained .
Unless …
Unless a trial would bring out certain facts that the Bush administration did n’t want revealed .
We already know they tortured KSM , and surely they were aware his confession was tainted , but that is n’t as much of a big deal as it ’s made out to be .
Most Americans ( present company excluded ) believe the 9/11 plotters deserved to be tortured , so the domestic public relations fallout – as opposed to the strictly legal consequences – would redound to the Bushies ’ favor .
And as the Bush crowd was never all that concerned with our image overseas , international reaction to details of torture sessions would presumably not come into play .
Torture aside , however , it occurs to me that the Bushies did n’t want a public trial because , after all , KSM and his comrades planned and helped [ . pdf ] execute the most successful – and deadliest – act of terrorism on U.S. soil in our history , and if anyone knows the real story behind it , it ’s the defendants in this case .
At the very least , their testimony will show up the Bush administration for the utter incompetents they were and expose to public view the gaping holes in our security al - Qaeda managed to crawl through without much difficulty .
Furthermore , we have to ask the question : what else will the defendants reveal about how they managed to down the twin towers and devastate the Pentagon armed only with some box -cutters ?
In spite of the numerous commissions , studies , books , films , and seemingly endless public discussion of this signal event , a great deal of the facts surrounding the 9/11 attacks remain shrouded in mystery .
And of course , this has given rise to a whole panoply of conspiracy theories , conjectures , and alternative narratives that have continuously threatened to overtake the official story and replace it with something far darker and more ambiguous .
I , for one , fail to understand how the hijackers , with minimal technical skill and arms , managed to take over four airliners and – with superb timing and pinpoint accuracy – ram them into such high - value targets with absolutely no outside help .
Not that there have n’t been intimations of such help .
Was the Bush administration aware of some form of outside assistance ( perhaps indirect , albeit intentional ) , possibly from state actors , and determined to keep it under wraps ?
Which raises another interesting question : why did the Obama administration decide to go ahead with prosecutions in a U.S. court ?
Could it be that they do n’t know everything the Bushies know – and are about to open a Pandora ’s box out of which will spring some pretty unpleasant wraiths ?
Before I get too far afield in pure speculation , I want to stop here and consider the Ft. Hood shooting , which the right wing ( led by the neocons ) is promoting as a mini-9 /11 .
There is no solid evidence Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan was acting under orders from any terrorist outfit , although it is too early to rule this out entirely .
Hasan was in touch with a radical imam who preached at the same mosque attended by three of the 9/11 hijackers .
Hasan prayed at this mosque when he was stationed in the D.C. area , and he exchanged as many as 20 - to - 30 e-mails with this character , who now lives in Yemen and who praised Hasan as an exemplar of Muslim piety .
We also have one member of Congress who claims there is a financial connection to Pakistan , although the details remain sketchy .
I am astonished , however , by the vehement reaction I ’ve received to my raising even the possibility of a terrorist connection .
One lefty blogger , after noting that Pat Robertson is whipping up " Islamophobia " over the Ft. Hood incident , avers , " I ’m not surprised , either , that Antiwar.com ’s editorial director Justin Raimondo is also jumping to right - wing conclusions over the Fort Hood shooting untethered from any factual basis . "
So now we have " right - wing conclusions " and " left - wing conclusions . "
Is there any room in our crazy , mixed - up , post - 9/11 , Bizarro World universe for plain old standard - issue conclusions ?
Apparently not .
This guy also fails to note that I drew no firm conclusions about the Ft. Hood massacre being directed or inspired by a terrorist conspiracy – I merely raised the possibility , which is hardly " untethered from [ sic ] any factual basis . "
The fact is al - Qaeda exists , as does the enormous amount of ill will – and , yes , hatred – directed at the U.S. because of our foreign policy .
Is it " untethered " to " any factual basis " to believe we might be scorched by the blowback ?
This is n’t a " right - wing " conclusion or a " left - wing " conclusion ; it is objective reality .
The timing of all this is oddly coincidental and , in one case , probably not due entirely to chance , which brings us to the seizure of that supposedly Iranian - owned mosque ( they also are said to be the real owners of the Piaget building in Manhattan ) – with the clear implication this represents some sort of security risk .
The question is , why now ?
Why , when the administration is trying to get the Iranians to make concessions at the negotiating table , is the Justice Department prosecuting alleged Iranian proxies in the U.S. ?
This only adds to the atmosphere of hysteria and suspicion heightened by the Ft. Hood incident and the upcoming 9/11 trial .
One has to conclude the Obamaites are deliberately fanning the flames – but to what end ?
Yes , I realize this column raises many questions and answers practically none of them , but that ’s the situation we find ourselves in these days , and there ’s no getting around it .
I do n’t pretend to have all – or even a good many – of the answers .
But the path to real knowledge is asking the right questions and , furthermore , being unafraid to go where the facts lead , whether the conclusions we draw are " right - wing " or " left - wing . "
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Now that ’s an odd admission for a pundit to make : I do n’t have all the answers .
And it ’s pretty uncharacteristic of my style , which is usually imbued with a ruthless certainty , at least insofar as my views of what ought to be are concerned .
Yet advocacy journalism is not only concerned with what ought to be , but also with what is .
Indeed , a writer ’s main task is to make the connection between his or her views and the facts .
The problem is that the facts are not always revealed in their entirety in the first five minutes of a crisis .
Look at the Ft. Hood attack : first Hasan was dead , and then he was n’t .
Initial reports posited more than one shooter , and it was only later that a lone gunman – an all - too - familiar figure in the history of American assassinations – emerged as the perpetrator .
We are still learning about this enigmatic Army recruit , a Muslim who joined the military against his parents ’ wishes and the advice of his friends and was openly and vehemently opposed to what he considered a U.S. war on the Muslim faith .
He even went so far as to make a long presentation at a conference of military psychiatric and medical personnel that seemed to justify terrorist attacks by Muslims .
He was also reportedly under investigation for his inflammatory Internet postings praising suicide bombers – although , inexplicably , the probe never went anywhere .
I repeat these facts because … well , facts are important , although they seem to have gone out of fashion .
We have " left - wing " truth and " right - wing " truth – but what , pray tell , is the real truth ?
That is the reason for Antiwar.com : to sort out the real truth from the ideological propaganda , so that we can make a reality - based case for a rational , non-interventionist foreign policy .
It is n’t enough to have a point of view ; indeed , everybody has one .
What everybody does n’t have is access to those particular facts that shed light on the darkest corners and illuminate the hidden reality – unless , of course , they are regular visitors to Antiwar.com
That ’s why it ’s so important to keep Antiwar.com going , and there ’s only one way to do that .
Yes , I ’m talking about our fundraising drive – again !
– but it has to be done .
If you want the sheer unadulterated , un - spun reality , the gritty details of a foreign policy that violates human rights and common sense , well , you ’ve come to the right place .
We depend on the contributions of our readers and supporters to keep operating .
Without that , we are gone .
It ’s as simple as that .
So if you have n’t donated yet , please consider doing so – and help keep alive the tradition of foreign policy journalism that is neither " left - wing " nor " right - wing , " but simply dedicated to saying what is .
Please note : I ’m doing a daily brief commentary for The Hill , Capitol Hill ’s newspaper of record .
Today ’s question is " What must Sarah Palin accomplish on her book tour ? "
My answer is here , along with those of ( so far ) Larry Sabato and Glenn Reynolds .
One of the secret weapons of the Velvet Underground was Lou Reed 's Ostrich Guitar Tuning , where all the strings were tuned to D .
It got its name from the 1964 novelty single " The Ostrich " by The Primitives , a pre-Velvet Underground band fronted by Lou Reed .
Originally only a studio project , the song about a fake novelty dance generated enough interest to put together a band for a few live gigs .
And amazingly enough , that touring version of The Primitives featured John Cale , Tony Conrad , and Walter DeMaria .
While I am not aware of any surviving live recordings of these guys , here are both sides of the studio recording in MP3 format : The Ostrich | Sneaky Pete
Only one year later Lou Reed and John Cale would form the Velvet Underground and never record a novelty dance number again .

Anyone who ’s passionate about science , as I am , cannot help but be seriously concerned by the growing extent to which anti-scientific ideas , and the groups and organisations that promote them , are increasingly creeping into public life and attracting mainstream political support .
While it ’s easy to ridicule the purveyors of anti-scientific ideas when they ’re to be found at the lunatic fringes of mainstream politics , and one thinks immediately of Nadine Dorries ’s ridiculous claim that ‘ Tridents are n’t weapons of mass destruction ’ and David Tredinnick ’s expenses claim for astrology software , the kidding around has to stop when one finds sizeable sums of public money are being routed to organisations that promote pseudoscience as a matter of public policy .
To make matters worse we ’re not just talking about the healthcare sector and NHS funding for pseudoscientific nonsense ( i.e. and other so - called ‘ alternative therapies ’ but an altogether more sensitive field – education .
By 2011 , a little over £ 1.4 million of taxpayers ’ money will have been blown , by the NHS , on setting up and bailing out the ‘ Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council ’ ( aka OfQuack ) , a supposed voluntary ‘ regulator ’ for practitioners of ‘ Complementary and Alternative Medicine ’ – one that ’s already shaping up to be just about as useful as that other notable paragon of voluntary ( non ) regulation , the Press Complaints Commission .
Whatever the CNHC might claim about its proposed role as regulator of the CAM sector , in reality its has no more authority than a bog - standard trade association and all the appearance of being yet another example of the state pandering to the increasing eccentric personal foibles and vanities of the Quacktitioner Royal .
That said , pissing £ 1.4 million down the drain on Chuck the Hippy ’s latest vanity project pales into relative insignificance when set against the sums that anti-science groups have managed to extract from the public purse through the government ’s academies programme , where a capital bung of £ 20 - 25 million per academy plus running costs of anything from £ 2 million to £ 7 million a year seems to be about the going rate .
The most notorious examples of anti-scientific thinking gaining a foothold in state - funded education via the academies programme , to date , have been the three academies run by Peter Vardy ’s Emmanuel Schools Foundation , in Middlesbrough , Gateshead and Doncaster , where significant concerns have arisen in relation to the teaching of creationism but , more recently , and with relatively little adverse publicity , proponents of pseudoscience have succeeding in opening a new front in their ongoing war on reason and rationality by securing £ 16 million in capital investment from the DCSF to support the creation of a publicly - funded Steiner Academy in rural Herefordshire , which opened ( as a state funded school ) only last year , against the wishes of local residents and Herefordshire Council .
The Academy No one Wanted
The circumstances in which the Hereford Steiner Academy came to be afforded state investment and revenue funding , look , to say the least , more than a little dubious .
Unlike other academies , which have been set up to replace failing state schools in , primarily , inner city areas , the precursor of the Herefordshire Steiner Academy was a fee- paying Steiner school , which was set up in 1983 in the distinctly rural Herefordshire village of Much Dewchurch , which has a population of around 250 residents and , since last year , an academy which provides 330 school places .
Objections to the academy project raised by both local residents and Herefordshire Council , which is badly strapped for cash and facing the prospect of making a raft of unpopular decisions on school closures in order to rationalise school in the county , appear to have been dismissed in a rather high handed fashion .
According to Dr Eddie Oram , a retired former Director of Education in the County who was enlisted by local residents to help with the campaign against the academy project , he was informed by a ’ emissary ’ from the DCSF ’s Academies Unit that :
“ though the council ’s view would be listened to , disagreement would not be allowed to frustrate the government plans to meet its intentions under the diversity agenda . ”
It seems that the DCSF now has a rather curious working definition of ‘ diversity ’ which now includes funnelling public money to an occult society that derives it ideas on childhood development from a thoroughly bastardised fusion of Edwardian occultism , quasi-Christian Gnosticism and badly re-written Hindu mysticism and its idea of what constitutes science from the otherwise long - discredited work of the author of Faust , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the German Counter - Enlightenment .
Despite their carefully cultivated ( and heavily sanitised ) public image as a haven of faintly hippyish liberal arts education rooted in an absurdly over - romanticised view of childhood , Steiner Schools ( also known as Steiner - Waldorf and Waldorf Schools ) are , in reality , just one arm of an occult society founded in the second decade of the 20th Century by Rudolf Steiner – The Anthroposophical Society – which actively espouses and promotes a fundamentally unscientific world view .
Crap Science
I ’ve already covered some of the background to both Steiner ’s self - coined ‘ philosophy ’ , which he termed ‘ Anthroposophy ’ , over at the Ministry and some of the quite significant concerns that former Steiner School pupils ( and their parents ) have raised in regards to both academic and pastoral standards in Steiner Schools ( usual cautions apply – it ’s long , covers a lot of varied ground and could really have done with a sub-editor ) .
It has to be said , however , that even that article is just the tip of a pretty sizeable iceberg , one in which I ’ve either omitted entirely , or barely touched on , a range of notable oddities which include :
– Anthroposophical beliefs about disabilities , which are regarded as ‘ karmic choices ’ made by individuals in order to learn a particular ‘ karmic lesson ’ ,
– Biodynamic Agriculture , which liberally mixes conventional organic farming practices with sympathetic magic and astrology , and
– Anthroposophic medicine , for which the most apt description is ‘ homoeopathy with even less science ’*.
* A couple of years ago , Prof Edzard Ernst ( co-author of ‘ Trick or Treatment ’ with Simon Singh ) attempted to carry out a systematic review of all randomised clinical trials of Anthroposophical medicine as either a sole or adjunctive treatment for any illness or condition , but failed to find a single study that met the inclusion criteria after running seven separate literature searches .
But what really concerns me , so far as this article goes , is what one discovers on digging into the nature of so - called ‘ Goethean science ’ as it ’s practiced within Steiner Schools .
Goethean Science is somewhat difficult to describe in simple terms , largely because answers to the question ‘ what is Goethean science ? ‘ are almost invariably wrapped up in copious layers of cod philosophy and psychobabble , but it is possible to get something of a flavour of how it differs from real science from this statement .
The idea is that the Goethean does not need to superimpose a rationalistic or reductionistic explanatory mechanism over top of the observed phenomenon , but rather simply takes the intuitive imaginative experience at face value .
A philosopher would call that a phenomenological approach .
A scientist would call it ‘ making shit up ’ – and that ’s pretty much the size of it .
So - called Goethean ‘ scientists ’ simply disregard all the proven tools provided by the scientific method , i.e. logic , reason and evidence , in favour treating their own imaginings and subjective impressions as an alternative form of ‘ scientific truth ’ .
One can easily see the kind of nonsense that this form of spurious reasoning generates in that passage from a paper entitled ‘ Doing Goethean Science ‘ by Craig Holdrege :
In a college botany course I learned why plants that grow in shady places have broader and larger leaves than plants that grow in full sunlight .
The reason given is that plants growing in shade do n’t receive as much light to do photosynthesis .
Therefore they grow larger surfaces with which they can capture more light and produce more organic matter via photo­synthesis .
Plants have developed this strategy to survive and reproduce in shady habitats .
This is a typical functional explanation that makes perfect sense - until you think the matter through a bit further .
The larger the surface area a plant creates , the more substance it needs to build up and sustain its larger body .
Would n’t it be just as effective for the plant to stay very small with narrow leaves ?
In this way it would n’t have to do so much photosynthesis since it could stay small .
Both explanations make sense .
I have yet to find a functional explanation of a phenomenon for which one could n’t find equally plausible alternatives .
Holdrege glibly dismisses what is a standard evolutionary explanation for the predominance of broad leaved plants in shady conditions on the basis that he imagines that bonsai pine trees might prove to be just as effective as solution to the challenge of plant survival in such conditions and that ’s all the ‘ evidence ’ he needs to conclude that the Darwinian account of plant evolution is in error .
The fact that the shadier corners of a typical deciduous forest simply are n’t heaving with bonsai pine trees and , therefore , provide no evidence to support his imaginings is completely irrelevant .
As you might well expect , whenever you find an attempt to fashion an alleged gap in Darwinian evolutionary theory , the idea that life is product of some kind of supernatural special creation wo n’t be following too far behind and , as the noted science education Eugenie C Scott notes in her 1994 article ‘ Waldorf Schools Teach Odd Science , Odd Evolution ‘ this is certainly true of the account of evolution taught in Steiner schools .
The [ Steiner ]
Waldorf version of evolution is especially concerned with the relationship of humans to animals , but this relationship is quite different from that of mainline evolutionists .
“ It becomes apparent that man is a compendium of the animal kingdom ; alternatively expressed , that the animal kingdom is the human being spread out . ”
The human “ essence ” passed through a number of “ spiritual states ” on the way to becoming human , which was a relatively recent event .
“ Dr. Steiner considers animals to be the by - products of human development .
Man has been involved from the beginning but not in a physical form .
Man existed spiritually and the animal forms represent physically incarnated soul forces which the human being had to dispense with in order to mature sufficiently to receive the ego .
…
As in life … we are trying to overcome the lower passions to evolve to something higher , so throughout evolution , the passions were separated out from man and these were incorporated as animals . ”
For our final example of the kind of rubbish that passes for ‘ science ’ in Steiner education we ’ll leave the biological sciences and turn to a delightful account of a middle school physics lesson as related by Christian Smits in a paper entitled “ A study of the element ‘ Water ’ “ .
Yes , even before we look at of the content of the paper , there ’s a pretty obvious problem to be addressed .
From chemistry we know that there are 92 naturally occurring chemical elements plus something of the order of another 25 or Transuranic elements that scientists have managed to create , artificially , within nuclear reactors , none of which are actually water …
… or air , fire and earth , all of which Steinerians consider to be elements as well .
Aristotelian dogma is , sad to say , alive and well and still being taught as ‘ science ’ in Steiner schools .
That said , the subject at hand is physics and what Smits ’ paper provides is an account of the teaching of some of the physical properties of water to a class of 12 year olds in a Steiner school which includes this absurdly florid attempt to account for the spherical shape of water droplets …
In beautiful water drops that shine while falling , we see the globular tendency .
Yet we also see the potential for water to collect in a round globe in the huge formations of the oceans of the world .
Also solid materials do as water - they join in the globular form .
All erosion and disintegration tend to create globes .
The fact that materials pack together from every direction and build a globe appears as primeval phenomena in the shape of a water drop .
These observations result in what we normally call gravitation .
Phenomenally all of the parts of physical materials trying to collect in a common globular form …
… A water level is also a globe , or more correctly defined as part of a globe .
If you build a house anywhere on the surface of the earth , the level will follow the surface of the earth , Gravity causes this effect .
It collects everything into a middle point .
But fluids have the ability to pull back into themselves .
Because of gravity they can form globe within and of themselves .
Conclusion : globular tendency = gravity .
We can say that solid bodies are individualized in their ability to pull together - they individualize gravity - while liquids collect in a unified gravitational form .
In other words , liquids , when they are as small as a drop , can break free from the power of gravity and create their own world .
Talk about filling kids ’ heads with rubbish !
Water droplets take on a spherical form due to surface tension which arises from intermolecular forces , not gravity – gravitational forces between atoms / molecules are simply too weak in a small water drop to cause it to coalesce in such a fashion and are overridden by the stronger intermolecular forces , and as for solids ‘ individualizing ’ gravity , that ’s just complete and utter bollocks as is the suggestion that liquids ‘ break free from the power of gravity and create their own world ’ when in droplet form .
Little wonder then that , only last year , Stockholm University chose to discontinue its teacher training course in Steiner education on the grounds that Steiner science literature contains ‘ too much myth and too little fact ’ .
The DCSF ’s ‘ Diversity Agenda ’ in action
Now you may well wonder , having read all that , just how the hell the DCSF managed to overlook all this in arriving at the decision to foist an unwanted Steiner Academy on the residents of Much Dewchurch ?
First , the DCSF commissioned a research study into Steiner Education in England from a small group of academics who are active proponents of so - called ‘ alternative education ’ .
Phillip and Glenys Woods , co-authors of the report along with Martin Ashley , are also the authors of a book entitled ‘ Alternative Education for the 21st Century ‘ , the publisher ’s promotional blurb for which states :
This is a unique collection of leading examples of education grounded in alternative philosophies and cultures – from initiatives to create more democratic schools , through Quaker , Buddhist , Islamic , Montessori and Steiner / Waldorf schools , to Maori and First Nations education in Canada and Palestinian Jewish schools in Israel .
Aimed at educational practitioners , leaders , and policy - makers in all types of educational settings , as well as academics and researchers , the book is a resource to help educators think creatively about education at a time when the need to find new ways to nurture spiritual and holistic growth and democratic citizenship has never been greater .
Fostering democratic citizenship is , of course , no bad thing in itself but the assertion that there is any kind of need to find ‘ new ways to nurture spiritual and holistic growth ’ is an altogether more questionable matter , not least in the sense that none of the so - called ‘ alternative philosophies ’ cited above are actually new and only one of them , the Montessori method , has any solid foundations in science and rationalism .
At this point , its also worth noting that Glenys Woods , who appears to have been the principle investigator on the DCSF commissioned study , not only gives her ‘ foundational interest ’ as an educational researcher as ‘ spiritual awareness ’ but also has an interesting sideline as an ‘ angelic reiki healer ’ that she omits from her academic profile .
Once one realises that the authors of the ‘ Woods Report ’ are anything but impartial in their opinions of so - called ‘ alternative education ’ it comes as no great surprise to find that what should otherwise have been treated as serious and well - founded concerns about the nature and character of science ‘ education ’ in Steiner Schools are , in fact , glibly dismissed in a matter of two paragraphs :
A more fundamental challenge for Steiner education is also posed by Jelinek and Sun , who identify as problematic Goethe ’s scientific world view .
They suggest that , whilst Steiner schools ’ science education in many ways is shown to be better than that in mainstream schools , [ Steiner education ] “ should disregard Rudolf Steiner and anthroposophy as the source of accurate scientific concepts ” .
They also draw attention to what they see as the unwillingness of some Steiner educators to countenance correction of the curriculum in the light of advances in scientific knowledge , or clarification of basic errors .
However , it is important to note that Steiner educators would emphasise that much of the science teaching in Steiner schools is based on training the pupils to observe and come to their own conclusions rather than proving someone else ’s theory .
To the extent that they are successful in this , pupils brought up on Steiner principles would be encouraged to critically question all theories , including those of Rudolf Steiner himself .
That may have satisfied policy wonks at the DCSF , but it ’s nowhere near enough for me , so I took the time to dig out Jelinek and Sun ’s full paper to see exactly what they had to say and whether it differs , to any significant extent , to the interpretation of its findings given in the Woods Report .
What Jelinek and Sun actually found
Well , the good news for Steiner educators is that Jelinek and Sun did find some evidence that the heavy emphasis on observation and subjective interpretation in Steiner Schools does give rise to some measurable benefits in terms of a more rapid development of non-verbal inferential reasoning skills in children educated in Steiner Schools as against those in mainstream education .
However , as the authors note , their findings are tentative given the small size of the study and the lack of a control group :
The overall effect of all 3 tasks ( non-verbal logical reasoning , verbal logical reasoning , and magnets ) leads to a tentative conclusion that Waldorf students ’ scientific reasoning and problem solving skills appear to be at or slightly above those of their counterparts in mainstream educational settings .
A more extensive investigation , with large numbers and a control group , is encouraged .
The bad news , which the Woods Report massively underplays , is perhaps best illustrated by unwinding the reports brief exercise in quote mining and placing the reference to dropping Steiner ’s works as a source of accurate scientific concepts in its full context and as it appears in a discussion of what would need to be done to enable Steiner schools to offer a viable science education .
As a first step Waldorf should disregard Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy as the source of accurate scientific concepts .
The basis for this recommendation is that Steiner ’s teachings do not pass the tests of empiricism ( a , b , c and d ) * , are not testable by anyone ( e ) , have not changed much , if any , since Steiner introduced them ( f ) , and rely on paranormal statements that can not be verified ( g ) .
Accepting many of Rudolf Steiner ’s scientific indications in light of the absence of empirical evidence violates the core premises of the scientific paradigm .
The anthroposophical argument is that Rudolf Steiner applied empirical investigations in the spiritual world where he garnered higher spiritual truths , but even if this turns out to be accurate it must be discarded as scientifically valid because it cannot be replicated by anyone .
If and when the scientific paradigm can ever be overturned with an anthroposophical paradigm because a preponderance of empirical evidence demands it , anthroposophists will have reason to celebrate ; but there is little in the current paradigm to suggest this is likely .
* Lettered references refer to an outline of the scientific paradigm which immediately precedes these conclusions in Jelinek and Sun ’s paper .
In short , what Jelinek and Sun actually concluded was that the apparent benefits of Steiner Education ’s methodological approach to science education are routinely and systematically squandered on the teaching of pseudoscientific nonsense , a view emphasised in a subsequent section of the paper which addresses the question of what else Steiner Schools need to do to develop a viable approach to science education after dumping Steiner ’s ideas from the curriculum in their entirety :
Waldorf needs to come to terms with the five defining theories of modern scientific thought ( Wynn & Wiggins , 1997 ) — the five “ Big Ideas ” of Physics , Chemistry , Astronomy , Geology , and Biology .
A “ Big Idea ” , according to Wiggins ( 2001 ) , has : lasting value ; can transfer to other inquiries ; serves as a “ key concept for making important facts , skills , and actions more connected ” ; summarizes “ key findings / expert insights in a subject or discipline ” ; and requires “ uncoverage ” ( i.e. , It has many layers and nuances that are not obvious to the naïve or inexperienced person and is often misunderstood and prone to disagreement .
Therefore one must dig well beyond the surface to grasp it , and in so doing begin to gain a “ depth and breadth of insights into the subject ” ) .
The Big Ideas that Steiner Education can’t handle .
So what are these five ‘ big ideas ’ that Steiner Education has yet to come to terms with ?
Well , in physics the big idea is the atom , which Steiner education disregards on the grounds that it is not directly observable and that atoms are “ … merely models ( imaginations ) that constitute an intermediate virtual concept that is constructed mentally in order to ‘ explain ’… ” .
In chemistry the big idea is the Periodic Law and the chemical properties of atoms , which Steiner Education , at best , relegates to a matter of minor interest due to its dislike of ‘ reductionism ’ , not to mention its penchant for Aristotelian dogma .
In the realm of Astronomy , as you may have already guessed , its Big Bang
Theory that appears to get short - shrift despite Jelinek and Sun noting that Steiner education ’s preference for observational / inferential teaching is actually quite well suited to this field of study where conventional approaches may too readily dive in abstract theory without building an observational foundations – astronomy is , after all , founded on observation .
The problem that the report identifies here is , however , a familiar one …
If “ penetrating the realities ” includes “ penetrating the Big Bang Theory ” then Waldorf ’s approach to astronomy is really quite educationally sound ; in fact , it is a step above many mainstream approaches that de-emphasize direct observational experience and prematurely delve into abstract theories .
On the other hand , if Waldorf chooses to avoid this theory in lieu of alternative explanations then it ignores a theory that , since Hubble ’s discovery in 1923 of another galaxy outside of our own , has substantiated existence of billions of expanding galaxies which , if mathematically calculated in reverse , would theoretically meet at “ zero - time ” , the “ Big Bang ” , some 15 billion years ago .
No prizes for guessing what ‘ alternative explanations ’ means in this context .
In Geology , the big idea is plate tectonics which labours both under Steiner education ’s over - reliance on outdated ideas and failure to keep up with recent scientific development and it preoccupation with mythology .
Jelinek and Sun did find one account of theory of continental drift in a Steiner booklet on Geology …
Kolisko ( 1945,1978 ) discusses Wegener ’s theory of Continental Drift in the Waldorf booklet Geology , but he does so in the context of arguing for the existence of the ancient continent of Atlantis , which split , then sank down into the “ flood ” .
“ If we imagine also that a continent splits in the middle , and moves , it is no longer astonishing that the coast lines fit into each other .
The continent splits , the flood breaks in , and because the continents are movable , displacements happen .
Wegener ’s theory of the Continental Drift , brought into connection with all the facts mentioned before , leads immediately to the conception that there must have been an Atlantic Continent ( p. 32 ) ”
… Wegener ’s theory does no such thing , of course , unless you ’re the kind of nutball who believes that Atlantis was actually a real place in first place .
Finally , the big idea in biology that Steiner education cannot deal with adequately is , of course , Darwinian evolution , of which little can said that has n’t already been well aired in disputes with other devout believers in supernaturalism .
Against this weight of evidence that Steiner educations teaching material include copious amounts of nonsensical pseudoscience Woods offer only the spurious counter argument that the Goethean methodology should operate as a self - correcting mechanism by encouraging children to question these ideas , an argument for which she offers no supporting evidence whatsoever , an assumption for which she offers no supporting evidence .
If this amounts to anything at all then it looks for all the world like an attempt to blow off Jelinek and Sun ’s criticisms without adequately addressing them and without raising suspicions that might prompt detailed scrutiny of the content of Steiner ‘ science ’ education in the UK .
Bending the Rules
Armed with the Woods report , the DCSF went on to strong - arm the local education authority into accepting a Steiner academy on their patch and pretty much waive any requirements that might place educational standards at the school under significant external scrutiny .
No SATS at age seven – not that this would help as Steiner schools do n’t bother with reading at this age .
No Ofsted report prior to conversion – in fact no evidence that the school has ever been inspected by Ofsted other than in terms of its nursery / kindergarten provision .
Oh , and do n’t ask too may questions as to where the money the Steiner Fellowship has to put up came from , because they ’re not saying – all that has been reported is that two unnamed donors put up the £ 1.5 million float that the school needed to convert .
In short , almost no scrutiny of the proposal at all .
It ’s also worth noting that the Hereford Steiner Academy is tied into a research network operating out of Plymouth University , which offers the UK ’s only degree course ( a BA ) in Steiner education .
The network ’s homepage throws up a couple of interesting names and connections .
Christopher Clouder , one of main contacts for this research group , is also the CEO of the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship and the Director of the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education in addition to moonlighting as the founder and international director of the Alliance for Childhood , which seems to have a considerable number of links to the Steiner movement , while Graham Kennish is , amongst other things , the science advisor to the University ’s Steiner Education course and a member of the Anthroposophical Society ’s ‘ science ’ group .
So far as the prospect of obtaining any kind of valid , unbiased , research out of this network goes , the chance of that looks to very much on a par with the chance of Paul Dacre developing a worthwhile sense of journalistic ethics at any point in the foreseeable future .
Digging around the membership of this science group turned up another rather interesting name – Nicholas Kollerstrom – who appears to be yet another anthroposophist , not to mention – since last year – one of the UK ’s better known holocaust deniers and conspiraloons , which rather serves to emphasise the point that if you believe the kind of crap that the Steiner movement peddles as ‘ science ’ then you ’ll believe anything , even to the extent of claiming that Auschwitz was a Nazi version of Butlins .
Enter the Tories … to make things even worse .
New Labour ’s overweening obsession with ‘ choice ’ and ‘ diversity ’ in education is bad enough as its manifested here – £ 16 million pissed away on state - funded Steiner Academy without any hint of adequate scrutiny of the obvious and well documented shortcomings of the Steiner movement ’s approach to science education , or rather , pseudoscience education as it should more accurately be called .
However , if a recent statement by Shadow Education Minister , Michael Gove , is anything to go by the things are set to get even worse if , as many expect , the Conservatives win the next general election .
Under the Tory proposals , new schools entering the state system would be free from the constraints of the statutory national curriculum .
Mr Gove believes many parents think the particular teaching styles “ and atmosphere of the environment ” at Montessori and Steiner schools would suit them and their children .
“ They are educational movements that explicitly want to do things differently , ” he said .
“ They engage the passions of teachers and parents .
They tend to have the results in the end , both in character and ability , that parents would want to see in their children .
“ If we are about enabling choice and diversity it is only right to allow both movements to become essentially state - funded schools . ”
Now as I see it , if you ’re also at all about providing a good education education and improving standards , particularly in the natural sciences , then the very last thing that any politician should be considering is bringing Steiner education into the state system .
Montessori schools are , for the most part , a very different matter .
There ’s a solid body of research evidence to support the claimed benefits of the Montessori method and only difficulty parents are likely to encounter is a touch of caveat emptor – the Montessori name is not a trademark and , in some instances , the extent to which schools operating under the Montessori name can be rather variable with an attended loss of academic and social benefits in those schools that fail to adhere closely to the Montessori method .
Steiner schools , as we ’ve seen , teach the most abject pseudoscientific crap as science and , as such , no amount of appeals to ‘ parental choice ’ and ‘ diversity ’ can reasonably justify pissing taxpayers ’ money down the drain on funding schools that teach utter rubbish in place of established scientific fact .
Will the real Michael Gove please stand up ?
Adding a further twist to this story , only last week Gove stood up in the House of Commons to criticise the standard of science teaching in mainstream education in what was , for the floor of the House , fairly strident terms :
I also congratulate the Minister of State , the hon .
Member for Gedling ( Mr. Coaker ) , on being appointed Minister for schools and learners .
He is a member of the NUT , and I am delighted that his union endorsed our proposals yesterday , calling them “ imaginative ” and in the interests of pupils .
It is good to have his support , and I look forward to more of it .
The Minister is also a member of the Socialist Education Association , which is committed to equality .
Like me , he will be disturbed by the fact that barely 2 per cent .
of pupils eligible for free school meals sit physics or chemistry GCSE , with under 4 per cent .
sitting biology .
Such pupils are 25 times less likely to sit any of those subjects than their wealthier peers .
While the numbers of poor children getting competitive qualifications are declining , so are standards .
This will be of interest to the Secretary of State : in the latest GCSE biology paper , students are asked if we sweat through our kidneys , liver , lungs or skin .
Was not the Royal Society of Chemistry right to suggest that Government changes to the science curriculum had been “ a catastrophe ” ?
Is it not true that the poorest pupils are being hit hardest ?
While , in an op - ed piece in the Yorkshire Post ( June 2008 ) Gove advanced this argument in favour of raising standards in science education :
Universities say that A - levels are no longer preparing children properly for university degrees in maths and science .
Physics departments and chemistry labs are closing .
Employers say that our education system is not delivering the skills we need .
What makes it worse is that there is a growing gap between standards for richer families and the rest .
Just six per cent of pupils in state schools took a combination of biology , chemistry and physics GCSE , compared with 26 per cent of pupils in independent schools .
In some parts of Britain , not a single state school pupil sat biology , chemistry or physics GCSE in 2005 - 6 .
There are whole boroughs where no state school children can get the qualifications which will enable them to compete properly for jobs in medicine , science or technology .
And the divide between the richest and the rest is set to become deeper .
Independent schools , worried that the current GCSE is n’t rigorous enough , are moving to a different exam , the international GCSE , which is tougher and a better preparation for further study .
For the same reason , many independent schools are also moving away from the A - level to a new exam called the pre-U .
The Government does not let state schools count results on these exams in league tables , so state schools , worried about their league table status , do not offer these rigorous qualifications .
There is a real danger now that our society will become less equal and less open to talent as privileged children in private schools sit the rigorous exams which universities and employers really value , while the majority of our children sit exams that do n’t command the confidence they should .
If that ’s what Gove genuinely believes , and by all accounts he ’s a strong advocate of a liberal , knowledge - based education when he ’s not being rooked by the likes of William Rees - Mogg , then why the hell would he even consider promising state funding to schools that teach children that ‘ Lemurian ’ and ‘ Atlantean ’ are valid geological ages , that earth , air , fire and water are elements or that water droplets ‘ break free ’ from the power of gravity ?
For once that ’s not a rhetorical question – I really would like an answer , and I ’m pretty sure Sunny would quite happily publish a response from Gove if one were forthcoming .
You set yourself up for happiness , success , and tremendous opportunity when you have self - confidence .
You become intimately familiar with how you think , speak , and behave around other people , and allow your confidence to inspire confidence in others .
Strong self - confidence to me is the faith I can handle what ’s ahead .
That faith comes from many sources like my faith in Christ , body language , speech patterns , and ways of thinking you ’re about to discover .
It is not having the elusive anxiety - free life nor is it knowing I can get what I want .
Confidence is the opposite .
The more I see that I am a flawed human being , the more courage I have to know things can go to the crapper and that I ’ll come out ahead .
I can still be anxious and not get what I want , yet remain a confident person .
Below is a list of scientifically - backed tips to build unstoppable self - confidence .
They are organized into helpful categories .
Confidence is formed by how we interact with ourselves and others .
Little adjustments in your thinking or behavior that seem silly at first glance , add up to make you a confident person .
Take a handful ( or the whole set ) for a spin .
Instill a surplus of confidence in your life .

In 1977 , a 22 - year - old truck driver named James Cameron went to see Star Wars with a pal .
His friend enjoyed the movie ; Cameron walked out of the theater ready to punch something .
He was a college dropout and spent his days delivering school lunches in Southern California ’s Orange County .
But in his free time , he painted tiny models and wrote science fiction — stories set in galaxies far , far away .
Now he was facing a deflating reality :
He had been daydreaming about the kind of world that Lucas had just brought to life .
Star Wars was the film he should have made .
It got him so angry he bought himself some cheap movie equipment and started trying to figure out how Lucas had done it .
He infuriated his wife by setting up blindingly bright lights in the living room and rolling a camera along a track to practice dolly shots .
He spent days scouring the USC library , reading everything he could about special effects .
He became , in his own words , “ completely obsessed . ”
He quickly realized that he was going to need some money , so he persuaded a group of local dentists to invest $ 20,000 in what he billed as his version of Star Wars .
He and a friend wrote a script called Xenogenesis and used the money to shoot a 12 - minute segment that featured a stop - motion fight scene between an alien robot and a woman operating a massive exoskeleton .
( The combatants were models that Cameron had meticulously assembled . )
The plan was to use the clip to get a studio to back a full - length feature film .
But after peddling it around Hollywood for months , Cameron came up empty and temporarily shelved his ambition to trump Lucas .
The effort did yield something worthwhile : a job with B - movie king Roger Corman .
Hired to build miniature spaceships for the film Battle Beyond the Stars , Cameron worked his way up to become one of Corman ’s visual effects specialists .
In 1981 , he made it to the director ’s chair , overseeing a schlocky horror picture , Piranha II : The Spawning .
One night , after a Piranha editing session , Cameron went to sleep with a fever and dreamed that he saw a robot clawing its way toward a cowering woman .
The image stuck .
Within a year , Cameron used it as the basis for a script about a cyborg assassin sent back in time to kill the mother of a future rebel leader .
This time , he would n’t need any dentists .
The story was so compelling , he was able to persuade a small film financing company to let him direct the picture .
When it was released in 1984 , The Terminator established Arnold Schwarzenegger as a huge star , and James Cameron , onetime truck driver , suddenly became a top - tier director .
Over the next 10 years , Cameron helmed a series of daring films , including Aliens , The Abyss , Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , and True Lies .
Generating $ 1.1 billion in worldwide box office revenue , they gave Cameron the kind of clout he needed to revisit his dream of making an interstellar epic .
So in 1995 , he wrote an 82 - page treatment about a paralyzed soldier ’s virtual quest on a faraway planet after Earth becomes a bleak wasteland .
The alien world , called Pandora , is populated by the Na’vi , fierce 10 - foot - tall blue humanoids with catlike faces and reptilian tails .
Pandora ’s atmosphere is so toxic to humans that scientists grow genetically engineered versions of the Na’vi , so - called avatars that can be linked to a human ’s consciousness , allowing complete remote control of the creature ’s body .
Cameron thought that this project — titled Avatar — could be his next blockbuster .
That is , the one after he finished a little adventure - romance about a ship that hits an iceberg .
Titanic , of course , went on to become the highest - grossing movie of all time .
It won 11 Oscars , including best picture and best director .
Cameron could now make any film he wanted .
So what did he do ?
He disappeared .
Cameron would not release another Hollywood film for 12 years .
He made a few underwater documentaries and did some producing , but he was largely out of the public eye .
For most of that time , he rarely mentioned Avatar and said little about his directing plans .
But now , finally , he ’s back .
On December 18 , Avatar arrives in theaters .
This time , Cameron , who turned 55 this year , did n’t need to build half an ocean liner on the Mexican coast as he did with Titanic , so why did it take one of the most powerful men in Hollywood so long to come out with a single film ?
In part , the answer is that it ’s not easy to out - Lucas George Lucas .
Cameron needed to invent a suite of moviemaking technologies , push theaters nationwide to retool , and imagine every detail of an alien world .
But there ’s more to it than that .
To really understand why Avatar took so long to reach the screen , we need to look back at the making of Titanic .
“ People may not remember , but it was an absolutely vicious time , ” Cameron tells me in the private movie theater at his sprawling home in Malibu , California .
He looks softer than he did at the Oscars in 1998 — his hair is longer and grayer and his face clean - shaven .
But his famous impatience is still close to the surface .
Early in our conversation about what he ’s been doing for the past decade , he informs me that I “ do n’t know fuck , ” so I try to let him explain how things unfolded .
“ When we were filming Titanic , ” he says , “ we were just trying to figure out how much money we were going to lose . ”
Indeed , in the mythic afterglow of box office success , it ’s easy to forget that Titanic was expected to be a disaster .
The project went more than $ 100 million over its initial $ 100 million budget , making it the most expensive movie ever made .
The main financier , 20th Century Fox , pressured Cameron to contain the overruns .
As a sign of his commitment , Cameron agreed to give up his entire directing fee and any profit participation in the movie .
When Titanic missed its July 4 release date , it appeared that the project was in big trouble .
Cameron kept a razor blade on his editing desk with a note :
Use only if film sucks .
“ I just realized I made a $ 200 million chick flick where everyone dies .
What the hell was I thinking ? ” he confided to a friend at the time .
“ I ’m going to have to rebuild my career from scratch . ”
The Hollywood trade journal Variety called it “ the biggest roll of the dice in film history ” and questioned whether Fox would come anywhere near breakeven .
“ Everybody was predicting catastrophic failure , ” says Rae Sanchini , the former president of Cameron ’s production company .
And then , miraculously , this Titanic dodged the iceberg and sailed into the record books , grossing $ 1.8 billion worldwide .
“ We went from the lowest lows to the highest high , ” Sanchini says .
“ It was a disorienting experience for all of us , but most of all for Jim .
He was emotionally and physically exhausted . ”
Still , Sanchini expected the director to bounce back .
Before Titanic , Cameron was excited about Avatar — it was , after all , the space epic he had been dreaming about since 1977 .
But now he did n’t seem very interested .
Part of this ambivalence stemmed from a meeting at Digital Domain , the visual effects company Cameron cofounded in 1993 .
He presented his concept for Avatar and explained that the main characters were 10 - foot - tall blue aliens with narrow waists and powerful legs and torsos .
They had to look utterly real , and the effect could n’t be achieved with prosthetics .
The aliens would have to be computer - generated .
But given the state of the art , his team told him , that was impossible .
It would take too much time and money and an unthinkable amount of computing power .
“ If we make this , we ’re doomed , ” one of the artists told him .
“ It ca n’t be done .
The technology does n’t exist . ”
Cameron was actually relieved .
He did n’t feel like dealing with actors and agents and “ all that Hollywood bullshit . ”
He needed a break .
Luckily , a huge windfall was headed his way .
Fox executives knew it was in their best interest to keep the self - anointed king of the world happy .
They decided to overlook the fact that he had given up his financial stake in Titanic and , in the wake of its historic Oscar run , wrote him a check for tens of millions of dollars .
( Reportedly , Cameron eventually earned more than $ 75 million from the film . )
He would n’t have to work another day in his life .
“ I had my fuck - you money , ” Cameron says .
“ It was time to go play . ”
Here ’s James Cameron ’s idea of play : scuba diving near unexploded , World War II - era depth charges in Micronesia .
In the summer of 2000 , he chartered an 80 - foot boat and invited a group of people to dive down to a fleet of sunken Japanese battleships .
He brought along Vincent Pace , an underwater camera specialist who had worked on Titanic and The Abyss .
Pace , expecting to experiment with hi-def video , packed all of his gear but soon began to suspect that Cameron had something else on his mind .
They were looking over footage from a day ’s dive when Cameron asked Pace a question :
What would it take to build “ the holy grail of cameras , ” a high - definition rig that could deliver feature - film quality in both 2 - D and 3 - D ?
Pace was n’t sure — he was no expert but knew about the cheap red-and - blue paper glasses of conventional 3 - D filmmaking .
They were notoriously uncomfortable , and the images could cause headaches if the projectors were n’t calibrated perfectly .
Cameron believed there must be a way to do it better .
What he really wanted to talk about was his vision for the next generation of cameras : maneuverable , digital , high - resolution , 3 - D .
Inventing such a camera would n’t be easy , but Cameron said he was ready to break new ground .
He mentioned a mysterious , long - gestating film project that would bring viewers to an alien planet .
Cameron did n’t want to make the movie unless viewers could experience the planet viscerally , in 3 - D. Since no satisfactory 3 - D cameras existed , he ’d have to build one .
He ’d brought Pace on the Pacific adventure to ask if the underwater cameraman wanted to help .
His goal seemed kind of extreme , but Pace thought it sounded interesting and signed on .
“ Jim had a clear ambition on the dive trip , ” Pace says .
“ It was fun , but I did n’t really know what I was getting into . ”
Two months later , Cameron sent Pace a $ 17,000 first - class ticket from Los Angeles to Tokyo , and soon they were sitting in front of the engineers at Sony ’s hi-def - camera division .
Pace was there to help persuade
Sony to separate the lens and image sensor from the processor on the company ’s professional - grade HD camera .
The bulky CPU could then be kept a cable - length away from the lens — rather than struggling with a conventional 450 - pound 3 - D system , a camera operator would just have to handle a 50 - pound , dual - lens unit .
Sony agreed to establish a new line of cameras , and , using the prototype , Pace set to work .
After three months , he had fitted the lenses into a rig that allowed an operator to precisely control the 3 - D imaging .
He figured they ’d start with a simple test using an actor or two , but Cameron had other ideas .
He asked Pace to install the gear in a rented World War II - era P - 51 fighter and then sent him up in a B - 17 Flying Fortress .
Cameron jumped in behind the pilot of the P - 51 and once airborne started filming while the pilot fired .50 - caliber machine gun blanks at Pace ’s B - 17 .
“ It was my first taste of what Jim considers ‘ testing , ' ” Pace says .
The camera performed well , delivering accurate 3 - D images that would n’t cause headaches over the course of a long movie .
Pace thought Cameron would launch right into Avatar .
Instead , the director took his new camera 2.3 miles under the sea to film the wreck of the Titanic in 3 - D .
The way Cameron tells it , he was n’t done having “ manly adventures . ”
His partner on these adventures was the deep - sea explorer Andrew Wight .
An intrepid Australian , Wight had explored a collapsing underwater cave , swum with great white sharks , and stared saltwater crocodiles in the eye .
But even he had trouble matching Cameron ’s intensity .
When a hurricane headed up the Eastern seaboard toward their position over the Titanic , Wight assumed they would turn and outrun the weather .
Cameron argued that it was a perfect opportunity to “ tweak the tail ” of the hurricane and get some great storm footage .
The Russian captain of the ship overruled Cameron , and to the director ’s chagrin , they ran .
“ He ’s a tough bugger , ” Wight says .
“ But it ’s not a death wish — it ’s just his idea of fun . ”
Sanchini , the former head of Cameron ’s production company , was n’t quite sure what to make of it .
“ I knew he was tired of the film business , ” she says , “ but I did n’t expect him to keep taking detours . ”
Cameron was n’t just goofing off .
He wanted to make Avatar , and he wanted to do it in digital 3 - D. Unfortunately , theater chains were not adopting the technology .
It would cost approximately $ 100,000 per theater , and exhibitors had to be convinced it would pay off .
They needed some high - profile 3 - D films that could generate enough revenue to justify the conversion .
So Cameron decided to let other directors test his system .
The first was Robert Rodriguez , who shot Spy Kids 3 - D using the new camera .
The picture would still have to be viewed wearing old - fashioned red-and - blue glasses , but Cameron hoped it would demonstrate demand for more 3 - D movies and goad theater owners into investing in next - gen projection systems .
Released in the summer of 2003 , Spy Kids 3 - D made $ 200 million worldwide , but exhibitors remained reluctant to invest in the technology .
Cameron decided to talk to theater owners directly and showed up at their annual convention in March 2005 .
ShoWest , at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino , was in full swing , and Cameron was ready to proselytize .
He laid it on thick , telling exhibitors that the world was “ entering a new age of cinema . ”
And in case the inspirational approach did n’t work , he tried something more ominous , telling them that those who did n’t switch would regret it .
By the end of the year only 79 theaters in the entire country could show digital 3 - D movies .
But exhibitors had gotten the message : Between 2005 and 2009 , they added some 3,000 screens capable of showing digital 3 - D .
However , the lack of 3 - D theaters was n’t the only thing holding Cameron back .
Special - effects companies were still struggling to create fully photo- realistic animated characters .
That had begun to change in 2002 , when Peter Jackson ’s Weta Digital in New Zealand debuted Gollum , a stunningly believable computer - generated character who held his own against the hobbits in the Lord of the Rings trilogy .
Cameron finally felt the time had come to try to build a CG world that would be indistinguishable from reality .
So in the spring of 2005 , he met with Fox and asked for a few million dollars to prove he could create just such a world .
The executives had some initial concerns , not all of which were technical .
For instance :
The tails — were the tails on the aliens absolutely necessary ?
“ Yes , ” Cameron said flatly .
“ They have to have tails . ”
He did n’t say anything else .
He did n’t have to .
The Fox executives stopped asking questions and agreed to pay for the test .
Cameron ’s Hollywood clout was intact .
The director spent five weeks putting together the 30 - second test scene .
It depicted an alien and an Avatar running through a forest and talking .
Lucas ’ own Industrial Light & Magic did the effects work , and it was enough to persuade Fox that the project was feasible .
The studio agreed to a budget of $ 195 million , and Cameron was finally back in the director ’s chair .
The first time Cameron set out to out - Lucas Lucas , he had to make do with $ 20,000 and a special effects studio set up in the back bedroom of his house in Orange County .
This time around , money was not an issue , and his special effects were handled by hundreds of artists at Weta and ILM .
But it was n’t all about f/x .
Lucas has had 30 years to expand the Star Wars universe .
The franchise has gotten so big that he has developed a sophisticated system for cataloging and tracking all its far - flung characters , planets , societies , and conflicts .
To conjure something even more elaborate for Avatar , Cameron went looking for expert help .
He started by hiring USC linguistic expert Paul Frommer to invent an entirely new language for the Na’vi , the blue - skinned natives of Pandora .
Frommer came on board in August 2005 and began by asking Cameron what he wanted the language to sound like ?
Did he want clicks and guttural sounds or something involving varying tones ?
To narrow the options , Frommer turned on a microphone and recorded a handful of samples for Cameron .
The director liked ejective consonants , a popping utterance that vaguely resembles choking .
Frommer locked down a “ sound palette ” and started developing the language ’s basic grammatical structure .
Cameron had opinions on whether the modifier in a compound word should come first or last ( first ) and helped establish a rule regarding the nature of nouns .
It took months to create the grammar alone .
“ He ’s a very intense guy , ” Frommer says .
“ He did n’t just tell me to build a language from scratch .
He actually wanted to discuss points of grammar . ”
Thirteen months after he began work on Avatar , Frommer wrote a pamphlet titled Speak Na’vi and started teaching the actors how to pronounce the language .
He held Na’vi boot camps and then went over lines one by one with each actor .
“ Cameron wanted them to be emotional , but they had to do it in a language that never existed , ” Frommer says .
If an actor flubbed a Na’vi word , Frommer would often step in with a correction .
“ There were times when the actors did n’t want me to tell them that they had mispronounced a word that had never been pronounced before , ” he says .
With the language established , Cameron set about naming everything on his alien planet .
Every animal and plant received Na’vi , Latin , and common names .
As if that were n’t enough , Cameron hired Jodie Holt , chair of UC Riverside ’s botany and plant sciences department , to write detailed scientific descriptions of dozens of plants he had created .
She spent five weeks explaining how the flora of Pandora could glow with bioluminescence and have magnetic properties .
When she was done , Cameron helped arrange the entries into a formal taxonomy .
This was work that would never appear onscreen , but Cameron loved it .
He brought in more people , hiring an expert in astrophysics , a music professor , and an archaeologist .
They calculated Pandora ’s atmospheric density and established a tripartite scale structure for the alien music .
When one of the experts brought in the Star Wars Encyclopedia , Cameron glanced at it and said , “ We ’ll do better . ”
Eventually , a team of writers and editors compiled all this information into a 350 - page manual dubbed Pandorapedia .
It documents the science and culture of the imaginary planet , and , as much as anything , it represents the fully realized world Cameron has created .
For fans who want to delve deeper , parts of Pandorapedia will be available online this winter .
Cameron is trying to show me something with a laser pointer .
He queues up a scene toward the end of Avatar and freezes the frame on an image of a large crowd of Na’vi .
He uses the pointer to draw attention to an ornate headdress composed of hundreds of tiny beads .
The onscreen image is amazingly crisp , and the headdress appears utterly real .
Each bead was designed by a digital artist , Cameron says , so it would look handmade .
“ Every leaf , every blade of grass in this world was created , ” he says , and his laser pointer streaks across the screen , alighting on so many things I can’t follow its path .
Back in 1997 , when Cameron was struggling to complete Titanic , disaster seemed right around the corner .
“ We were pegged the biggest idiots in film history , ” he says .
Now he has the opposite problem : Expectations could n’t be higher .
“ It ’s making me work harder , ” he says .
This time , though , Cameron seems to be enjoying the work .
At least there ’s no razor blade next to the editing controls .
“ For Jim , this project was in some ways the antidote to Titanic , ” Sanchini says .
“ He did n’t have to deal with weather , wardrobe problems , historical accuracy , or huge sets .
If the leading lady had a pimple , it was n’t a disaster .
Avatar gave Jim total control . ”
Thirty - two years after realizing that he desperately wanted to make a space epic to rival Star Wars , Cameron has put the finishing touches on his picture .
Now he has to wait to see what the public and critics make of the result .
The days of total control are over .
Contributing editor Joshua Davis ( www.joshuadavis.net) wrote about the world ’s biggest diamond heist in issue 17.04 .
London : A British soldier convicted of a war crime in Iraq says troops there frequently punched and kicked Iraqi prisoners .
Former corporal Donald Payne says he covered up some of the abuses out of sense of " misguided loyalty " .
Payne was court - martialed in 2007 for the death of hotel receptionist Baha Mousa , while the Iraqi man was in British custody in 2003 .
Payne 's evidence comes a few days after Britain 's Ministry of Defense admitted that Iraqi civilians detained by British troops during the US - led war have made some 33 allegations of rape and abuse against soldiers .
The ministry said it is investigating the claims .
Payne gave his evidence in Monday at a public inquiry into Mousa 's death .

Mr Sarkozy would like solid commitments from Germany
This year will be the first time a German chancellor has ever participated in the commemoration of Armistice Day , when Germany was defeated in France .
Some of Angela Merkel 's predecessors have commemorated World War I on French soil before - in 1984 , Chancellor Helmut Kohl took the hand of President Francois Mitterrand at a Verdun grave site .
And in 1998 , then President Jacques Chirac asked Gerhard Schroeder to come to Paris for the Armistice Day events , but the German chancellor controversially turned the invitation down , insisting while it was right to remember past events it was " a mistake to live in the past " .
But this new Franco - German gesture of " togetherness " is more than just a simple one of remembrance .
The official announcement of Mrs Merkel 's plans were made two weeks ago at a joint statement at the Elysee Palace .
It was Mrs Merkel 's first foreign trip after being sworn in as chancellor for a second term and the aim was to send a strong message about the depth of Franco - German ties .
The German leader spoke of joint plans to integrate the young generation into the EU claiming " France and Germany have an exemplary role to play " .
She also spoke of her government 's desire to focus on education , economic growth and research , saying it was " more useful than ever for France and Germany to intensify their cooperation and common action " .
New agenda French President Nicolas Sarkozy is particularly keen to reinvigorate the Franco - German axis .
Germany may be less keen on pursuing a European energy policy Just back from the celebrations marking the fall of the Berlin wall , the French leader would now like to see some solid co-operation commitments .
These include finding consensus on economic policy , greater tax co-ordination , backing for a European plan for energy independence and a new industrial strategy to promote European champions .
French Europe Minister Pierre Lellouche is busy with plans to prepare a new " Franco - German agenda for Europe " which he claims will be a central relationship in the new European configuration .
But despite a warm personal relationship , Germany is slightly colder than France when it comes to making concrete signs of unity .
On the question of energy , for example , Germany enjoys renewed relations with Russia which means it may not wish to spend too much effort on pursuing a European plan for energy independence .
For now , it is Mr Sarkozy who is counting most heavily on the Franco - German relationship
And economic harmony will also be difficult to achieve - Mrs Merkel is keen to balance the books and spend thriftily , while Mr Sarkozy is already on a collision course with the European Union which is ordering France to rein in its spending .
Germany is also much keener on a liberal economy while France is more protectionist .
And Germany is not quite so pro-EU as once it was .
At the end of September this year , after the G20 at Pittsburgh , Mrs Merkel apparently joked she was " Sarkozyfying " her ideas while Mr Sarkozy is said to have retorted that he was " Merkelizing " his .
But for now , it is Mr Sarkozy who is counting most heavily on the Franco - German relationship because , if Britain elects a more Eurosceptic Conservative government next year , France knows it will need a strong friend in Europe .

[ This article 's original title is " Logical Catallactics Versus Mathematical Catallactics . "
It is excerpted from chapter 16 of Human Action .
Robert Murphy has written a study guide for this chapter , available in HTML and PDF . ]
" A very imperfect and superficial metaphor is not a substitute for the services rendered by logical economics . "
The problems of prices and costs have been treated also with mathematical methods .
There have even been economists who held that the only appropriate method of dealing with economic problems is the mathematical method and who derided the logical economists as " literary " economists .
If this antagonism between the logical and the mathematical economists were merely a disagreement concerning the most adequate procedure to be applied in the study of economics , it would be superfluous to pay attention to it .
The better method would prove its preeminence by bringing about better results .
It may also be that different varieties of procedure are necessary for the solution of different problems and that for some of them one method is more useful than the other .
However , this is not a dispute about heuristic questions , but a controversy concerning the foundations of economics .
The mathematical method must be rejected not only on account of its barrenness .
It is an entirely vicious method , starting from false assumptions and leading to fallacious inferences .
Its syllogisms are not only sterile ; they divert the mind from the study of the real problems and distort the relations between the various phenomena .
The ideas and procedures of the mathematical economists are not uniform .
There are three main currents of thought which must be dealt with separately .
The first variety is represented by the statisticians who aim at discovering economic laws from the study of economic experience .
They aim to transform economics into a " quantitative " science .
Their program is condensed in the motto of the Econometric Society : " Science is measurement . "
The fundamental error implied in this reasoning has been shown above .
Experience of economic history is always experience of complex phenomena .
It can never convey knowledge of the kind the experimenter abstracts from a laboratory experiment .
Statistics is a method for the presentation of historical facts concerning prices and other relevant data of human action .
It is not economics and cannot produce economic theorems and theories .
The statistics of prices is economic history .
The insight that , ceteris paribus , an increase in demand must result in an increase in prices is not derived from experience .
Nobody ever was or ever will be in a position to observe a change in one of the market data ceteris paribus .
There is no such thing as quantitative economics .
All economic quantities we know about are data of economic history .
No reasonable man can contend that the relations between price and supply is , in general or in respect of certain commodities , constant .
We know , on the contrary , that external phenomena affect different people in different ways , that the reactions of the same people to the same external events vary , and that it is not possible to assign individuals to classes of men reacting in the same way .
This insight is a product of our aprioristic theory .
It is true the empiricists reject this theory ; they pretend that they aim to learn only from historical experience .
However , they contradict their own principles as soon as they pass beyond the unadulterated recording of individual single prices and begin to construct series and to compute averages .
A datum of experience and a statistical fact is only a price paid at a definite time and a definite place for a definite quantity of a certain commodity .
The arrangement of various price data in groups and the computation of averages are guided by theoretical deliberations which are logically and temporally antecedent .
The extent to which certain attending features and circumstantial contingencies of the price data concerned are taken or not taken into consideration depends on theoretical reasoning of the same kind .
Nobody is so bold as to maintain that a rise of a percent in the supply of any commodity must always — in every country and at any time — result in a fall of b percent in its price .
But as no quantitative economist ever ventured to define precisely on the ground of statistical experience the special conditions producing a definite deviation from the ratio a : b , the futility of his endeavors is manifest .
Moreover , money is not a standard for the measurement of prices ; it is a medium whose exchange ratio varies in the same way , although as a rule not with the same speed and to the same extent , in which the mutual exchange ratios of the vendible commodities and services vary .
There is hardly any need to dwell longer upon the exposure of the claims of quantitative economics .
In spite of all the high - sounding pronouncements of its advocates , nothing has been done for the realization of its program .
The late Henry Schultz devoted his research to the measurement of elasticities of demand for various commodities .
Professor Paul H. Douglas has praised the outcome of Schultz 's studies as " a work as necessary to help make economics a more or less exact science as was the determination of atomic weights for the development of chemistry . "
The truth is that Schultz never embarked upon a determination of the elasticity of demand for any commodity as such ; the data he relied upon were limited to certain geographical areas and historical periods .
His results for a definite commodity , for instance potatoes , do not refer to potatoes in general , but to potatoes in the United States in the years from 1875 to 1929 .
They are , at best , rather questionable and unsatisfactory contributions to various chapters of economic history .
They are certainly not steps toward the realization of the confused and contradictory program of quantitative economics .
It must be emphasized that the two other varieties of mathematical economics are fully aware of the futility of quantitative economics .
For they have never ventured to make any magnitudes as found by the econometricians enter into their formulas and equations and thus to adapt them for the solution of particular problems .
There is in the field of human action no means for dealing with future events other than that provided by understanding .
" The mathematical method must be rejected not only on account of its barrenness .
It is an entirely vicious method , starting from false assumptions and leading to fallacious inferences . "
The second field treated by mathematical economists is that of the relation of prices and costs .
In dealing with these problems the mathematical economists disregard the operation of the market process and moreover pretend to abstract from the use of money inherent in all economic calculations .
However , as they speak of prices and costs in general and confront prices and costs , they tacitly imply the existence and the use of money .
Prices are always money prices , and costs cannot be taken into account in economic calculation if not expressed in terms of money .
If one does not resort to terms of money , costs are expressed in complex quantities of diverse goods and services to be expended for the procurement of a product .
On the other hand , prices — if this term is applicable at all to exchange ratios determined by barter — are the enumeration of quantities of various goods against which the " seller " can exchange a definite supply .
The goods which are referred to in such " prices " are not the same to which the " costs " refer .
A comparison of such prices in kind and costs in kind is not feasible .
That the seller values the goods he gives away less than those he receives in exchange for them , that the seller and the buyer disagree with regard to the subjective valuation of the two goods exchanged , and that an entrepreneur embarks upon a project only if he expects to receive for the product goods that he values higher than those expended in their production , all this we know already on the ground of praxeological comprehension .
It is this aprioristic knowledge that enables us to anticipate the conduct of an entrepreneur who is in a position to resort to economic calculation .
But the mathematical economist deludes himself when he pretends to treat these problems in a more general way by omitting any reference to terms of money .
It is vain to investigate instances of nonperfect divisibility of factors of production without reference to economic calculation in terms of money .
Such a scrutiny can never go beyond the knowledge already available ; namely that every entrepreneur is intent upon producing those articles the sale of which will bring him proceeds that he values higher than the total complex of goods expended in their production .
But if there is no indirect exchange and if no medium of exchange is in common use , he can succeed , provided he has correctly anticipated the future state of the market , only if he is endowed with a superhuman intellect .
He would have to take in at a glance all exchange ratios determined at the market in such a way as to assign in his deliberations precisely the place due to every good according to these ratios .
It can not be denied that all investigations concerning the relation of prices and costs presuppose both the use of money and the market process .
But the mathematical economists shut their eyes to this obvious fact .
They formulate equations and draw curves which are supposed to describe reality .
In fact they describe only a hypothetical and unrealizable state of affairs , in no way similar to the catallactic problems in question .
They substitute algebraic symbols for the determinate terms of money as used in economic calculation and believe that this procedure renders their reasoning more scientific .
They strongly impress the gullible layman .
In fact they only confuse and muddle things which are satisfactorily dealt with in textbooks of commercial arithmetic and accountancy .
Some of these mathematicians have gone so far as to declare that economic calculation could be established on the basis of units of utility .
They call their methods utility analysis .
Their error is shared by the third variety of mathematical economics .
The characteristic mark of this third group is that they are openly and consciously intent upon solving catallactic problems without any reference to the market process .
Their ideal is to construct an economic theory according to the pattern of mechanics .
They again and again resort to analogies with classical mechanics which in their opinion is the unique and absolute model of scientific inquiry .
There is no need to explain again why this analogy is superficial and misleading and in what respects purposive human action radically differs from motion , the subject matter of mechanics .
It is enough to stress one point , viz. , the practical significance of the differential equations in both fields .
The deliberations which result in the formulation of an equation are necessarily of a nonmathematical character .
The formulation of the equation is the consummation of our knowledge ; it does not directly enlarge our knowledge .
Yet , in mechanics , the equation can render very important practical services .
As there exist constant relations between various mechanical elements and as these relations can be ascertained by experiments , it becomes possible to use equations for the solution of definite technological problems .
Our modern industrial civilization is mainly an accomplishment of this utilization of the differential equations of physics .
No such constant relations exist , however , between economic elements .
The equations formulated by mathematical economics remain a useless piece of mental gymnastics and would remain so even it they were to express much more than they really do .
A sound economic deliberation must never forget these two fundamental principles of the theory of value : First , valuing that results in action always means preferring and setting aside ; it never means equivalence or indifference .
Second , there is no means of comparing the valuations of different individuals or the valuations of the same individuals at different instants other than by establishing whether or not they arrange the alternatives in question in the same order of preference .
In the imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy , all factors of production are employed in such a way that each of them renders the most valuable service .
No thinkable and possible change could improve the state of satisfaction ; no factor is employed for the satisfaction of a need a if this employment prevents the satisfaction of a need b that is considered more valuable than the satisfaction of a .
It is , of course , possible to describe this imaginary state of the allocation of resources in differential equations and to visualize it graphically in curves .
But such devices do not assert anything about the market process .
They merely mark out an imaginary situation in which the market process would cease to operate .
The mathematical economists disregard the whole theoretical elucidation of the market process and evasively amuse themselves with an auxiliary notion employed in its context and devoid of any sense when used outside of this context .
In physics we are faced with changes occurring in various sense phenomena .
We discover a regularity in the sequence of these changes and these observations lead us to the construction of a science of physics .
We know nothing about the ultimate forces actuating these changes .
They are , for the searching mind , ultimately given and defy any further analysis .
What we know from observation is the regular concatenation of various observable entities and attributes .
It is this mutual interdependence of data that the physicist describes in differential equations .
In praxeology , the first fact we know is that men are purposively intent upon bringing about some changes .
It is this knowledge that integrates the subject matter of praxeology and differentiates it from the subject matter of the natural sciences .
We know the forces behind the changes , and this aprioristic knowledge leads us to a cognition of the praxeological processes .
The physicist does not know what electricity " is . "
He knows only phenomena attributed to something called electricity .
But the economist knows what actuates the market process .
It is only thanks to this knowledge that he is in a position to distinguish market phenomena from other phenomena and to describe the market process .
Now , the mathematical economist does not contribute anything to the elucidation of the market process .
He merely describes an auxiliary makeshift employed by the logical economists as a limiting notion , the definition of a state of affairs in which there is no longer any action and the market process has come to a standstill .
That is all he can say .
What the logical economist sets forth in words when defining the imaginary constructions of the final state of rest and the evenly rotating economy and what the mathematical economist himself must describe in words before he embarks upon his mathematical work , is translated into algebraic symbols .
A superficial analogy is spun out too long , that is all .
Both the logical and the mathematical economists assert that human action ultimately aims at the establishment of such a state of equilibrium and would reach it if all further changes in data were to cease .
But the logical economist knows much more than that .
He shows how the activities of enterprising men , the promoters and speculators , eager to profit from discrepancies in the price structure , tend toward eradicating such discrepancies and thereby also toward blotting out the sources of entrepreneurial profit and loss .
He shows how this process would finally result in the establishment of the evenly rotating economy .
This is the task of economic theory .
The mathematical description of various states of equilibrium is mere play .
The problem is the analysis of the market process .
" Nobody ever was or ever will be in a position to observe a change in one of the market data ceteris paribus . "
A comparison of both methods of economic analysis makes us understand the meaning of the often - raised request to enlarge the scope of economic science by the construction of a dynamic theory instead of the mere occupation with static problems .
With regard to logical economics , this postulate is devoid of any sense .
Logical economics is essentially a theory of processes and changes .
It resorts to the imaginary constructions of changelessness merely for the elucidation of the phenomena of change .
But it is different with mathematical economics .
Its equations and formulas are limited to the description of states of equilibrium and nonacting .
It cannot assert anything with regard to the formation of such states and their transformation into other states as long as it remains in the realm of mathematical procedures .
As against mathematical economics the request for a dynamic theory is well substantiated .
But there is no means for mathematical economics to comply with this request .
The problems of process analysis , i.e. , the only economic problems that matter , defy any mathematical approach .
The introduction of time parameters into the equations is no solution .
It does not even indicate the essential shortcomings of the mathematical method .
The statements that every change involves time and that change is always in the temporal sequence are merely a way of expressing the fact that , as far as there is rigidity and unchangeability , there is no time .
The main deficiency of mathematical economics is not the fact that it ignores the temporal sequence , but that it ignores the operation of the market process .
The mathematical method is at a loss to show how , from a state of nonequilibrium , those actions spring up which tend toward the establishment of equilibrium .
It is , of course , possible to indicate the mathematical operations required for the transformation of the mathematical description of a definite state of nonequilibrium into the mathematical description of the state of equilibrium .
But these mathematical operations by no means describe the market process actuated by the discrepancies in the price structure .
The differential equations of mechanics are supposed to describe precisely the motions concerned at any instant of the time traveled through .
The economic equations have no reference whatever to conditions as they really are in each instant of the time interval between the state of nonequilibrium and that of equilibrium .
Only those entirely blinded by the prepossession that economics must be a pale replica of mechanics will underrate the weight of this objection .
A very imperfect and superficial metaphor is not a substitute for the services rendered by logical economics .
" There is no such thing as quantitative economics . "
In every chapter of catallactics , the devastating consequences of the mathematical treatment of economics can be tested .
It is enough to refer to two instances only .
One is provided by the so - called equation of exchange , the mathematical economists ' futile and misleading attempt to deal with changes in the purchasing power of money .
The second can be best expressed in referring to Professor Schumpeter 's dictum according to which consumers , in evaluating consumers ' goods " ipso facto also evaluate the means of production which enter into the production of these goods . "
It is hardly possible to construe the market process in a more erroneous way .
Economics is not about goods and services ; it is about the actions of living men .
Its goal is not to dwell upon imaginary constructions such as equilibrium .
These constructions are only tools of reasoning .
The sole task of economics is analysis of the actions of men , is the analysis of processes .
( Wired ) --
Google is set to become your new phone company , perhaps reducing your phone bill to zilch in the process .
Seriously .
Google has bought Gizmo5 , an online phone company that is akin to Skype but based on open protocols and with a lot fewer users .
TechCrunch , which broke the news on Monday , reported that Google spent $ 30 million on the company .
Google announced the Gizmo acquisition on Thursday afternoon Pacific Time .
Gizmo5 's founder Michael Robertson , a brash serial entrepreneur , will become an Adviser to Google Voice .
It 's a potent recipe -- take Gizmo5 's open standards - based online calling system .
Add to it the new ability to route calls on Google 's massive network of cheap fiber .
Toss in Google Voice 's free phone number , which will ring your mobile phone , your home phone and your Gizmo5 client on your laptop . ÿþ
Meanwhile you can use Gizmo5 to make ultracheap outgoing calls to domestic and international phone numbers , and free calls to Skype , Google Talk , Yahoo and AIM users .
You could make and receive calls that bypass the per-minute billing on your smartphone .
Then layer on deluxe phone services like free SMS , voicemail transcription , customized call routing , free conference calls and voicemails sent as recordings to your e-mail account , and you have a phone service that competes with Skype , landlines and the Internet telephone offerings from Vonage and cable companies .
That 's not just pie in - the - sky dreaming .
Ask longtime VOIP watcher and consultant Andy Abramson , who introduced the idea of integrating Gizmo5 and Grand Central ( now Google Voice ) , long before Google bought either .
" Google is now the the uncommon carrier , " Abramson said , punning on the iconic 7 - UP commercials and the phrase " common carrier . "
That refers to phone companies that operate on the traditional publicly switched network -- a status that gives them benefits and obligations .
" If AT&T is Coca - Cola , Google is now 7 - UP , " Abramson added .
" All of a sudden you have something that offers more than Skype , " Abramson said , saying the combo could now put Google in competition with phone and cable companies , IP " telephony " ( VOIP ) companies and Vonage .
" But now you can do everything with Google and pay nothing and have a platform where engineers can build new things . "
In fact , Gizmo5 offered a rogue version of that service for $ 6 a month until last week .
On November 2 , Gizmo5 abruptly canceled the two - month old " residential service , " which paired the free phone number available through Google Voice with Gizmo 's Internet calling service to provide the equivalent of a home - phone replacement like Vonage .
Now , that service has been wiped off the Internet and , more intriguingly , Google 's cache of the page disappeared the day after the acquisition was reported .
For $ 6 a month , Gizmo5 residential users got 300 minutes a month of outbound calling anywhere in the United States , unlimited incoming calls on their home computers or even home phones ( using a broadband - to - phone network conversion box ) and E911 service ( which means 911 calls work like landlines calls do , once you register your home address ) .
It 's not too surprising that offer got taken down .
For one Google is already trying to steer clear of U.S. regulators by making it clear that Google Voice is n't a replacement for a home phone since you have to have phone service from some other company to use it .
You can forward calls from a Google Voice number to your Gizmo5 number , but you must have a mobile or landline number as well .
Google does n't say it , but clearly it hopes that restriction will keep the service from incurring the common carrier obligations attached to the regular phone system ( PSTN ) , and the 911 and wiretapping requirements that apply to Internet telephony and to traditional copper wire phones .
AT&T has already tried to sic federal regulators on Google Voice because Google is blocking outgoing calls to a handful of shady calling services mostly free conference - calling services that exploit federal rules that let rural phone companies charge high fees to connect calls to rural areas .
AT&T itself has sued similar services that play this arbitrage game , and complaining to the feds may have only brought more attention to an issue the FCC has procrastinating fixing for too long .
Gizmo5 will also help save Google money on phone - call termination fees as users start to use computer - based clients to connect to Google Voice .
That would allow Google to recoup the purchase price of $ 30 million in little time , if only it saves even a few dollars per user per year .
Google also gets Michael Robertson , a troublemaker with technical chops .
Robertson made millions from MP3.com in the dot - com boom , despite drawing lawsuits from major record labels for creating innovative services .
He was later sued by Microsoft for his startup Lindows , which made Linux installations for cheap PCs .
And his current music venture , MP3tunes.com , is being sued by EMI .
Though still in invite - only mode , Google Voice has about 580,000 active users and nearly 1.5 million registered users , according to a Google filing with the FCC .
If you are interested in the combination , you might want to sign up for Gizmo5 before the acquisition is formally announced , since Google often freezes new registrations at companies it acquires until it figures out how to integrate the technology .

Along with Satanism , Scientology and the GOP ’s friends over at the Moonie newspaper .
I ’ve often said that the radical Mormon activists who we ’re forced to deal with – the ones who forcibly baptize dead Jewish Holocaust victims in an effort to steal their souls , the ones who spend tens of millions in other states to force Christians and others to live according to Mormon views of morality – bear a striking resemblance to Scientologists .
We have a Scientology mother ship here in DC , and if you ever talk to any of its inhabitants it ’s remarkably like talking to activist Mormons .
Sweet as pie to a fault until you question them on anything , then the long knives , and the lawyers , come out .
Here ’s the report , in French .
Yesterday we received anonymous tips that pointed towards substantial December 11th OTA updates for both the Motorola Droid and the HTC Droid Eris .
Whether or not that specifically will definitely happen cannot be confirmed , but a December 11th Android update is now inevitable .
Google has just sent out an E - Mail to Android Developers noting a new version of the Developer Distribution Agreement and requiring acceptance of the agreement by ( guess when ) December 11 , 2009 12:00:00 AM Pacific Standard Time .
Here is the E - Mail :
We ’d like to let you know that there is a new Developer Distribution Agreement ( DDA ) for Android Market .
The next time you sign in to the Android Market publisher website , you ’ll be asked to agree to these new terms before continuing .
If you have not accepted the new DDA by Friday , December 11 , 2009 12:00:00 AM Pacific Standard Time , your application (s ) will be unpublished from the Android Market .
First things first – if you ’re a developer , get your booty on over to the new agreement and accept it .
If it slips your mind , all your stuff could be unpublished and that would just be a pain in the , well … booty .
But what I REALLY wanted to know is what this agreement CONTAINS if anything interesting .
It would probably be best to highlight what has been updated / changed from the original to pinpoint the specific need of the update , but I ’m unaware of what the first agreement contained so we ’re analyzing this with fresh eyes .
Here are some of the topics popping up that interested me :
Shall we ?
First of all , I have been under the assumption that when you buy an app / game from Android Market , you have 24 - hours to return it .
I ’m not sure if this changed earlier , but in the newest agreement developer ’s commit to offering Android users a 48 - hour application return window .
This means when you buy an application you ’ll have much more time to test it and use it , making a more informed decision if it is worth your money .
Wonderful .
( See 3.4 Special Refund Requirements )
When a developer DOES make a transaction for a PAID application , they are charged a tranasction fee , essentially Google / Carrier are taking a cut of the revenue .
Oddly enough , Google provides a link that specifically states these transaction fees but , when I visited it , received only a 404 Not Found Error .
I agreed to the contract with the 404 Not Found error so I ’ll take that as a “ their transaction fee ” is not found meaning I get 100 % of everything .
Okay Google ?
Great thanks .
( See 3.2 )
Google also claims the responsibility to “ automatically terminate ” your account “ if you are ( a ) not a Developer in good standing . ”
What exactly denotes a Developer in good standing ?
I ’m not exactly sure but it seems that Product ratings , uninstall rates , refund rates and other factors come into play .
Not only that , but Google assigns developers a “ Developer Composite Score ” based on your history and uses this to rank existing apps / games as well as determine placement / inclusion / ratings for new launches in Android Market .
( See 4.9 Product Ratings )
But who REALLY cares about poor Product Ratings getting you kicked out of the market when Google reserves the right to kick you out for no reason , and individual manufacturers / carriers can kick you out because your app does n’t meet THEIR requirements .
( See 7.2 Google Takedowns )
One tidbit of information I found REALLY interesting is the admission that Google is collecting usage statistics on the market and particular devices and is for aggregate analysis .
You know , to help make things better .
So guess what I just did ?
Sent Google a written request for limited aggregate data .
( See 9.1 and 9.2 )
Those are the things I found most interesting … but if you want to dig through the entire agreement be my guest – I have pasted it in its entirety below .
Developer ’s are being asked to confirm with “ I agree and I am willing to associate my credit card and account registration above with this updated Android Market Developer Distribution Agreement . ” :
Android Market Developer Distribution Agreement

3. Pricing and Payments .
3.1 This Agreement covers both Products you choose to distribute for free and Products for which you charge a fee ( once payment processing is enabled on the Market ) .
In order to charge a fee for your Products , you must have a valid Payment Account under a separate agreement with a Payment Processor .
If you already have a Payment Account with a Payment Processor before signing up for the Market , then the terms of this Agreement shall supersede your Payment Account terms and condition for Products sold via the Market .
You may set the price for your Products in the currencies permitted by the Payment Processor .
The Market may display to users the price of Products in their native currency , but it is not responsible for the accuracy of currency rates or conversion
3.2
The price you set for Products will determine the amount of payment you will receive .
A Transaction Fee , as defined below , will be charged on the sales price and apportioned to the Payment Processor and , if one exists , the Authorized Carrier .
The remainder ( sales price less Transaction Fee ) will be remitted to you .
The “ Transaction Fee ” is set forth at http://www.android.com/support/market/bin/answer.py?answer=112622
and may be revised by Google from time to time .
Developer is responsible for determining if a Product is taxable and the applicable tax rate for the Payment Processor to collect for each taxing jurisdiction where Products are sold .
Developer is responsible for remitting taxes to the appropriate taxing authority .
3.3
You may also choose to distribute Products for free .
If the Product is free , you will not be charged a Transaction Fee .
You may not collect future charges from users for copies of the Products that those users were initially allowed to download for free .
This is not intended to prevent distribution of free trial versions of the Product with an “ upsell ” option to obtain the full version of the Product :
Such free trials for Products are encouraged .
However , if you want to collect fees after the free trial expires , you must collect all fees for the full version of the Product through the Payment Processor on the Market .
In this Agreement , “ free ” means there are no charges or fees of any kind for use of the Product .
All fees received by Developers for Products distributed via the Market must be processed by the Market ’s Payment Processor .
3.4 Special Refund Requirements .
The Payment Processor ’s standard terms and conditions regarding refunds will apply except the following terms apply to your distribution of Products on the Market .
Products that can be previewed by the buyer ( such as ringtones and wallpapers ) :
No refund is required or allowed .
Products that cannot be previewed by the buyer ( such as applications ) :
You authorize Google to give the buyer a full refund of the Product price if the buyer requests the refund within 48 hours after purchase .
3.5 You Support Your Product .
You will be solely responsible for support and maintenance of your Products and any complaints about your Products .
Your contact information will be displayed in each application detail page and made available to users for customer support purposes .
Failure to provide adequate support for your Products may result in low Product ratings , less prominent product exposure , low sales and billing disputes .
Except in cases when multiple disputes are initiated by a user with abnormal dispute history , billing disputes received by Payment Processor for Products sold for less than $ 10 may be automatically charged back to the Developer , in addition to any handling fees charged by the Payment Processor .
Chargeback requests for Products $ 10 or more will be handled in accordance with the Payment Processor ’s standard policy .
3.6 Reinstalls .
Users are allowed unlimited reinstalls of each application distributed via the Market , provided however that if you remove a Product (s ) from the Market pursuant to clauses ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) or ( iv ) of Section 7.1 , such Product (s ) shall be removed from all portions of the Market and users shall no longer have a right or ability to reinstall the affected Products .
4. Use of the Market by You
4.1 Except for the license rights granted by you in Section 5 below , Google agrees that it obtains no right , title or interest from you ( or your licensors ) under this Agreement in or to any of Products , including any intellectual property rights which subsist in those applications .
4.2
You agree to use the Market only for purposes that are permitted by ( a ) this Agreement and ( b ) any applicable law , regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions ( including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries ) .
4.3
You agree that if you use the Market to distribute Products , you will protect the privacy and legal rights of users .
If the users provide you with , or your Product accesses or uses , user names , passwords , or other login information or personal information , you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your Product , and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users .
Further , your Product may only use that information for the limited purposes for which the user has given you permission to do so .
If your Product stores personal or sensitive information provided by users , it must do so securely and only for as long as it is needed .
But if the user has opted into a separate agreement with you that allows you or your Product to store or use personal or sensitive information directly related to your Product ( not including other products or applications ) then the terms of that separate agreement will govern your use of such information .
If the user provides your Product with Google Account information , your Product may only use that information to access the user ’s Google Account when , and for the limited purposes for which , the user has given you permission to do so .
4.4 Prohibited Actions .
You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Market , including the development or distribution of Products , that interferes with , disrupts , damages , or accesses in an unauthorized manner the devices , servers , networks , or other properties or services of any third party including , but not limited to , Android Users , Google or any mobile network operator .
You may not use customer information obtained from the Market to sell or distribute Products outside of the Market .
4.5 Non-Compete .
You may not use the Market to distribute or make available any Product whose primary purpose is to facilitate the distribution of Products outside of the Market .
4.6

4.8 The Market will allow you to protect your Products so that users may not share Products with other users or devices .
4.9 Product Ratings .
The Market will allow users to rate Products .
Only users who download the applicable Product will be able to rate it .
Product ratings will be used to determine the placement of Products on the Market with higher rated Products generally given better placement , subject to Google ’s ability to change placement at Google ’s sole discretion .
The Market may also assign you a composite score for any Product that has not received user ratings .
A Developer Composite Score will be a representation of the quality of your Product based on your history and will be determined at Google ’s sole discretion .
For new Developers without Product history , Google may use or publish performance measurements such as uninstall and / or refund rates to identify or remove Products that are not meeting acceptable standards , as determined by Google .
Google reserves the right to display Products to users in a manner that will be determined at Google ’s sole discretion .
Your Products may be subject to user ratings to which you may not agree .
You may contact Google if you have any questions or concerns regarding such ratings at http://market.android.com/support/publish.

Do Not Kill Yourself Because John Irving Said
In an interview for " Big Think " this week , John Irving admits that there 's no way his first novel -- " Setting Free the Bears " -- would sell these days and claims that if he were a 27 - year - old novelist trying to get his first book published now , he 'd seriously consider suicide .
As a 27 - year - old writer trying to get his first novel published , I 'd much rather kill John Irving .
And Kundera , and Mailer , and Roth , and Updike , and Pynchon , and Wolfe ... There is plenty of hope for " literary fiction . "
For instance , despite their cloddishness , genre fiction writers are so beloved because they like to experiment .
They take risks .
They seem to ENJOY writing and do n't just view it as the most important duty of their caste .
Often , they are female .
Luckily , the 27 - year - old fiction writers of my generation are not all privileged , Ivy - League - educated , tentative , moody , New England assholes ( not ALL of them anyway ) or fiction would be in big trouble .
A hostile and difficult climate for fiction will only force new novelists to craft tighter prose and tell more interesting stories .
We must get back to basics and reject the self - indulgent wallowing of the preceding generation , those monumental egos who turned fiction into a place to bask like barking seals on rocks of Self and who forgot that the pleasure of narrative is to extend beyond the possible into the imaginary .
Comic book writers took up the slack for awhile , but it is time for fiction writers to roll up their sleeves and get dirty again .
To titillate , amuse , satisfy , provoke , soothe , and outrage !
To make worlds !
To seduce with words instead of cataloging the glories of past seductions ... Irving is the way backward .
Murakami is the way forward .
A harsh and demanding environment for fiction can only be corrective against its current bloated indulgences .
The best stories always come out of the wasteland .
The crumbling edifice of modern publishing is the greatest opportunity for fiction writers since the dawn of the printing press .
Our stories are no longer being collated and refereed by a tight - fisted group of white , monied , upper - class intellectuals .
" Brigands , all of them , " said Dickens .

Tell them whatever the fuck you want .
Internet Service Providers are a modern day necessity , but that does n't stop many of us from hating them sometimes .
In many nations , broadband providers top the consumer complaint charts .
If complaints are n't about delivering the promised speeds , they 're about the crappy customer service , billing problems , frequent outages , and the impossibility of switching to another without being cut off from the Internet for months .
So what would it take to craft a truly " cool " ISP , one that attracted legions of adoring customers who sing its praises to everyone they meet ?
Fortunately , ISPs around the world are doing innovative things at prices that will make your jaw drop .
Join us on our worldwide quest to find the coolest ISPs in the world , then get ready to write your own service provider a strongly worded note once you know what else is possible .
Business models
When it comes to business models , it 's clear that customer complaints are n't the only area where broadband providers the world over are equal .
It seems that almost all of them offer the exact same thing ; Internet access and telephony , often combined with television and some generic services like e-mail and space for a website .
Some ISPs can offer hundreds of different combinations by varying speeds , prices , and content packages , but it 's essentially the same " triple play " offer .
In fact , making a triple play offer difficult in many different ways seems a prerequisite for becoming a telecom marketer .
It 's surprising ( and refreshing ) , then , to find a quite different business model like plus simple operated by French ISPs .
French broadband providers like Free.fr , Numericable , and SFR have just one offer .
It costs € 30 / $ 45 , and for that you get everything :
Cable and DSL internet at 20 - 30 M bps ( and DOCSIS3 or fiber at 100 M bps in some towns )
Free telephony to 100 nations ( mostly to fixed lines ; calling mobiles costs more )
HDTV with a HD - DVR
( Some ISPs like Numericable and France Telecom / Orange have offers for € 20 for Internet + telephony , or Internet + TV , but the majority of customers choose a € 30 pack . )
This is n’t all you get .
More is included , like free access to WiFi hotspots , music jukeboxes , computer games , your own personal television channel for live TV , etc .
We 'll touch upon these innovations in more depth below .
The pioneer of this business model was Free.fr .
Led by its maverick CEO Xavier Niel , it introduced the plus simple model in 2002 into what was then considered a lagging broadband market .
Now Free is the second largest ISP in the country , it is profitable ( with 4 million subscribers ) , and it boasts extremely low churn rates below 0.01 percent a month .
One could almost say that Free ’s subscribers only give up their subscription upon death or moving outside of the service area .
Of every two new subscribers in the French broadband market , one chooses Free.fr .
The philosophy of this extremely cool ISP is that competitors should be denied the possibility to compete on 1 ) price or 2 ) bandwidth .
Consumers are influenced mostly by headline speeds and price , so Free makes sure that they know they get the best deal in town .
Compare this to the philosophy where consumers are best left as confused as possible , and it 's difficult to know when you 're getting the best deal .
" One size fits all " not only saves the customer headaches , it also simplifies internal IT .
Getting billing and customer relations right for hundreds if not thousands of product combinations has turned out to be too hard for most ISPs .
Furthermore , acquiring the customer is expensive , so good ISPs make sure that once subscribers sign up , they never want to leave .
This is achieved by continually improving the service offered , introducing small innovations every couple of months .
Not every customer will use or even like every service that is offered , but it does n’t matter because they are free add - ons .
If the services are unique and well - liked , competitors will have a tough time poaching customers .
Furthermore , giving customers what they want may turn them into happy customers who promote the ISP ’s service to their friends and family , further reducing acquisition costs .
A third important element of Free ’s strategy is to make good use of open innovation .
Most of its internal operations and many of the things it offers are based on open source software and open standards .
Apart from the savings in license fees and the possibility for Free to adapt the code to do what it wants , Free also allows its customers to work with the code and build on it .
There is an active community of Freenauts ( yes that ’s what their customers call themselves ) developing and improving various bits of the services .
A fourth element , and one of the prime reasons you wo n’t see this offer elsewhere anytime soon , is that Free lacks marketing managers .
There is only one product to manage and new services are added based on whether there is budget and whether the service is deemed cool enough .
There is therefore little place in the organization for marketing managers complicating service offers and thinking up new services with fake projected take - up numbers in order to " make " the business case for the new service .
Unfortunately for the rest of the world 's ISPs , the fact that their marketing managers are the ones responsible for proposing new business models means that a business model that eliminates marketing managers will never get proposed .
But what would the hypothetical " coolest ISP in the world " offer using the business model described ?
Network
To provide Internet service , the provider needs access to a network .
It does n’t need to own the network , though ; it can be somebody else ’s so long as the ISP can tweak the service parameters .
FTTH offers the highest speeds available .
There is a Swedish mother with 40 G bit /s of service , but she 's just lucky that her son is Peter Lothberg .
The fastest commercial service available for consumers currently seems to be 1 Gbps .
Residents of Hong Kong and of Stockholm and Lund in Sweden can get these speeds now .
In the Netherlands , many FTTH users receive a second fiber in their home that will carry the analog and digital broadcast television signal .
This way , the indoor coaxial cable wiring for television can be used and every TV can have access to the analog signal even though not all use the digital signal .
A cool ISP would n’t restrict itself to just one network .
It would try to provide you with Internet connectivity anytime , any place , anywhere .
The integration of fixed and ( mobile ) wireless access has proved elusive , and a full integrated offer is not on the market .
Change is coming , though .
ISPs like BT , SFR , and Free. fr now offer shared WiFi access using WiFi hotspots integrated into broadband routers , even those of other customers .
Subscribers can securely access the WiFi access point of millions of other customers .
SFR and BT cooperate with FON so that their customers can use it all over the world where FON is used .
BT has faced some flak from customers worried that their connections would be overloaded by the visitors , but in France this seems less of an issue .
It might be that because the Brits generally only have 8 M bps broadband , they fear congestion more than the French , who are used to receiving 20 M bps or more .
The question is whether we will see networks agree to roaming agreements for WiFi hotspot usage between different networks .
A variant on the same theme is the Vodafone Access Gateway , which is a 3G femtocell you can connect to your home broadband connection .
It will give up to four users secure access to Vodafone ’s 3G network .
At $ 265 it seems a bit expensive to fix what is essentially a hole in Vodafone ’s network coverage .
It can , however , be imagined that every ISP will in the near future add a 3G / 4G / Wimax femtocell to its routers and farm these out to wireless networks needing some extra coverage .
OCTOBER 26 -- A group of women who exposed themselves in a Florida bar for a " Girls Gone Wild " film crew is facing indecent exposure charges .
After a " concerned citizen " tipped cops that a " Girls Gone Wild " bus was in town , Nassau County Sheriff 's Office detectives launched an undercover probe that resulted in the bust early Friday of 16 individuals at a bar in Yulee .
Included among those arrested were seven female patrons who complied with requests to " show their breasts so they could be photographed / filmed or so they could have their breasts spray painted in front of the patrons at the bar , " according to a sheriff 's press release .
The seven alleged exhibitionists ( ages 18 to 29 ) are pictured in the accompanying mug shots .
The bar 's owner and two " Girls Gone Wild " employees were each charged with illegally operating a sexually oriented business ( the remaining arrestees were collared for disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest ) .
Investigators confiscated camera equipment used during filming inside The Mill nightclub .

Tommie Harris Ejected VIDEO , Chicago Bears
Chicago Bears defensive tackle Tommie Harris was ejected from the Sunday game against the Arizona Cardinals a mere 65 seconds into the November 8th contest .
It could well be an NFL record for the earliest ejection in history .
At the end of an Arizona running play , Harris and Cardinal lineman Deuce Lutui ended up on the ground .
Before getting up , Tommie unleashed a couple of staccato punches to his competitors face - see video below .
The Bears were assessed a 15 - yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and Harris was summarily dismissed to the locker room for an early shower by no nonsense referee Ed Hochuli .
The Cardinals beat Chicago 41 - 21 final .

The Family : Fundamentalists Preaching A Gospel Of American Empire
In his new book , The Family , journalist Jeff Sharlet takes us inside Christian fundamentalism ’s most elite , disturbing and secretive organization .
The Family is fundamentalism ’s avant - garde , on a mission to wage a spiritual war in the halls of American power and around the globe .
They consider themselves the “ new chosen ” , Senators , Congressmen , Generals and foreign dictators who meet in confidential cells , to pray and plan for a “ leadership led by God ” .
The Family is about the other half of American Christian fundamentalist power - not its angry masses ( see photos ) - but its elites .
Jeff Sharlet follows the story of the group back to its founder , Abraham Vereide , a preacher who in 1935 organized a small group of businessmen sympathetic to European fascism , combining the far - right with his own brand of authoritarian faith .
From that core , Vereide built an international network of fundamentalists who speak the language of establishment power .
In public , the Family host the National Prayer Breakfast , in private they preach a gospel of “ biblical capitalism ” , military might and American empire .
Citing Hitler , Stalin and Mao as model leaders , the Family ’s current leader , Doug Coe , declares “ We work with power where we can , and build new power where we can ’t ”
The Family has operated secretively with the help of influential politicians , who are members of the group , to promote their anti-gay , anti-abortion and pro-free market ideas in America and other parts of the world .
However , two sex scandals involving people connected with the Family , Nevada Senator Ensign and South Carolina Governor Sanford , have brought public attention to the group .
Also , both Bart Stupak and Joe Pitts are connected to the Family , they introduced the amendment to the health care bill that would prevent funds to cover abortion .
Overseas , in Uganda , the Family is connected to a proposed anti-gay legislation that could sentence so called “ repeat offenders ” to the death penalty .
“ The founder of the group , Abraham Vereide , said that God came to him one night in April 1935 and told him Christianity has been focusing on the wrong people ; the poor , the suffering , the down and out .
Vereide said that “ God told him ” to be a missionary to and for the powerful , the ones he called the up and out .
They could dispense blessing to everybody else through a bizarre kind of trickle - down religion , ” Jeff Sharlet told NPR ’s Terry Gross in an interview on November 24 .

Maps without legends may not be immediately informative , but determining what they represent is extremely fun .
If you ’re into that kind of thing , here ’s a game for you .
If you ’ve ever picked up an old globe in a thrift store , you already know the sport of trying to determine its age based on where certain borders are demarcated and how territories are designated .
And if testing your combined knowledge of history , culture , and cartography sounds like your kind of fun ( it ’s our kind of fun ) , you may enjoy what we ’ve got in store .
We ’ve removed the legends and all other telltale labels from the maps below , and challenge you to guess what each map depicts using only clues contained within the maps : the color - coding , names , landmarks , and whatever else you can detect .
Here ’s one clue to get you started : None of the maps represent gross national anything .

A Milpitas man with a long history of violence was sentenced Friday to more than 25 years in prison for beating his former girlfriend ’s cocker spaniel to death with a hammer , a third strike for Alex Castro .
Castro , 48 , begged the court for mercy , saying such a long sentence was too much for killing a dog , but the judge said he could not ignore the violence Castro inflicted in his life , according to the prosecutor .
“ I am appreciative that not only did a jury take this case incredibly seriously , as evidenced by their verdict , but also that the judge did , ” said Deputy District Attorney Kevin Smith .
“ Despite the defendant ’s claims he was getting too much time for ‘ only killing a dog , ’ he is getting this sentence for the violence in his past . ”
Castro , a drywall worker , was sentenced to 25 years to life .
Because of enhancements to his sentence , the earliest he’d be eligible for parole is 33 years , Smith said .
In an interview for a probation report prepared for the judge , Castro said he believed the most time he should receive for killing Copper in July 2007 was three years , the maximum allowed for felony animal cruelty .
Copper ’s owner said she was “ satisfied ” by the verdict .
“ The way he did it was horrible , ” said Joanie Gonzalez , of San Jose , who had owned Copper since he was a puppy .
“ There was no reason for it ; that dog did n’t do anything wrong . ”
Castro ’s attorney did not return phone calls Friday .
During his trial , Castro denied killing the 10 - year - old dog , asserting the small pools of Copper ’s blood found by investigators stemmed from him moving the dog several times after finding the dog dead near the trailer he shared with Gonzalez at the Main Street Mobile Home and RV park in Milpitas , next to the Ooh La Lodge .
Castro said he could n’t decide how to tell Gonzalez her dog was dead , likely hit by a car , and did n’t want to see her cry .
Prosecutors successfully sought to have Copper ’s murder counted as a third strike for Castro because he had two previous violent felonies .
In his probation interview , Castro said his first two strikes “ are old ” and he is not a habitual criminal .
In 1994 , Castro and a friend went to pick up a refrigerator at his estranged wife ’s house and got into a fight with her then - current boyfriend .
The two entered without knocking and teamed up for the fight , with his friend standing on the boyfriend ’s legs while Castro choked him .
Castro choked the man until he turned blue and finally stopped when his friend said “ Alex , he ’s almost dead , he ’s blue , ” according to the probation report .
In 1982 , Castro and his father had been at a bar when Castro grabbed a tire iron from his truck and struck two men his father had been fighting with multiple times .
In addition to the two felony batteries with serious bodily injury and assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm , Castro had 20 misdemeanor convictions , including driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license .
Castro is due back in court Monday for the setting of a trial on charges of soliciting to prevent a witness from testifying in the trial over Copper ’s death .
While in county jail , he managed to have a letter sent to a Milpitas motorcycle club , asking that a key witness in the case , a member of the club , not be allowed to testify in court , testimony that would have included his statements to a friend about killing Copper .
That member did testify .
Gonzalez said she was initially torn that Castro was facing such a long sentence .
She had just lost her mother , then her dog — and her boyfriend .
“ I really did n’t think that life was the right sentence for killing an animal , ” she said .
“ But as someone said , who knows , it could have a been a child the next time . ”

In the face of an outraged Arab world , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton backed off on her congratulation of Israel for merely pledging to limit settlement construction in the occupied West Bank .
Previously , President Barack Obama , originally appearing to be much more friendly to the Palestinian and Arab causes than George W. Bush , told Israel , " It is time for the settlements to stop . "
The president ’s earlier position reinforced that of the United Nations and other international bodies : such settlement by the occupier of any territory conquered in war is against international law .
The U.S. waffling demonstrates that despite Obama ’s youth spent in a Muslim country and greater sensitivity to Islamic concerns than his predecessor , he will likely always be forced by domestic political considerations to come home to the mother ship of the Israeli lobby .
Conflict in Palestine started in the 1920s and was caused by Jewish immigration , beginning in the late 1800s , to a land they had n’t populated in great numbers since the Roman Empire .
To win Arab support against the Turks during World War I , Britain , attempting to expand its empire , cynically promised the Arabs postwar independence , which was not granted .
Then to win support for the British war effort from the United States and its Jewish minority , Britain issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917 , which promised the Jews a homeland ( not a state ) .
After having promised the same land to two peoples , Britain planned to withdraw from Palestine .
In 1947 , the UN voted to partition Palestine , but give the Jews – who owned only 6 percent of Palestine – a whopping 56 percent of the land .
As a result , Palestinians and Jews fought , and neighboring Arab countries attacked Israel when it provocatively declared itself a state in 1948 .
After this rebellion and war , in which the militarily stronger Israelis brutally ethnically cleansed the Palestinians from their land , the Jews owned even more of Palestine than the UN had bestowed on them – running the amount to more than 70 percent .
Then came the war of 1967 , which added the Israeli occupation of Gaza , the Sinai , the Golan Heights , and the West Bank .
The Israelis have withdrawn from Gaza and the Sinai but not the Golan Heights or West Bank .
Believing that possession is nine - tenths of the law , the Israelis began settling the occupied Golan Heights and West Bank .
Currently , there are 280,000 Jews in 121 settlements on the West Bank and 190,000 in East Jerusalem .
In the West Bank , the Israelis have placed their settlements strategically – including along the Jordan River Valley , which forms the border of the West Bank farthest from Israel and which Israel wants to control after any settlement .
Israel will likely eventually settle the issue by giving the Palestinians some sort of state – whether by negotiated settlement or unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank ( similar to the approach it took in Gaza ) .
The reason : the Arab population within the West Bank and Israel proper is growing so fast that if Israel does n’t cut the West Bank loose , Israel will likely lose its Jewish democratic identity by the institution of an apartheid South Africa - style system of minority rule .
Yet this resolution will probably not happen for some time , because Israel wants to acquire as much strategic Palestinian land as it can through West Bank settlements before the time Jews become a minority in Israel and the West Bank .
Where does this leave the United States ?
The waffling by the Obama administration , betraying the overwhelming underlying domestic political forces supporting Israel , has severely undermined any perceived status the U.S. had as an honest broker in the already perpetually infuriating Israeli - Palestinian negotiations .
Because the United States cannot be a neutral moderator , it should turn that role over to others – Britain would be ideal , since it caused the problem in the first place – and exit the scene .
After all , Palestine is hardly strategic to U.S. security .
Full marks to the students who complained to their headteacher about the intrusive taking of fingerprints in their school
The brilliant new documentary about privacy by David Bond , Erasing David , has a telling scene in Chipping Campden School , Gloucestershire , where the headteacher shows off a new fingerprinting system that allows pupils to register and take their meals by pressing a pad .
The headteacher , Annette France , demonstrates the £ 25,000 system in front of a classroom of kids , most of whom look pretty underwhelmed .
Possibly France was put off by the camera and the kids smirking behind her back but I sensed a shiftiness in her attitude , as though she was beginning to realise that collecting biometrics from children and dismissing parents ' concerns was actually rather weird behaviour .
In south Devon , the kids and parents are made from sterner stuff .
Students at Kingsbridge community college have rebelled against this pernicious practice of taking fingerprints and have won the support of the Totnes MP Anthony Steen , who has written to schools secretary Ed Balls .
At St King Edward
Vl community college , also in Devon , parents have protested about a similar system .
A delegation of four students at Kingsbridge school met the headteacher , Roger Pope , last week and sent a letter to Steen which said :
Roger
Pope is going to discuss our objections with the governors , but in the meantime we are trying to gather more evidence and support for our cause .
We would be interested to know where you stand on this matter and would welcome your support if possible .
Steen took up the case :
I have considerable sympathy for students at the college who do not want to be fingerprinted .
Although I welcome the idea of a cashless society , I personally would not wish to have the contours of my fingerprints kept solely to enable me to buy food at school .
What 's wrong with a plastic card to swipe ?
Or what about cash for counters ?
The answer is that schools like Kingsbridge community college and Chipping Campden School have become obsessed with these expensive monitoring systems without really thinking of the rights of children and parents .
The thrilling sense of control they give school authorities trumps the express wishes of parents who are worried about privacy and the eventual use of the biometric data .
The same objections , by the way , have been voiced at the disgraceful practice of putting CCTV in classrooms .
With the daily reports of data loss and security breaches ( the latest concerns the T - Mobile phone company ) the case against the needless accumulation of personal data has been made so convincingly that it is surprising that these schools are still spending public money on systems , which they cannot guarantee are secure .
Roger Pope insists that the fingerprint cannot be recreated from any loss of data but how many times have we been told to entrust our personal information to authorities and businesses only to find it has been released in the great haemorrhage of data from public and private bodies ?
How can he be sure that a new technique will not be invented to breach his students privacy and recreate the fingerprint ?
Steen said :
I am in touch with the secretary of state for children , schools and families , Ed Balls MP , asking what the government 's view is .
I hope he does n't tell me the state knows best and individuals are merely cogs in the glorious system .
Good to hear a Conservative saying such things .
Let 's hope the party continues to do so if it wins the next election .
Let 's be clear about these systems – they are an intrusive waste of money .
The four students who have challenged Pope should be awarded a special prize for showing more initiative and common sense than their headmaster .
They have my support .
The aftermarket autogasmic behemoth that is SEMA starts tomorrow .
Good a time as any to ask the question again — what 's the worst aftermarket auto add - on ?

In our minds — the worst add - on is any aftermarket part sold as a " performance " booster when there 's not a lick of performance benefit provided by it .
Put anything chrome , plastic and fake on a hood or side quarter panel and we 're NOT going to like it .
At all .
But , recently we found these 3A Racing " performance " mesh fabric seat covers .
We 're not only 100 % sure they wo n't make your car go faster , we 're pretty sure the added weight will actually decrease performance .
What we also know is we do n't want them .

The United States has relinquished its status as Internet supervisor .
After the Department of Defense developed the technology that runs the World Wide Web 40 years ago , the country has maintained a sort of advisory role over its continuity .
That changed significantly 11 years ago when it loosened its grip by establishing the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers .
However , ICANN was still subject to periodic U.S. review .
That changed Wednesday .
The two entities have signed a new agreement that eliminates the U.S. reviews .
ICANN now will be reviewed by a broader - based group of stakeholders from around the world .
" One thing this is not is Independence Day , " [ ICANN Vice President Paul ]
Levins said .
" We were independent the day we were established .
This is not somehow slipping nooses of accountability or cutting ourselves loose from the U.S. "

Update ( 2017-09-10 ) :
The bottom line of this article changed since the 8 years it was posted , quite unsurprisingly .
Nowadays , vanilla kernel has a decent ASLR and so everyone does actually have advantages in building everything as PIE .
Indeed , Arch Linux and probably most other binary distributions do exactly that .
The rest of the technical description of why this is important and how is still perfectly valid .
One very interesting misconception related to Gentoo , and especially the hardened sub- profile , is related to the PIE ( Position - Independent Executable ) support .
This is probably due to the fact that up to now the hardened profile always contained PIE support , and since it relates directly to PIC ( Position - Independent Code ) and PIC as well is tied back to hardened support , people tend to confuse what technique is used for what scope .
Let ’s start with remembering that PIC is a compilation option that produces the so - called relocatable code ; that is , code that is valid no matter what base address it is loaded at .
This is a particularly important feature for shared objects : to be able to be loaded by any executable and still share the code pages in memory , the code needs to be relocatable ; if it ’s not , a text relocation has to happen .
Relocating the “ text ” means changing the executable code segment so that the absolute addresses ( of both functions and data — variables and constants ) is correct for the base address the segment was loaded at .
Doing this , causes a Copy - on - Write for the executable area , which among other things , wastes memory ( each process running will have to have its private copy of the executable memory area , as well as the variable data memory area ) .
This is the reason why shared objects in almost any modern distribution are built relocatable : faster load time , and reduced memory consumption , at the cost of sacrificing a register .
An important note here : sacrificing a register , which is something needed for PIC to keep the base address of the loaded segment , is a minuscule loss for most architectures , with the notable exception of x86 , where there are very few general registers to use .
This means that while PIC code is slightly ( but not notably ) slower for any other architecture , it is a particularly heavy hit on x86 , especially for register - hungry code like multimedia libraries .
For this reason , shared objects on x86 might still be built without PIC enabled , at the cost of load time and memory , while for most other architectures , the linker will refuse to produce a shared object if the object files are not built with PIC .
Up to now , I said nothing about hardened at all , so let me introduce the first relation between hardened and PIC : it ’s called PaX in Hardened Linux , but the same concept is called W^X ( Write xor eXecute ) in OpenBSD – which is probably a very descriptive name for a programmer – NX ( No eXecution ) in CPUs , and DEP ( Data Execution Prevention ) in Windows .
To put it in layman terms , what all these technologies do is more or less the same : they make sure that once a memory page is loaded with executable code , it cannot be modified , and vice - versa that a page that can be modified cannot be executed .
This is , like most of the features of Gentoo Hardened , a mitigation strategy , that limits the effects of buffer overflows in software .
For NX to be useful , you need to make sure that all the executable memory pages are loaded and set in stone right away ; this makes text relocation impossible ( since they consists of editing the executable pages to change the absolute addresses ) , and also hinders some other techniques , such as Just - In - Time ( JIT ) optimisation , where executable code is created at runtime from an higher , more abstract language ( both Java and Mono use this technique ) , and C nested functions ( or at least the current GCC implementation , that makes use of trampolines , and thus require executable stack ) .
Does any of this mean that you need PIC - compiled executables ( which is what PIE is ) to make use of PaX / NX ?
Not at all .
In Linux , by default , all executables are loaded at the same base address , so once the code is built , it does n’t have to be relocated at all .
This also helps optimising the code for the base case of no shared object used , as that ’s not going to have to deal with PIC - related problems at all ( see this old post for more detailed information about the issue ) .
But in the previous paragraph I did write some clue as to what the PIE technique is all about ; as I said , the reason why PIE is not necessary is that by default all executables are loaded at the same address ; but if they were n’t , then they ’d be needing either text relocations or PIC ( PIE ) , would n’t they ?
That ’s the reason why PIE exists indeed .
Now , the next question would be , how does PIE relate to hardened ?
Why does the hardened toolchain use PIE ?
Does using it make it magically possible to have a hardened system ?
Once again , no , it ’s not that easy .
PIE is not , by itself , neither a security measure nor a mitigation strategy .
It is , instead , a requirement for the combined use of two mitigation strategy , the first is the above - described NX idea ( which rules out the idea of using text relocations entirely ) , while the second is is ASLR ( Address Space Layout Randomization ) .
To put this technique also in layman terms , you should consider that a lot of exploit require that you change the address a variable points to , so you need to know both the address of that variable , and the address to point it to ; to find this stuff out , you can usually try and try again until you find the magic values , but if you randomize the addresses where code and data are loaded each time , you make it much harder for the attacker to guess them .
I ’m pretty sure somebody here is already ready to comment that ASLR is not a 100 % safe security measure , and that ’s absolutely right .
Indeed here we have to make some notes as to which situation this really works out decently : local command exploits .
When attacking a server , you ’re already left to guess the addresses ( since you do n’t know which of many possible variants of the same executable the server is using ; two Gentoo servers rarely have the same executable either , since they are rebuilt on a case by case basis — and sometimes even with the same exact settings , the different build time might cause different addresses to be used ) ; and at the same time , ASLR only changes the addresses between two executions of the same program : unless the server uses spawned ( not cloned ! ) processes , like inetd does ( or rather did ) , then the address space between two requests on the same server will be just the same ( as long as the server does n’t get restarted ) .
At any rate , when using ASLR , the executables are no longer loaded all at the same address , so you either have to relocate the text ( which is denied by NX ) or you ’ve got to use PIE , to make sure that the addresses are all relative to the specified base address .
Of course , this also means that , at that point , all the code is going to be PIC , losing a register , and thus slowed down ( a very good reason to use x86 - 64 instead of x86 , even on systems with less than 4GiB of RAM ) .
Bottomline of the explanation : using the PIE component of the hardened toolchain is only useful when you have ASLR enabled , as that ’s the reason why the whole hardened profile uses PIE .
Without ASLR , you will have no benefit in using PIE , but you ’ll have quite a few drawbacks ( especially on the old x86 architecture ) due to building everything PIC .
And this is also the same reason why software that enables PIE by itself ( even conditionally ) , like KDE 3 , is doing silly stuff for most user systems .
And to make it even more clear : if you ’re not using hardened - sources as your kernel , PIE will not be useful .
This goes for vanilla , gentoo , xen , vserver sources all the same .
( I ’m sincerely not sure how this behave when using Linux containers and hardened sources ) .
It all starts with a dream .
Even the Web started with one .
Here ’s how Tim Berners Lee described his dream of the World Wide Web :
Photo Copyright : Living Juicy
“ I have a dream for the Web …and it has two parts .
In the first part , the Web becomes a much more powerful means for collaboration between people .
I have always imagined the information space as something to which everyone has immediate and intuitive access , and not just to browse , but to create .
The initial WorldWideWeb program opened with an almost blank page , ready for the jottings of the user .
Robert Cailliau and I had a great time with it , not because we were looking at a lot of stuff , but because we were writing and sharing our ideas .
Furthermore , the dream of people - to - people communication thorough shared knowledge must be possible for groups of all sizes , interacting electronically with as much ease as they do now in person .
In the second part of the dream , collaborations extend to computers .
Machines become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content , links , and transactions between people and computers .
A " Semantic Web , ” which should make this possible has yet to emerge , but when it does , the day - to - day mechanisms of trade , bureaucracy , and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines , leaving humans to proivide the inspiration and intuition . “ [ 1 ]

Weaving the Web : The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web .
Harper Paperbacks , 2000 .
For some A Boy and His Blob was the pinnacle of puzzle platforming on the NES ; I am not one of those people .
It was just one of those games I never played as a kid , and once the SNES came out , I think I was too blinded by the “ 16 - bit wonder ” to give a crap about that lousy “ 8 - bit stuff ” ; kids do the darnedest things .
Anyways , the game revolved around a boy who found a blob that he could feed jelly beans , and each bean would transform the blob into an object .
These objects would be used to traverse through an environment , and attack enemies in various inventive ways .
Seeing as I have n’t played the original , I popped the game into the Wii with totally neutral expectations that were n’t going to be bloated by nostalgia .
After playing through the game , and being drowned in cuteness … A Boy and His Blob has transformed me into a fan .
This is a series that does n’t bother the player with a huge dramatic story , and for that , I commend it .
All you need to know is that the blob has come from his planet , Blobolonia , after it has been taken over by some baddies .
Shortly after landing on Earth , the boy meets the blob in the forest , and your journey begins .
After befriending the boy , your new goal is to travel to the blob ’s home planet and save his people .
This blob may look pretty pointless at first , but once you start feeding him special jelly beans , he will transform into many useful objects .
For instance , when you ca n’t reach a ledge , transform him into a trampoline …enemies you ca n’t pass ?
Squash them with a blob anvil !
There are around forty levels ( ten levels , spread across four worlds ) , not to mention challenge levels from collectibles you find ; so overall , there is plenty of stuff to keep you busy in the game .
Personally , I had a hell of a time with this game .
Even though I never played the original , it still struck this chord with me being a lover of 2 - D games .
The puzzles were pretty inventive and manageable throughout , and even though some were kind of boring , it did n’t ruin the experience .
However , the difficulty curve for the game is a bit off .
The first few worlds of the game give you constant hints and make every puzzle apparent , and then in the later levels there was n’t much of a curve to the difficulty , it just goes from easy to hard .
Some of the best and most tedious puzzles were found in the boss battles .
Since you can only take one hit , and ca n’t actually hurt the enemies , you must rely on your smarts and blob ’s abilities to pass these foes .
Sometimes the main enemy you will face during the game is the jelly bean interface .
While it is n’t too hard to hit the Z button and choose your bean with the analog stick , the actual throwing of the beans was a bit too touchy ( your trajectory moves around really fast . )
Many times , especially in boss battles , I had to throw a bean at an exact spot , and I would keep overshooting .
While it was a bit of an annoyance , I began to get used to the touchy controls , so I ca n’t really mark the game badly for it .
Even dying in the game was n’t a huge pain in the butt ; you have an unlimited number of lives , and start off exactly where you die ; some game developers could learn a thing or two from Blobs mostly forgiving gameplay .
This game feels like it is for more of a niche crowd than anything , which makes it hard to give a strong recommendation .
If you are like me and love a good 2 - D puzzle / platformer , than Blob is top - notch .
However , I think people looking for more of an action / adventure title need to look elsewhere , because they may not have the patience for some of the more tedious bits of this game .
Also , collectibles and challenge levels aside , you can blow through the main game in a couple sittings if you are dedicated .
The short length , may through this little gem into the “ rental zone ” , but I feel that if people purchase this game , maybe we will see other nostalgic reboots in the future .
After playing Mighty Flip Champs on the DSi and A Boy and His Blob on the Wii , WayForward is slowly becoming one of my favorite Nintendo developers .
Blob brought something to the table that I think even the most hardcore gamers need to fill up on ; a nice , healthy helping of simple fun .

One advantage the department has is that it can be more selective about recruits as interest has increased .
Two former Police Academy officials said in interviews that they could not recall anyone during their tenure who had worked on Wall Street and become a police officer .
“ There were teachers , security guards , painters , military , almost everything , even sales , but I do n’t remember anyone from Wall Street , ” said John Cerar , who spent 15 of his 26 years on the force working at the Police Academy as a supervisor , officer and administrator and retired in 1999 .
Although police officials characterized the trend in glowing terms , Vincent E. Henry , a former commanding officer at the Police Academy and the author of two books about police work , said the department might have to adjust to having more highly skilled officers .
“ Many Ivy League graduates joined the force and different forces around the country in the 1970s , ” said Dr. Henry , who retired from the force in 2002 and is now the director of the Homeland Security Management Institute at Long Island University .
“ A good number did n’t stay on because the organizations were not able to keep them interested , and there was resentment from others of their degrees . ”
Dr. Henry said , however , that the economy and the increased interest in the force presented the department with “ a tremendous opportunity ” to attract officers with significant life experiences .
For Officer Gerard Salvia , the Police Department provided an opportunity to break away from what he said was the hierarchical nature of Wall Street , where , he said , he thought he would not advance .
Unlike many of his classmates in the academy , Officer Salvia , who worked as a trader ’s assistant at LaBranche & Company , did not have a four - year degree .
“ Guys like me do n’t make managing director or partner ; that was how it was 30 years ago , ” Officer Salvia said .
“ Now , at least at the Police Department , I have the same opportunity as every police officer .
If you want to go to all the special units , you need to do something to earn it .
It ’s not so much that you are part of a club . ”
Hey guys ,
I ’m so excited to announce that my kids record Nali & Friends is released today !
You can download or purchase here .
Nali & Friends is a tale about unconventional , oddball animals from different parts of the world .
I co-wrote this with longtime friend and collaborator , filmmaker Rhys Graham , the stories were inspired by our journey through Uganda and Kenya working with The Thin Green Line Foundation – an international organisation that provides welfare and support to Wildlife Rangers .
It was during this trip that we had the opportunity to get up close with baby animals and observe their quirky personalities .
It was one of the most rewarding musical experiences I ’ve had to date .
There are elements , to this story of Nali , which talk about being nice to people and being a good person .
To celebrate the release , I ’m taking the songs out on the road for my first run of kids shows !!
I ’m bringing all my new friends such as Bwindi , Putu and Tembo along for the ride also !
You can catch me , Nali & Friends on Saturday , July 13 at Factory Theatre in Sydney , and Saturday , July 20 at Melba Spiegeltent in Melbourne .
All the ticketing details are below , ca n’t wait for these shows so we can sing and dance along with the family together !

MADRID ( Reuters ) - Third - tier Alcorcon lost 1 - 0 to Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Tuesday but dumped the nine - times European champions out of the King ’s Cup 4 - 1 on aggregate .
Real had promised to rectify their embarrassing 4 - 0 first leg defeat with a stirring fightback at home at the last - 32 stage .
Manuel Pellegrini ’s side though , boasting Raul and Ruud van Nistelrooy up front supported by Gonzalo Higuain and Kaka , created little in front of a near - full house .
Alcorcon operate on a budget of just over one million euros ( $ 1.50 million ) , around 400 times smaller than Real’s .
“ Beating Real Madrid is a dream come true and there is a nice party going on right now in the dressing room .
I think we deserve it , ” said coach Juan Antonio Anquela .
“ The players made an incredible effort and I want to thank them publicly for that . ”
The visitors were disciplined and organised and grew in confidence the longer Real laboured .
The hosts threatened briefly at the start of the second half , when they hit the crossbar , but as the chances dried up disgruntled fans started whistling the players and chanting for coach Pellegrini to go .
Real substitute Rafael van der Vaart scored from outside the area with nine minutes left and Higuain hit the bar but by then fans were streaming out of the Bernabeu .
The supporters that remained cheered Alcorcon ’s every touch and gave them a standing ovation at the finish .
“ We ca n’t say we did n’t try but it ’s clear we did n’t achieve our objective , ” Real director general Jorge Valdano told Canal Plus television .
“ But I say again we have absolute confidence in the coach , the same as we did before the game . ”
It is the second year in a row Real have been humbled by a Segunda B side in the Cup after Real Union beat them at the same stage last season .
LOWER LEAGUE
Other top - flight sides to lose to lower league opposition were Tenerife , who fell 3 - 1 on aggregate to second division Celta Vigo , and Sporting Gijon who lost a penalty shootout against second division Recreativo Huelva .
Holders Barcelona , Sevilla and Atletico Madrid emphatically swept aside Segunda B opponents .
Barca put five past Cultural Leonesa on the night to win 7 - 0 on aggregate , with Bojan Krkic ’s double opening the floodgates at the Nou Camp .
Argentina midfielder Maxi Rodriguez netted four goals as Atletico completed an 8 - 0 aggregate rout of Marbella and Sevilla substitute Jose Carlos bagged two as they beat Atletico Ciudad 9 - 3 on aggregate .
Ten -man Valencia hung on to draw 2 - 2 at home against Segunda B side Alcoyano to go through 3 - 2 overall and Villarreal edged past third - tier Puertollano 2 - 1 on aggregate thanks to a late goal from Italy striker Giuseppe Rossi .
Deportivo Coruna , Malaga and Osasuna also made the last 16 .
The following is a portion ( it ’s too long to post the whole thing here ) of my new article in The American Conservative about talk host Glenn Beck , his critics on the Right and what bothers them most about the FOX pundit ’s meteoric popularity ( hint , it is n’t just his wacky style ) :
Who Hates Glenn Beck ?
By Jack Hunter
His talk - radio brethren have less of a problem with his histrionics than with his evolving libertarianism
Warning that popular talk radio and Fox News host Glenn Beck was “ Harmful to the Conservative Movement , ” Peter Wehner wrote on Commentary ’s “ Contentions ” blog in September : “ he seems to be more of a populist and libertarian than a conservative , more of a Perotista than a Reaganite .
His interest in conspiracy theories is disquieting , as is his admiration for Ron Paul and his charges of American ‘ imperialism . ’
( He is now talking about pulling troops out of Afghanistan , South Korea , Germany , and elsewhere . ) ”
Wehner is not alone in his criticism .
When Beck told CBS News ’ Katie Couric , “ John McCain would have been worse for the country than Barack Obama , ” fellow radio talker and New York Times bestselling author Mark Levin fired back : “ to say that he would be worse than a president who ’s a Marxist , who ’s running around the world apologizing for our nation , who ’s slashing our defense budget … to say he would be worse is mindless … incoherent , as a matter of fact . ”
Beck has been criticized from both Left and Right for his melodramatic , sometimes conspiracy - minded , intermittently bizarre style .
But his conservative critics seem most offended not by Beck ’s manner but by his deviationism .
He wo n’t stick to the ideological script .
Conservative radio and TV punditry has a strict set of ground rules .
Whatever Democrats are up to is bad ; Republicans are n’t perfect , but they are worth cheering for and at least deserve the benefit of the doubt .
Rush Limbaugh ’s occasional guest host Michael Medved reflected talk - radio orthodoxy perfectly when he said , “ For those Americans who want to fight back against the menacing expansion of government and the insanely irresponsible spending of the Obama administration , there is only one way to succeed : electing more Republicans to high office . ”
But as Marc Ambinder at The Atlantic notes , Beck is an exception : “ Beck claims to be non-partisan .
Conservative , yes , but disdainful of the GOP , with no vested interest in seeing Republicans return to power . ”
During the George W. Bush years ,
Beck ’s politics were less differentiated from those of other radio talkers .
He deferred to the Bush administration , promoted militarism as patriotism , and called the day ’s news along partisan lines .
When Ron Paul received national attention for questioning America ’s interventionist foreign policy during a 2007 GOP presidential primary debate , Beck called Paul “ crazy ” and asked , “ how did this guy get on stage ? ”
At the time there were no complaints about Beck from the likes of Wehner and Levin — because Beck sounded much like them .
Sometimes he still does , mashing recycled neoconservative jargon with wild - eyed panic about the growth of government power under Obama .
But however politically incoherent or ideologically imperfect his rants may be , Beck , unlike other conservative media celebrities , seems to have learned something from the past eight years .
He said in September :
I am becoming more and more libertarian every day , I guess the scales are falling off of my eyes , as I ’m doing more and more research into history and learning real history .
Back at the turn of the century in 1900 , with Teddy Roosevelt — a Republican — we started this , ‘ we ’re going to tell the rest of the world , ’ ‘ we ’re going to spread democracy , ’ and we really became , down in Latin America , we really became thuggish and brutish .
It only got worse with the next progressive that came into office — Teddy Roosevelt , Republican progressive — the next one was a Democratic progressive , Woodrow Wilson , and we did … we empire built .
The Democrats felt we needed to empire build with one giant global government …
The Republicans took it as , we ’re going to lead the world and we ’ll be the leader of it … I do n’t think we should be either of those .
I think we need to mind our own business and protect our own people .
When somebody hits us , hit back hard , then come home .
When he made headlines by saying that McCain would have been worse than Obama , Beck explained to Couric , “ McCain is this weird progressive like Theodore Roosevelt was . ”

Phil Woolas claimed that British troops are fighting in Afghanistan to control immigration
Phil Woolas provoked fury yesterday by claiming British troops are fighting in Afghanistan in part to keep immigration under control .
The gaffe - prone Home Office Minister told MPs the number of asylum seekers coming to the UK would ' significantly increase ' if troops were withdrawn .
The Taliban would take over and large numbers of Afghans would flee to Britain to claim refugee status , he said .
During a meeting of the home affairs select committee , Mr Woolas said : ' If this country and others were to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and the Taliban were able to take control of Afghanistan our evidence is that the number of asylum seekers coming to the EU would significantly increase .
' An argument that is not aired strongly enough in my view is the benefit of the presence of our armed forces and other countries is to help us control immigration . '
Former Army officer and Tory MP Patrick Mercer said the comments - made on the day five British soldiers were murdered - were ' extraordinary ' and ' unpalatable ' .
He added : ' Armed forces are for the conduct of war in all its phases .
They are not there to control immigration .
' This is yet another distortion of what our troops are trying to achieve in this theatre . '
Casualties are brought into a hospital at Camp Bastion , Afghanistan , after five British soldiers were shot dead in an attack yesterday .
This picture was approved by the MoD
Tory immigration spokesman Damian Green said : ' On a day when so many soldiers have lost their lives , for a Minister to say that the war in Afghanistan helps make it easier to control immigration is pretty crass .
' We all know that Labour 's immigration policy is in a mess .
This kind of comment really proves that Ministers at the Home Office have little idea of how to control our borders . '
Mr Woolas had been responding to a question from the home affairs select committee about whether members of the Taliban had successfully claimed asylum in Britain .
The immigration minister said he did not know the answer , as people ' who claim asylum tend not to tell us if they are a member of the Taliban ' .
Liberal democrat spokesman Chris Huhne said : ' Phil Woolas 's point is tasteless and disrespectful on a day when five of our brave soldiers in Afghanistan have lost their lives .
' He just underlines that the Government does not have clear objectives in this conflict and we need urgently to be told the strategy for success . '
( CNN ) -- Hundreds of Facebook groups have been hijacked in recent days by users pointing out what they say is a weakness in how the social - networking site handles the administration of its groups .
By Tuesday morning , 286 groups had apparently been renamed Control Your Info and had a new message posted to their walls .
" Hello , we hereby announce that we have officially hijacked your Facebook group , " the message reads .
" This means we control a certain part of the information about you on Facebook .
If we wanted we could make you appear in a bad way which could damage your image severly [ sic ] . "
According to Control Your Info , when Facebook group administrators step down , anyone else can take over their duties -- giving them access to members ' personal information , the ability to send messages to all members of the group and the authority to make changes to that group .
" For example we could rename your group and call it something very inappropriate and nasty like ' I Support Pedophiles ' Rights , ' " the message continued .
" But have no fear .
We wo n't . "
Among the groups renamed " Control Your Info " on Tuesday were a " Twilight " fan group , supporters of a high school football team and patrons of a Virginia winery .
In a statement , Facebook said no confidential information has been placed at risk .
" The groups in question have been abandoned by their previous owners , which means any group member has the option to make themselves an administrator in order to continue communication to the group .
Group administrators have no access to confidential information and group members can leave a group at any time , " said a Facebook spokesperson .
" For small groups , administrators can simply edit a group name or info , moderate discussion , and message group members .
The names of large groups cannot be changed nor can anyone message all members .
" In the rare instances when we find that a group has been changed inappropriately , we will disable the group , " the spokesperson said .
The names of two Facebook users who have posted Control Your Info messages after group takeovers -- Janis Roukkos and Bella Roregit -- did not appear to have active Facebook accounts by mid-morning Tuesday .
A message on Control Your Info's Web site blamed Facebook for shutting down the group 's fan page .
Members of the group could not be reached for comment Tuesday .
The group , which offered only a YouTube account as contact information , disagreed with calling what it had done " hacking . "
" This is n't some kind of scare tactics , nor is it a hack , it 's a feature that can be used , and is being used , in bad ways , " the post reads .
" Remember , control your info !
Also , this project is strictly not for profit and done for a good cause . "
The group 's site contains pages of tips on protecting social - network users ' private information .
Not all members of the groups that were hijacked were taking the stunt in the spirit it was apparently intended .
" It 's pretty inappropriate and [ expletive ] you hijacked a facebook group for Palestinian rights to selfishly promote your little conspiracy theory page , " one user wrote .
" I reported this to facebook and others should too . "
I miss yur old boyfriend ... the one who duz n't like kittehs .

Los Angeles managed to cut water use by 17 percent in July compared with a year earlier , according to an announcement last week by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
Single - home residences cut their water usage by 20 percent , and multi-family homes cut usage by 8 percent .
“ With the water shortage that we are facing , we must reduce our reliance on imported water , ” Mr. Villaraigosa said in a statement , “ and I am very encouraged that Angelenos have reduced their water consumption , especially during these summer months . ”
Even government buildings in Los Angeles reported a 34 percent drop in water usage , according to Mr. Villaraigosa .
The water successes of the city — which also significantly cut its electric use by encouraging residents to turn in old energy - guzzling refrigerators , among other measures — are in line with a call by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in February for California cities to slash their water usage by 20 percent .
( Many cities in drought - stricken Texas are also tightening water restrictions . )
One exception , however , to all the water saving unfolding in Los Angeles : the mayor ’s residence .
According to NBC 4 , a local news station , “ During the past month at the mayor ’s house , backyard sprinklers were running at 2 a.m. on a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Tuesday — all in violation of the law . ”
The station filmed the sprinklers at work .
The mayor ’s response ?
“ I sleep very heavily and I could n’t hear it , ” he told the station , also noting that overall water usage at the residence had nonetheless fallen .
Introduction
One of the most alarming side effects of the federal government 's war on drugs is the militarization of law enforcement in America .
There are two aspects to the militarization phenomenon .
First , the American tradition of civil - military separation is breaking down as Congress assigns more and more law enforcement responsibilities to the armed forces .
Second , state and local police officers are increasingly emulating the war - fighting tactics of soldiers .
Most Americans are unaware of the militarization phenomenon simply because it has been creeping along imperceptibly for many years .
To get perspective , it will be useful to consider some recent events :
The U.S. military played a role in the Waco incident .
In preparation for their disastrous 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian compound , federal law enforcement agents were trained by Army Special Forces at Fort Hood , Texas .
And Delta Force commanders would later advise Attorney General Janet Reno to insert gas into the compound to end the 51 - day siege .
Waco resulted in the largest number of civilian deaths ever arising from a law enforcement operation .
1 Between 1995 and 1997 the Department of Defense gave police departments 1.2 million pieces of military hardware , including 73 grenade launchers and 112 armored personnel carriers .
The Los Angeles Police Department has acquired 600 Army surplus M - 16s .
Even small - town police departments are getting into the act .
The seven - officer department in Jasper , Florida , is now equipped with fully automatic M - 16s.2
In 1996 President Bill Clinton appointed a military commander , Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey , to oversee enforcement of the federal drug laws as the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy .
3
Since the mid-1990s U.S. Special Forces have been going after drug dealers in foreign countries .
According to the U.S. Southern Command , American soldiers occupy three radar sites in Colombia to help monitor drug flights .
And Navy SEALs have assisted in drug interdiction in the port city of Cap - Haitien , Haiti . 4 The U.S. Marine Corps is now patrolling the Mexican border to keep drugs and illegal immigrants out of this country .
In 1997 a Marine anti-drug patrol shot and killed 18 - year - old Esequiel Hernandez as he was tending his family 's herd of goats on private property .
The Justice Department settled a wrongful death lawsuit with the Hernandez family for $ 1.9 million . 5
In 1998 Indiana National Guard Engineering Units razed 42 crack houses in and around the city of Gary .
The National Guard has also been deployed in Washington , D.C. , to drive drug dealers out of certain locations .
6
In 1999 the Pentagon asked President Clinton to appoint a " military leader " for the continental United States in the event of a terrorist attack on American soil .
The powers that would be wielded by such a military commander were not made clear .
7
What is clear — and disquieting — is that the lines that have traditionally separated the military mission from the police mission are getting badly blurred .
Over the last 20 years Congress has encouraged the U.S. military to supply intelligence , equipment , and training to civilian police .
That encouragement has spawned a culture of paramilitarism in American police departments .
By virtue of their training and specialized armament , state and local police officers are adopting the tactics and mindset of their military mentors .
The problem is that the actions and values of the police officer are distinctly different from those of the warrior .
The job of a police officer is to keep the peace , but not by just any means .
Police officers are expected to apprehend suspected law breakers while adhering to constitutional procedures .
They are expected to use minimum force and to deliver suspects to a court of law .
The soldier , on the other hand , is an instrument of war .
In boot camp , recruits are trained to inflict maximum damage on enemy personnel .
Confusing the police function with the military function can have dangerous consequences .
As Albuquerque police chief Jerry Glavin has noted , " If [ cops ] have a mindset that the goal is to take out a citizen , it will happen . "
8
The lines that have traditionally separated the military mission from the police mission are getting badly blurred .
Paramilitarism threatens civil liberties , constitutional norms , and the well - being of all citizens .
Thus , the use of paramilitary tactics in everyday police work should alarm people of goodwill from across the political spectrum .
This paper will examine the militarization of law enforcement at the local level , with particular emphasis on SWAT ( Special Weapons and Tactics ) units .
The paper will conclude that the special skills of SWAT personnel and their military armaments are necessary only in extraordinary circumstances .
The deployment of such units should therefore be infrequent .
More generally , Congress should recognize that soldiers and police officers perform different functions .
Federal lawmakers should discourage the culture of paramilitarism in police departments by keeping the military out of civilian law enforcement .
A Brief History of the Relationship between the Military and Civilian Law Enforcement
The use of British troops to enforce unpopular laws in the American colonies helped to convince the colonists that King George III and Parliament were intent on establishing tyranny .9
The Declaration of Independence specifically refers to those practices , castigating King George for " quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us " and for " protecting [ soldiers ] , by mock Trial , from Punishment , for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States . "
The colonists complained that the king " has kept among us , in Times of peace , Standing Armies , without the consent of our Legislatures .
He has affected to render the Military independent of , and superior to , the Civil Power . "
After the Revolutionary War , Americans were determined to protect themselves against the threat of an overbearing military .
The Founders inserted several safeguards into the Constitution to ensure that the civilian powers of the new republic would remain distinct from , and superior to , the military : The Congress shall have Power . . .
To declare War . . .
To raise and support Armies . . .
To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and Naval Forces . . .
To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the Militia .10 No State shall , without the consent of Congress , . . . keep Troops , or Ships of War in time of Peace , . . . or engage in War , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay .
11 The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the Militia of the several States , when called into the actual Service of the United States .
12 A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed .
13
No soldier shall , in time of peace be quartered in any house , without the consent of the Owner , nor in time of war , but in a manner to be prescribed by law .
14
It is important to emphasize that those provisions were not considered controversial .
3
The debate was only with respect to whether those constitutional safeguards would prove adequate .
15 After the Revolutionary War , Americans were determined to protect themselves against the threat of an overbearing military ..
During the Civil War period the principle of civil - military separation broke down .
President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus , and citizens were arrested and tried before military tribunals .
After the Civil War , Congress imposed martial law in the rebel states .
And to shield the military 's reconstruction policies from constitutional challenges , Congress barred the Supreme Court from jurisdiction over federal appellate court rulings involving postwar reconstruction controversies .
17 The Army enforced an array of laws in the South and , not surprisingly , became politically meddlesome .
In several states the Army interfered with local elections and state political machinery .
Such interference during the presidential election of 1876 provoked a political firestorm .
18 The Democratic candidate , Samuel J. Tilden , won the popular vote while the Republican candidate , Rutherford B. Hayes , garnered more electoral votes .
The Republican victory was tainted by accusations that federal troops had stuffed the ballot box in a few southern states to favor Hayes .
Negotiations between the political parties ensued and a compromise was reached .
The Democrats agreed to concede the election to " Rutherfraud " Hayes ( as disgruntled partisans nicknamed him ) on the condition that federal troops be withdrawn from the South .
19 The Republicans agreed .
The Army 's machinations in the South also set the stage for a landmark piece of legislation , the Posse Comitatus Act.20
The one - sentence law provided , " Whoever , except in cases and under such circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or by Act of Congress , willfully uses any part of the Army as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined no more than $ 10,000 or imprisoned not more than two years , or both .
" 21 Southern Democrats proposed the Posse Comitatus bill in an effort to get Congress to reaffirm , by law , the principle of civil - military separation .
President Hayes signed that bill into law in June 1878 .
Federal troops have occasionally played a role in quelling civil disorder — without prior congressional authorization — in spite of the plain terms of the Posse Comitatus Act .
The U.S. Army , for example , was used to restore order in industrial disputes in the late 19th and early 20th century .
Except for the illegal occupation of the Coeur d'Alene mining region in Idaho in 1899 - 1901 , army troops were used by presidents to accomplish specific and temporary objectives — after which they were immediately withdrawn .
22 Federal troops and federalized National Guardsmen were called upon to enforce the desegregation of schools in Little Rock , Arkansas , in 1957 ; in Oxford , Mississippi , in 1962 ; and in Selma , Alabama , in 1963 .
Over the past 20 years there has been a dramatic expansion of the role of the military in law enforcement activity .
In 1981 Congress passed the Military Cooperation with Law Enforcement Officials Act.23
That law amended the Posse Comitatus Act insofar as it authorized the military to " assist " civilian police in the enforcement of drug laws .
The act encouraged the military to ( a ) make available equipment , military bases , and research facilities to federal , state , and local police ; ( b ) train and advise civilian police on the use of the equipment ; and ( c ) assist law enforcement personnel in keeping drugs from entering the country .
The act also authorized the military to share information acquired during military operations with civilian law enforcement agencies .
As the drug war escalated throughout the 1980s , the military was drawn further and further into the prohibition effort by a series of executive and congressional initiatives :
In 1986 President Ronald Reagan issued a National Decision Security Directive designating drugs as an official threat to " national security , " which encouraged a tight - knit relationship between civilian [ police and the military ] .
4
As the drug war escalated throughout the 1980s , the military was drawn further and further into the prohibition effort .. law enforcement and the military .
24 In 1987 Congress set up an administrative apparatus to facilitate transactions between civilian law enforcement officials and the military .
For example , a special office with an 800 number was established to handle inquiries by police officials regarding acquisition of military hardware .
25
In 1988 Congress directed the National Guard to assist law enforcement agencies in counter - drug operations .
Today National Guard units in all 50 states fly across America 's landscape in dark green helicopters , wearing camouflage uniforms and armed with machine guns , in search of marijuana fields .
26 In 1989 President George Bush created six regional joint task forces ( JTFs ) within the Department of Defense .
Those task forces are charged with coordinating the activities of the military and police agencies in the drug war , including joint training of military units and civilian police .
JTFs can be called on by civilian law enforcement agencies in counter - drug cases when police feel the need for military reinforcement .
27
In 1994 the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense signed a memorandum of understanding , which has enabled the military to transfer technology to state and local police departments .
Civilian officers now have at their disposal an array of high - tech military items previously reserved for use during wartime .
28
All of those measures have resulted in the militarization of a wide range of activity in the United States that had been previously considered the domain of civilian law enforcement .
As one reporter has observed , " Not since federal troops were deployed to the former Confederate states during Reconstruction has the U.S. military been so intimately involved in civilian law enforcement .
" 29 The Militarization of the Police Department Not only is the military directly involved in law enforcement ; police departments are increasingly emulating the tactics of the armed forces in their everyday activities .
This aspect of the militarization phenomenon has gone largely unnoticed .
The Early American Police Force
In one sense , the paramilitarism in today 's police departments is a consequence of the increasing professionalism of police in the 20th century .
Professionalism essentially grants a monopoly of specialized knowledge , training , and practice to certain groups in exchange for a commitment to a public service ideal .
While that may sound desirable for law enforcement officers , the effects of professionalism have , in many respects , been negative .
Over the last century police departments have evolved into increasingly centralized , authoritarian , autonomous , and militarized bureaucracies , which has led to their isolation from the citizenry .
Early police departments were anything but professional .
Officers were basically political appointees , with ties to ward bosses .
Officers also had strong cultural roots in the neighborhoods they patrolled .
Police work was more akin to social work , as jails provided overnight lodging and soup kitchens for tramps , lost children , and other destitute individuals .
Discipline was practically nonexistent , and law enforcement was characterized by an arbitrary , informal process that is sometimes dubbed " curbside justice . "
Barely trained and equipped , police aimed at regulating rather than preventing crime , which , in the previous century , meant something closer to policing vice and cultural lifestyles .
On the positive side , the early police forces were well integrated into their communities , often solving crimes by simply chatting with people on the street corners .
On the negative side , the police were suspicious of and often hostile to strangers .... immigrants , and , having strong loyalties to the local political machine , they were susceptible to bribery and political influence .
5 Police departments have evolved into increasingly centralized , authoritarian , autonomous , and militarized bureaucracies .
Throughout the 19th century police work was considered casual labor , making it difficult for either municipalities or precinct captains to impose any uniform standards on patrolmen .
Police did not consider themselves a self - contained body of law officers set apart from the general populace .
The initial round of professionalization took place during the Progressive Era with the appearance of early police literature , fraternal organizations , and rudimentary recruitment standards — all of which suggest the emergence of a common occupational self - consciousness .
Internal and external pressures forced the depoliticization and restructuring of police departments , which gradually reformed into centralized , depersonalized , hierarchical bureaucracies .
To gain control of the rank and file , police chiefs assigned military ranks and insignia to personnel , and some departments required military drills .
" Military methods have been adopted and military discipline enforced , " wrote Philadelphia police superintendent James Robinson in his department 's 1912 annual report .30
A wave of police unionism from 1917 to 1920 was a strong indication that police not only were acquiring a shared occupational outlook but had come to regard policing as a full - time career .
Two events , however , signaled the break - away of police from their communities and into their modern professional enclave .
In 1905 the first truly modern state police force was formed in Pennsylvania .
Ostensibly created to control crime in rural areas , the Pennsylvania State Police was used mainly in labor disputes , since the state militias and local police ( who were more likely to sympathize with strikers ) had been ineffective .
That centralized organization , under one commander appointed by the governor , recruited members from across the state so that no more than a handful of officers had roots in any single community .
This new force was considered so militaristic that the Pennsylvania Federation of Labor referred to it as " Cossacks . "
Despite the misgivings of many people , Pennsylvania started a trend .
Other states began to emulate Pennsylvania 's state police force .
The other significant event was J. Edgar Hoover 's directorship of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
By raising standards of training and recruitment , Hoover rescued federal law enforcement from its former state of corruption and mismanagement .
Hoover imbued his agents with a moral zeal to fight crime , and in 1935 he opened the National Police Academy , which has exerted tremendous influence on police training generally .
31 Hoover 's FBI acquired a prestige that made it the model police organization Elite SWAT Units Created
There is agreement in police literature that the incident that inspired the SWAT concept occurred in 1966 .
In August of that year a deranged man climbed to the top of the 32 - story clock tower at the University of Texas in Austin .
For 90 minutes he randomly shot 46 people , killing 15 of them , until two police officers got to the top of the tower and killed him .
The Austin episode was so blatant that it " shattered the last myth of safety Americans enjoyed [ and ] was the final impetus the chiefs of police needed " 32 to form their own SWAT teams .
Shortly thereafter , the Los Angeles Police Department formed the first SWAT team and , it is said , originated the acronym SWAT to describe its elite force .
The Los Angeles SWAT unit acquired national prestige when it was used successfully against the Black Panthers in 1969 and the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1973 .
Much like the FBI , the modern SWAT team was born of public fear and the perception by police that crime had reached such proportions and criminals had become so invincible that more armament and more training were needed .
SWAT team members have come to consider themselves members of an elite unit with specialized skills and more of a military ethos than the normal police structure .
Another striking similarity with the FBI is that that SWAT units have gained their status and legitimacy in the public eye by their performance in a few sensational events .
The earliest SWAT teams consisted of small units that could be called into action to deal with difficult situations , such as incidents involving hostages , barricaded suspects , or hijackers .
Early SWAT team members were not unlike regular police officers and were only slightly better equipped .
SWAT Teams Everywhere , Doing Everything
The 1980s and 1990s saw marked changes in the number of permanent SWAT teams across the country , in their mission and deployment , and in their tactical armament .
According to a 1997 study of SWAT teams conducted by Peter Kraska and Victor Kappeler of Eastern Kentucky University , nearly 90 percent of the police departments surveyed in cities with populations over 50,000 had paramilitary units , as did 70 percent of the departments surveyed in communities with populations under 50,000 .
33 Although the proliferation of those special units was slow in the late 1960s and early 1970s , their numbers took a leap in the mid-1970s , and growth has remained high since the 1980s .
In fact , most SWAT teams have been created in the 1980s and 1990s .
Towns like Jasper , Lakeland , and Palm Beach , Florida ; Lakewood , New Jersey ; Chapel Hill , North Carolina ; Charlottesville , Virginia ; and Harwich , Massachusetts , have SWAT teams .
The campus police at the University of Central Florida have a SWAT unit — even though the county SWAT team is available .
Kraska refers to the proliferation as the " militarization of Mayberry , " and he is rightly alarmed that the special units are becoming a normal and permanent part of law enforcement agencies .
Under the Military Cooperation with Law Enforcement Officials Act , Congress directed the military to make equipment and facilities available to civilian police in the anti-drug effort .
As a result , police departments began to acquire more sophisticated tactical equipment : automatic weapons with laser sights and sound suppressors , surveillance equipment such as Laser Bugs that can detect sounds inside a building by bouncing a laser beam off a window , pinhole cameras , flash and noise grenades , rubber bullets , bullet - proof apparel , battering rams , and more .
The Boone County Sheriff 's office in Indiana has acquired an amphibious armored personnel carrier .
34
In Fresno , California , the SWAT unit has access to two helicopters equipped with night vision goggles and an armored personnel carrier with a turret .
35 According to Cal Black , a former SWAT commander for the FBI , " The equipment SWAT teams use today is many times more sophisticated than it was when I began in SWAT in the 1970s .
. . .
Because of this high - tech equipment , the ability of SWAT teams has increased dramatically .
" 36 The National Institute of Justice report on the DOJ - DOD technology " partnership " boasted a number of high - tech items that SWAT teams now have at their disposal .
Included among the showcase military technologies deemed applicable to law enforcement were " inconspicuous systems that can detect from more than 30 feet away weapons with little or no metal content as well as those made of metal .
"
37 Other items in the pipeline include " a gas - launched , wireless , electric stun projectile " ; a " vehicular laser surveillance and dazzler system " ; " pyrotechnic devices such as flash - bang grenades [ and ] smoke grenades " ; instruments of " crowd control " ; mobile , even hand - held , systems to locate gunfire ; and tagging equipment to locate , identify , and monitor the " movement of individuals , vehicles and containers .
"
38 Special body armor and helmets are also under consideration .
Nick Pastore , former police chief in New Haven , Connecticut , says : " I was offered tanks , bazookas , anything I wanted .
. . .
I turned it all down because it feeds a mindset that you 're not a police officer serving a community , you 're a soldier at war .
" 39,7 The 1980s and 1990s saw marked changes in the number of permanent SWAT teams across the country , in their mission and deployment , and in their tactical armament ..
An even more disturbing development reported in the Kraska - Kappeler study , however , is the growing tendency of police departments to use SWAT units in routine policing activity .
The Fresno SWAT unit , for example , sends its 40 - person team , with full military dress and gear , into the inner city " war zone " to deal with problems of drugs , gangs , and crime .
One survey respondent described his department 's use of SWAT teams in the following way : " We 're into saturation patrols in hot spots .
We do a lot of our work with the SWAT unit because we have bigger guns .
We send out two , two - to - four - men cars , we look for minor violations and do jump - outs , either on people on the street or automobiles .
After we jump - out the second car provides periphery cover with an ostentatious display of weaponry .
We 're sending a clear message : if the shootings do n't stop , we 'll shoot someone . "
40 A Midwestern community with a population of 75,000 sends out patrols dressed in tactical uniform in a military personnel carrier .
The armored vehicle , according to the SWAT commander , stops " suspicious vehicles and people .
We stop anything that moves .
We 'll sometimes even surround suspicious homes and bring out the MP5s ( machine gun pistols ) . "
41 Unfortunately , it is likely that the number of SWAT " patrols " will rise in the future .
In their survey , when Kraska and Kappeler asked the question , Is your department using the tactical operations unit as a proactive patrol unit to aid high crime areas ?
107 departments indicated that they were .
Sixty - one percent of all respondents thought it was a good idea .
In fact , 63 percent of the departments in that survey agreed that SWAT units " play an important role in community policing strategies .
" 42 According to Police magazine , " Police officers working in patrol vehicles , dressed in urban tactical gear and armed with automatic weapons are here — and they 're here to stay .
" 43 Limiting the SWAT Mission to Bona Fide Emergencies
The relatively recent phenomenon of special , commando - type units within civilian law enforcement agencies is occurring on both sides of the Atlantic .
The British counterpart to the SWAT team in America is the Police Support Unit ( PSU ) .
In 1993 the British Journal of Criminology published opposing views on British paramilitarism by P. A. J. Waddington and Anthony Jefferson .
Both scholars agreed that public order policing in Britain by PSUs was becoming paramilitaristic , but they could not agree on a precise definition of " paramilitarism . "
While Jefferson defined paramilitarism as " the application of quasi-military training , equipment , philosophy and organization to questions of policing , " Waddington confined paramilitarism to police methods of riot control , namely , " the coordination and integration of all officers deployed as squads under centralised command and control . " 44 A third scholar , Alice Hills , has sought the middle ground , rounding off the differences by looking at paramilitary forces of other countries , such as the French Gendarmerie , the Italian Carabiniere , the Frontier Guards in Finland , Civil Defense Units in Saudi Arabia , and the National Security Guards in India .
By Hills 's reckoning , paramilitarism should " be defined in terms of function . . . and relationships ; of the police to the military and to the state , as well as to the legal system and style of political process .
" 45 In general , however , as has been the case in this country , British studies have largely " neglected . . . the relationship of the police to the other uniformed services , particularly the army , in the late twentieth century .
"
46 What is disturbing is that under any of the definitions offered by the British analysts , American SWAT teams can be regarded as paramilitary units .
The institutional cooperation between civilian law enforcement and the military has emerged under the direct political sponsorship of elected leaders in the national legislature and the presidency .
( In 1981 Congress diluted the Posse Comitatus Act — a law that was designed to keep the military out of civilian affairs — in order to give the military an active role in the war on drugs , and that role has been expanded by subsequent congressional action and by the support of presidents of both political parties . ) 8
A disturbing development is the growing tendency of police departments to use SWAT units in routine policing activity ..
The military - law enforcement connection is now a basic assumption within the federal government , and it receives enthusiastic support in government literature .
For example , in a 1997 National Institute of Justice report on the transfer of military technology to civilian police departments , the Joint Program Steering Group explained the " convergence in the technology needs of the law enforcement and military communities " as due to their " common missions . "
In the military 's newest " peacekeeping " role abroad , it is obliged — much as civilian police — to be " highly discreet when applying force , " given the " greater presence of members of the media or other civilians who are observing , if not recording , the situation .
" 47 Moreover , the military 's enemy abroad has begun to resemble law enforcement 's enemy at home : " Law officers today confront threats that have more and more military aspects " due to the changed " nature of criminals and their crimes . "
48 With widespread political sanction , the military is now encouraged to share training , equipment , technology — and , most subtle , mentality — with state and local civilian police .
SWAT team members undergo rigorous training similar to that given military special operations units .
Training , as one study has noted , " may seem to be a purely technical exercise , [ but ] it actually plays a central role in paramilitary subculture " 49 and moreover reinforces " the importance of feeling and thinking as a team .
"
50 The research of Kraska and Kappeler revealed that SWAT units are often trained alongside , or with the support of , military special forces personnel .
Of 459 SWAT teams across the country , 46 percent acquired their initial training from " police officers with special operations experience in the military , " and 43 percent with " active - duty military experts in special operations . "
51 Almost 46 percent currently conducted training exercises with " active - duty military experts in special operations . "
52 Twenty - three respondents to the survey indicated that they trained with either Navy SEALs or Army Rangers .53
One respondent went into greater detail : " We 've had special forces folks who have come right out of the jungles of Central and South America .
. . .
All branches of military service are involved in providing training to law enforcement .
U.S. Marshals act as liaisons between the police and military to set up the training — our go - between .
They have an arrangement with the military through JTF - 6 [ Joint Task Force 6 ] . . . .
I just received a piece of paper from a four - star general who tells us he 's concerned about the type of training we 're getting .
We 've had teams of Navy Seals and Special Forces come here and teach us everything .
We just have to use our judgment and exclude the information like : " at this point we bring in the mortars and blow the place up .
" 54 Because of their close collaboration with the military , SWAT units are taking on the warrior mentality of our military 's special forces .
SWAT team organization resembles that of a special combat unit , with a commander , a tactical team leader , a scout , a rear guard or " defenseman , " a marksman ( sniper ) , a spotter , a gasman , and paramedics .
Moreover , SWAT teams , like military special forces , are elite units :
Their rigorous team training ; high - tech armament ; and " battle dress uniforms , " consisting of lace - up combat boots , full body armor , Kevlar helmets , and goggles with " ninja " style hoods , reinforce their elitism within law enforcement agencies .
( One commander — who disapproved of proactive SWAT policing and turned down requests from team members to dress in black battle dress uniforms while on patrol — nevertheless understood its attraction to team members : " I can't blame them , we 're a very elite unit , they just want to be distinguishable .
"
55 ) Because of their close collaboration with the military , SWAT units are taking on the warrior mentality of our military 's special forces .
The so - called war on drugs and other martial metaphors are turning high - crime areas into " war zones , " citizens into potential enemies , and police officers into soldiers .
Preparing the ground for the 1994 technology transfer agreement between the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice , Attorney General Reno addressed the defense and intelligence community .
In her speech , Reno compared the drug war to the Cold War , and the armed and dangerous enemies abroad to those at home : " So let me welcome you to the kind of war our police fight every day .
And let me challenge you to turn your skills that served us so well in the Cold War to helping us with the war we 're now fighting daily in the streets of our towns and cities across the Nation .
" 56 The martial rhetoric can be found in both political parties .
Bill McCollum ( R - Fla . ) , chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee , has criticized the Clinton administration for not waging the war on drugs aggressively enough : " The drug crisis is a top — if not the top — national security threat facing our nation today . . . [ the Clinton ] administration 's clear unwillingness to wage an all - out drug war can not go unchallenged .
"
57 In the current political climate , anyone who does not support an escalation of the drug war is condemned for being " soft on crime .
" 58 Departmental SWAT teams have accepted the military as a model for their behavior and outlook , which is distinctly impersonal and elitist ; American streets are viewed as the " front " and American citizens as the " enemy . "
The sharing of training and technology by the military and law enforcement agencies has produced a shared mindset , and the mindset of the warrior is simply not appropriate for the civilian police officer charged with enforcing the law .
The soldier confronts an enemy in a life - or - death situation .
The soldier learns to use lethal force on the enemy , both uniformed and civilian , irrespective of age or gender .
The soldier must sometimes follow orders unthinkingly , acts in concert with his comrades , and initiates violence on command .
That mentality , with which new recruits are strenuously indoctrinated in boot camp , can be a matter of survival to the soldier and the nation at war .
The civilian law enforcement officer , on the other hand , confronts not an " enemy " but individuals who , like him , are both subject to the nation 's laws and protected by the Bill of Rights .
Although the police officer can use force in life - threatening situations , the Constitution and numerous Supreme Court rulings have circumscribed the police officer 's direct use of force , as well as his power of search and seizure .
59
In terms of violence , the police officer 's role is — or should be — purely reactive .
When a police officer begins to think like a soldier , tragic consequences — such as the loss of innocent life at Waco — will result .
After some controversial SWAT shootings spawned several wrongful death lawsuits against the police department of Albuquerque , New Mexico , the city hired Professor Sam Walker of the University of Nebraska to study its departmental practices .
According to Walker : " The rate of killings by the police was just off the charts .
. . .
They had an organizational culture that led them to escalate situations upward rather than deescalating .
The mindset of the warrior is simply not appropriate for the civilian police officer charged with enforcing the law ..61" 60
The city of Albuquerque subsequently hired a new police chief and dismantled its SWAT unit .
The tiny town of Dinuba , California ( population 15,000 ) , created a SWAT unit in the spring of 1997 .
A few months later an innocent man , Ramon Gallardo , was killed by the SWAT team when it raided his home looking for one of his teenage sons .
The SWAT unit rushed into the Gallardo household at 7 a.m. wearing hoods and masks , yelling " search warrant . "
Gallardo and his wife were awakened by the ruckus , but before they could determine what was happening , Ramon was shot 15 times .
10 A police brutality lawsuit was later brought against the city .
At trial , the police said they had to shoot in self - defense because Gallardo had grabbed a knife .
Gallardo's wife testified that the knife on the scene did not belong to her husband and alleged that the police had planted it there to legitimize the shooting .
The jury awarded the Gallardo family $ 12.5 million .
Because the whopping verdict exceeded the small town 's insurance coverage , the city is now in financial straits .
After Gallardo's killing , the city fathers of Dinuba disbanded the SWAT unit and gave its military equipment to another police department .
62 Some local jurisdictions may wish to retain SWAT units for the special skills they possess , but the deployment of such units should be limited to extraordinary circumstances — such as a hostage situation .
If a SWAT unit is created ( or retained ) , the need for that unit should be assessed annually by locally elected officials .
Policymakers must be especially wary of " mission creep " and guard against it .
Inactive SWAT teams have a strong incentive to expand their original " emergency " mission into more routine policing activities to justify their existence .
In recent years , city officials in Dallas and Seattle have curtailed the activity of their SWAT units , taking them off drug raids and suicide calls .
Other cities should follow their lead by curtailing the SWAT mission — or even dismantling the entire unit as was done in Albuquerque and Dinuba .
Conclusion
The militarization of law enforcement in America is a deeply disturbing development .
Police officers are not supposed to be warriors .
The job of a police officer is to keep the peace while adhering to constitutional procedures .
Soldiers , on the other hand , consider enemy personnel human targets .
Confusing the police function with the military function can lead to dangerous and unintended consequences — such as unnecessary shootings and killings .
The proliferation of SWAT teams is particularly worrisome because such units are rarely needed .
SWAT teams are created to deal with emergency situations that are beyond the capacity of the ordinary street cop .
But , as time passes , inactive SWAT units tend to jettison their original , limited mission for more routine policing activities .
Local jurisdictions should carefully assess the need for SWAT units and guard against the danger of mission creep .
SWAT teams do possess specialized skills , but they should only be deployed on those extraordinary occasions when their skills are necessary — such as a hostage situation .
More generally , Congress should recognize that federal policies have contributed to the culture of paramilitarism that currently pervades many local police departments by restoring the traditional American principle of civil - military separation embodied in the Posse Comitatus Act .
The Military Cooperation with Law Enforcement Officials
Act created a dangerous loophole in the Posse Comitatus Act .
That loophole should be closed immediately .
Congress should also abolish all military - civilian law enforcement joint task forces and see to it that all military hardware loaned , given , or sold to law enforcement agencies is destroyed or returned .
Armored personnel carriers and machine guns , should not be a part of everyday law enforcement in a free society .

The University of East Anglia said yesterday that it was cooperating with police and launching its own internal probe into how thousands of e-mails and documents from its Climatic Research Unit ended up on the Internet last week , sparking an ongoing fight between climate scientists and skeptics who say the data breach suggests ethical lapses in the research community .
The incident came to light last Tuesday morning , when hackers attempted to post the stolen data on " RealClimate , " a group blog maintained by many prominent scientists , including some quoted in the CRU e-mails .
Some of the e-mails and files are impolite , revealing deep grudges between scientists and skeptics .
Others are mundane announcements of upcoming conferences or research trips .
But by the end of last week , climate skeptics were busy posting and analyzing CRU e-mails and files they say justify their objections to mainstream climate science , including the idea that humans are driving global warming .
" Some of them are embarrassing , " said Pat Michaels , a senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute .
" The one about ' let 's punch Pat Michaels ' -- that 's really no big deal .
Much more important are the e-mails showing attempts to intimidate the editors of journals and the refereed scientific literature . "
Messages Michaels objects to include a March 19 , 2009 , e-mail from CRU Dsirector Phil Jones in which he complains to another scientist about the new editor of Weather , a journal published by the Royal Meteorological Society .
" If I do n't get him to back down , I wo n't be sending any more papers to any RMS journals and I 'll be resigning from the RMS , " Jones writes , in an apparent protest to a change in the journal 's guidelines for authors .
Other e-mails that have drawn scrutiny include a message from Kevin Trenberth , a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. , that includes this sentence : " The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can 't . "
Heated battle over ' lack of warming '
Skeptics have also pounced on an e-mail from Jones to colleagues that reads : " I 've just completed Mike 's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) and from 1961 for Keith 's to hide the decline . "
But the scientists affected by the data breach say the leaked information does n't contain a smoking gun .
" I 'm involved in 102 of the e-mails , " Trenberth said .
" I do n't see anything embarrassing to me particularly .
There are a few things that can be taken out of context , and they have been . "
That includes the line about a " lack of warming , " which Trenberth says was part of a longer message intended to highlight shortcomings in scientists ' understanding of recent temperature fluctuations .
" We 've always had some problems with the observing system , " he said .
" It 's obviously not as good as we would like , and that 's true of the temperature record , as well .
What this is saying is we need better observations .
What it 's not saying is that global warming is not here . "
Trenberth said it 's telling that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found evidence of climate change to be " unequivocal " in its 2007 report .
" The IPCC is actually a fairly conservative process , " he said .
" It involves people from over 100 countries and different parts of the political spectrum to see what the best statements we can make about global climate change are .
They are consensus statements , so by definition that means they are somewhat conservative . "
Nothing unethical about a ' trick '
Meanwhile , Jones defended his " trick " e-mail in a statement posted on the University of East Anglia 's Web site .
" The word trick was used here colloquially as in a clever thing to do , " he said .
" It is ludicrous to suggest that it refers to anything untoward . "
Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann -- the " Michael " in Jones ' message -- agreed .
Mann said the second portion of Jones ' message referred to a known problem with certain temperature records gleaned from tree rings .
Up until 1960 , temperature records measured by weather stations agree with records extrapolated from tree rings .
But after 1960 , it 's a different story .
Some of the trees no longer accurately register temperature variations .
That 's a problem that CRU scientist Keith Briffa identified in a journal article more than 10 years ago , Mann said , arguing that scientists should n't use the inaccurate post - 1960 data .
To suggest otherwise is a " deliberate smear , " Mann said .
" I really think the story is this very carefully , and almost certainly high - level , orchestrated smear campaign to distract the public about the nature of the climate change problem . "
Scientists playing ' whack - a- mole '
Perhaps unsurprisingly , those following reaction to the release of the stolen e-mail and files do n't agree on its ultimate impact on climate policy and public opinion .
The Cato Institute 's Michaels says he believes the true impact of the data breach wo n't be felt until next year , since it 's unlikely that nations will assent to a new binding agreement next month at U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen .
" Whatever happens , this is going to go on -- there are just too many of them , " Michael said , referring to the CRU files .
" It 's like whack - a - mole .
And the whack - a- mole nature of it means it 's going to be prolonged .
We 're now seeing people get into the computer code , and that 's going to have a life of its own . "
But Anthony Leiserowitz , director of the Yale Project on Climate Change , says he believes the release of the CRU data will ultimately do little to influence public opinion .
" Based on what we have here , I do n't believe it 's going to affect public opinion at all , " he said .
" Most people will never hear about this .
Within a month , probably within a couple of weeks , this story will have basically died as a mainstream media story , unless it turns out to be the beginning of some grander , bigger scandal . "
What 's also likely , Leiserowitz said , is that the files will help harden the views of climate skeptics , who see the CRU data as reinforcing their existing suspicions .
A chilling effect on future collaboration ?
Meanwhile , some researchers whose e-mail was leaked said they are concerned the incident will have a chilling effect on how scientists communicate with each other .
" Science is a social endeavor , " Schmidt said .
" We collaborate with people across the world .
... I think people now realize e-mail is not the same as having a conversation with a friend .
That means we will be communicating less like that , and that is a shame .
You ca n't do everything by phone . "
Judith Curry , a researcher at Georgia Institute of Technology who studies the links between hurricanes and climate change , said in a posting on the climate skeptics ' blog " Climate Audit " that she hopes the CRU kerfuffle will change the way scientists approach providing their data to the public and reacting to criticism of their work .
" In my opinion , " she wrote , " there are two broader issues raised by these emails that are impeding the public credibility of climate research : lack of transparency in climate data , and ' tribalism ' in some segments of the climate research community that is impeding peer review and the assessment process . "
Curry said she learned the hard way , when a " disgruntled employee " submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act , to be careful about what she puts in an e-mail .
But Mann said those comments were " somewhat naive , " especially since scientists have become much more open with their data in recent years .
Skeptics " will always complain about something else , want something more , " Mann said .
" Eventually , as we see , they 've found a way to get access to private communications between scientists . "

Strikeforce and CBS will present Fedor Emelianenko to the country this Saturday night .
Fedor will fight his first fight in a three - fight deal with Strikeforce .
Fedor will fight relative unknown , Brett Rogers in what is being billed as the main - event .
Rogers has the unenviable task of trying to survive against arguably the greatest MMA fighter of the 21st century .
To me , this fight is nothing but a huge farce .
I think it is laughable that Strikeforce thinks any MMA fan with a brain would take Rogers as a serious threat to Fedor .
Brett does boast an impressive record by the numbers , going 10 - 0 with nine knockouts .
However , there is nothing impressive about the record once you take a look at Rogers ’ opponents .
Rogers ’ biggest claim to fame was an awesome first - round knockout over former UFC champion , Andrei Arlovski .
Other than the Arlovski fight , there is n’t much on Rogers ’ record to get excited about .
Rogers has been turned into main - event fighter in Strikeforce by necessity .
Dana
White proclaimed the company , Strikefarce due to this kind of match - making .
I agree with him .
Arlovski has n’t exactly been stellar the last couple of years .
A knockout win over Arlovski is impressive for someone of Rogers ’ inexperience , but that does n’t make me believe he can hang with anyone like Fedor .
This is truly a showcase fight for Fedor and nothing more in my opinion .
Something interesting to note about this fight is the betting line as of this writing .
The line on the fight from BetUs.com is Fedor as a - 550 favorite with Rogers as a +375 underdog .
That is interesting to me , because Fedor was a - 800 favorite against Marc Coleman two years ago .
On paper , I would expect that Marc Coleman would have a better shot of beating Fedor in 2006 yet Rogers is getting a little more respect from Vegas .
I am truly surprised that the betting line is n’t - 1,000 or more for Fedor .
As for Fedor Emelianenko , the next three fights may be the biggest fights of his career .
Fedor passed up a reported $ 30 million deal to sign with UFC for a three - fight Strikeforce deal .
Anyone that follows MMA knows that Fedor Emelianenko vs. Brock Lesnar is the biggest money match not on the table right now .
Until Fedor signs with the UFC , it is n’t going to happen .
UFC president Dana
White said that the offer to Fedor will still be available once his Strikeforce deal expires with one catch .
White said he will pull the offer immediately if Fedor loses a fight .
Theoretically , the financial future of Fedor and prosperity of a Brock Lesnar showdown starts this Saturday against Brett Rogers .
I do n’t think there is a chance in the world that Fedor loses .
Rogers does have incredible punching power , but he does n’t have the ground game to hang with Fedor .
To me , too much is being made of the shots Arlovski nailed Fedor with back in their January fight .
Strikeforce likes to cite that moment to remind people that Fedor is beatable .
The bottom line is that Fedor shook it off and put Arlovski on his butt for a knockout of his own and the win .
Fedor is beatable , but Brett Rogers is not going to be the guy to beat Fedor .
If Rogers does the unthinkable , Fedor ’s reputation in MMA will take a huge hit .
He has been vastly criticized for passing up the UFC deal for Strikeforce .
A lot of fighters and writers feel that Fedor went to Strikeforce to avoid the more competitive UFC .
To bolster UFC ’s argument , UFC offered Fedor an immediate world title match in his first bout .
Strikeforce ’s champion has n’t defended the title in two years .
One would assume looking on the outside that Fedor is definitely taking an easier road by signing with Strikeforce .
If Brett Rogers happens to pull off the unthinkable , all of Fedor ’s critics will be proven right in that Fedor ’s skills have declined and he is n’t the fighter he used to be .
My prediction is a first - round knockout .
I have watched a ton of Fedor fights and I just do n’t see a flaw in his game .
The only flaw I see would be his size and the obvious mismatch in size that he would have to overcome against Brock Lesnar .
Rogers is taller and has about 30 - 40 pounds on Fedor , but he does n’t have the ground game to bully Fedor around like Lesnar could do .
I think Fedor is out to prove a point Saturday and keep his $ 30 million UFC offer safe .
Fedor saw what happened when Arlovski let his guard down and he wo n’t make the same mistake .
My prediction is Fedor in a first - round knockout , and the Fedor - Lesnar talk starts once again .

Police in central China have closed a factory producing fake and unsterile condoms and are tracking down over two million of the unsafe contraceptives already on the market , state press say .
The condoms were made in a factory in Hunan province and are believed to have been sold nationwide under a variety of names , including those of well - known makers such as Jissbon and Durex , the China Youth Daily said .
Police have detained suspect manufacturer Li Anping , who allegedly bought condoms wholesale , added an unknown lubricant and crudely packaged them without sterilising the product , the report said .
Several underage girls worked in the now - shuttered factory , it added .
Li allegedly produced up to 2.16 million condoms before the plant was closed down .
Fake and faulty products remain a major concern in China as unscrupulous manufacturers seek to make profits as the nation 's economy booms .

A year ago , the only thing we had to fear was fear itself ; today , the reigning doctrine in Washington appears to be “ Be afraid .
Be very afraid . ”
What happened ?
To be sure , “ centrists ” in the Senate have hobbled efforts to rescue the economy .
But the evidence suggests that in addition to facing political opposition , President Obama and his inner circle have been intimidated by scare stories from Wall Street .
Consider the contrast between what Mr. Obama ’s advisers were saying on the eve of his inauguration , and what he himself is saying now .
In December 2008 Lawrence Summers , soon to become the administration ’s highest - ranking economist , called for decisive action .
“ Many experts , ” he warned , “ believe that unemployment could reach 10 percent by the end of next year . ”
In the face of that prospect , he continued , “ doing too little poses a greater threat than doing too much . ”
( CNN ) --
When Kerry Higuera started bleeding three months into her pregnancy , she feared she was miscarrying .
Heading to the emergency room seemed like the prudent thing to do .
Higuera says she 'll regret that decision for the rest of her life .
When Higuera arrived at Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale , Arizona , that February morning in 2008 , she was put in a room and told to wait for a nurse to come get her .
Soon , a nurse poked her head into her room .
" She said , ' Kerry ? ' and I said , ' Yes , ' and she said , ' I 'm going to take you for a little walk ' and I followed her down the hallway , " says Higuera , a mother of four who lives in Peoria , Arizona .
" She brought me to the CT scan room , and I said , ' Is this really what I need to have done ? '
And the nurse said , ' Yes , this is what the doctor wants .
He wants a CT scan of your abdomen , ' and I said , ' OK , ' " Higuera remembers .
After the scan , the nurse led Higuera back to a room to wait for the doctor .
" I was so scared .
I told my husband , I 'm sure I 've had a miscarriage .
I 'm sure the doctor is going to come and tell us we lost the baby , " she says .
But that was n't what happened at all .
After about half an hour , Higuera says the emergency room physician , two radiologists and a representative from the hospital 's human resources department came into her room .
" I started to cry and asked if I 'd miscarried , and they said no , I was still pregnant .
My husband and I said , ' Oh , that 's great ! ' " she remembers .
But then they told the Higueras there was something else they needed to know .
" They said , ' We made a mistake ; we did something we should n't have done , ' and I was like , ' What do you mean ? ' "
Higuera remembers .
" They said ' There 's another patient here named Kerry , and you two are the same age .
We mixed you up .
She was supposed to have the CT scan , not you . ' "
While no large studies have been done on the effects on the fetus of performing a CT scan to a pregnant woman 's abdomen , experts say a fetus exposed to radiation can , in some cases , develop physical and mental growth problems
In statement e-mailed to CNN , Bill Byron , senior director for public relations and online services at Banner Health , wrote , " Ms. Higuera is represented by legal counsel in this matter and it appears to be moving towards litigation ; therefore , Banner Health is unable to provide any comment at this time . "
Higuera 's lawyer , David Patton of Scottsdale , Arizona , provided CNN with Higuera 's records from her visit to Banner Thunderbird .
" The patient was unintentionally scanned as she was confused with another patient , " reads one report .
" There was a misidentification of the patient and inadvertently this patient [ Kerry Higuera ] had a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed , " reads another report .
" [ The scan ] had been ordered for another patient with a similar first name . "
More than five wrong surgeries every day
While Higuera 's story is certainly unusual , it 's more common than you might think for a hospital patient to be the victim of mistaken identity , or to receive a surgery on the wrong body part .
The Joint Commission , which accredits hospitals , reports that wrong - site , wrong - side and wrong - patient procedures occur more than 40 times each week in the United States .
Earlier this month in Rhode Island , state regulators took the unusual step of requiring video cameras in all operating rooms at Rhode Island Hospital after a spate of errors .
At least six surgical errors have occurred at Rhode Island Hospital since 2001 , including one where a child went in for eye surgery and the surgeons , confusing this child with another patient , took out the tonsils instead .
Another child had cleft palate surgery on the wrong side of the mouth .
Another patient went in for neurosurgery , and doctors drilled holes on the wrong side of the head .
Dr. Mary Cooper , chief quality officer for Lifespan Health System , which owns Rhode Island Hospital , says the facility is fully committed to making the hospital safer .
" Every single time we hear of something we can do to prevent problems , we put in those fixes , " she says .
" We like to catch all errors before they happen , and we do a good job of that , in general . "
She added that just because surgical errors occur at a hospital does not mean that the hospital is bad .
" I was working at a hospital where my husband had an operation in the wrong location , and he continued having surgeries there , " she says .
Free coupons and flowers
Back in Arizona , Higuera says the doctors were " very nice " and " said they were sorry over and over again . "
She says the emergency room doctor , who was also pregnant , cried as she apologized to her and her husband .
" They asked me if I wanted free coupons to the hospital cafeteria , and I said no thanks .
They asked me what kind of flowers I liked , that I would have flowers waiting for me when I arrived home , " she says .
Higuera says the doctors explained to the couple that their baby could have mental retardation , a low IQ or growth problems because of the radiation exposure .
Her baby , Nathan Higuera , is now 15 months old .
His pediatrician is aware of Nathan 's situation , according to Nathan 's medical records , given to CNN by Higuera 's lawyer .
" MOM EXPOSED TO RADIATION DURING FIRST TRIMESTER , " reads one comment in the pediatrician 's notes .
" CHECK DEVELOPMENT !!! "
In the pediatrician 's records , it 's noted that at 3 months of age , Nathan 's head circumference had been in the 73rd percentile , but that at his 1 - year checkup it was in the fifth percentile .
Pediatricians often consider it a red flag if a child 's growth does not stay in the same percentile range .
The records also note that Nathan would be referred to a specialist soon if his growth and development " is not that great . "
" I feel horrible that I let them do the CT scan , " says Higuera , crying .
" But I thought the doctors must know what they 're doing .
I did n't know .
I did n't know . "
To try to keep yourself and your family from receiving the wrong surgery , follow the advice below .
As Jim Conway , the senior vice president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement puts it : " An empowered patient becomes a very important partner in getting things right . "
1. Say : " My name is Mary Smith , my date of birth is October 21 , 1965 , and I 'm here for an appendectomy . "
You might feel like an idiot , but say this to every doctor , nurse , and technician who takes care of you .
2. Say : " Please check my ID bracelet . "
Hospital staff is supposed to confirm your identity in at least two ways , according to Nancy Foster , vice president for quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association .
One of those ways is to check your ID , or scan it if it has a bar code .
Another way is to ask you for your name and date of birth .
Of course , you should check your bracelet to make sure the information on it is correct .
3 . Say : " Please look in my chart and tell me what procedure I 'm having . "
If a nurse states that you 're having an appendectomy and she 's right , that 's not enough , because that nurse wo n't necessarily be there with you in the operating room .
" Make sure the nurse is looking at your chart when she tells you what procedure or test you 're having , " says Ilene Corina , president of PULSE , New York , a grass - roots patient safety organization .
4. Say : " I want to mark up my surgical site with the surgeon present . "
Hospitals these days often hand patients a pen and ask them to mark where they 're going to have surgery .
Corina says you should do it in front of the surgeon who will be with you in the operating room , and not just in front of the person who hands you the pen .
" If you mark it and the surgeon does n't know about the marking , what 's the point of marking it ? " Corina asks .
5 . Be impolite .
Foster , the executive at the hospital association , gives this example .
" If the nurse comes in and says , ' Are you Mary Jones ? ' and you 're really Miriam Jones , you might just nod your head and say yes because you 're too polite to correct her , " Foster says .
" Do n't be polite . "
Higuera now wishes she 'd been impolite and followed her instincts .
" On my way into the CT scan , the nurse looked at the chart in her hands and said , ' This scan should help tell us why you 're having abdominal pain . '
I told her I was n't having pain , just bleeding , and she said , ' Well , the doctor says you 're having pain , ' " Higuera remembers .
" I thought it was strange , but I did n't say anything more . "
It was , of course , the other Kerry who was having pain , the Kerry who actually did need the abdominal CT scan .
" If that happened to me now , I would say , ' Stop everything , I 'm not doing this scan , ' " she adds .
" If I were wrong , I 'd have been embarrassed .
But I 'd rather be embarrassed than be in the situation we 're in now . "
CNN 's Sharisse Scineaux , Matt Sloane and Sabriya Rice contributed to this report .
Gordon Brown today called for a new global " economic and social contract " with the financial institutions to ensure taxpayers around the world would never again have to bear the cost of banking failure .
Addressing the meeting of G20 finance ministers in St Andrews , the Prime Minister said that in future there must be a " just distribution of risks and rewards " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" I believe we should discuss whether we need a better economic and social contract to reflect the global responsibilities of financial institutions to society , " he said .
" This is a unique sector that , when it fails , imposes such a high cost to the wider economy and damage to society that government intervention becomes essential .
So the taxpayer had no real choice but to step in to keep the system afloat .
" And it can not be acceptable that the benefits of success in this sector are reaped by the few but the costs of its failure are borne by all of us .
" There must be a better economic and social contract between financial institutions and the public based on trust and a just distribution of risks and rewards . "
Mr Brown said that it could be achieved through an insurance fee to reflect systemic risk , a special " resolution fund " , contingent capital arrangements , or a global levy on financial transactions - a so - called " Tobin tax " .
Mr Brown stressed that in order to work , the measures would have to be implemented by all the major financial centres around the world - including the US , Europe , Asia , the Middle East and Switzerland .
" Let me be clear : Britain will not move unless others move with us together , " he said .
The measures would also have to be " non-distortionary " - to ensure they did not result in inefficient allocation or encourage avoidance - and should reinforce the action already taken to stabilise the financial system .

He stressed that the contribution of the financial services sector would have to be " fair , measured and enable financial services to make their necessary contribution to future economic growth " .
" I do not in any way underestimate the enormous and difficult practical and technical issues that will need to be overcome that a globally cohesive system raises , " he said .
" But I do not think these difficulties should prevent us from considering with urgency the legitimate issues I have discussed .
" Those goals are ambitious but they are necessary .
" I believe in a strong global financial sector .
I believe in an open and inclusive globalisation .
But I believe that the global economy and global society will only thrive if it is brought within a rational and fair framework . "
Mr Brown again warned that it was still too soon for countries to consider withdrawing the one trillion dollar " stimulus " package which they agreed to support their economies .
" While recent indications of economic expansion give cause for cautious optimism they are not a reason to end economic stimulus prematurely , " he said .
" It would be dangerous to put recovery at risk by suddenly cutting off the funding and investment that is supporting families and businesses through the most challenging times in a generation . "
He said that when the time came , it was important that countries were able to co-ordinate their " exit strategies " .
Two days after the world ’s atomic energy watchdog rebuked Iran for building a small undisclosed uranium enrichment facility , the Islamic Republic ’s Cabinet today ordered a dramatic expansion of the nuclear program that would include 10 more nuclear plants .
If completed , the plan to build nuclear enrichment facilities on the scale of the industrial - size 50,000 - centrifuge in the town of Natanz would provide Iran with enough enriched uranium to produce 20,000 megawatts of electricity within six years , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said , according to the semiofficial Mehr news agency .
But Iran ’s stated plans often do n’t square with its capabilities .
The oil - and - gas rich Middle East nation of 70 million would need to overcome economic and technical hurdles to mount so ambitious an expansion of its nuclear program .
Currently , Iran has installed about 8,000 centrifuges , of which only about half are producing reactor - grade uranium .
Ahmadinejad said the new facilities would incorporate new , more efficient centrifuges that have yet to be employed by Iran .
“ New high - capacity centrifuges have been designed by the Islamic Republic of Iran that can carry out the task in fewer numbers , ” he said .
“ We will use these new centrifuges as soon as they become operational . ”
Iran ’s parliament issued a statement today asking the government to reduce its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency following the censure vote on Friday .
But Ali Akbar Salehi , head of Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organization , said the country would not pull out of its treaty obligations , which bar it from pursuing nuclear weapons .
“ We pursue our rights and international obligations in equal measures , ” he said on the sidelines of the Cabinet meeting , according to Mehr .
Iran ’s continued enrichment of uranium has worried the United States and the West .
Highly enriched uranium can provide fuel for a nuclear weapon , and the 500,000 centrifuges Iran envisions could theoretically produce enough fuel for a bomb every two days .
Iran has not responded definitively to a U.S. - backed proposal to swap much of its current supply of 5 % - enriched uranium for 20 % - enriched fuel rods to operate a Tehran medical research plant .
Ahmadinejad also said the government would begin studying the possibility of producing its own medical - grade fuel .
Iran contends that the world powers are obliged to sell it the medical fuel rods as signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
“ We treat the entire world with kindness and friendship , ” Ahmadinejad said .
“ However , we are not joking around with anyone , and we do not allow the rights of the Iranian nation to be violated even by one iota . ”

TILERA IS CLAIMING to have the first commercial CPU to reach 100 cores , and while this is true , the real interesting technology is in the interconnects .
The overall chip is quite a marvel , and it is unlike any mainstream CPU you have ever heard of .
Making a lot of cores on a chip is n’t very hard .
Larrabee for example has 32 Pentium ( P54 ) cores , heavily modified , as the basis of the GPU .
If Intel wanted to , it could put hundreds of cores on a die , that part is actually quite easy .
Keeping those cores fed is the most important problem of modern chipmaking , and that part is not easy .
Large caches , wide memory busses , ring busses on chip , stacking , and optical interfaces all are attempts to feed the beast .
Everyone thought Intel ’s Polaris , also known as the 80 core , 1 TeraFLOPS part from a few years ago , was about packing cores onto a die .
It was n’t , it was a test of routing algorithms and structures .
Routing is where the action is now , packing cores in is not a big deal .
Routing is where Tilera shines .
It has put a great deal of thought into getting data from core to core with minimal latency and problems .
Its rather unique approach involves five different interconnect networks , programmable partitioning , accelerators , and simply tons of I/O .
Together , these allow Tilera ’s third generation Tile - Gx CPUs to scale from 16 to 100 cores without choking on congestion .
They may not have the same single - threaded performance of a Nehalem or Shanghai core , but they make up for it with volume .
Tilera 100 core chip
The basic structure is a square array of small cores , 4×4 , 6×6 , 8×8 or 10 ×10 , each connected via five ( 5 ) on - chip networks , and flanked by some very interesting accelerators .
The cores themselves are a proprietary 32 - bit ISA in the first two generations of Tilera chips , and in the Gx , it is extended to 64 - bit .
There are 75 new instructions in the Gx , 20 of which are SIMD , and the memory controller now sees 64 bits as well .
In previous generations , there was no floating - point ( FP ) hardware in Tilera products .
The company strongly recommended against using FP code because it had to be emulated taking hundreds or thousands of cycles .
With the new Gx series chips , FP code is still frowned upon , but there is some FP hardware to catch the odd instruction without a huge speed hit .
The 100 core part can do 50 GigaFLOPS of FP which may sound like a large number , but that is only about 1/50th of what an ATI Cypress HD5870 chip can do .
The majority of the new instructions are aimed at what the Tilera chips do best , integer calculations .
Things like shuffle and DSP - like multiply - and - accumulate ( MAC ) functions , including a quad MAC unit , are where these new chips shine .
Basically , the Gx moves information around very quickly while twiddling bits here and there with integer functions .
While the cores might not be overly complex , the on-chip busses are .
Each
Gx core has 64 K of L1 cache , 32 K data and 32 K instruction , along with a unified 8 - way 256KB L2 cache .
The cache is totally non-blocking , completely coherent , and the cache subsystem can reorder requests to other caches or DRAM .
On top of this , the core supports cache pinning to keep often used data or instructions in cache .
On the 100 core model , the Gx has 32 MB of cache .
Tiles are the name Tilera uses for for a basic unit of repetition .
The 16 core Gx has 16 tiles , the 64 core Gx has 64 , etc .
A tile consists of a core , the L1 and L2 caches , and something Tilera calls the Terabit Switch .
More than anything , this switch is the heart of the chip .
A Tilera tile
Remember when we said that cramming 100 cores on a die is not a big problem , but feeding them is ?
The Terabit Switch is how Tilera solves the problem , and it is a rather unique solution .
Instead of one off - core bus , there are five .
Each of them has a dedicated purpose , and that not only gives huge bandwidth , it also goes a fair way towards minimizing contention .
Cache traffic will never be stepped on by user data , and so on .
The five networks are called QDN , RDN , FDN , IDN and UDN .
In the last two generations of Tilera chips , all of these networks were 32 bits wide , but on the Gx , the widths vary to give each one more or less bandwidth depending on their functions .
QDN is called the reQuest Dynamic Network , and it is used for memory and cache .
QDN is 64 bits wide .
RDN is Response Dynamic Network , and it is used to feed memory reads back to the chips .
RDN is 112 bits wide , an odd number , 64 + 48 from the look of it .
FDN is the widest at 128 bits , and it is used for cache to cache transfers and cache coherency .
Given the critical nature of cache transactions like this , the width is no surprise .
The last two IDN and UDN are both 32 bits wide .
IDN is I /O Dunamic Network , and passes data on and off the chip .
With a dedicated channel for off - chip transfers , you can see that reaching theoretical numbers was a priority at Tilera .
The last network UDN is for User Dynamic Network , basically the one users get to send stuff around on .
QDN , RDN , FDN and IDN are basically housekeeping , they work in the background .
If you want to send things from point A to point B , you send it across the UDN .
Although Tilera did n’t explicitly state it , each hop from router to router takes one cycle .
This means that in a pathological case , corner core to memory on the far corner , it could take 19 cycles to go from request to memory , plus the memory round trip time , and then another 19 cycles to get back .
That is what you call a long time in computer speak .
Even in an ‘ average ’ case , you have a 10 cycle latency , which is very long as well .
To be fair , the Tilera architecture is not made to run general purpose code .
As it was described when the first generation came out , workloads are meant to be chunked up , so a single tile does a function , then the data gets passed to the next tile for more work , and so on and so forth .
If your program has 20 steps , you use 20 tiles and pipeline the work .
This solves many of the problems with variable latency and multi- hop traffic .
The other more elegant solution is the ability to section off chunks of the chip into sub-units .
There is a hypervisor that can partition each Gx chip into programmable blocks .
Sub -sections of tiles
As you can see in the diagram above , each Gx is broken up into sub-chips in software .
You can give each process as much CPU power as it needs , and arrange it so the output of one block feeds into the input of the next in a single clock .
This example has two Apache web server instances , an intrusion prevention system ( IPS ) , a secure sockets layer ( SSL ) stack , a network stack and a few other processes running next to each other .
The Apache instances have their own memory controller , as do the IPS and the SSL stack .
The network stack is sitting on top of the memory controller for decreased latency .
Basically , the programmer can choose where to put each process to minimize latency .
It does n’t take much to figure out how to apply these concepts to a database plus web server scenario , or a three - tiered SAP - like workload .
Basically , Tilera allows you to explicitly place the data and compute resources where , when and how you need them .
The chunks are done at roughly the same level as hardware VMs are in x86 CPUs , running below the level that a process can affect .
This creates hardware walls to segregate data transfers , cache coherency traffic , and other tile to tile transfers .
If done correctly , it can minimize latency a lot in addition to keeping processes from stepping on each other .
Now that you know how the cores work , talk , and are partitioned , what about the ‘ uncore ’ ?
Talk about that starts with the memory controllers – four DDR3 - 2133MHz banks on the 64 and 100 core Gx , two on the 16 and 36 core models .
For the keen eyed out there , this means Tilera has two different socket configurations , one for the 64 and 100 core chips , and another one for the 16 and 36 core chips .
DDR3-2133MHz memory is very fast , hugely fast in fact .
The math says 17 GBps per controller , so 68 GBps for the chip with an 80 cycle ‘ typical ’ load to use latency .
Each controller can support 16 ranks , vastly more than a PC controller .
In all , the 64 and 100 core Gxs can support 1TB of memory if you can find 4 Gb DDR3 chips .
The memory controllers also support request reordering and some QoS provisioning .
Moving along to I/O , there are 20 PCIe 2.0 lanes , arranged in three controllers of 8 , 8 and 4 lanes .
There are also 8 Ethernet controllers capable of supporting 4 GigE lanes per controller .
These can be aggregated into 8 10 Gb or 2 40 Gb lanes .
Basically , this chip has a lot of available bandwidth .
As you might imagine , on the 16 and 36 core variants , there are only half the controllers , so half the bandwidth .
In addition , you have a generic controller for USB , UARTs , JTAG and I2C controllers .
Given that Tilera chips are basically embedded , these are not likely to be used for much more than booting and diagnostics .
On the core diagram above , there are two other blocks , the orange MiCA and mPIPE accelerators .
These are where the other parts of the Tilera Gx ‘ magic ’ happen .
MiCA stands for Multistream iMesh Crypto Accelerator , while mPIPE is short for multicore Programmable Intelligent Packet Engine .
If it is n’t blindingly obvious , the MiCA does the crypto and the mPIPE speeds up I/O .
The mPIPE does a lot of interesting things , all supposedly at wire speed .
It has a programmable packet classification engine , said to be usable at 80 Gbps or 120 M packets per second .
It can twiddle headers and do other evil things that would make Comcast drool with the potential for ‘ network management ’ extortion payements .
In addition , it can also load balance across the various I/O lanes , and redirect tile to tile ‘ I / O ’ in a somewhat intelligent fashion .
On top of that , the mPIPE manages buffer sizes , queues , and other housekeeping to keep latencies low .
Think of it as a programmable housekeeping offload engine .
The most interesting bit is that the mPIPE can tag a packet with a 32 bit header before it sends it onto the internal network .
This is where the programmable part shines .
You can set up fields in the I/O packet itself to pass along pre-decode information and other time - saving tidbits .
Since I/ O is fully virtualizable , you could theoretically tag the packets with VM data , or just about anything else a bored programmer can think of .
The MiCA engines , two on the 64/100 core , one on 16/36 cores , are crypto offload engines .
They can work either ‘ inline ’ or as ull blown offload engines , that is up to the programmer .
The MiCA can pull data directly from caches or main memory without CPU overhead , basically fire and forget .
If you like acronyms , the MiCA on the Gx can support AES , 3DES , ARC4 , Kasumi and Snow for crypto , SHA -1 , SHA - 2 , MD5 , HMAC and AES - GMAC for hashes , RSA , DSA , Diffie - Hellman , and Elliptic Curve for public key work , and it has a true random number generator ( RNG ) .
WTF , LOL , ROFL and other netspeak can be encrypted along with any other text that uses correct grammar .
RLY .
Tilera claims that the MiCA engine can do wire speed 40 Gbps crypto with full duplex on the 100 core Gx , and 1024 b key RSA at 50 K keys per second on the 100 core , 20 K keys per second for the 36 core .
Not bad at all .
In addition , the MiCA supports a hardware compression engine that uses the tried and true Deflate algorithm .
The last piece of the puzzle is something that Tilera calls external acceleration interfaces .
This could be as simple as plugging in a PCIe card , but that lacks elegance .
The interesting part is a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) interface .
You can take up to 8 lanes of PCIe and connect the FPGA to the serial deserial unit ( SerDes ) to enable basically direct and low latency 32 G bps transfers .
Direct transfers to cache and multiple contexts are supported , meaning you can do quite a bit with an FPGA and a Tilera - Gx chip .
In the end , you have a monster chip for I/O and packet processing .
It does n’t do single - threaded applications all that fast , but it really is n’t meant to .
The chip itself is not out yet , nor is there even silicon yet .
The first version out will be the 36 core Gx in Q4 of 2010 , followed by the 16 core later in Q4 or possibly Q1 of 2011 .
These both share the same socket configuration and a 35 * 35 mm package .
In Q1 of 2011 , the 100 core chip will come out on a new socket and in a 45 * 45 mm package .
A bit after that , the 64 core will hit the market .
Power ranges from 10W for the 16 core to 55W for the 100 core , but you can get power optimized variants that will only suck 35 W .
Given the programmability of the parts , power use is likely more dependent on the programs running on it .
The last bit of information is clock speeds .
The 64 and 100 core models will come in versions that run at 1.25GHz and 1.5GHz , not bad considering how much there is to synchronize and keep going .
The 36 core models will come in 1.0GHz , 1.25GHz and 1.5GHz versions , and the 16 core models will only come in 1.0GHz or 1.25 GHz versions .
Given the core count , internal interconnections , memory and I/O capabilities , Tilera will pack a lot of power into these small packages .

JERUSALEM , Israel — I just returned to Jerusalem after a month away .
Or at least I thought I did .
I suspect I entered a cosmic wormhole that popped me out in the right place — the Israeli capital — only nine years earlier .
Muslim leaders claim radical Jews plan to pray at the mosques on the Temple Mount .
Protect the Mount , goes the cry .
Rioters throw rocks at tourists and at Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall .
Both sides scream that they ’re being provoked .
That ’s the news this week .
But it was also the news in the week that started the second intifada in October 2000 .
So you ’ll have to forgive me for wondering whether I passed through a fold in the space - time continuum on the flight back from Zurich , where I was vacationing on Lake Geneva after finishing up a book tour .
In October 2000 , Sheikh Raed Salah , leader of the Northern Islamic Movement inside Israel , called on Muslims to defend the Haram ash - Sharif ( the “ Noble Sanctuary , ” which is also known as the Temple Mount because it was the site of the ancient Jewish temple ) .
To defend it against a visit by Israel ’s then - opposition leader Ariel Sharon , and against Jews who supposedly wanted to pray there , and against archaeological excavations undermining the mount ( the supposed digging was aimed at proving what Salah and his followers argue is a Zionist lie that the Jewish temple ever stood there ) .
His call was in essence to defend the mount against any perceived affront to Muslim “ sovereignty ” over it by Israel .
The result : the second intifada , more than 1,000 dead Israelis and Palestinians , and another 7,000 injured .
Secondary results : deep - freeze for a peace process that ’s still frosty on the outside and ice - cold within , Palestinian civil war and a big boost for right - wing Israeli politicians who said the peace process was a mistake in the first place .
Despite such dreadful consequences , if Salah could go back in time , he ’d do it over just the same .
In fact , that ’s what he ’s doing .
He spent the last week in Jerusalem pushing for a violent response to the plans of a Jewish group to pray on the Mount .
The Israeli police barred the group , which hopes their temple will be rebuilt on the site and the Jewish Messiah will come , from entering the holy precinct .
That was n’t enough for the sheikh .
Nor for the Palestinian Authority , which has used the crisis and the violence surrounding it to deflect attention from its own confused response to the U.N. ’s investigative report on the war in Gaza at the turn of the year .
The Palestinian government in Ramallah initially wanted to turn the screw on Israel and to have the report form the basis of hearings at the International Court of Justice in The Hague .
Israel headed that off with threats of economic sanctions .
Many Palestinians were unhappy with the decision to ease off on the war crimes angle .
Thus , the Palestinian leadership got on board with Salah .
One of the leading Jerusalem members of Fatah , the faction that rules the West Bank , threatened a “ third intifada ” over the Temple Mount .
The chief Palestinian peace negotiator blamed Israel for the tension at the holy site .
That plays well with a Palestinian public that is angry at Israel ’s right - wing government , but it wo n’t outweigh the disgust of Gazans that there ’ll be no push to put Israel on trial at The Hague .
In Gaza this week , Hamas displayed large posters of Western - backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas with the caption “ Traitor . ”
Gazans were invited to throw shoes at the picture .
In the Middle East , showing the dirty sole of your shoe to someone is an insult .
To throw it at them is much worse .
Israel ’s leadership has responded to the Temple Mount shenanigans so far with bewilderment .
The police have arrested 75 Palestinians , including 24 minors .
A Jerusalem judge freed Salah after he was arrested Tuesday , but he banned the sheikh from Jerusalem for 30 days .
Given the nasty atmosphere in Jerusalem , that seemed to me like Salah was being rewarded for what the judge called his “ incitement . ”
But then I spent the previous week in Montreux where the most inciteful thing is a lakefront statue of Freddie Mercury in tight pants .
It seems unlikely that the sheikh ’s Islamic Movement will be banned , though Israeli politicians have raised the idea .
The focus on the Temple Mount conspiracy theories of Sheikh Salah would be laughable if it was n’t for the fact that it raises the prospect of violence potentially as damaging as that which followed the onset of the second intifada nine years ago .
It also deflects attention from the very real issues Palestinians have to face with Israeli policy in general and with Jerusalem in particular .
Efforts by the Obama administration to force a freeze on building in Israel ’s West Bank settlements were essentially evaded by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s government — Israel agreed to a freeze , but before it takes effect permits will be granted for a lot of new building .
Meanwhile in the Jabal Mukhaber neighborhood of Jerusalem , just over the Green Line into East Jerusalem , a right - wing politician and the former chief rabbi laid the cornerstone Wednesday for a new Israeli residential complex called Nof Zion .
The 105 housing units planned for the site could be a source of tension to add to the more ideological Israeli settlements deeper in East Jerusalem , close to the Temple Mount .
The view which gives the complex its name ( Nof Zion means “ View of Zion ” in Hebrew ) is the forked valley known as the “ holy basin , ” with the golden Dome of the Rock at its center .
The residents of Nof Zion might soon have a front - row seat for some unholy fireworks .
At 11:00 am on August 9th , 1945 , just a minute before the second atomic bomb in the space of three days was dropped on Japan , a B - 29 bomber named The Great Artiste quietly dropped three canisters from the sky .
Inside each of the canisters , alongside a shockwave gauge designed by American physicist Luis Alvarez , was an unsigned copy of the following letter .
The letter , written by Alvarez and two fellow scientists , was addressed to Japanese nuclear physicist Ryokichi Sagane – a man with whom Alvarez had previously worked at Berkeley – and pleaded with him to inform his ‘ leaders ’ of the impending ‘ total annihilation ’ of their cities .
The letter reached Sagane a month later after being found 50 km from the centre of devastation : Nagasaki .
Alvarez and Sagane met again 4 years later , at which point the letter was finally signed .

Headquarters
Atomic Bomb Command
August , 1945 To : Prof. R. Sagane
From :
Three of your former scientific colleagues during your stay in the United States .
We are sending this as a personal message to urge that you use your influence as a reputable nuclear physicist , to convince the Japanese General Staff of the terrible consequences which will be suffered by your people if you continue in this war .
You have known for several years that an atomic bomb could be built if a nation were willing to pay the enormous cost of preparing the necessary material .
Now that you have seen that we have constructed the production plants , there can be no doubt in your mind that all the output of these factories , working 24 hours a day , will be exploded on your homeland .
Within the space of three weeks , we have proof - fired one bomb in the American desert , exploded one in Hiroshima , and fired the third this morning .
We implore you to confirm these facts to your leaders , and to do your utmost to stop the destruction and waste of life which can only result in the total annihilation of all your cities , if continued .
As scientists , we deplore the use to which a beautiful discovery has been put , but we can assure you that unless Japan surrenders at once , this rain of atomic bombs will increase manyfold in fury .
To my friend Sagane
With best regards from

An Indonesian woman gave birth to this 19.2 pound bundle of joy , the country 's biggest baby ever .
Doctors think gestational diabetes is to blame .
We think he 's just an awesome giant .
That other baby does n't even know what to think .
Fidel Castro learned a lot from Chilean President Salvador Allende 's failed power grab in 1973 .
And he used the lessons of that bitter defeat to coach Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez to dictatorship under the guise of democracy more than 25 years later .
Now Latin America 's revolutionaries may be experiencing another setback and this time they can't claim that a military coup removed their would - be dictator .
Instead , former Honduran president Manuel Zelaya was arrested by order of the ...
It 's tempting to see the confrontation between the entertainment industry and the Internet as some kind of moral issue ; a clash of the heavyweights with only one possible outcome : a triumph of good over evil .
In the red corner we have the people who bring us recorded music and Hollywood films , who have spent the last decade trying everything short of physical violence to stop people from getting access to their products for free .
And , ladies and gentlemen , in the blue corner we have the plucky little Internet , which has grown up overnight into a 200 kg gorilla , empowering right - thinking people around the world and making despotic regimes tremble .
Would that it were that straightforward because then we could settle the whole struggle with a political process assisted in the usual way by name - calling in the media .
Dear Mr Prime Minister :
Do you want an educated population or an entertained one ?
An efficient business sector or one that still sends paper letters ?
The opportunity to buy air tickets online in seconds or jobs for travel agents on every city block ?
A vibrant New Zealand cultural sector or an endless diet of overseas re-runs ?
In fact , the situation is even simpler than that .
There is now no cost to distributing information .
That 's not rhetoric - it's an indisputable fact .
It means that people who rely for their income on being a toll - gate on the flow of information do n't have a business model any more .
Artists can still create and charge people for appreciating their work directly , but those who make their living from recycling imperfect copies of what others do are going to find it more and more difficult from now on .
This is the context for the innocuously - named Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA to its friends ) , an international treaty being negotiated by the governments of New Zealand , the EU , Canada , the US and a few other countries .
Rumours have persisted for some time that this treaty is really about controlling copying on the Internet , as well as , or perhaps instead of , controlling the flood of fake Prada handbags and Rolex watches filling our shops .
And rumours are what we have to rely on because no - one has seen the text of ACTA .
The government officials negotiating it have told us that it's far too commercially sensitive for the people it would affect to be able to actually see it before it's all signed off by Obama , Gordon Brown or his successor and John Key .
It 's not strictly true to say that no - one has seen the ACTA drafts , of course .
The officials negotiating it obviously have , although they are n't talking about it .
But , despite the potential effects on everyone who uses the Internet , the text of the treaty has been kept very quiet .
During the US election campaign last year , Obama said that he would make the draft treaty open and stop treating it as a matter of national security .
That has n’t happened , but in a breakthrough of transparency the text of ACTA has now been shown to selected lobbyists .
We do n't have to think too hard to figure out which side of this debate will be employing lobbyists .
The people who stand to lose from an attack on the Internet to prevent people copying things are ordinary folks , run of the mill Internet users , not just those who like to download copyrighted music and movies .
The people want that attack on the Internet , because it is destroying their business models , are a handful of very well - resourced industry associations and big companies .
The same people who claimed that the very existence of recorded music would cause human vocal chords to atrophy , or that the popularity of the VCR ( remember those ? ) would be " as dangerous as the Boston Strangler was to a woman at home " .
The only person not an advocate for the recorded entertainment industry who claims to have seen a copy of ACTA is Canadian law professor Michael Geist .
He says that ACTA is quite as bad as the rumours claim ; that it contains a requirement for countries to implement law to force ISPs to cut off people 's Internet connection if they are * accused * of copyright violation , to make it a criminal offence to break the digital rights management software that prevents blind people from accessing electronic books , and to enact the anti-competitive provisions of the US Digital Millennium Copyright
Act which are used for such things as preventing third parties from refilling printer cartridges .
It ’s no accident that pharmaceuticals are more expensive in the US than almost anywhere else .
This would be very bad indeed for everyone who uses the Internet , except for a few large companies and industry organizations .
Arbitrarily cutting off people ’s Internet without due process would kill the innovation that it has allowed by making Internet providers liable for allowing anything those companies did n’t want on the Internet .
It would make the Internet into more of a TV system , something that the entertainment industry is more used to .
We ’ve already seen provisions like this in New Zealand law .
John Key 's government , on entering office , was persuaded by a public outcry not to implement Section 92A of the Copyright Act which would have subjected New Zealanders to the draconian ( his word ) provisions of cutting off people ’s Internet connection on the basis of an unsubstantiated allegation .
To Labour 's shame , it had passed that law before the election with no public consultation , a fact that can't have been lost on observers as they watched front person Judith Tizard lose the Labour stronghold of Auckland Central .
There 's still a chance for S92A to come back ; either through the Select Committee currently considering its replacement , or through some kind of enabling legislation to implement an international treaty .
Yes , ACTA .
There is just starting to be a fuss world wide among the digerati about the potential for this secretly - negotiated international treaty to disenfranchise the great majority of Internet users from a say in how their medium is policed .
In many countries people are worried that their leaders wo n't be able to resist an opportunity to look statesmanlike by signing an international treaty with that nice Mr Obama .
Perhaps some countries will find it a condition of a free trade agreement with the US .
All this leads to a question about governments : just how do these decisions get made in the first place ?
There 's no doubt that the music and film trade associations are a formidable lobbying force .
How else can we imagine that politicians make decisions favouring the lobbyists at the expense of the rights of ordinary citizens ?
If I come over as a little irritated about this , that 's because I 'm seethingly angry .
Protecting the growing Internet from ignorant interventions used to be a matter of philosophy , of ideology if you like .
I like to think that laws that affect New Zealanders are in made New Zealand and with due consultation with those affected .
That was before I and others were sworn at by the responsible minister for suggesting that breaking the Internet without asking its users might not be a good idea .
It was before I watched New Zealand go to the brink of being the first country to deprive someone of a basic human right because their flatmate or employee was accused of copying a song .
It was before I watched the ACTA treaty being negotiated while being kept a secret from the people whom it affects .
I ca n’t accept how New Zealand politicians can let this just happen .
How dare they take more notice of secret overseas treaty negotiations and industry lobbyists than they do of their constituents ?
The last government passed S92A and paid for it , although I doubt that was the only reason for its demise .
The current government is still permitting its officials to take part in a secret process designed to curtail the rights of New Zealanders .
How DARE they sell ordinary New Zealanders down the river ?
I still believe - pity me if you like - that the vast majority of politicians are good people who go into Parliament and into government to make a difference , to do good things for their fellow human beings .
I can only assume that something about the air - conditioning in the Beehive allows some of its inhabitants to get so far out of touch with the majority of people who put them there .
That must be how we have MPs being , shall we say , less than grounded about how others might view their personal expense claims .
And it can be the only explanation for those who show contempt for ordinary Internet users - most New Zealanders - by tolerating a process aimed at legislating away their rights .
After all , the alternative would be to assume that politicians were completely in the pocket of well - heeled lobbyists .
And I do n't believe that at all .
Frank Schaeffer : " Old Testament , biblical equivalent of calling for Holy War . "
" Most Americans will just see the bumper - sticker and smile and think that it 's facetious ...
What surprises me is that responsible ( if you can put it that way ) Republican leadership , and the editors of some of these Christian magazines , etc. , etc. , do not stand up in holy horror and denounce this .
You know , they 're always asking : where is the Islamic leadership denouncing terrorism ? "

... against our President .
It 's arguably treasonous language and suggestions , coming from supposedly Christian sources , who are , according to Evangelical author Frank Schaeffer , lifting bible verses to trawl for assassins .
Here 's some video from the Rachel Maddow show .
It starts with a discussion of Obama 's trip overseas , and how his diplomacy and the observation of protocol has provoked criticism at home .
She proceeds to a frank discussion with Schaeffer about veiled messages inciting violence against the President .
Trusting , faithful Christians are , it seems , being led astray by those with clearly political , anti-American agendas cloaked in carefully selected bible verses while waving American flags .
Those who seek to create chaos and violence are neither Christian nor patriotic .
They prey upon our most trusting , by manipulating scriptures for their own aggrandizement while accusing their counterparts overseas for engaging in the same selfish , godless goals .
Pupils in a Irish school are being asked to bring their own toilet paper to school to help offset funding cutbacks .
The principal of St John 's Girls National School in Carrigaline , County Cork , confirmed she had sent out a memo to parents last week requesting that their daughters occasionally bring a roll of toilet paper to give to the class teacher , who would dispense the rolls to students when needed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The bizarre request is part of the school 's cost - containment programme so that dwindling state funding can be better spent on education , says principal Catherine O'Neill .
She refused to divulge the school 's annual budget but said that the Government 's abolition of various grants was behind the request .
The letter , dated 1 October , reads : " Dear parent .
From time to time we will request your daughter to bring in a toilet roll to her class teacher .
These rolls will be specifically for your daughter 's class and will be dispensed by the class teacher .
We would also request that your daughter has tissues in her sack at all times .
This is due to cutbacks .
we are endeavouring to trim down expenses and ensure we use our grants towards the educational needs of your child . "
She stressed that the request was just that , and pupils were not obliged to comply .
" We thought with this request that it would n't be a burden on families .
We 're just hoping to spend money on education , " she said .
" We 're all aware of cutbacks .
We did n't mean to insult anyone .
It 's kind of humorous , " she said , adding she did n't believe her school was the first to make such a request .
But a parent of one pupil said he was astonished when he got the letter last week .
" Are things really this bad ?
This is like something Frank McCourt might have written about growing up in the 1930s , " he said .
" I was flabbergasted . "
Irish National Teachers ' Organisation spokesman Peter Mullan said many schools were reeling under funding cutbacks and parents were being asked to shoulder an even greater burden of their child 's educational costs .

Despite the Government increasing the capitation grant to cover basic operating costs in the last budget , other grants have been removed .
They include the free - book scheme for low - income students , the school library grant and a special grant for Traveller children , he says .
" Two years ago , the Government promised to spend € 252 m to upgrade computers but not a cent has been spent on them , " he said .
Consequently , parents are being asked to hold fundraising drives in order to pay for basic upgrades of their school 's computer system , he says .
Students are also being asked to bring items like egg cartons and yoghurt containers to use for art class , he says .
" Parents were being asked to fund superficial things but now they 're being asked to pay the core things , " he said .
" It 's no longer a few books or computer equipment .
It 's now for basic running costs , " he said .
The Department of Education , however , said that schools were now getting more funding for basic operating costs after the capitation grant was increased last year to €200 per student .
He added that St John 's Girls school had received close to € 379,000 in state funding for its 540 pupils since January 2008 .
" The school has not come to the department about any financial difficulty , " he said .

How Egypt thwarts USAID
The United States provides Egypt with an annual injection of around $ 200 million in development aid — a vestige of the U.S. wheel - greasing that accompanied the 1979 peace deal between Israel and Egypt .
It is the job of USAID to distribute a portion of that money to democracy promotion programs .
A recent audit offers a depressing verdict on USAID ’s efforts : the impact of its programs was “ unnoticeable ” in improving Egypt ’s democratic environment .
Of the programs for which USAID distributed funds , donors carried out only 65 % of the activities promised and achieved only 52 % of the planned results , based on predetermined metrics .
The audit lays the blame for USAID ’s failure at the feet of the Egyptian government .
The government , “ has shown reluctance to support many of USAID ’s democracy and governance programs and has impeded implementers ’ activities , ” says the report .
Egyptian delays are caused by a combination of resistance to democratic reforms , bureaucratic red tape , and plain old cronyism .
In one example , the audit describes how study tours abroad were subverted by an Egyptian contractor who kept selecting the same people for the tours .
One particular Cairo University professor , the report states , was selected for three separate trips on USAID ’s dime .
Stop the presses : the Egyptian government is riddled with corruption , and hostile to democratic reform !
After three decades of distributing aid in Egypt , these facts should n’t come as a surprise to anyone — and should n’t be an excuse for why USAID has been flushing taxpayers ’ money down the drain .
Fortunately , in 2005 Congress provided USAID with the authority to issue direct grants to Egyptian NGOs , bypassing the approval of the Egyptian government .
As the audit shows , USAID “ achieved its greatest success ” with these direct grant programs .
Direct grant recipients completed 80 percent of their planned activities during the 2008 financial year , in programs that ranged from anticorruption initiatives to programs emphasizing political processes and civic participation .
The Egyptian government often still found ways to stymie these programs : in one case , the government delayed distribution of the civic education material produced by one recipient , making it difficult for the material to reach schoolchildren .
However , these obstacles pale in comparison to the difficulties of working directly with the Egyptian government .
It is naive to expect a regime that is preparing to elevate Gamal Mubarak to the presidency will be willing to make aggressive reforms .
And it is hypocritical for the United States to preach the virtues of democracy while still devoting most of its funds to efforts which have proven ineffective .
U.S. policymakers know perfectly well how to design more effective programs in Egypt .
They should do it .
It is hard to imagine why Wall Street would cheer a 10.2 percent official unemployment rate since the stock market actually ended the day higher after this dismal news .
Since the start of the recession , 8 million people have lost their jobs .
A total of approximately 27 million people are unemployed , underemployed , or have given up looking for work .
All the talk of improvement got people out looking for work again and that is why the unemployment rate saw a big jump from 9.8 percent to 10.2 percent even though employers “ only ” cut 190,000 in October .
The data is deceptive for many reasons .
For one , long - term unemployment is a sign that many jobs will be lost forever .
The second more ominous point is that many sectors are experiencing mini-depressions .
All job cuts are not equal .
If we had to sum it up , paper pushing jobs in the financial sector seem more immune than good producing jobs .
Let us look at how the real employment situation is panning out :
Since the start of the recession 22 months ago in December of 2007 , the government has added 78,000 jobs employing some 22.44 million people .
It is interesting to look at local and state taxes that are being pummeled yet this sector is still up .
It would be one thing to create new jobs but looking at the chart above , jobs were never cut .
What did the government actually do ?
States like California implemented furloughs and raised taxes in many cases .
Of course , the major issue in many states is the bloated pension system that puts an unsupportable burden on those who are actually still working .
I can understand that someone needs to live and support themselves in retirement .
But in California for example , you have many people receiving $ 100,000 + pensions and many only worked until their early 50s .
What is clear from the above is the government did not cut any jobs on a net basis .
So we can scratch this sector when looking at where the jobs were lost .
The next sector is the FIRE economy :
Given the 8 million jobs officially lost in this recession , a mere 600,000 came from the finance , insurance , and real estate industries .
This is the sector that is largely responsible for the housing bubble and the entire finance mess yet it is not taking a major cut as it should .
Why ?
The bailouts are targeted in protecting many of these Wall Street paper pushers .
In fact , you can see that in the last month it actually added jobs .
The 6.6 percent drop does not reflect the actual overall fall in employment .
Again , this sector is being supported by the trillions in taxpayer money .
So where are the job cuts really coming from ?
Construction employment has taken it on the chin :
Construction employment is down by a stunning 20 percent since the start of the recession .
It is interesting that from the start of the recession , construction and the FIRE sector had roughly the same number of employees benefiting from the housing bubble but where the FIRE sector lost 600,000 jobs , the construction sector has seen 1,557,000 jobs cut , nearly 3 times the rate of the FIRE sector .
Apparently building a home is less valuable than writing a toxic mortgage .
Again , the government bailouts are protecting an over employed FIRE sector while throwing other sectors of the economy to the wolves .
Keep in mind both of these sectors used the same underlying asset ( real estate ) to expand .
The housing bubble is now the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve bailout of the FIRE economy .
Durable goods manufacturing has also been slammed :
Durable good manufacturing has fallen a stunning 18 percent since the recession started .
If we look at construction and durable goods , both sectors are experiencing depressions while the FIRE sector is experiencing a tiny recession .
And take this data point as a reference :
Durable goods and manufacturing :
December 2007 jobs : 8.728 million jobs
October 2009 jobs : 7.121 million jobs
FIRE sector :
December 2007 jobs : 8.242 million jobs
October 2009 jobs : 7.697 million jobs
This should tell you what is happening to many average Americans .
Only two years ago , the durable goods and manufacturing sector had 486,000 more jobs than the FIRE sector .
Now , the FIRE economy has done a role reversal and has 576,000 more jobs than the durable goods manufacturing sector !
Who are we really bailing out here ?
Conclusion
Simply taking the employment report at face value is meaningless .
What is happening is the bailout structure is designed to prop up the primary industries that created the housing bubble .
Many of the FIRE jobs are over compensated Wall Street cronies who are using taxpayer dollars to gamble .
The real fact is many sectors of the American economy are in deep recession .
Unless you work for the government or the FIRE sector , chances are your industry is in a deep recession .
Then again , why else would the stock market be up by 60 percent since March ?
It is easy to make money when you eliminate the biggest line item ( employees ) for short - term bottom line gains for those in the FIRE economy since your job is subsidized by the taxpayer .

It 's the sound of iPhones ringing around the country to the tone of " Hallelujah ! "
AT&T announced today that the iPhone 3G and 3GS will finally be able to send multimedia messages ( MMS ) starting Sept. 25 .
The original , metal - back iPhone will not be supported , an Apple representative said in an e-mail .
Like text messaging , MMS allows users to send media - rich messages , with pictures , video and audio , directly to other wireless phones .
Previously , Apple encouraged iPhone users to e-mail those files as attachments .
Staying true to its promise of delivering the functionality in " late summer , " the feature will be included in a software update for iPhone 3G and 3GS , AT&T said in a press release .
The update is presumably iPhone OS version 3.1 , which developers think will open the floodgates for augmented - reality applications .
" We ’ve been working for the past several months to prepare our systems and network to ensure the best possible experience with MMS when it launches , " the AT&T press release reads .
" We know that iPhone users will embrace MMS .
The unique capabilities and high usage of the iPhone ’s multimedia capabilities required us to work on our network . "
The update will bring the iPhone in line with just about every other phone on the market that has long been capable of sending and receiving MMS messages .
But hey , who 's complaining ?
We 're all finally welcome to the party !
Oh , you still have an original iPhone ?
That 's rough .
Updated , 12:20 p.m. : Added confirmation from Apple that the original iPhone will not be capable of transmitting MMS .

Oceanside resident Woodrow Hidgon 's three minutes of public testimony at the September 2 city council meeting ended with jeers from the audience : " Sit down ! " were the shouts from inside city council chambers .
" Okay , people , you really do n't want to hear this do you ? " replied Higdon in the microphone amid shouts from audience members .
" Have a seat , sir .
We 've had enough .
Thank you , " said Oceanside mayor Jim Wood , a retired , 31 - year veteran of the city 's police force .
Higdon , a middle - aged ex-cop , donning wire - rim glasses and neatly cropped hair , exited the dais as the audience applauded .
As he made his way toward his seat , mayor Wood 's voice boomed over the public audio system , " We've had several issues with this gentleman [ that are ] being addressed by our chief of police . "
Higdon has grown accustomed to this treatment .
For months , he has gone before the city council to report his findings of supposed corruption and criminal misconduct in the city 's police department .
" I 've been cut - off for many months [ for ] complaining about various aspects of police corruption , " said Higdon during a September 3 phone interview .
" They do n't want to hear from me . ”
For the past eight months , Higdon has been running his own investigation into Oceanside 's police department .
He says he has hundreds of pages of " documentation " and that he is on the edge of breaking the case .
Higdon says he 's uncovered collusion between the police department and insurance companies in the wrongful denial of damage claims .
He says there are illegal recordings by an Oceanside police officer , who for eight years has failed to submit audio recordings of criminal suspects into evidence , which may result in re-trials and costly civil suits -- all without any punishment from the chief of police .
And then there ’s the police union 's role in donating funds to the recall election of councilmember Jerome Kern .
" There are a number of people who are trying to cover this up .
Why have n't these guys come after me and arrested me ?
It 's because I 've given all the evidence in the world that this is true and all the documentation is solid .
They can't touch me . "
Higdon says he will continue to appear at city council meetings .
He expects nothing more than to be cut off at precisely three minutes into his testimony .
" Like I said , nobody wants to hear this , but they can't keep me quiet . "

ASIANS complain that when George Bush chose Iraq and terrorism as his main arenas in foreign affairs , it was at their expense .
Barack Obama intends his first Asian trip as president , which begins in Tokyo on November 13th , as proof of change .
As well as Japan , the tour takes in Singapore , China and South Korea .
Engagement in the region , he says , is critical to America 's future .
Advisers even suggest that what he achieves there will help define Mr Obama 's presidency .
Of course , they say that about a lot of things on his plate .
But to judge by ordinary folk , the region wishes him well .
Many Indonesians think of Mr Obama as one of their own .
In Japan students of English have emptied the bookshops of his collected speeches .
Some activity suggests there is indeed a new engagement .
In July , the American secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , signed ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Co-operation .
The ten-member Association of South - East Asian Nations had been largely ignored by Mr Bush .
This weekend Mr Obama will meet ASEAN 's leaders as a group , which is a first .
His administration reached out to the thuggish junta in Myanmar , reversing a policy of isolation , and on November 10th said Mr Obama 's special envoy to North Korea would go to Pyongyang for talks with the obstreperous nuclear state ( after close consultation with South Korea and Japan first ) .
The president has taken pains to define China as a “ strategic partner ” , one without whom America has little hope of tackling everything from the global economic crisis to climate change and nuclear proliferation .
And Mr Obama 's energetic support this year for the G20 , with its Asia - heavy membership , can be read as a tacit acknowledgment that in economic and political terms the world 's centre of gravity has shifted away from the G8 group of wealthy nations .
And yet .
American policy in Asia — or , just as often , the lack of it — retains the power to unsettle its friends in the region .
Take Japan , the cornerstone of America 's Asian alliances .
There , some people ask whether the hand extended to America 's adversaries might reasonably be extended to its allies too .
The Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , which recently swept away the old political guard , wants to put Japan 's security alliance with America on a more “ equal ” footing , one in which America does not call all the shots .
Many Americans , too , see disadvantages in a skewed relationship .
Among other things , it discourages Japan from taking up more international responsibilities .
Soon after coming to office , Japan 's prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , suggested revisiting an unpopular plan , agreed under the previous government , to move an American air base on Okinawa , a tiny southern island with an overwhelming American military presence .
The Obama administration could have shown patience towards a government still finding its feet .
But it was confrontational from the start .
Changing the agreement , said the defence secretary , Robert Gates , was out of the question .
Japan , a State Department official told the Washington Post , was a bigger problem than China — an extraordinary judgment .
It is true that Japan could have handled the problem better ( see article ) .
But America has done itself few favours and the best Mr Obama can do now is remind both sides of the strategic ends of their alliance and call for a rethink about the means .
Next year 's 50th anniversary of the pact would provide an occasion for that .
Elsewhere in Asia , a new engagement , however welcome , is not thought to be enough .
Many of China 's neighbours , eyeing its rise , want the reassurance of a more robust American presence .
In a recent speech in Washington , DC , Singapore 's patriarch , Lee Kuan Yew , surprised his audience by raising concerns about China 's naval build - up , something South - East Asia 's leaders rarely talk about in public .
“ If you do not hold your ground in the Pacific ” , he told the Americans , “ you can not be a world leader . ”
In private , Mr Lee was blunter : “ You guys are giving China a free run in Asia , ” the Financial Times reports him saying .
As well as engaging China , America must also balance it .
Celebrate and monitor
Mr Lee had America 's economic influence in mind as well as its military presence .
Take free - trade agreements ( FTAs ) .
China has signed FTAs with most of its neighbours , including with ASEAN as a whole , often on terms more favourable to China than to its partners .
Talk is growing about the possibility of a super - FTA between China , Japan and South Korea .
Asians are also negotiating FTAs with the European Union .
In contrast , the ratification of a landmark agreement between South Korea and America is mired in Congress .
The administration has taken retaliatory measures against imports of Chinese tyres .
It has even drawn back from perhaps the only regional project seeking genuinely open trade , the Transpacific Partnership , led by a handful of liberal states .
Meanwhile , South - East Asia 's battered exporters long for America to take a tougher stance with China over its undervalued currency that is , in practice , pegged to the declining dollar while other regional currencies rise .
Mr Obama has been squishy on the issue , not wishing to poison Chinese - American relations .
So Mr Obama will be monitored , as well as celebrated .
On trade , an American commitment to seek an FTA with ASEAN would send the right signal .
So would re-engaging with the Trans pacific Partnership .
On Myanmar , whose abuses are poisoning ASEAN 's own future , the president needs to be clear to the region 's leaders , including Myanmar 's prime minister ( whom he will meet ) , that he will bring the pariah state in from the cold only with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the launch of a democratic process involving the opposition and minorities .
And Mr Obama needs to signal that America will balance a rising China in such a way that China 's neighbours never have to take sides .

Since the Obama administration began accusing Fox News of being “ a wing of the Republican Party , ” the war of words has intensified .
The latest counterattack from Fox ’s defenders is the claim that the White House is putting Fox on a Nixon - like enemies list , a list which Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) describes as also including the insurance companies and the US Chamber of Commerce .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) , however , believes that an enemies list is exactly where Fox belongs .
“ Fox News and their Republican collaborators are the enemy of America , ” Grayson told MSNBC ’s Ed Schultz on Wednesday .
“ They ’re the enemy of anybody who cares about health care in this country , the enemy of anybody who cares about educating their children , the enemy of anybody who wants energy independence or anything good for this country .
And certainly the enemy of peace , there ’s no doubt about that .
They are the enemy . ”
Grayson thinks that the White House is doing exactly the right thing in going after Fox , because “ what you do with a bully is you confront the bully and the bully backs down . ”
“ That ’s a good description of Fox News , ” Grayson explained .
“ People come on the air , they insult them as they did me .
…
Why would anybody think that Fox News is some sort of valid news organization ? ”
Grayson did not go any easier on the Republican Party than on Fox .
“ The Republicans operate simply by vilifying their enemies and nothing else , ” he told Schultz .
“ All they do is try to distract people from issues of health care , issues of jobs , issues of energy independence .
They ’ve got nothing .
…
The Party of No is well on its way to becoming the party of nobody . ”

Liberal sites like Daily Kos have been predictably enthusiastic about Grayson ’s remarks , while conservative bloggers have just as predictably attacked him as “ off his meds . ”
In a post mockingly titled , “ Alan Grayson : Fox News , GOP are the enemies of America , peace , puppies , ” Allahpundit described Grayson as a “ grandstanding idiot ” who ’s “ relishing his role as the left ’s new golden boy / attack dog . ”

David Rosenberg thinks the unemployment rate is headed much higher than anyone anticipates .
If you recall , back in January when the stimulus package was crafted , the Obama Administration felt that passing the bill would mean an unemployment rate which would top out at 8.0 % .
As the situation deteriorated , the President recognized that 10.0 % was more likely – a number we just got last week .
But Rosenberg is the only one ( except Meredith Whitney ) who is talking about 12 - 13 % .
As an aside , it was interesting to hear Whitney at about 3:15 into the third video in the link above from July .
Right before she gives us the dreaded 13 % number , she admits to lowballing her house price decline estimates in order not to be dismissed as wildly out of step with consensus .
That pressure is something I discussed here .
Here ’s what Rosenberg says :
There are serious structural issues undermining the U.S. labour market as companies continue to adjust their order books , production schedules and staffing requirements to a semi- permanently impaired credit backdrop .
The bottom line is that the level of credit per unit of GDP is going to be much , much lower in the future than has been the case in the last two decades .
While we may be getting close to a bottom in terms of employment , the jobless rate is very likely going to be climbing much further in the future due to the secular dynamics within the labour market .
But in a nutshell , to be calling for a 12.0 - 13.0 % unemployment rate is meaningless except that it is very likely going to be a headline grabber .
The most inclusive definition of them all , the U6 measure of the unemployment rate , which includes all forms of unemployed and underemployed , is already at 17.5 % .
The posted U3 jobless rate that everyone focuses on is at 10.2 % ( though if it were n’t for the drop in the labour force participation rate , to 65.1 % from 66.0 % a year ago , the unemployment rate would be testing the post - WWII high of 10.8 % right now ) .
The gap between the U6 and the official U3 rate is at a record 7.3 percentage points .
Normally this spread is between 3 - 4 percentage points and ultimately we will see a reversion to the mean , to some unhappy middle where the U6 may be closer to 15.0 - 16.0 % and the posted jobless rate closer to 12 % .
This will undoubtedly be a major political issue , especially in the context of a mid-term elections and the GOP starting to gain some electoral ground .
As I indicated when the employment numbers came out last week , we should expect the labor force participation rate to increase during recovery as discouraged workers come back into the labor force .
The fact that the opposite is still happening means the unemployment rate will move higher ( although 13 % is sure to induce a double dip and I am not seeing this as a base case at this time ) .
Rosenberg ’s political calculus also seems accurate .
In my post , “ the politics of economics ” I said that President Obama needs to take more blunt measures to deal with the unemployment situation head on .
Indirect measures are not going to be effective enough to prevent Democratic losses in 2010 .
Moreover , a recent poll released by Gallup today says that Republicans have now edged ahead of Democrats for 2010 .
If we see 12 or 13 % unemployment , it will be much , much worse than that for the Democrats – and if Obama thinks getting his agenda through now is difficult , wait until 2011 when he may have to contend with more Republicans in Congress .

North Korea is a regimented and repressive society , say refugees
North Korea still runs six prison camps holding 154,000 political prisoners , a South Korean lawmaker has said .
Yoon Sang - hyun , of the ruling Grand National Party , said inmates worked long hours in return for meagre food rations , reported Yonhap news agency .
Mr Yoon said he was basing his claims on a South Korean government report .
North Korea denies claims it abuses human rights .
Earlier this year it amended its constitution to refer to its " respect " for human rights .
But human rights groups and North Korean refugees describe blatant , widespread and ongoing violations of basic rights in the Stalinist country .
In his statement to the National Assembly , Mr Yoon said North Korea used to operate 10 labour camps holding some 200,000 people in the 1990s , but had closed four under international pressure .
But he said six large camps were still going , holding dissidents , those who had attempted to flee the country , the losers in political power struggles , and ordinary North Koreans accused of being disrespectful towards the leadership .
' Crimes against humanity '
These 154,000 inmates - who are held in separate prisons from common criminals - are forced to work more than 10 hours a day on only 200g ( 7 oz ) of food , and are denied medical care , Mr Yoon said .
" North Korea perpetrates various crimes against humanity , including public executions , tortures or rapes , against those who try to escape , " Mr Yoon was quoted as saying .
Observers say that over recent years South Korea has often been reluctant to highlight evidence of rights abuses in its northern neighbour for fear of jeopardising attempts at rapprochement .
But South Korea 's conservative President Lee Myung - bak pledged to be more openly critical of the North 's authoritarian regime when he took office last year .

U.S. manufacturing is finally on the mend — though as many factory bosses are quick to point out , when you ’re in a hole this deep , everything looks up .
That ’s certainly true of capacity utilization .
The numbers show U.S. factories remain “ grossly underutilized , ” writes Daniel Meckstroth , chief economist of MAPI / Manufacturers Alliance , in a new report .
Capacity utilization , which includes manufacturing , mining and utilities , has been hit hard in this recession , reaching 70.5 % in September after being in the 80s for years .
In the manufacturing sector , factory utilization for September ticked up to 68 % — rising from a post World War II record low of 65 % in June .
Capacity utilization for manufacturing dropped like a rock in this recession , falling from 79 % in December 2007 .
The problem , as Meckstroth notes , is that while any movement upward is welcome , there has to be a lot more growth to simply soak up all those idle machines and assembly lines .
Looking beyond the headline number points to another sobering reality :
Some industries were hit much harder than others — and therefore have further to go to get back to more normal utilization .
Capacity utilization in primary metals plunged from 86 % in December 2007 to 55 % currently , mainly because of collapsing demand for some types of steel , while the utilization rate in the computer and peripherals industry fell to 58 % , down from 83 % in December 2007 .
Each industry got hammered by its own mix of headwinds .
Computer sales suffered as businesses postponed information technology upgrades and laid off white - collar workers , while makers of big ticket items such as furniture and cars suffered because consumer financing dried up even for those still eager to buy .
Only a few industries avoided going off the cliff .
Capacity usage in the petroleum refining and coal industries fell only 1 percentage point over the last 21 months , while in the food industry , usage declined only 2 percentage points .
One upshot of all this factory slack , according to Meckstroth , is that there is little incentive for companies to invest in new equipment or other expansion .
“ A high level of capacity utilization is associated with strong growth in business investment and low utilization is consistent with falling investment , ” he writes .
Even so , Meckstroth ’s group , which represents mostly large , multinational manufacturers , is expecting to see growth in business equipment spending in 2010 in high tech , transportation equipment , and business software .
‘ Birther ’ lawyer : Fort Hood proves soldiers should be allowed to disobey orders
Conservative commentators are ratcheting up anti-Muslim rhetoric in the wake of last week ’s Fort Hood massacre , with televangelist Pat Robertson leading the way with a declaration that Islam is “ not a religion , ” but a “ political system ” bent on destroying all the world ’s governments .
ADVERTISEMENT
In a commentary on his show , The 700 Club , Robertson noted that the alleged shooter in the Fort Hood massacre , Nidal Malik Hasan , had come to the attention of authorities prior to the rampage by emailing a radical cleric and trying to contact Al Qaeda .
“ Nobody wanted to go after him because of political correctness , ” Robertson said on Monday .
“ We just do n’t talk about somebody ’s quote ‘ religion , ’ even if the religion involved beheading infidels and pouring boiling oil down their throats . ”
Robertson said Islam should be treated like a fringe political movement .
“ If we do n’t stop covering up what Islam is … Islam is a violent — I was going to say religion , but it ’s not a religion , it ’s a political system , it ’s a violent political system bent on the overthrow of the governments of the world and world domination , ” Robertson said .
“ You ’re dealing with not a religion , you ’re dealing with a political system , and I think we should treat it as such , and treat its adherents as such as we would members of the communist party , members of some fascist group . ”
Robertson pointed the finger of blame at the US military , suggesting that the families of the 12 killed and 30 wounded have a strong case for suing the Pentagon .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Those in the Army should be held to account for the fact they let this man loose , ” Robertson said .
This is not the first time that Robertson has aired controversial views about an act of violence on American soil .
In 2001 , shortly after the 9/11 attacks , Robertson agreed with fellow preacher Jerry Falwell that the attacks were God ’s punishment for the US allowing abortion and homosexuality .
“ I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle , the ACLU , People for the American Way , all of them who try to secularize America … I point the finger in their face and say you helped this happen , ” Falwell said , to which Robertson replied : “ I totally concur . ”

Both evangelists issued apologies for their statements later .
ORLY TAITZ : ‘BLIND OBEDIENCE ’ TO MILITARY CAUSED FORT HOOD MASSACRE
ADVERTISEMENT
But Robertson ’s theme this week — that the military is to blame for not preventing the massacre — has been echoed by numerous right - wing pundits .
As David Weigel reported at the Washington Independent , “ birther ” lawyer Orly Taitz is arguing that the Fort Hood massacre is evidence that soldiers should be allowed to disobey orders .
Taitz is the lawyer who has spearheaded a number of largely unsuccessful lawsuits challenging Barack Obama ’s legitimacy as president on the argument that Obama is not a natural - born citizen of the United States .
She was behind the release of the now - discredited “ Kenyan birth certificate ” for the president .
In an appeal of a federal court ’s decision to dismiss one of her lawsuits , Taitz wrote :
ADVERTISEMENT
Recent terrorist incident at Fort Hood has given this question paramount importance .
This order has advocated blind obedience by the members of the military .
If someone were to have common sense , brains and strength of character to challenge allegiance of Nidal Malik Hasan in court , after he made numerous anti-American and antimilitary statements , maybe 12 young boys would n’t be 6 feet under today , maybe 12 mothers and 12 fathers would n’t had their hearts ripped out of their chests and torn apart .
And the author of a recent book claiming that the US ’s largest Muslim advocacy group is trying to plant “ spies ” on Capitol Hill now says the Fort Hood massacre proves it ’s time for a “ backlash ” against Muslims .
In an interview with FamilySecurityMatters.org , Dave Gaubatz , co-author of Muslim Mafia : Inside the Secret Underworld That ’s Seeking to Islamize America , said it ’s time to make a “ bonfire ” out of the terrorist materials he says are circulating in mosques .
“ This was not an isolated incident , ” Gaubatz told the Web site :
ADVERTISEMENT
Maj .
Hasan ( allegedly ) did what he was taught .
Politicians , Muslims , and law enforcement are concerned about a ‘ backlash ’ against Muslims .
Now is the time for a professional and legal backlash against the Muslim Brotherhood and their leaders .
…
If Muslims do not want a backlash , then I would recommend a “ house cleaning . ”
Stack every Saudi , al Qaeda , Pakistani , Taliban , Hamas , and Muslim Brotherhood piece of material from their mosque and have a bonfire .
Tell the American , Jewish , and Muslim community this hatred will no longer be allowed in their mosques .
Last month , four Republican House representatives called for an investigation into claims in Gaubatz ’s book that the Council on American - Islamic Relations , the largest Muslim advocacy group in Washington , is trying to use the congressional intern program as a way to plant “ Muslim spies ” on Capitol Hill .
That notion was met with derision and ridicule from CAIR , which said that Gaubatz used his son to steal private documents from the group , and that the documents showed nothing more than typical lobbying activities by CAIR .
On Monday , a federal judge ordered Gaubatz to remove some of the 12,000 pages of CAIR documents he had posted to his Web site .
The judge supported CAIR ’s claims that the documents were “ unlawfully obtained . ”
The following video was broadcast on The 700 Club , November 9 , 2009 , and uploaded to the Web by MediaMatters .
One of the signs held by a gun-toting protester against the Democratic health care proposal earlier this year said “ IT IS TIME TO WATER THE TREE OF LIBERTY ! ”
This is a shorthand reference to an oft-used and abused quotation by Thomas Jefferson :
“ The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . ”
Jefferson made this remark in a letter to Col. William Smith , dated November 13 , 1787 .
It was part of a what he said in the letter about Shays ’s Rebellion , a brief uprising of poor farmers and revolutionary war veterans in western Massachusetts that reached a head that year .
They were mad as hell about the crushing taxes they were forced to pay and the laws that let the government confiscate their property if they could n’t pay those taxes .
As a symbol of their protest , they designated certain trees as “ liberty trees , ” like those used during the Revolution to hang tax collectors working for the British Crown .
They demanded changes in the tax laws , they had guns – and they were prepared to use them .
The Massachusetts state government reacted forcefully to put down this threat to their power , with encouragement from Founding Fathers like Samuel Adams .
In the rebellion ’s most significant “ battle , ” dozens of protesting farmers were killed or wounded by the state militia .
Hundreds were eventually put in prison .
Some were executed .
Thomas Jefferson was in Paris at the time .
From that distance , he adopted a philosophical view of Shay ’s Rebellion .
In his letter to Col. Smith , Jefferson did not justify the rebellion .
In fact , he said it was “ founded in ignorance . ”
But then , Jefferson went on to say the part that people who are mad as hell about something love to quote :
“ What country can preserve it 's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance ?
Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants .
It is it ’s natural manure . ”
Protesters against “ Obamacare ” are fans of Jefferson ’s “ tree of liberty ” quote .
So was Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh , who killed 168 people by blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , as an anti-government “ protest . ”
When arrested , McVeigh was wearing a t - shirt that had a picture of a tree of liberty dripping blood , and the words : “ The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . ”
Indeed , for over two centuries now , Jefferson ’s “ tree of liberty ” quote has been used by various people who think it somehow justifies what they believe and do .
And , I expect it will be for years to come .

Ingemar Westlund says he was " dragged through a nightmare "
A Swedish man who was arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife has been cleared , after police decided she was probably killed by an elk .
Ingemar Westlund , aged 68 , found the dead body of his wife Agneta , 63 , by a lake close to the village of Loftahammer in September 2008 .
He was immediately arrested and held in police custody for 10 days .
Now the case has been dropped after forensic analysis found elk hair and saliva on his wife 's clothes .
Mr Westlund told Expressen newspaper : " My family and I have been dragged through a nightmare . "
His wife had last been seen taking the family dog out for a walk in the forest .
When she failed to return her husband went out to look for her .
Although the murder investigation was dropped five months ago , details have only just emerged and the police plan to hold a news conference next week to explain what happened .
The European elk , or moose , is usually considered to be shy and will normally run away from humans .
But Swedish Radio International says the animals can become aggressive after eating fermented fallen apples in gardens .

The number of students entering the UK from India and Bangladesh has risen sharply since a new visa system began , the BBC has learned .
The UK Border Agency had said it believed the total number of students was " roughly the same " as last year .
But a Freedom of Information request revealed the numbers entering from those countries , thought to be hotspots for bogus students , has tripled .
The Home Office insists that the figures do not reflect a global trend .
' Raise the bar '
The new points - based immigration system was introduced last year .
It was designed to be tougher and more selective than the old one .
The then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith promised that the new system would " raise the bar " and lead to " fewer migrants coming to the UK from outside the EU " .
But earlier this month , immigration officers told BBC Radio 5 live they feared more bogus students are arriving in the UK under the new system , partly because of the large volume of arrivals which must be processed .
Officers said a significant number of those arriving on student visas had previously been denied entry to the UK , and they suspected that many had come here to work and not study .
One Heathrow - based whistleblower told the Donal MacIntyre programme that many so - called students could not speak English , and knew nothing about the courses they claimed to be studying .
He said many of these students came from the Indian subcontinent .
Sharp increase Responding to the immigration officers ' concerns , Jeremy Oppenheim , who runs the points - based system at the UK Border Agency , said that the number of students coming into the UK this year was " roughly the same as last year " .
But figures subsequently obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information
Act show there has been a sharp increase in the number of student visas granted in India and Bangladesh - two of the biggest centres for non-EU student visa applications .
Between June and August 2008 ( before the new system for students came into force ) , the British High Commissions in Mumbai , New Delhi and Dhaka issued 6,771 student visas .
During the same period this year ( under the new points - based immigration system ) , the three offices issued 19,950 visas .
The number of student visa applications rejected also rose from 3,997 to 6,261 .
' Flexible '
The government says it has cracked down on bogus colleges , and that the number of institutions able to bring students into the UK from outside the European Union has been halved since the introduction of the new points - based immigration system .
In a statement , Mr Oppenheim told the Donal MacIntyre programme : " The UK Border Agency has 74 visa - issuing posts worldwide , so three cities should not be taken as representative of a global trend .
" The points - based system is designed to be flexible , " he added .
" It enables us to regularly check and monitor all student applications and colleges to ensure that they meet the required standards , and take action where necessary . "

About
Everyone who speaks a language , speaks it with an accent .
A particular accent essentially reflects a person 's linguistic background .
When people listen to someone speak with a different accent from their own , they notice the difference , and they may even make certain biased social judgments about the speaker .
The speech accent archive is established to uniformly exhibit a large set of speech accents from a variety of language backgrounds .
Native and non-native speakers of English all read the same English paragraph and are carefully recorded .
1
The archive is constructed as a teaching tool and as a research tool .
It is meant to be used by linguists as well as other people who simply wish to listen to and compare the accents of different English speakers .
This website allows users to compare the demographic and linguistic backgrounds of the speakers in order to determine which variables are key predictors of each accent .
The speech accent archive demonstrates that accents are systematic rather than merely mistaken speech .
All of the linguistic analyses of the accents are available for public scrutiny .
We welcome comments on the accuracy of our transcriptions and analyses .

This 1930 newsreel footage shows Helen Keller and her companion Anne Sullivan demonstrating how Keller learned to speak .
Much is made of Keller ’s method of sign language , but I had no idea she could talk .
( via gulfstream )
Update : Here ’s an audio clip of Keller giving a speech .
Let me ask you something .
Does your phone play VHS tapes ?
Does it make toast ??
Does holding it against a patient in cardiac arrest restart their heart a la defibrillator ???
No ?
That 's because you do n't own an xPhone .

The xPhone is the future of humanity .
And I know what you 're thinking — you 're thinking this is nuts .
This is a joke .
This can't be real !
No one makes touchscreen tech like Apple or RIM , and we have n't even seen the OS .
So toast or not , this sucker is too good to be true !

Maybe it is .
But after watching this clip , I know one thing .
If I do n't get my xPhone , I 'm definitely learning German .

Families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq today reacted angrily to news that civil servants at the Ministry of Defence shared performance bonuses of almost £ 300 million since the start of the war in Iraq .
Official MoD figures showed a total of £ 287,809,049 has been paid out in bonuses to civil servants since 2003 , including more than £ 47 million this year .
Bereaved families said the bonuses were " absolutely disgusting " while troops were " making do " in Afghanistan .

Hazel Hunt , whose son died in August , said it was " obscene " that troops were being short - changed .
Private Richard Hunt was injured following an explosion while on vehicle patrol for the 2nd Battalion the Royal Welsh in Helmand Province .
The 21 - year - old from Abergavenny , South Wales , died in hospital two days later .
Mrs Hunt said : " I would take great exception to bonuses paid for ' exceptional performance ' .
" They are not delivering and I think it is obscene they have got such bonuses while our troops are being short changed ; not only in equipment but also in the fact that my son was barely on £ 17,000 a year .
" I think it is obscene , I really do , especially in the current climate with the recession and ordinary people losing their houses , including troops . "
Phil Cooper - whose son received £ 200,000 in compensation for injuries received in Iraq - said it was " absolutely disgusting that they can do this from the safety of their armchairs " .
Jamie , then 18 , became the youngest soldier to be injured in the conflict in 2006 .
His father said he was " laughing with astonishment " at the revelations .
Mr Cooper , 50 , from Bristol , said the MoD 's performance bonuses were unacceptable when troops were dying in Afghanistan and lacked equipment .
He said : " I find it ludicrous .
It makes me angry that they are being paid £ 47 million to pat themselves on the backs . "
Graham Knight , whose son Sergeant Ben Knight was killed when an RAF Nimrod exploded in mid-air over Helmand province on September 2 2006 , added that news of the bonuses " beggars belief " .

He said the pay - outs were " an insult " to the forces " making do " in Afghanistan .
The MoD said the bonuses - going to around 50,000 staff - would average less than £ 1,000 this year .
But some senior officials may be receiving as much as £ 8,000 , according to reports .
The figures emerged in a written reply from defence minister Kevan Jones to shadow defence secretary Liam Fox .
Mr Jones revealed that in the seven months from April to October this year , MoD staff received bonuses totalling £ 47,283,853 .
MoD sources said the majority of bonuses are handed out in August , so the figure is unlikely to rise by much over the remaining five months of the financial year .
The figure was down on the £ 52,984,656 paid out in 2008 /09 , but higher than the previous year 's £ 46,103,238 and almost double the bonuses totalling £ 24,866,213 paid out in 2003 / 04 .
Dr Fox has promised to cut 25 per cent from the cost of running the MoD , largely by reducing its headcount of 85,000 civil servants - one for every two active troops in the armed forces .
" Many in the armed forces will be aghast that bonuses are being paid on the basis of ' outstanding performance ' , " he told the Daily Telegraph .
" This will only increase the view that the armed forces and the MoD administration are hugely out of balance . "
An MoD spokesman said : " These pay awards are met from within salary budget and have no impact on the operational or equipment budget .
" Pay awards were given to around 50,000 civil servants resulting in an average payment of less than £ 1,000 .
" The vast majority of these awards were paid in August as part of previously agreed pay deals , so we are not expecting this year 's total to increase significantly . "
The lowest - paid Army privates earn £ 16,681 a year , with a six - month tax - free operational allowance of £ 2,380 if they are posted to Afghanistan .
Ashleigh Hall : ' We 've learned a terrible lesson ' , says mother of girl killed after going to see ' boy ' she met on Facebook
The mother of a teenager lured to her death over the internet yesterday warned other parents of the dangers of social networking sites .
Andrea Hall , 39 , spoke of the ' terrible lesson ' she had learned .
Her 17 - year - old daughter Ashleigh was found dead in a ditch on Monday .
The student nursery nurse had left home on Sunday evening and told her mother that she would be staying at a friend 's house .
She believed she was going to meet a boy of 16 whom she had befriended on the social networking site Facebook .
Her body was found at the side of a secluded country road in Sedgefield , County Durham , known locally as a lovers ' lane .
Devastated : Andrea
Hall warned other parents after her daughter Ashleigh , right , was killed after going to meet a man who she had met on the internet
Online yesterday : The Facebook page of 32 - year - old Peter Chapman
Miss Hall , who has three other children , yesterday said the death of her eldest child had devastated the family .
She begged other parents : ' Tell your kids to be careful on the internet .
Do n't meet someone without telling your family where you are going .
' Do n't trust anybody and do n't put your children on Facebook or other sites if they are underage .
We have learned a terrible lesson . '
Ashleigh lived with her mother in Darlington and had three sisters - Olivia , six , Ellie , four , and one - year - old Evie .
Miss Hall , who also has a page on Facebook , said her daughter was in her final year at college where she was studying child care and was looking forward to a career as a child minder or nursery nurse .
Charged : Peter Chapman led police to the girl 's body
' No one can imagine the hurt and devastation that has caused our family , ' she said .
' Ashleigh was loving , honest , caring and well - liked .
' Everybody loved her .
She was a person who brought light into the lives of others .
' To have Ashleigh taken from us in such circumstances is beyond belief and I do n't want other families to suffer what we are going through .
' All we ask now is that people help the police in any way they can .
We do n't want any other child to be a victim . '
In a separate message , posted on her Facebook site just hours after she learned of her daughter 's death , she simply wrote : ' My beautiful daughter has been taken away from me . '
Unemployed drifter Peter Chapman , 32 , is thought to have led police to Ashleigh 's body on Monday evening after being arrested by traffic officers .
He appeared before Newton Aycliffe Magistrates '
Court yesterday charged with killing the teenager , kidnap and failing to notify the police of a change of address as all sex offenders are required to do .
Unshaven and wearing blue jeans and a creased white T - shirt , he kept his hands in his pockets and his head bowed for the five - minute hearing .
He remained standing in the dock as the charges against him were read to the court .
Chapman is thought to have been monitored every six months by the police under the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements ( MAPPA ) for sex offenders .
Last night it emerged that Chapman 's ex-fiancee is the spitting image of Ashleigh Hall .
Dyanne Littler , who moved in with the murder suspect after he proposed to her , has the exact brown hair and eyes and rounded features as the tragic 17 - year - old .
Miss Littler , a mother - of - one , also revealed how she was wooed by Chapman over Facebook - the same internet site he used to target Ashleigh .
A month later Chapman was arrested after police discovered he was looking after her baby despite the fact he was on the sex offender 's register .
She immediately ended the relationship and a few months later she suffered a miscarriage she blames on stress
Last night Miss Littler , 25 , told The Sun : " He was always on Facebook and other social sites - he was on his PC constantly . "
Magistrate Christopher Shaw told Chapman that he would not be granting bail because of the ' substantial grounds ' that he would commit further offences .
Chapman will appear before Teesside Crown Court on November 3 .
Last night , Merseyside Police said they had launched a review into Chapman 's case .
Victim :
The body of Ashleigh Hall , pictured left with a friend , was found in a field near Sedgefield in County Durham
A white tent covers the place where the 17 - year - old 's body was found
In a statement they said : ' We can confirm that Peter Chapman was a registered sex offender who was resident in the force area .
' It was recently established that he had left his address in Merseyside and failed to notify the police to this .
' He was immediately circulated as being wanted for this offence and efforts have been made since to locate him .
' As a matter of routine and as with any such breach of requirements by a registered sex offender Merseyside Police are reviewing Chapman 's case . '
A former neighbour of Chapman 's from Kirkby , Liverpool , where he lived for two years until October last year , said : ' He was no problem most of the time , he had a manual job with a glass company .
' He seemed to like cars , that was his big interest .
He had a couple of bangers he was doing up . '
A Facebook page under Chapman 's name , with a black - and - white photo , was still active yesterday .
All of his 144 listed ' friends ' are women .

After years of crafting and rationalizing Bill Clinton 's version of the attack on poor people , high - ranking Department of Health and Human Services officials May Jo Bane and Peter Edelman resigned recently , several weeks after the president signed the hideous " welfare - reform " bill .
David Ellwood , another architect of the welfare overhaul , left a year earlier .
I 'm sorry , but their grand gesture , tastefully skirting direct criticism of Clinton 's action , seems too much like a self - righteous attempt to escape responsibility for their own involvement in bringing this savagery about .
To that extent , their crocodile tears underscore the ugly truth of American liberalism .
Sometime early in Ronald Reagan 's first term , I decided to forget everything I 'd always disliked about liberals .
I took pains to subordinate what put me off about them to the larger objective of unity against the rightwing onslaught , I decided to overlook their capacity for high - minded fervor for the emptiest and sappiest platitudes ; their tendencies to make a fetish of procedure over substance and to look for technical fixes to political problems ; their ability to screen out the mounting carnage in the cities they inhabit as they seek pleasant venues for ingesting good coffee and scones ; their propensity for aestheticizing other people 's oppression and calling that activism ; their reflex to wring their hands and look constipated in the face of conflict ; and , most of all , their spinelessness and undependability in crises .
But during the ' 80s liberal opinion gradually accommodated to Reaganism by sliding rightward .
Two rhetorical justifications emerged for this adaptation .
The Democratic Leadership Council called for a new centrism , jettisoning egalitarian politics and the constituencies identified with it .
Additionally , an excesses - of - the - '60 s - as - fall - from - grace fable propelled this slide and justified the smug dismissal of those of us who did n't want to go along .
This new liberalism curtly demanded that we grow up and accept the realpolitik ; Reaganism was all our fault for going too far anyway .
Bill Clinton 's genius is that he managed to embody both the neoliberal and DLC variants of the rightward shift , and combined them with a superficial earnestness that mitigates whatever egalitarian thoughts may linger among those who will to believe in him .
So liberals have followed and rationalized and pimped for him through the debacle of his half - assed , insurance company - led health - care reform , NAFTA and GATT , his horribly repressive crime and antiterrorism legislation , and his conspicuous retreat from support of civil rights enforcement .
Now Clinton 's apologists even attempt to justify his embrace of the abominable welfare - reform bill , stooping to a Flip Wilson defense ( Gingrich made him sign it ) and using the bill 's passage as a reason to vote for Bipartisan Bill ( so that he can " fix " what he just did ) .
Talk about will to believe .
Or is it will to get paid ?
Their lapdog defense of Big Bill highlights liberals ' willingness to sacrifice the poor and to tout it as tough - minded compassion and an act of courage .
Even before Clinton won the Democratic nomination in 1992 this trait was visible , especially among those policy - jock types who had begin to sense the possibility of a Clinton victory and their impending opportunity to consort with power .
I got my wake - up call from a poverty - researcher colleague who , on the eve of the Illinois primary , impatiently dismissed my objections to Clinton 's having just executed black , impoverished , and brain - damaged Rickey Ray Rector .
She blew me off as naive for not recognizing that any Democrat who hoped to win the presidency would have to support capital punishment .
" Easy for you to say , " I thought , but , regrettably , was too polite to say out loud .
Nowhere have the moral and political deficiencies of this liberal notion of realpolitik been more clearly exposed than around the Clinton administration 's welfare - reform politics .
A decade ago , William Julius Wilson set the tone with The Truly Disadvantaged .
In that work , Wilson chided the left for losing credibility , to the benefit of conservative critics , by not facing up to a spreading social pathology among the urban underclass .
He proposed a sleight - of - hand approach to helping the poor schmucks through " universal " programs that would n't antagonize the better - off by appearing to do anything for poor people in particular .
Fittingly , he became a major Clinton apologist in 1992 .
Following Wilson , David Ellwood , a highly regarded liberal poverty researcher at Harvard 's Kennedy School , invented the " two years and off " notion , which he publicized in his 1988 book , Poor Support .
Ellwood eased his provocative idea with calls for a battery of support services that would accompany expulsion from the welfare rolls .
Like Wilson , he blew off the critics on his left who argued that his costly bundle of safeguards would go nowhere without a forceful challenge to the right - wing climate that his get - 'em - off - the - dole slogan accommodated .
The fear , now realized , was that his liberal credentials would legitimize the two - years - and - off idea as a programmatic goal without including any of his finely crafted hedges .
Attracted by Bubba 's call to " end welfare as we know it , " Ellwood and Kennedy School colleague Mary Jo Bane headed south to become part of official Washington .
They would be the main players in the administration 's overhaul of welfare , using two - years - and - off as their centerpiece .
Joining the team later was Peter Edelman , the perennially up - and - coming liberal lawyer .
He had assailed welfare as early as 1967 , employing the coded attack phrase fostering dependence ( read : poor folks are lazy bastards ) .
Beneath all this idiotic coyness lie liberals ' long - standing aversion to conflict and their refusal to face up to the class realities of American politics .
They avoid any linkage of inequality with corporations ' use of public policy to drive down living standards and enhance their plunder , So Marian Wright Edelman ( Peter 's wife ) of the Children 's Defense Fund concocted the strategy of focusing on children .
This save - the - babies politics is not only maudlin ( notice how her pal Hillary 's " whole village " went so easily from raising a child to stoning poor families in her support of hubby 's welfare travesty ) , it also gives in to the right 's demonization of poor adults by conceding their worthlessness in order to focus on their presumably innocent kids .
Roll ahead to the summer of 1994 .
Ellwood and Pane , representing HHS , sat at Daniel P. Moynihan 's Senate Finance Committee hearing on Clinton 's welfare - reform package ( which , by the way , was n't all that different from the Republican thing he signed ) .
Alongside them was their boss , another liberal stalwart , HHS secretary Donna Shalala .
As chief Clintonista , Shelala proclaimed that the purpose of the president 's welfare - reform initiative was to eliminate out - of - wedlock births , her underlings nodded in agreement -- thus playing into one of the ugliest right - wing canards about social provision .
As if that was n't disgusting enough , when Moynihan invoked the specter of " speciation " -- the notion that generations of out - of - wedlock breeding in isolated , impoverished city pockets has created a new " species " -- each of the HHS folks nodded again .
I 'm sure that these good liberals would have explained away their participation in that dehumanizing characterization as a strategic move ; their intention being the advancement of humane social policy within an unfavorable political climate .
However , their behavior exposes a deeper truth about the political commitments on which this strain of liberalism rests :
This is a politics motivated by the desire for proximity to the ruling class and a belief in the basic legitimacy of its power and prerogative .
It is a politics which , despite all its idealist puffery and feigned nobility , will sell out any allies or egalitarian objectives in pursuit of gaining the Prince 's ear .
In a few short years , these sort of liberals have reminded me of all that had troubled me about them , and more .
I 'd just about convinced myself that my earlier scornfulness was a function of youthful hotheadedness .
Some was , but not that much .
In the end , it is the poisonous mix of self - righteousness and hypocrisy -- as illustrated by Ellwood , Bane , and Edelman -- which earns my contempt .
15 ) Tom Clancy
How many hurried travellers pick up a Tom Clancy 's Op - Centre or Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell paperback from an airport bookshop in the belief that they are getting something , y'know , written by Tom Clancy , only to discover on the plane that it was tossed out by a ghostwriter ?
They are just two of the " brands " created by Clancy and his publishers to cash in on the novelist 's name , with lesser - known authors hired to do the actual writing .
Some do not even get their name on the cover , enduring the double indignity of having their work credited to both Clancy and a pseudonym .
Hold on to your hats ladies and gentleman , search is about to get smaller again if Barry Diller gets his way .
Hot off their earnings call for the quarter , Diller ’s IAC has mentioned that they would be open to a sale of their Ask.com search engine .
This right after the gigantic Yah00 - Microsoft deal that will bring the vast majority of search under two roofs .
Ask has long been the fourth wheel in search , never making much consumer headway .
Its market share has hovered in lower single digits for most of recent memory .
But now Diller might be looking to slough it off , if he can find a buyer .
Ask is currently monetized through a deal with Google , so it seems hardly likely that Microsoft will want to pay to play .
Google has no need to purchase something that it already has the purse strings to , and Yahoo is leaving search .
Name another internet giant that is actively pushing on search and has the cash to buy Ask .
Do n’t have anyone in mind ?
You are not alone .
A few years back there was a general back - of - the - envelope calculation that pegged 1 % of the search market at a value of one billion dollars .
By that math , Ask is worth around four billion dollars .
Hardly pocket change for a company that has never captivated the consumer .
If Diller does manage to convince a giant to purchase Ask , and it is rolled into a current offering , we will go from four to two search engines in just a year .
You can almost touch the anti-trust legislation coming down the pipeline .
Of course , until a suitor comes along , Ask is just another person at the dance waiting for a date .
But if you know Mr. Diller , you know that he has a propensity for getting his way , and making deals happen .
He just might pull it off .
Given that Ask might be leaving us , we wanted to use their old logo that we love .

Six Things To Avoid Saying to the Insurance Company in a Claim
In many ways , insurance is a lot like a game .
The goal ?
Trying to get a payment for a claim since you have been paying insurance for that very purpose : Protection against large expenses due to unforeseen events .
However , opposing you is the insurance company , which will be on the lookout for red flags and indications that fraud may be at work .
What you say to your insurance agent can mean a delayed claim — or even one that ends up denied .
If you want to come out on top and be the winner , here are four things to avoid saying to your insurance agent :
1. “ Flooded ”
It is important to realize that most standard homeowner ’s policies do not cover floods .
You have to purchase separate coverage to protect against flood damage to your home .
So , using “ flooded ” as a description of what your bathroom looks like , thanks to a burst pipe immediately gets your claim flagged .
As far as the insurance company is concerned , a flood is something that happens when the weather is involved or the nearby pond overflows .
And that is not covered by your homeowner ’s policy .
So before you frantically call and mention that you ’ve got a “ flooded ” room , consider your word choice .
If you have a burst pipe or some other water - related problem that is covered by your homeowner ’s insurance , mention that .
“ My water main burst ” is all the description you need .
2. “ Whiplash ”
One of the biggest red flags when it comes to auto insurance is the word “ whiplash . ”
Fraudulent claims related to this neck condition are quite numerous and costly for insurers .
If you say you have whiplash , then it is possible that your claim will be flagged .
While it may not necessarily be denied , it could be delayed for a rather inconvenient amount of time .
Realize that whiplash is , in fact , a specific medical term for a particular condition .
Unless your doctor has actually diagnosed you with whiplash , describe your condition as “ neck pain . ”
3 . “ Send a check ”
The theory behind an insurance company paying a claim is that you will use the money to fix a problem .
With health insurance , it is pretty straightforward :
For the most part , the insurer is billed by the health care provider and pays the bill directly .
However , for homeowner ’s insurance , and some auto insurance , you might get a check that ’s meant to defray the cost of repairs .
Note though , that you do n’t want to actually say the words “ send a check ” to your insurance agent .
That could be an indication that you are not interested in getting your car ’s dent repaired or your leaky roof fixed .
Insurance companies do n’t always check up on you , but if you seem fixated on getting a check , your claim may be red- flagged for further investigation , delaying the needed funds .
4. “ Experimental ”
Understand that most health insurance policies do n’t cover true experimental procedures .
If you tell your insurance agent that a treatment is investigative in nature , you may be denied coverage .
It is also important to realize that when a health care provider says that s/he will experiment with a treatment , it does n’t necessarily mean that the treatment itself is experimental in nature .
Find out from your doctor whether or not the treatment has been shown to be reasonably effective , and whether the doctor sees it as medically necessary .
Get the word from your doctor before classing something as “ experimental . ”
5 . “ I think , or it ’s probably because … ”
There ’s no place to play detective or medical doctor in an insurance claim .
It ’s very important that you stick to the facts and not assume you know why something is broken or why you have body aches .
Try to avoid speculating on the causes of the problem .
Your insurance agent does n’t need a detailed history of why you think that pipe burst .
Just say that it did , and point to your documentation of the damage , or refer the agent to the documentation from the claim representative .
As anything can be used against you , it ’s best to just tell the agent everything that ’s happening without offering too much additional color because you never know how something you say is going to hurt you .
6. “ I ’m Good ”
Most people will answer that things are good when someone asks how their day is going , but a response that ’s too positive and peppy may give the insurance agent the impression that the situation is not as serious as it is .
You do n’t want to lie , but you definitely do n’t want the insurance agent to believe that you are exaggerating your difficulties if , for example , your back is really bothering you .
What This All Means
The words you use are really important , and what you say to your insurer , especially in an official statement , can come back to haunt you .
When speaking with your agent about a claim , make sure that you stick to known facts .
If you do n’t know something , you need to say : “ I do n’t know . ”
Do n’t guess .
And do n’t lie .
You should also ask for a copy of the statement your agent takes , or a transcript of any recording .
This way , you can go through and check for inaccuracies or other problems .
It ’s ultimately up to you to make sure that your insurance claim starts off on the right track .
Knowing what will red flag your claim can help you avoid potential pitfalls .

At IAmA – an incredible corner of the social news website Reddit – people , hiding behind online anonymity , submit themselves to the masses and invite them to " ask me anything " .
They range from the mundane ( " I work at a small scale hardware store " ) to the bizarre ( " I'm a medieval times princess " ) to the incredible .
One recent interviewee was the winner of $ 30 m on the lottery and fielded hundreds of questions ranging from " Do you get up earlier ? " to the intricacies of what it 's like managing vast wealth ( he bought some dinosaur bones ) .

It takes 100 years or more for some species of tree to grow to full size but a few minutes to cut them down .

The question that faces the British electorate in the next eight months or so is whether the same applies to the conventions of liberty , trust and privacy which have been felled by Labour 's chainsaw .
Is the damage irreversible or can the opposition parties muster the leadership and will to guarantee a restoration of all that has been lost in the last 12 years ?
The question haunts me .
Every day , there is some new example of madness or spite perpetrated by a government that seems now in its final gibbering months to be waging war on normality itself .
What better betrays the suspicion and dread that writhe in the minds of civil servants and ministers than a law which requires every parent to join a government database and be vetted before accompanying their children 's friends to some sport event or scout meeting , where , incidentally , the traditional penknife is now banned ?
How have they got away with this presumption , with the lunatic idea that everyone who has contact with vulnerable people or children is a potential abuser ?
The bill to the taxpayer is going to be £ 170 million , but will the Independent Safeguarding Authority do much to prevent the abuse of the vulnerable ?
I very much doubt it .
It 's the small things that strike you about the powers given to a great army of busybodies , guardians , wardens and police officers .
The Lennox Herald in Scotland reported last week that 109 litres of alcohol had been seized during patrols around Loch Lomond in 22 days .
Police logged 29 crimes and 81 other offences , reported 42 people , warned a further 255 and searched 297 .
Nine warrants were executed and 5,168 vehicles checked through automatic number plate recognition .
There will be those who think this is a good thing , but there will be many that view this level of police attention as intimidating .
The police are behaving as though the area is host to Glasgow 's entire criminal fraternity .
At the other end of the UK , in Brighton , you find the same misappropriation of drink and oppressive presence of police officers .
Attend a legitimate political meeting in the town and you are likely to be met by police forward intelligence teams with a video camera at the door .
This is a story I have been telling for some years now .
Things do n't get better ; we just get used to them , which is dangerous .
Beneath these measures are disturbing developments which heap suspicion on individuals and undermine their rights .
Look closely at the " sleeper " clause in the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004 which from the end of this month extends the range of circumstances that a restraining order can be made under Jack Straw 's Protection from Harassment Act 1997 .
I quote from a lawyer 's commentary : " Restraining orders can be issued following conviction for any offence rather than just offences covered by the 1997 act ; and secondly restraining orders can also be issued following an acquittal for any offence . "
Yes , that 's right – following acquittal for any offence .
So the innocent will become subject of an order which , if breached , may result in a maximum jail term of five years .
Lewis Carroll must have had a hand in drafting this clause .
If you are innocent , you are guilty – off with your head .
Innocence is compromised by excessive state suspicion .
At HM Revenue and Customs , officials are seeking new powers to force businesses to provide information on customers and clients , which , according to Roy Maugham , a tax partner at UHY Hacker Young , will allow HMRC to build a database of unprecedented size and power about UK citizens and businesses .
" This means , " he says , " that it will be able to cross - check the bank details of potentially everyone against their tax returns in just a few clicks . "
It must be obvious that we have to balance the policing of society with the interests of its tone and our conventions of tolerance .
To have tax officials able to access any bank account or policemen taking pictures of every climate change activist or examining every carload of city dwellers seeking a bit of fresh air on the banks of Loch Lomond is plainly inimical to a free society .
The opposition parties understand what is going on .
At the time of the Convention on Modern Liberty earlier this year , the Liberal Democrats produced the Freedom Bill which covered everything from the intrusive Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to ID cards , the regulation of CCTV and the retention of DNA from innocent people .
It is an excellent blueprint .
David Cameron welcomed the convention with this : " Things we have long thought were part of the fabric of liberty in this country – such as trial by jury , habeas corpus with strict limits on the time that people can be held without charge , the protection of Parliament against intrusion by the executive – have been whittled away . "
In a speech in May he fitted the analysis into the overall Conservative belief in personal responsibility and local accountability .
" A culture of rule - following , box - ticking and central prescription robs people of the chance to use their judgment , " he said .
" An increasingly Orwellian state reminds people that the powers that be do n't trust them . "
This is right , but I have one big doubt and that is the Tory faith in local accountability and scrutiny .
During the six months since the convention , it has become clear that local authorities and police forces have thrilled to the excessive use of authoritarian powers .
We need a Great Repeal Bill , which lists in detail the large and small measures responsible for the decline in Britain 's democracy .
This needs to be endorsed and settled by both opposition parties in their separate ways before the election campaign begins in earnest and the issues of freedom are swamped by the debate about spending cuts and tax .
The time for this action is now , in the party conference season , when ideas and commitments can be explained without haste and embedded in a campaign .
Leadership and activism must join to end the beginning of tyranny .
Microsoft Research and the Applied Sciences Group have developed five input device prototypes that combine a variation of multitouch sensing to the standard capabilities of a typical computer mouse .
Microsoft believes these prototypes have the potential to set a new standard for " expressive interaction . "
Each device explores a different touch sensing strategy via a different form factor .
Microsoft sent us a short five - minute video that demonstrates each of the five prototypes .
The prototypes shown are really cool so we 've embed the video for your viewing pleasure :
If video is n't your thing , here 's how Microsoft describes each of the five mice :
FTIR ( Frustrated Total Internal Reflection ) Mouse : FTIR
Mouse is a mouse design that uses the principle of frustrated total internal reflection and a built - in camera to sense user 's touches on top of an arc - shaped piece of acrylic .
This approach provides a very robust means of detecting touch events .

Mouse : The Arty Mouse takes the notion of Side Mouse one step further with a base for the palm of the hand to rest on and two " arms " that can be freely and independently moved on the table by the thumb and index finger .
This design allows a high - resolution optical mouse sensor to be placed underneath two of the user 's fingers for extremely high sensing fidelity .
This prototype can support subtle and fine - grained multi - touch gestures .
The following people contributed to these prototypes : Nicolas Villar , Shahram Izadi , John Helmes , Steve Hodges , Alex Butler , and Xiang Cao of Microsoft Research ; Hrvoje Benko of Microsoft Research ; Dan Rosenfeld , Jonathan Westhues , Eyal Ofek , and Billy Chen of Microsoft .
They ’re presenting their prototypes and their findings at this week ’s User Interface Software and Technology conference in Victoria , British Columbia , Canada .
If this is true , then somebody has slipped up big time .
A planning document has appeared on Sega's PR site that , for all intents and purposes , confirms the existence of PlayStation 2 / PlayStation 3 backwards compatability .
The document says , clear as day , that Sony has plans to sell PS2 games via the PSN .
If Sony 's planning that , the PS3's going to need some emulation capabilities for all units .
Here 's what the document says :
PS2 emulator for PS3 ( confidential ) SCEA wants to sell all PS2 titles on PSN ( GTA Vice City / Sonic/etc )
For co Marketing money show PS3 controller on TV ads – similar to EA Madden Spots , NCAA , etc …
This is n' tthe document reveals , either .
It contains a number of Sega inner workings , such as the revelation that the publisher feels " is more RPG " than , aaction figure is being considered , and thatcould ship on a hybrid Blu-ray that contains the movies .
There 's also talk of Sony motion controller plans and !
Hot stuff !
I have a feeling this doc is genuine , as I tried the download link and it certainly comes from Sega 's own PR site .
This means some huge things , and somebody 's probably going to get into a lot of trouble .
Still , the document is full of all sorts of interesting and / or crazy items , so scour through it after the jump .
You really want to check this out .
SCEA Meeting Aug 5th Notes
Aug 6 2009 – DRAFT FOR COMMENTS
Objectives of Meeting
Dyer agreed to regular quarterly meetings with SOA
Sony PS3
SCEA reiterated plans to sell 13 million PS3s this year
Big announcement back half of year they ca n’t talk about ( potentially price cut of PS3 to reach hardware goals )
SCEA commented on indexing between PS3 and 360 SKUs , should be around 2:1 to garner most favorable treatment .
Motion Controller
Spring 2010 launch ( March in JP )
No bundle / pricing details yet , should come Sept 1
Plan on selling 4 - 5 MM units WW
SCEA agreed to provide a list of Sega IP that would work well with the motion controller , Virtua Tennis was an example
Motion Controller support allows easy way to differentiate PS3 SKU
Other differentiation opportunities include PSP / PS3 interoperability – think of features that would make users want to buy both PS3 and PSP SKUs .
Alpha Protocol
Michael Foster , product evaluator , said AP felt barely RPG .
Initial level too challenging for players .
“ Mass Effect felt more RPG . ”
Review notes sent to John Merlino a few weeks prior .
After meeting Gerald mentioned AP is a high priority for his team .
Planet 51
Sell in of PS3 SKU – SCEA noted that other movie titles on PS3 had underperformed as well ( inc. Transformers ) this cycle .
Dyer suggests contacting Susan at Walmart and asking what she wants in the pack to sell this SKU ( movie tix etc )
Other possibilities are Hybrid movie disc ( BD 25 or 50 with Game and Movie on same disc ) .
Bayonetta
Collectors edition with Bayonetta Action Figure
Novo recommended launching PSN demo around Xmas based off a Jan 5th Ship date with 2 - 3 week run out to launch .
3 - 4 weeks is usually ideal demo timing with fresh content every week leading up to launch ( trailers , insider video about PG heritage , video blogs ) .
Vancouver 2010
HOME , Olympic destination would garner a lot of positive attention from SCEA
Should be doing same with Bayonetta , Marvel etc.
Easy to launch in all territories .
HOME merchandizing opportunities ( clothes etc ) .
Sonic Racing
Open to DLC to differentiate PS3 SKU – not ratchet and clank but other characters
maybe characters from Rare or Fable universes
Yakuza
Could put Japanese games directly on PSN for download in a special Japanese Import section ( pricing $ 9.99 to $ 39.99 for full game ) .
Might need to localize menus at least with subtitles .
SCEA interested in helping on MKTG side if they can have period of exclusivity .
AVP
Another great HOME candidate
AVP avatars
Hybrid BD disc with movie
Iron Man 2
Great candidate for HOME space – explore Tony Stark ’s lab etc .
Should have one for Marvel in general .
PSU2

Speaking before the Media Institute in Virginia on Tuesday , the leading voice of the cable industry challenged the idea that net neutrality regulations enhance free speech .
Quite the contrary , warned Kyle McSlarrow , CEO of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association , " the First Amendment is framed as a shield for citizens , not a sword for government . "
True enough , the First Amendment " promotes democratic values , " McSlarrow added , " but it does so best by freeing citizens from government regulation of their speech , not by regulating it . "
The NCTA 's boss was responding to the Federal Communications Commission 's proposed new Internet non-discrimination rules , which would put the kibosh on ISPs unnecessarily blocking or interfering with applications , and require them to be transparent about their network management practices .
Advocates of net neutrality are " standing the First Amendment on its head , " McSlarrow declared , when they invoke the amendment on behalf of this cause .
Kind of creepy
Presumably , when McSlarrow used the word " citizens , " he was referring to Comcast , Time - Warner , Cox , and the rest of the cable industry , a presumption that the Supreme Court validated in its famous Santa Clara versus Southern Pacific Railroad case of 1886 .
But he insisted that he 's talking about everybody else too .
And it 's not like the issue came out of nowhere .
In fact , the FCC requested feedback on the First Amendment implications of its suggested rules in its Notice of Proposed rulemaking .
Would these rules impose " any burdens on access providers ’ speech that would be cognizable for purposes of the First Amendment , and if so , how ? " the FCC asked .
And : " Would any burden on access providers ’ speech be outweighed by the speech - enabling benefits of an open Internet that provides a non-discriminatory platform for the robust interchange of ideas ? "
Some parties in this discussion , most notably the advocacy group Free Press , have argued that the FCC should apply " strict scrutiny " principles to ISPs .
" Just as the First Amendment applies strict scrutiny to effectively ban speech - discrimination on streets and in parks , the FCC should apply strict scrutiny to ban such discrimination by network operators on the Internet , " Free Press wrote to the FCC in June of 2008 .
Needless to say , the NCTA does n't like that idea .
McSlarrow even called the strict scrutiny argument " kind of creepy . "
Here are his answers to the FCC 's questions .
It has n't happened here
Much of McSlarrow 's speech reiterated what has become a mainstay of anti-net neutrality discourse , that the government is proposing a " solution in search of a problem . "
" It is exactly that , " he insisted .
" Because all of the openness , all of the civic participation , all of the democratic engagement we could possibly want is happening right now . . . without net neutrality regulation . "
Yes , McSlarrow noted , there have been " a couple of isolated incidents that keep being held up as examples of what needs to be prevented " — presumably the Madison River ISP 's agreement with the FCC not to block VoIP applications and the agency 's 2008 Order sanctioning Comcast for P2P throttling .
But , " nothing that suggests any threat to the openness of the Internet . "
" I do n't know how to say it any more clearly than this , " McSlarrow declared .
" Internet Service Providers do not threaten free speech ; their business is to enable speech and they are part of an ecosystem that represents perhaps the greatest engine for promotion of democracy and free expression in history . "
And this has important legal implications , McSlarrow continued , invoking the Supreme Courts ' Turner Broadcasting vs. FCC decision of 1994 .
In that case , the high court narrowly upheld the constitutionality of the 1992 Cable Act , which established " must carry " rules requiring cable companies to set aside some of their channels for local TV broadcasters .
But the Supremes also warned that lawmakers must show that they are addressing a real problem , not just an anticipated one .
When the Government defends a regulation on speech as a means to redress past harms or prevent anticipated harms , it must do more than simply ' posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured . '
It must demonstrate that the recited harms are real , not merely conjectural , and that the regulation will , in fact , alleviate these harms in a direct and material way .
That advisory " should ring loud and clear in the net neutrality proceeding , " McSlarrow added .
" Because when all the dire warnings of the net neutrality proponents are stripped away , there really are no signs of actual harm . "
A strong implication
The NCTA also does n't like all the talk coming from the FCC about how to handle " managed services " on the ' Net , which could include IP video .
The agency says it wants to offer flexibility in this area , but only up to a point .
" The growth of managed or specialized services might supplant or otherwise negatively affect the open Internet , " the FCC 's NOPR warns , noting , for example , that AT&T runs its U - Verse IP based video service on the same networks it offers Internet access .
" The strong implication " here , McSlarrow suggested , " is some kind of guaranteed amount of bandwidth capacity for services the government deems important . "
And that 's where the First Amendment supposedly comes into play again .
Net neutrality rules could infringe ISP First Amendment rights , NCTA argues , " because they could prevent providers from delivering their traditional multichannel video programming services or new services that are separate and distinct from their Internet access service . "
And cable companies are not broadcasting over the public airwaves , McSlarrow reminded his audience .
These rules could hurt applications providers too , McSlarrow warned , especially if they ban prioritized access rules , as the FCC is proposing .
" The First Amendment protects the right not just to decide what to say , but how to say it , " he continued .
" Does the First Amendment really allow the government to prohibit a content or applications provider from paying to acquire the means to distribute its content in the form or manner it wishes ? "
And here you thought the First Amendment just said that " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . "
Do n't expect this debate to end any time soon .
Mossad does not give uniformed police advance notice of training sessions
A trainee spy for Israel 's secret service agency Mossad was arrested by Tel Aviv police while taking part in a training operation , media reports say .
The young trainee was spotted by a female passer - by as he planted a fake bomb under a vehicle in the city .
He was only able to persuade police he was a spy after being taken in by an officer for questioning on Monday .
The authorities have refused to comment on the story although Israeli media outlets have expressed their surprise .
' Just a drill '
Mossad does not tell local uniformed police about its training exercises .
The country 's commercial Channel 10 said it hoped the agency 's operatives were " more effective abroad " , AFP news agency reported .
Niva Ben-Harush , the woman who reported the novice 's suspicious behaviour to police , told Ynet News that 15 minutes after she made the call , Tel Aviv 's port was closed and people evacuated .
She said police initially asked her to come with them and identify the suspect .
" But after a few minutes , they told me it was just a drill , " she said .
Up to three agency employees were believed to have been suspended following the incident , Ynet reported .
It quoted the prime minister 's office as saying it did " not respond to information about such activities undertaken by security agencies or attributed to them " .
THE city ’s unofficial motto , “ Keep Austin Weird , ” blares from bumper stickers on BMWs and jalopies alike , on T - shirts worn by joggers along Lady Bird Lake and in the windows of independently owned shops and restaurants .
It ’s an exhortation for a city that clings to eccentricity , even in the face of rapid development  downtown Austin , for one , is being transformed with a fleet of high - rise condos and a W Hotel , scheduled to open late next year .
But this funky college town , known for its liberal leanings and rich music scene , has little to worry about  at least as long as its openhearted citizens , with their colorful bungalows and tattoos , do their part to keep the city endearingly odd .
As one local put it : “ As long as Austinites keep decorating their bodies and cars , we ’re going to be fine . ”

The Sport Review 's selection of the five most peculiar crowd moments in football The Sport Review 's selection of the five most peculiar crowd moments in football
There are many things one can expect to see at a football match , but a fan brushing his teeth in the stands surely is n’t one of them .
With Chelsea beating Manchester United 1 - 0 at Stamford Bridge on Sunday , Salomon Kalou was preparing to come on to replace Didier Drogba .
The camera pans to Kalou , but bizarrely in the background , a crowd member has decided the time is right to ensure dental cleanliness .
Here is The Sport Review ’s selection of the five most peculiar crowd moments in football .
1 . The list would n’t be complete without the infamous toothbrush moment .
2. Barcelona captain Carlos Puyol marauds down the right wing , unleashing a high , inaccurate cross goalwards .
It evades the players flying well behind the goal , but one optimistic fan attempts to catch the loose ball with devastating consequences .
3 . Much has been made of recent crowd troubles at Upton Park and Oakwell .
However in the Arsenal v Manchester United fixture in 2007 - 08 , one elderly lady - presumably an Arsenal fan - makes her feelings clear when Ryan Giggs trots over to take a United corner .
4 . As fans in the stands , we would relish the opportunity to run out on the pitch and show the professionals how it should be done .
This Russian fan does just that as he dispatches his spot kick with consummate ease for his team , Spartak Moscow .
As he runs away in celebration he is joined by his fellow friend and fan .
5 . Our last choice is n’t so much an incident involving a crowd member but a ball boy .
Spurs are comfortably demolishing Cypriot side , Anorthosis Famagusta .
The away side earn a throw in and the Tottenham ball boy is a little too enthusiastic as he returns the ball to the Cypriot player .
“ … And A Little Child Shall Lead Them ”
THOMAS FRIEDMAN , the New York Times columnist , has an idea .
That happens to him quite often .
One might almost say - too often .
It goes like this :
The US will turn its back on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The entire world will follow .
Everybody is fed up with this conflict .
Let the Israelis and the Palestinians sort out their problems by themselves .
Sounds sensible .
Why must the world be bothered with these two unruly children ?
Let them kick each other as much as they like .
The adults should not interfere .
But in reality this is an outrageous suggestion .
Because these two children are not of equal strength .
When an adult sees a 14 - year old mercilessly mistreating a 6 - year old , can he just look on ?
Israel is materially a hundredfold , indeed a thousandfold , stronger than the Palestinians .
The fourth strongest army in the world ( by its own estimate ) dominates the life of a helpless people .
The Israeli economy , with some of the most advanced technologies in the world , dominates a people whose resources are next to nil .
A 42 - year old occupation dominates every single corner of occupied Palestine .
This did not come about by a miracle .
The huge gap between the strength of the two peoples has also been created by the support of the US for Israel .
Israel would not be where it is today without this political , economic and military underpinning .
Billions of dollars in annual aid , access to the most advanced weaponry in the world , the political immunity assured by the US veto in the Security Council and all the other forms of assistance have helped successive Israeli governments to maintain and intensify the occupation .
Friedman does not propose ending this support , which itself is a massive intervention in this conflict , and is given to the stronger side .
When he suggests that the US withdraw from the conflict , he is actually saying : let the Israeli government do what it is doing – continue the occupation , set up new settlements , withdraw the land from under the feet of the Palestinian people , go on with the murderous blockade that denies the 1.5 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip – men , women and children –almost all the necessities of life .
This is a monstrous suggestion .
True , the prophet Isaiah ( 11:6 ) describes a situation where the wolf shall dwell with the lamb .
( Israeli humor comments :
No problem , provided a new lamb is brought in every day . )
Now the prophet Thomas proposes to let the wolf and the lamb sort out their relationship between themselves .
BINYAMIN NETANYAHU could not wish for more in his wildest dreams .
In the meantime he is satisfied with something less : President Obama ’s acceptance of his latest trick .
And thus Netanyahu confronted the nation with a tortured face and told us about his inhumanly difficult decision : to suspend the building activities in the settlements .
The entire world applauded .
How wonderful of Netanyahu to sacrifice his most sacred principles on the altar of peace .
He has taken a stupendous step .
Now it ’s up to the Palestinians in their turn to respond with a grand gesture .
But something is wrong in this picture and needs explaining .
To return to the great Sherlock Holmes , who spoke about the curious incident of the dog in the night - time : “ But the dog did nothing in the night - time ! ” he was told .
“ That was the curious incident , ” the detective answered .
It could have been assumed that after such a dramatic announcement by the Likud leader , the settlers would let out a deafening roar .
Riots in the streets of all the towns .
Blocking of all roads in the occupied territories .
A rebellion of the settlers in the cabinet and the Knesset .
But the dog did not bark .
Not even a growl , just a token yelp .
Culture Minister Limor Livnat opened her big mouth and declared that the Obama administration was “ terrible ” .
That ’s more or less all .
The settler - minister Avigdor Lieberman even voted for the decision in the cabinet , and so did the ultra - extreme Likud minister Benny Begin , son of the late Prime Minister .
Begin even explained his curious behavior on TV : he had no reason to vote against .
After all , it was only a gesture to appease Obama .
It has no real content .
Building “ public structures ” will go on ( about 300 new ones were approved just this week ) .
Building will be continued in housing projects whose foundations have already been laid ( at least 3000 apartments in the West Bank ) .
And , most importantly : there will be absolutely no limitation to Jewish building activity in East Jerusalem , where building continues frantically in half a dozen locations in the heart of the Arab part of the city .
And , besides , the suspension will last only for 10 months .
Then , Begin promised , construction will be resumed in full swing .
That would not have appeased the settlers , if they did not know what every Israeli knows : that it is all phony .
Building will continue everywhere , with the officials cooperating on the quiet and the army closing its eyes .
It will be claimed that building permits had already been issued , that the foundations had already been laid .
( In many places extra foundations have indeed been laid , just in case . )
That ’s the way it was in the past , under the governments of Labor and Kadima , and that ’s the way it will continue now .
This week it became known that in the whole of the West Bank , just 14 ( fourteen ! ) government inspectors are supervising all building activity .
In the same TV program , Yossi Beilin was sitting next to Begin .
It might have been expected that he at least would expose the fraud , but no .
Beilin lauded Netanyahu for his brave act and saw in it a promising new beginning .
This way he rendered important assistance in winning over world public opinion and setting the mind of Israeli innocents at rest .
It would be difficult to imagine a sadder example of the collapse of the “ Zionist Left ” .
The Geneva Initiative has turned into the Jerusalem Deception .
The largest opposition party , too , joined the chorus .
Tzipi Livni , who bears the impressive official title of “ Leader of the Opposition ” , mumbled something unintelligible and went back to sleep .
AND OBAMA ?
He capitulated again .
After giving up his original demand for a total freeze of building in the settlements , he had no choice but to give in again .
He reacted to Netanyahu ’s shabby performance as if it were high drama .
Obama is in need of an achievement .
It is being said that he has not achieved a single objective in the international arena .
So here is an achievement .
Netanyahu is freezing – sorry , restraining – sorry , suspending - settlement activity .
My father taught me in my youth that one must never give in to a blackmailer .
After giving in once , one is condemned to giving in again and again , while the demands of the blackmailer grow and grow .
After giving in to the pro-Israel lobby once , Obama will have to give in again and again .
One could almost pity him and his assistants .
Such an impressive , such a tough , such an experienced group – and they are returning from Jerusalem like Napoleon ’s army from Moscow .
We saw poor George Mitchell .
The man who brokered peace between the murderous factions in Ireland came to Jerusalem .
Came again and again and again .
Came as the representative of the world ’s one remaining superpower to tell Israelis and Palestinians what they have to do .
He was tough .
He dictated terms .
Israeli officials laughed at him behind his back .
They are used to the likes of him .
They have eaten them for breakfast .
Remember William Rogers , Nixon ’s Secretary of State and his peace plan ?
And the great Henry Kissinger ?
And even James Baker , who tried to impose economic sanctions on us ?
And Bill Clinton ’s “ Guidelines ” ?
And the “ vision ” of George Bush ?
The political graveyard is full of American politicians who tried to impose limits on Israel , without being able or willing to use the necessary force .
Welcome , George .
Nice to see you , Hillary .
What is so pathetic is that Netanyahu is not even deceiving Obama .
The American president knows full well that this is all play acting .
He is very intelligent .
He is not very courageous .
For the mess of pottage of a pretended achievement he has sold his political birthright .
Even George Bush managed to extract from Ariel Sharon an undertaking to dismantle all settlements set up after March 2001 ( needless to say , not a single one was dismantled ) .
This is a great victory for Netanyahu , his second over Obama .
Not yet the decisive victory , but a victory that bodes ill for the chances of peace in the near future .
NETANYAHU DID NOT even try to deceive the Palestinians either .
He knew that this is impossible .
Every Palestinian understands Netanyahu ’s announcement only too well .
He has only to look out of his window to see what is happening .
After all , Israel would not invest billions in new building if it had any intention of dismantling the settlements for peace within a year or two .
There is hardly a place in the West Bank where one cannot see a settlement on a hilltop , near or far .
In some places , one can see two or three .
If one approaches closer , one can see the building activity in full swing , the overt and the covert , the “ legal ” and the “ illegal ” .
And , most importantly : there is no Palestinian leader who could possibly agree to the continued building in East Jerusalem .
The construction of Jewish housing projects goes on while Palestinian homes are being destroyed , “ archeological ” digs continue as well as all the other activities designed to “ judaize ” Jerusalem .
To put it more bluntly : making Jerusalem “ Arab - free ” .
When Obama capitulates to Netanyahu , there is nothing Mahmoud Abbas can do .
When the Americans demand that the Palestinians answer Netanyahu ’s “ important ” step with an important step of their own , it is nothing but a sad joke .
The Americans help Netanyahu to put the ball into the Palestinian court , and with a pious rolling of their eyes ask why , after such a momentous Israeli gesture , the Palestinian do not agree to resuming the “ peace process ” .
But Abbas cannot start negotiations without a total freeze of the settlements , especially in Jerusalem .
The only dialog between Israelis and Palestinians that is taking place now is with Hamas .
The prisoner exchange deal is nearing the point of decision .
The main remaining bone of contention is the freeing of the Fatah leader , Marwan Barghouti , who was sentenced to five life terms .
If the deal is clinched and Barghouti freed , it will be another humiliation for Abbas : it will be said that Hamas , not he , has achieved the liberation of the Fatah leader .
The freed Barghouti will act to mend the split between Fatah and Hamas and will be a credible candidate for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority .
Then , a new chapter of the conflict will begin .
IT IS worth reading the full text of Isaiah ’s prophecy : “ The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb , and the leopard shall lie down with the kid , and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together , and a little child shall lead them . ”
The role of the little child , so it seems , falls to Obama .
If he accepts , God forbid , Friedman ’s advice and leaves the picture , the vision will turn into a nightmare .
The Israeli government will increase the oppression , the Palestinians will turn to unbridled terrorism , the entire world will be dragged into bloody chaos .
Some advice .
Report Failure to Yield : Evaluating the Performance of Genetically Engineered Crops reveals North America ’s use of genetically engineered crops has promoted increased use of pesticides , an epidemic of herbicide - resistant weeds and more chemical residues in foods .
Despite the biotechnology ’s loud and well advertised claims they are the only hope for feeding the world and protect the environment .
Despite 20 years of research and 13 years of commercialization , genetic engineering has failed to significantly increase U.S. crop yields .
[ Originally released April 2009 I did not get a chance to write about it then . ]
It reviewed two dozen academic studies and is the first report to closely evaluate the overall effect genetic engineering has had on crop yields in relation to other agricultural technologies .
The report was released by nonprofits The Organic Center ( TOC ) , the Union for Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) and the Center for Food Safety ( CFS

For nearly six years , I have served on the Board of Trustees of the California State University system -- the last two as its chairman .
This experience has been more than just professional ; it has been a deeply personal one .
With my term ending soon , I need to share my concern -- and personal pain -- that California is on the verge of destroying the very system that once made this state great .
I came to California because of the education system .
I grew up in Connecticut and attended college back East on partial scholarships and financial aid .
I also worked part time , but by my first year of grad school , I ’d maxed out my financial aid and was relying on loans that charged 14 % interest .
Being a lawyer had been my dream , but my wife and I could not afford for me to go to any law schools back East .
I applied to UC Berkeley Law School because it was the only top law school in the U.S. that we could afford .
It turned out to be the greatest education I have ever received .
And I got it because the people of California -- its leaders and its taxpayers -- were willing to invest in me .
For the last 20 years , since I graduated , I have felt a duty to pay back the people of this state .
When I had to figure out where to build a practice , buy a home , raise my family and volunteer my time and energy , I chose California .
I joined a small California firm -- Munger , Tolles & Olson -- and eventually became a partner .
This year , American Lawyer magazine named us the No. 1 firm in the nation .

That success is also California ’s success .
It has meant millions of dollars in taxes paid to California , hundreds of thousands of hours of volunteer time donated to California , houses built and investments made in California , and hundreds of talented people attracted to work in and help California .
My story is not unique .
It is the story of California ’s rise from the 1960s to the 1990s .
Millions of people stayed here and succeeded because of their California education .
We benefited from the foresight of an earlier generation that recognized it had a duty to pay it forward .
That was the bargain California made with us when it established the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 .
By making California the state where every qualified and committed person can receive a low - cost and high - quality education , all of us benefit .
Attracting and retaining the leaders of the future helps the state grow bigger and stronger .
Economists found that for every dollar the state invests in a CSU student , it receives $ 4.41 in return .
So as someone who has lived the California dream , there is nothing more painful to me than to see this dream dying .
It is being starved to death by a public that thinks any government service -- even public education -- is not worth paying for .
And by political leaders who do not lead but instead give in to our worst , shortsighted instincts .
Advertisement
The ineffective response to the current financial crisis reflects trends that have been hurting California public education for years .
To win votes , political leaders mandated long prison sentences that forced us to stop building schools and start building prisons .
This has made us dumber but no safer .
Leaders pandered by promising tax cuts no matter what and did not worry about how to provide basic services without that money .
Those tax cuts did not make us richer ; they ’ve made us poorer .
To remain in office , they carved out legislative districts that ensured we would have few competitive races and leaders with no ability or incentive to compromise .
Rather than strengthening the parties , it pushed both parties to the fringes and weakened them .
When the economy was good , our leaders failed to make hard choices and then faced disasters like the energy crisis .
When the economy turned bad , they made no choices until the economy was worse .
In response to failures of leadership , voters came up with one cure after another that was worse than the disease -- whether it has been over - reliance on initiatives driven by special interests , or term limits that remove qualified people from office , or any of the other ways we have come up with to avoid representative democracy .
As a result , for the last two decades we have been starving higher education .
California ’s public universities and community colleges have half as much to spend today as they did in 1990 in real dollars .
In the 1980s , 17 % of the state budget went to higher education and 3 % went to prisons .
Today , only 9 % goes to universities and 10 % goes to prisons .

The promise of low - cost education that brought so many here , and kept so many here , has been abandoned .
Our K - 12 system has fallen from the top ranks 30 years ago to 47th in the nation in per-pupil spending .
And higher education is now taking on water .
At every trustees meeting over the last six years , I have seen the signs of decline .
I have listened to the painful stories of faculty who could not afford to raise a family on their salaries ; of students who are on the financial edge because they are working two jobs , taking care of a child and barely making it with our current tuitions .
I have seen the outdated buildings and the many people on our campuses who feel that they have been forgotten by the public and Sacramento .
What made California great was the belief that we could solve any problem as long as we did two things : acknowledged the problem and worked together .
Today that belief is missing .
California has not acknowledged that it has fundamentally abandoned the promise of the Master Plan for Higher Education .
And Californians have lost the commitment to invest in one another .
That is why we have lost our way in decision after decision .
Today , everyone in our system is making terrible sacrifices .
Employee furloughs , student fee increases and campus - based cuts in service and programs are repulsive to all of us .
Most important , it is unfair .
The cost of education should be shared by all of us because the education of our students benefits every Californian .

We ’ve gone from investing in the future to borrowing from it .
Every time programs and services are cut for short - term gain , it is a long - term loss .
The solution is simple , but hard .
It is what I ’m doing now .
Tell what is happening to every person who can hear it .
Beat this drum until it ca n’t be ignored .
Shame your neighbors who think the government needs to be starved and who are happy to see Sacramento paralyzed .
We have to wake up this state and get it to rediscover its greatness .
Because if we do n’t , we will be the generation that let the promise for a great California die .
Jennings becomes youngest NBA player to score 50 points ( Video )
Records are made to be broken .
Brandon Jennings averaged five points a game in Italy last year , but on Saturday the Milwaukee Bucks rookie set an NBA record as the youngest player to break the 50 - point threshold , scoring 55 points against the Golden State Warriors .
The 20 - year - old point guard notched 29 points in the third quarter , then 16 in the fourth to become only the third Bucks player to score more than 50 .
Jennings was three points away from Wilt Chamberlain ‘s NBA rookie record for points in a game .

The support by Nobel laureates -- Jody Williams , Shirin Ebadi , Mairead Corrigan Maguire , Desmond Tutu , Rogoberta Menchu Tum , Adolfo Perez Equivel , Betty Williams and Wangari Maatai -- was contained in a signed letter handed over to the Tibetan temporal head .
It was handed over by Mairead Magquire , Jody Williams and Shirin Ebadi at a ceremony here , sources in the Tibetan government - in - exile here said .
They also asked the Chinese government to implement laws that are enshrined in their constitution for a legitimate and meaningful autonomy for all Tibetans , the sources added .
" For 50 years , the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people have waged a peaceful struggle to preserve their ancient culture , religion , language and identity .
" As the issue of Tibet remains tragically unresolved and Tibetans continue to endure repressive conditions in Tibet , we wish to express our concern and support Dalai Lama for his non-violent efforts to achieve autonomy for Tibetan people , " they said in statement .
They urged the Chinese government to " take immediate and constructive steps to resolve the status of Tibet and end oppressive policies that continue to marginalise and impoverish Tibetans in their own land , " they said .

THE idea that Earth was entirely frozen over about 700 million years ago – the so - called Snowball Earth hypothesis – poses one small problem : how did our planet thaw out ?
The conundrum could be explained if the Earth was more mudball than snowball .
Evidence for Snowball Earth comes from the discovery of glacial rock formations around the world that date back to this time .
One proposed explanation for the subsequent thawing is that carbon dioxide levels soared during the freeze , warming the planet .
But recent studies of oxygen isotopes suggest that the level of …

A second adviser to the government has resigned in protest at Home Secretary Alan Johnson 's sacking of his chief drugs adviser , Prof David Nutt .
Marion Walker 's departure from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) followed the earlier resignation of Dr Les King .
Dr King said he would like to see the ACMD become an independent body , free from the government 's influence .
Mr Johnson said Prof Nutt was sacked for " crossing a line " into politics .
On Sunday , Prof Nutt revealed Ms Walker , ACMD member from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society , had stepped down .
However , she could not be reached for comment .
I 'm not going to say just how many I think might resign but there is an extremely angry feeling among most council members
Dr Les King Ms Walker is clinical director of Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 's substance misuse service .
Prof Nutt said her departure " means we have no - one now looking at that vast group of people who prescribe drugs and advise people about drugs , drug harms from the over - the - counter and prescription side " .
The BBC understands that several other members of the ACMD , who are unpaid for their work on the council , are considering their positions , in response to Prof Nutt 's dismissal .
Prof Nutt was sacked after calling cannabis less harmful than alcohol and tobacco , and saying it was upgraded to Class B for political reasons .
' Angry feeling '
The reclassification had been " on the whim of the prime minister " , he claimed .
HAVE YOUR SAY Scientific advisers should advise ; ministers should then make decisions based on that advice ...
This sorry lot can't even get that right Steve , Fordingbridge , UK There was " very strong feeling " among the council 's members over Prof Nutt 's sacking , Dr King said .
" I 'm not going to say just how many I think might resign but there is an extremely angry feeling among most council members .
" Amongst the scientists , I think a number will resign .
It does n't need the whole council to resign for the thing to stop working . "
He also said the ACMD should become independent " just as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence is separate from government and is free to make decisions , free of political interference , just as ... the Bank of England is free to make decisions on interest rates .
" That 's what we need I think , because the classification of drugs is about drug harm .
It does n't need to be politicised in the way that it is . "
Dr King was appointed on 3 April 2008 and wrote a book on the Misuse of Drugs Act in 2003 .
He was previously head of the Drugs Intelligence Unit in the Forensic Science Service .
DEPARTING ADVISERS
Prof David Nutt - chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs Dr Les King - part - time advisor to the Department of Health , senior chemist on ACMD Marion Walker - clinical director of Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 's substance misuse service , Royal Pharmaceutical Society 's representative on ACMD
Send us your comments Prof Nutt has told the BBC that the council 's position is " untenable " .
He said : " I think the position of scientists on the council 's untenable , because I cannot see how Alan Johnson , given what he 's just said , which clearly indicates he does n't understand how scientists think , how scientists on council could continue to work with him . "
Confirming Dr King 's resignation , the Home Office said in a statement : " We 're not going to give a running commentary on the speculation around further resignations .
We will not be commenting further . "
Speaking to Sky News on Sunday , Mr Johnson said he thought his ex-chief drugs adviser was " wrong " on cannabis - but sacked him for " crossing a line " into politics .
" What you cannot have is a chief adviser at the same time stepping into the political field and campaigning against government decisions .
You can do one or the other .
You can't do both . "
Mr Johnson said that Prof Nutt had " crossed the line between offering advice and then campaigning against the government on political decisions " .

But Labour peer Lord Robert Winston told BBC Radio 4's
The World This Weekend he was " very surprised and disappointed " by Mr Johnson 's actions .
He warned that the government would be ignored if it gave advice to the public that did not take account of scientists ' opinions and said Prof Nutt had made a " very reasonable " point about the relative dangers of illegal and legal drugs .
Lord Winston , professor of science and society at Imperial College London , said : " I think that if governments appoint expert advice they should n't dismiss it so lightly .
I think it shows a rather poor understanding of the value of science . "
Dr Evan Harris MP , Liberal Democrat science spokesman , said : " I fear there will be many more resignations unless the government acts to restore confidence among its independent scientific advisers , upon which it relies for advice on matters from nuclear safety to childhood vaccination . "

It played like a scene from a holiday movie -- a mystery couple , who did n’t leave their names or numbers , walked into a restaurant , finished their meal and then set - off a chain reaction of generosity that lasted for hours .
That ’s just what employees at the Aramingo Diner in Port Richmond said a man and a woman did during their breakfast shift last Saturday morning .
“ It was magical .
I had tears in my eyes because it never happened before .
I ’ve been here for 10 years and I ’ve never seen anything like that , ” said Lynn Willard , a waitress .
Willard and other waitresses told NBC Philadelphia that the couple started the chain reaction by paying double : for their own meal and for the tab of another table of diners at the restaurant .
There 's no evidence that one group of diners knew the others .
“ I could not believe it … and it continued and continued , it was very nice , ” said Willard .
“ They asked us not to say anything until they left , but we said ‘ Merry Christmas , that person picked up your tab . ’ ”
For the next five hours , dozens of patrons got into that same holiday spirit and paid the favor forward .
The diner ’s manager said not one person was concerned about price of the check -- which averaged between $ 12 -$ 30 .
“ It was a surprise to all of us , the girls were even taken aback , ” said Linda .
“ Those who took the check also tipped the waitress .
So nobody had to do anything other than pass it on and that ’s what they did .
They just passed it forward . ”
It ’s a true holiday story that proves how a small gesture of kindness can create some magic .
With his hair half - braided - and half in a huge bushy afro - Marcus T. Bailey could easily win an award for worst hair day of all time .
The 25 - year - old had been halfway through a visit to the barbershop when he stepped outside allegedly to sell crack cocaine to two addicts .
What he did n't know was that police were waiting for him and promptly hauled him off .
Caught mid-haircut : Bailey 's mugshot shows off his extraordinary hairstyle
The result was this extraordinary mugshot which shows off his unconventional hairstyle in all its glory .
Bailey teamed his new look with a rather sulky pout .
Police say they recovered about 21 grams of cocaine from his car in Evansville , Indiana .
The daughter of traveling performers , Ms. White has been performing in musicals since she was 8 , and the language of the medium infects her life narrative .
She started out as a “ hoofer , ” a tap - dancer .
She has a theme song : “ Nobody Knows You When You ’re Down and Out . ”
And as of July 2008 , she felt she was “ all washed up . ”

Between gigs on Broadway and singing with Liza Minnelli , Ms. White had always worked for tips in piano bars around the West Village .
She was a regular at 88 ’s until it closed , then found a new home at Rose ’s Turn on Grove Street  until it , too , closed .
She struggled to get a perch at the few surviving piano bars around town .
Heartfelt if campy renditions of American songbook classics were out .
Spoofy if campy versions of ’ 80s pop were in .
“ They want to bring in the younger crowd , ” Ms. White said .
“ And I ’m old . ”
She still played one night a week at the Duplex , on Christopher Street , earning enough to keep her phone on and get by on Ramen noodles , and kept some clothing there after losing her apartment .
In the park , Ms. White slept on a bench near the bathroom because it made her feel more civilized .
She knew some of the longstanding homeless there from her years in the neighborhood ( they often tried to bum cigarettes as she smoked on the sidewalk ) .
And she got to know the temporarily homeless like herself .
“ Their clothes did not look like they were from Goodwill , ” she said .
“ They looked like they ’d had jobs . ”
Ms .
White never mentioned to the others who slept in the park that she had performed alongside Glenn Close in the Tony - nominated “ Barnum , ” in 1980 ; nor did she ask about their pasts .
Severely depressed , she was too proud to reach out to social services , and kept the extent of her problems from friends .
“ Most of them are barely getting by in their tiny apartments as it is , ” she said .
“ People in New York , they need their patterns .
You ca n’t interrupt them . ”
Weed stays in you hair for 60 days once you have smoked if you are an infrequent smoker ( about once every 2 weeks ) .
If you are a frequent smoker ( every day to every other day ) , at the time you stop smoking it , it will take 90 days .
This method is effective once you use the correct ingredients and apply them the correct way .
Another name for the method is the macujo .
Nexus Aloe Rid shampoo
These are the instrument you need for this kind of test .
First , it is important that you protect your eyes so that these chemicals do not find their ways to your eyes .
To get ready , you must first wet your hairs and you do that using warm water .
Then you have to apply the vinegar , which you have to massage with your hair .
Furthermore , massage it with salicylic acid .
Ensure that this enters your hairs very well because this is the only way it can remove the drug particles in the hairs .
You must note however that it can lead to a burning sensation .
You should be aware of this before you start that test .
Furthermore , wipe that excess shampoo on the ears and other parts of your body such as the forehead and so on .
Allow for forty - five minutes , after which you can now rinse your head with water .
Use warm water to rinse the hairs .
Furthermore , continue to wash and to rinse your hairs using Nexus Aloe Rid shampoo .
This is the best hair follicle detox shampoo on the market .
If there are , remnants of the drugs on your hairs the last applications will remove them from your hairs .
Furthermore , you can add more detergent and clean it thoroughly until you have completely washed everything out of the hairs .
If you have , enough time before the test is conducted then you can repeat this process once in every ten days .
This method can be very effective but you should know that you should desist from using drugs once you are undergoing this cleaning process .
This is very important otherwise ; the whole efforts will be in vain .
This is reliable and it has the highest success rate once you do that the correct way .
Another good thing with this method is that it is healthier than other methods such as bleaching the hair .
Other methods can be associated with health - threatening conditions .
Shave your hair
The second method that can work for you is to completely shave your hair before the test time .
It is not often the best because it can be counterproductive .
There is no way you can come for such a test without your hairs .
It will indeed call for suspicion and you will not be better off that way .
Scientists in Washington , D.C. are reporting laboratory evidence supporting the possibility that some of Earth 's oil and natural gas may have formed in a way much different than the traditional process described in science textbooks .
Their study is scheduled for Nov. / Dec. issue of ACS ' Energy & Fuels , a bi-monthly publication .
Anurag Sharma and colleagues note that the traditional process involves biology : Prehistoric plants died and changed into oil and gas while sandwiched between layers of rock in the hot , high - pressure environment deep below Earth 's surface .
Some scientists , however , believe that oil and gas originated in other ways , including chemical reactions between carbon dioxide and hydrogen below Earth ' surface .
The new study describes a test of that idea , which dates to at least 1877 and famous Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeelev .
They combined ingredients for this so - called abiotic synthesis of methane , the main ingredient in natural gas , in a diamond - anvil cell and monitored in - situ the progress of the reaction .
The diamond anvils can generate high pressures and temperatures similar to those that occur deep below Earth 's surface and allow for in - situ optical spectroscopy at the extreme environments .
The results " strongly suggest " that some methane could form strictly from chemical reactions in a variety of chemical environments .
This study further highlights the role of reaction pathways and fluid immiscibility in the extent of hydrocarbon formation at extreme conditions simulating deep subsurface .

Drinking epidemic ' fuels surge in cancer '
Round - the - clock drinking and cut - price alcohol are to blame for an ' appalling ' rise in cancers , experts warned today .
Cases of cancer of the mouth have gone up by half in the past decade , with a 43 per cent rise in liver tumours .
There have also been big rises in breast and colorectal cancer .
Many experts are blaming alcohol consumption , which has doubled in the UK since the 1950s and has been fuelled by Labour 's decision to relax licensing laws .
Alcohol link : A study has blamed Britain 's drinking culture for an increase in the number of cases of cancer being diagnosed
They are calling for tougher measures to crack down on 2 for 1 offers and price - cutting by supermarkets , as well as the current 24 - hour drinking culture .
The latest official figures , obtained from parliamentary questions by the Liberal Democrats , show almost 5,000 in England are diagnosed each year with oral cancers - a 53 per cent increase on 3,225 cases in 1997 .
There was a 20 per cent jump in cancer of the gullet ( oesophagus ) from 5,397 to 6,487 .
Both types of cancer are linked to heavy drinking , with a fourfold rise in risk for men consuming more than seven drinks a day and women having five drinks or more a day .
Liver cancer cases went up over the same period from 1,925 to 2,754 - with this cancer two and half times more likely to affect heavy drinkers compared with people who do not drink .
Female breast cancer cases rose 33 per cent from 28,618 to 38,048 .
Heavy drinkers run a 60 per cent extra chance of developing the disease .
Colorectal cancer increased by 14 per cent from almost 27,000 cases to 30,727 , with heavy drinking responsible for a 50 per cent rise in risk .
Only cancer of the larynx registered a reduction of 8 per cent over the period , down from 1,871 to 1,714 .
' Problems escalating ' : Lib Dem MP
Don
Foster says it 's time to address problems caused by alcohol
Smoking and alcohol are the two main risk factors for oral cancers , which kill around 1,800 a year .
Other contributing factors may be a diet lacking in fruit and vegetables and the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus , which can also cause cervical cancer .
The figures follow Cancer Research UK data earlier this year which showed an alarming rise of a quarter in oral cancer rates among men and women in their 40s .
Liberal Democrat spokesman Don Foster , said : ' Excessive drinking has been on the rise for years , and these shocking figures show how dramatically the health problems of booze Britain are escalating .
Ministers cannot turn a blind eye to the terrible problems alcohol is causing .
' The Government 's failure to cut alcohol consumption now is storing up problems for later .
The appalling rise of alcohol - related health problems will only continue unless we crack down on reckless retailers and irresponsible drink offers . '
Recent research by Dr John Foster of Greenwich University , for the Alcohol Education and Research Council , found drinking at home is now routine behaviour for millions .
He said : ' Supermarkets are " normalising " the purchase of a drug for adults that over time is likely to have major health costs , including rising cancer rates .
' Two - for - one offers and discounted bulk buys should be banned . '
Alcohol Concern chief executive Don Shenker said : ' Many people are not aware of the connection between alcohol and cancer yet it can be a major contributor or cause of the disease . '
Stephanie Gilmore 's stunning dominance of women 's surfing has continued with a third straight world title in Hawaii , but the Gold Coaster claimed emulating the deeds of tour legend Layne Beachley were not in her thoughts .
Gilmore finished third in the final of the Gidget Pro event at Sunset Beach , but it was enough to see her clinch the 2009 title with one event to go next month .
The 21 - year - old has been the standout performer on the women 's tour since storming away with the world title during her rookie season in 2007 , winning 10 of the 22 events she has competed in since becoming a full - time tour member .
Her run has her on track to match Beachley , whose seven world titles remain the benchmark for women 's surfing , but Gilmore said she was more driven by current rivals .
" That sort of record is n't really what I 'm aiming at - I 'm just trying to keep up with the rookies , " Gilmore said .
" I 'm not trying to chase the record , I 'm all about surfing well in events and getting good waves . "
The 21 - year - old had the crown sewn up before the four - woman final - which was won by local trials winner Carissa Moore - when her last remaining challenger Coco Ho failed to progress past the semi-finals .
" I had no idea what was going on , " said Gilmore , who was in the viewing tower as Ho bombed out .
" I was n't following the second semi-final at all and I did n't know anything about the world title possibilities because I had n't checked them out .
" All of a sudden all these cameras were around me and everyone started doing the countdown and I was like ' what 's going on ' .
" Three in a row , it 's just amazing .
The first one was just relief and the second was really satisfying and this one , it 's just so hard to comprehend what 's actually going on . "
Gilmore will now head to the final event at Honolua Bay , beginning December 8 , with the pressure off .
There is however the small matter of the triple crown title , awarded to the best performing surfer in the three Hawaiian events , regardless of world tour status .
Gilmore trails Hawaiian Alana Blanchard in the triple crown ratings , though neither was any match for Moore in the Gidget Pro final .
Moore , 17 and qualified for the tour full - time in 2010 , won with a two - wave score of 14.24 points from Australian youngster Sally Fitzgibbons ( 13.07 ) , Gilmore ( 12.17 ) and Blanchard ( 11.17 ) .
There is little doubt Gilmore 's focus was a little wayward following her title confirmation .
" It really took the weight off my shoulders heading into the final , but I think I was a little too relaxed , " Gilmore said .
" The girls out there thought I was crazy , I was smiling and laughing and was n't really concentrating . "
Fitzgibbons ' best result of the year pushed her up to fifth on the tour ratings and she posted the event 's only 10 - point ride and highest heat score of 17.17 in winning her semi-final .
" I was really happy to get that wave , " Fitzgibbons said of the ever - shifting conditions at Sunset .
" It was tricky .
There were not that many waves in that heat . "

Historic novel set in Rome ( an account of life in everyday 115 AD )
On a recent trip to Rome I decided to take “ A Day in the Life of Ancient Rome ” by Alberto Angela .
The author ’s objective is to “ make the ruins of ancient Rome live again through an account of everyday life … ”
In other words , what might it have felt like to walk down the ancient streets , what did the average Roman hear , see and smell ?
We are taken back to 115 AD ( the author prefers to use the terms BCE – Before the Common Era which
Historic novel set in Rome ( an account of life in everyday 115 AD ) On a recent trip to Rome I decided to take “ A Day in the Life of Ancient Rome ” by Alberto Angela .
The author ’s objective is to “ make the ruins of ancient Rome live again through an account of everyday life … ”
In other words , what might it have felt like to walk down the ancient streets , what did the average Roman hear , see and smell ?
We are taken back to 115 AD ( the author prefers to use the terms BCE – Before the Common Era which equates to BC , and Common Era CE , which equates to AD , thus removing himself from the notional eras governed by the Christian calendar ) .
Trajan is the Emperor at the helm .
We start early in the morning and progress through the day , visiting the forum , enjoying the baths , and exploring the various dwellings – the domus of a typical rich Roman , and the Insulae ( the skyscrapers of Rome ) .
Technically , an apartment building was only to rise to 6 floors but often was expanded by further floors causing tremendous instability .
The kitchen of a typical home consisted of a brazier , and with the innumerable oil lamps , fires were hugely common – in a total reversal of today ’s culture , the poorer the people , the higher they lived ( escape at times of crisis from the upper echelons was nigh impossible ) .
Thus , the more wealthy Romans lived nearer the ground so that escape was easier .
But here the views were n’t great and the smells from the streets rather pungent .
Angela equates the feel of ancient Rome with the bustle of , say , a typical Indian city – colour , buzz , poverty , and incredibly pungent smells would all have been redolent in this ancient city .
He looks at the games in the Colosseum – the travertine marble would have given the construction a real glow , so different to the skeleton we see today .
The types of games , the animals , the gladiators are all brought to life through his eloquent prose .
Food was a hugely important feature of culture – whether door mice ( who had their own terracotta exercise pots ) , stuffed pig ’s teats , honey , pine nuts and so much more , but at this point , the Romans would have to wait another 1400 years to experience tomatoes and potatoes , part of todays staple diet .
And collecting urine was a daily event – apparently it was used to wash laundry and clean teeth ..
Sex , too , is something to savour , a gift from the goddess Venus , though there were strict codes that had be observed , who could sleep with whom … .
Slavery of course was at the heart of ancient Rome – some of the slaves did ok but the majority had a very , very hard life that one just cannot compute from today ’s Western perspective .
So , as I visited the recently discovered Domus at the Palazzo Valentini I had the words of Angela ringing in my ears .
It too is a domus that existed at the time of Trajan and , in fact , Trajan ’s column ( situated nearby ) plays its part in the whole experience .
Palazzo Valentini is subterranean excavation , located in modern day beneath a palatial Renaissance building , a visitor experience that comes to life through a unique , multi-media visit .
The voices of Angela ’s people on the streets under my own feet , the smells , and the sounds all reverberated as I viewed the mosaics and the frescoes and what remains of the building structure .
A fabulous book to take on a visit to this wonderful city .

Malcolm Turnbull and Joe Hockey share a moment during question time yesterday Credit : Stefan Postles ______
Until now , Mr Hockey had been a staunch supporter of Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull and the position he has taken towards supporting Labor 's amended ETS .
But this morning , Mr Hockey tweeted the following : " Hey team re The ETS .
Give me your views please on the policy and political debate .
I really want your feedback . "
Sources close to Mr Hockey say this was a deliberate hint by the shadow treasurer that he was prepared to change his view and accommodate the anti-ETS conservatives .
Joe Hockey ... let his intentions be known over Twitter .

Under a plan being hatched by powerbroker Nick Minchin , Tony Abbott will step aside as a challenger to Mr Turnbull and Mr Hockey will become the consensus leadership candidate with Peter Dutton as his deputy .
Mr Hockey was keeping out of the spotlight today .
A group of 10 Liberals , led by Mr Abbott , wrote to the party ’s chief whip today requesting a meeting of the Parliamentary Liberal Party at 9 am on Monday .
The letter says they want the meeting ‘‘ in order to move a motion that the position of leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party be declared vacant . ’’
In addition to Mr Abbott the letter was signed by most of the former Liberal frontbenchers who resigned their positions on Wednesday and Thursday in protest at Mr Turnbull ’s decision to press ahead with a deal with the Federal Government to pass its emissions trading legislation .
The signatories were : Victorian MHRs Tony Smith and Sophie Mirabella ; Victorian Senator Mitch Fifield ; Queensland MHR Michael Johnson ; Queensland Senator Brett Mason ; South Australian Senator Cory Bernardi ; Western Australian Senator Mathias Cormann and Judith Adams ; and Tasmanian Senator David Bushby .
Exhibiting his trade mark game show host smile , Mr Turnbull declared that he was ‘‘ completely relaxed ’ ’ as he strode from his electorate office on New South Head Road shortly after midday .
‘‘ I am perfectly comfortable with my position , ’’ he said .
But he conceded that ‘‘ party unity is a valuable thing ’’ .
Beating a hasty retreat Mr Turnbull proceeded to jump the taxi queue in front of Edgecliff shopping centre , drawing a stream of abuse from a woman who had been waiting .
‘‘ God I hate Turnbull .
He ’s such a bully , ’’ said the woman who refused to be named .
Concetta Fierravanti-Wells , the shadow immigration parliamentary secretary , became the latest Liberal to desert Mr Turnbull 's front bench .
Concetta Fierravanti-Wells , the shadow immigration parliamentary secretary , became the latest Liberal to desert Mr Turnbull 's front bench .
In a statement , she said she had tendered her resignation , making her the 13th Liberal in the past three days to quit in protest at the party 's position on an emissions trading scheme .
Senator Fierravanti-Wells had been expected to back the ETS laws but has now indicated she will vote against the bill .
" I acknowledge the avalanche of correspondence and feedback conveyed to me from a wide cross-section of the community , most especially after the decision of the joint party room to amend and support the legislation , " she said .
Senator Fierravanti-Wells , who is facing a Senate preselection ballot on December 12 , indicated she was heeding the view of the NSW Liberal base of the party , which was strongly against the ETS decision .
Independent Senator Nick Xenophon said Mr Turnbull reminded him of the Monty Python character the black knight , who has lost both arms , both legs and has blood spurting everywhere .
" And he says it 's just a flesh wound .
That 's what he reminds me of , " he told reporters .
Senator Xenophon said he supported getting the questions asked on the ETS bills .
" We 've still got a long way to go .
I do n't think anybody can accuse me of filibustering .
" I just want to get down to the business , ask relevant questions , but there are literally hundreds of questions that must be asked and answered in relation to the scheme before we can vote on it . "
Greens Senator Christine Milne said it was very hard to tell if a vote on the amendments would occur by 3.45 pm .
" There was a filibuster on last night and it looks as if the Liberal Party ... will keep the filibuster going if last night is any indication , " she told reporters .
Asked if it was a realistic time frame , Senator Milne said , " The amendments have not been debated and I have no intention of not debating my amendments . "
Her party 's leader , Bob Brown , said the far right of the Liberal Party and the Nationals were holding the Senate to ransom on the ETS debate .
" If you have a listen to that debate , like the climate , it 's hot air , " he said .
Senator Brown said never had such a " schism " occurred between the major parties before on the environment .
" And you 'll never see the Coalition recover from it . "
But Mr Turnbull is n’t willing to step down - if the party wants him gone they ’ll have to remove him from the top job .
A key supporter told AAP Mr Turnbull was ‘‘ determined to press on ’’ .
If they want to get rid of him , the opposition leader believes they should ‘ ‘ roll him ’ ’ .
The source said Mr Turnbull ‘‘ did n’t care about the numbers ’’ , when asked if the Liberal leader had adequate support to stave off an expected challenge on Monday .
There is a growing view within shadow cabinet that Mr Turnbull ’s leadership is untenable but they want a seamless transition to another candidate .
‘‘ Malcolm has been sufficiently damaged , ’’ one member of shadow cabinet said .
‘‘ There is a growing consensus in shadow cabinet that it ’s untenable . ’’
A number of media organisations were reporting that Liberal deputy Julie Bishop had urged Mr Turnbull to step aside today but her spokesman later confirmed that was not the case .
Gillard disappointed Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard has urged the Liberals to stick by their agreement to pass the emissions trading scheme when the parliament resumes on Monday .
Ms Gillard said the government was deeply disappointed that the Liberal Party had failed to honour its deal to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme ( CPRS ) by 3.45 pm ( AEDT ) today .
But she said that agreement would remain on the table for next week when both houses will sit .
Punters are throwing their money behind Joe Hockey to lead the coalition .
The odds for Mr Hockey have shortened to just $ 1.80 , while odds for Tony Abbott shortened to $ 2.75 , according to bookie Sportingbet Australia .
Mr Turnbull ’s odds have sagged to $ 3.50 , ‘ ‘a devastating judgment by punters that is sure to compound his current woes , ’’ Sportingbet Australia CEO Michael Sullivan said .
‘‘ Over the last six months , Hockey has been paying upwards of $ 3 for most of the time as he has not been keen to make a grab at the leadership , ’’ Mr Sullivan said .
‘‘ Now punters are getting behind him as it seems that Turnbull ’s day is done . ’’

Other leadership contenders in the Sportingbet Australia market are Andrew Robb at odds of $ 17 , and Peter Dutton and Julie Bishop both at $ 21 and behind ‘‘ any other ’ ’ at $ 7 .
Talking crap and pissin ' folks off .
These are a few of my favorite things - in a good way , of course !
Not a type " A " win - at - all - cost jag - off like the folks you want to punch right square in the face at a sporting event .
For me it's to bring out the competitive spirit and comradeship between friends .
This is most likely why I am drawn to fishing so much .
Challenging each other , to see who gets to take the walk of glory vs. the walk of shame back to the truck , is always a good time .
So here I am on a conference call with a few of the Dudes in my hacking circle and we are all laying it down thick and heavy to each other , playing " Can you top this ? "
So of course a challenge ensued : " Break up into teams of two and see how many servers ( of each other 's ) we can compromise . "
Sounds fair and fun right ?
Oh no , not for me , ' cause , you see , I am an idiot .
I just have to push it just a bit more .
So I say , " If you can break into my server and capture my flag , I will send you out a Wisconsin Kringle from O&H Bakery and I will wear a dress on the next episode of TechWiseTV . "
Yeah , that 's right .
I am moron .
I went about config'ing and hardening up my server to get ready for the contest .
The rules are simple .
It needs to be on the Internet , needs to be a Web server , we have 72 hours to config it and 72 hours to git 'er done !
I started running some pen tests and it looked good , but pen testing your own stuff is like proofreading your own blog .
I needed something else that was more automated .
I tried Nessus , Paros and WebScarab and they did indeed catch some stuff .
I was feeling OK , but I just felt I was missing something .
I did not know what , but I was going to deploy the server .
Now I am a fan of crappy sci-fi movies , so I had the Robert Wise classic " The Day the Earth Stood Still " playing in the background and starting thinking about the 1974 album cover of Goodnight Vienna with Ringo Starr wearing a spacesuit saying " Klaatu Barada Nikto . "
Laughing to myself , I thought , yeah that al ... bum ... wait ...
Nikto !
That 's it !
How did I overlook that awesome tool ?
Nikto is an excellent Web scanner that for some unknown reason I totally forgot about - oh right , see paragraph four .
Anyway , I went here to download and make this prog .
Nikto is built on LibWhisker and will run on any machine with Perl installed .
I will be using my Ubuntu machine to get this Dude up and going on .
To get it going you need to preinstall a few modules : - PERL and Net_SSLeay - LibWhisker
Then a simple sudo apt - get command grabs this 264K file and it is ready to go : sudo apt - get install nikto Running it is really just as simple .
My server IP was 192.168.1.22 so to get it started I just entered : ./ nikto -h 192.168.1.22
Nikto starts to run a bunch of tests against the Web server and then prints the results to the terminal .
Sure enough , Nikto found a hole that I know would have bit me in the tail : +OSVDB - 877 : TRACE /: TRACE option appears to allow XSS ...
I also used the - mutate option to actively look and try to exploit for other weaknesses .
I had success again with test 4 : enumerating users via / cgi - bin / cgiwrap / ~user Nikto is a fantastic tool that can take input from NMAP to scan multiple servers ( kinda slow though ) , and there is a prebuilt NASL plug - in for Nessus as well to extend Nikto .
I also used Nikto Evasion mode to put the LibWhisker module to work and actually slipped through an IDS and grabbed a flag .
What a fantastic tool this is !
As for the contest ?
Well , we did n't win - but we did n't lose either .
So Lane Bryant wo n't see me in their shop this time - oh wait , I mean " ever " !
That 's what I meant , " ever " !

Neurons compete in a royal rumble for the brain 's attention .
Battling neurons decide where this owl looks .
stock.xchg
Sudden movements and sounds can trigger a battle between neurons in the brain , and the winners get to decide where an animal will look , according to new research .
Working with barn owls , neuroscientists at Stanford University in California found that neurons in the midbrain , which acts as a relay for sensory information , engage in a ' winner takes all ' battle with one another .
To the victors go the owl 's gaze and attention .
The findings , presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Chicago , Illinois , could explain how the brain decides where to look in an emergency 1,2 .
The senses detect everything around them , but the brain can only focus on one part of the world at a time .
In everyday life , the conscious mind decides what this should be .
But when confronted with a loud noise or fast - moving object , the urge to look becomes automatic .
That response makes sense , says principal investigator Eric Knudsen .
" When there are features in the environment signalling something that could be life - or - death , we 'd want to know about it , " he says .
Let 's get ready to rumble
What is less clear is how this head - turning decision happens on a cellular level .
To find out , Knudsen 's team used barn owls , which have neatly arranged midbrains that are easy to study .
Research focused on a circuit in the midbrain known as the isthmotectal network , which receives sensory information and tells the eyes where to look .
To prevent the animals from controlling their own gaze , the researchers began by sedating them with nitrous oxide .
The scientists then presented a fast - approaching dot in the owls ' visual field , positioning the dot so that it would stimulate a particular region of the isthmotectal network .
A subset of neurons in the region responded to the dot by firing at a high rate , which — had the animal been awake — might have directed its eyes and attention towards the potentially menacing dot .
They found the same result when they recorded from another region of the network .
The authors then presented a second looming dot , this time outside the field of view of the neurons they were studying .
The neurons began slowing down .
The faster the competing dot approached , the slower the neurons became , and when the competing dot moved faster than the first dot , the neurons switched to a low - firing rate .
That switch suggests that they had lost the battle with other neurons in the region that had been signalling the competing dot .
The authors found similar results when the competing stimulus was an increasingly loud auditory tone : at a certain decibel level the neurons responding to the dot switched from high to low activity , suggesting that the sound had become more important .
Intriguingly , the neurons in the network fired in bursts , primarily at 30 – 40 hertz .
This frequency is meaningful for attention — similar frequencies has been seen in primates when they attend to stimuli3 .
Competing for attention
The findings suggest that neurons in the isthmotectal network engage in a constant battle to decide which ones are sensing the most important stimulus .
Usually nothing in the environment will be arresting enough to trigger the system , but when something does come along — a flash of light , a shotgun 's crack — the responding neurons will switch on , sending a strong signal that usurps the animal 's attention .
Neuroscientist Richard Krauzlis at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla , California , thinks the switch - like behaviour is intriguing .
" This could be part of a mechanism for helping to select the relevant stimulus , and this is a very interesting possibility , " he says .
Further studies are needed to prove that neurons in the network actually compete , he says , and that neurons in awake animals behave in the same way .
The Goldman 10 - Q is out , providing numerous interesting datapoints for those willing to scour through them .
The key one : Goldman lost money on just one trading day in Q3 , making money on all the other 64 .
As a reminder , even in Q2 Goldman lost money on two trading days .
The statistical probability distribution of 1 out of 65 is something that not the SEC , but Richard Feynman should be looking into , as Goldman Sachs , after rewriting the lass of risk / return , is now set to redefine normal distributions and other Statistics 101 concepts .
Looking at Goldman 's risk profile , total VaR presumably declined from $ 221 to $ 189 : this was due to declines in Interest Rates and Equity Prices VaRs , coupled with an increase in Currency Rates and , more importantly , Commodity Prices .
Notably , the " diversification effect " of numbing VaR provided about a ( $ 93 ) benefit to reducing overall risk .
One wonders what will happen to Goldman 's VaR when the dollar carry trade bandwagon hits a wall and death and destruction become pervasive .
And an indication of just how much of a hedge fund Goldman has become instead of a client servicer , the firm 's Equities Commissions revenue for the quarter dropped to $ 930 million from $ 1.2 billion YoY , while prop Equities Trading skyrocketed from $ 354 million to $ 1.8 billion YoY !
And just in case you were wondering someone , somewhere was motivated to destroy Fixed Income powerhouse Lehman and Bear , look no further than Goldman 's Fixed Income , Currency and Commodities which did a gentle jump from $ 1.6 billion in Q3 2008 to $ 6 billion last quarter .
And that explains all you need to know about motivations and backstops .
More to come .
More than one nervous medical student has entered Robin Mulroney ’s hospital gown from the bottom to listen to her lungs .
Aspiring doctors also have been known to forget to release blood - pressure cuffs after taking the vitals of their “ patient . ”
And there was the time a student inserted a speculum upside - down during one of LoriLynne Lawson ’s many pelvic exams endured in the name of training future physicians .
The days when medical students learned how to examine patients just by watching real doctors in action and then trying it themselves are now supplemented by people such as Mulroney and Lawson : “ standardized patients ” who are paid $ 20 to $ 50 per hour to let students poke inside their ears and tap on their stomachs .
These fake patients , many of them professional actors looking for extra money , can cry on demand when they are “ diagnosed ” with cancer or Alzheimer ’s disease .
Strong memorization skills are a must : Patients have to stick to a script saturated with family history of disease , medications , sexual history and surgeries .
Standardized patients are in higher demand than ever in Colorado with the opening of a second medical school in the state last year , Rocky Vista University in Parker .
Rocky Vista , an osteopathic school , and the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine each employs about 60 actor - patients , some of whom work for both schools .
The universities also have high - fidelity simulators — manikins ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000 that take over where actors cannot :
Give birth , have heart murmurs , bleed out , receive drug injections and require intubation .
Many actor - patients say they do n’t do it for the money but to help future doctors develop empathy , better listening skills and a gentler touch .
After their exam , patients evaluate students as part of their grade .
“ I want them all to succeed , ” said Rich Beall , who also has worked for the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and had a TV role on “ Perry Mason . ”
He does n’t hold back when it comes to constructive criticism .
“ If someone comes in with a lab coat that ’s not clean , you note it , ” he said .
“ I had one gal come in all dressed for a Saturday night . ”
“ Patient ” doing her part
Mulroney , who has worked as a standardized patient for nine years and now trains others , believes she ’s doing her part to prevent that rare “ doctor from hell ” encounter .
She recalled a real - life experience in which a specialist walked into the hospital room of one of her relatives , flopped into a lounge chair and without even introducing himself announced , “ So you have lupus . ”
The doctor kept talking “ 90 miles an hour ” even after the woman burst into tears .
“ His empathy , his patient care for the whole patient , the emotions of the patient , it was just tragic , ” Mulroney said .
Last week at Rocky Vista , 10 first - year medical students wearing white lab coats and clutching medical bags lined up outside their assigned exam rooms .
One was so nervous beforehand that she put her fingers in a yoga pose and sighed , “ Zen . ”
With the sound of an alarm , each student knocked on an exam - room door and stepped inside to greet an actor - patient sitting on an table .
The students had 50 minutes to perform a routine physical examination , observed by faculty and recorded in a control room down the hall .
Meredith Kirtland , 26 , sailed through the “ patient encounter ” after she had practiced on her fiance and some friends .
“ Just a couple questions about your sexual history , ” she told her male patient at one point .
“ Sorry , it ’s a little uncomfortable topic . ”
Her professor ’s one small critique :
She should have lowered her patient ’s pants farther to feel his lower abdomen .
Kirtland was too busy running through a mental checklist to think about the fact that the patient was an actor .
It was a lot easier to examine him than her friends , who are “ kind of giggly and you know it ’s not real , ” she said .
“ Everything else in that room is so real .
What better way to learn it ? ”
The highest - paid patients are gynecological and urological teaching associates who guide students through pelvic exams .
Lawson , a 53 - year - old with scars from a C - section and a breast lumpectomy , has had up to 14 gynecological exams in one day .
She had one student remove the speculum without closing it .
And she chuckles remembering some of the clumsy statements students have made , as in , “ Let ’s just take a feel now , shall we ? ”
Lawson does n’t tell everyone she knows about her job .
“ Some people say , ‘ Ewww , how do you do that ? ’
Some people think you are prostituting yourself , ” she said .
But Lawson remembers holding her daughter ’s hand during her first pelvic exam .
“ I was glad they knew what they were doing and had n’t just practiced on a plastic doll , ” she said .
“ Making a difference ”
Gynecological teaching associates typically are feminists “ who know their bodies like no other ” and have a “ real strong belief that they are making a difference in the world , ” said Gwyn Barley , director of UCD ’s Center for Advancing Professional Excellence , which employs the actor - patients .
Men submit to urological exams , she said , because there are “ so few opportunities of any sort for students to learn the male genital exam . ”
“ There is so much kind of mystery , ” she said .
“ You ca n’t just ignore the male reproductive system . ”
Chelsea Williamson , 25 , became a standardized patient after she was laid off as a cabinet designer last spring .
She has found that some medical students need to work on their listening and sensitivity .
While she was portraying a girl with severe psychological problems who cuts herself , one student kept saying , “ Gotcha . ”
Another said “ Great ! ” after she informed him that her parents were dead .

Court rejects Republican attempt to avoid statutory requirement for verifiable elections results in 2010 ...
Brad Friedman Byon
11/7/2009 , 9:02 am PT
In 2008 , election integrity advocates in Tennessee won a hard and long - fought victory as the state legislature finally passed , on a bi-partisan basis , the Tennessee Voter Confidence Act ( TVCA ) requiring the state 's wholly unverifiable touch - screen voting machines to be replaced with precinct - based optical - scan paper balloting in time for the crucial 2010 general election .
But in November of 2008 , as the state was still using its completely faith - based electronic voting systems , it somehow managed to buck the national trend as the only state in the nation to see legislative gains for the Republican Party which managed to win a majority in the statehouse in the bargain .
Ever since , the GOP majority , along with the Republican Secretary of State and Election Director , have been fighting against implementation of that paper ballot law .
A move in the legislature to delay the law until 2012 was narrowly defeated --- by a single vote --- earlier this year , but the state 's Republican apparatchiks have continued attempts to forestall following the rule of law .
Late this week , however , a Nashville judge issued a ruling in a case brought by Common Cause seeking to force Secretary of State Tre Hargett to immediately implement the law he 's so far refused to act on ...
The Rule of Law
On Thursday , Chancellor Russell Perkins found the state must move ahead with replacement of voting machines as required by the statute , though he failed to offer the immediate injunction Common Cause had sought .
The ruling appears to be a victory for the plaintiffs nonetheless , as Perkins ruled against the state 's argument / delay tactic that there were no currently certified voting machines that meet the law 's mandate for systems that are federally certified to 2005 standards .
You see , the law actually contains no such mandate .
The judge determined that the law does not require that the new systems meet 2005 standards --- there are currently none certified to that standard --- and that systems meeting the 2002 federal standards are perfectly legal .
The TVCA states only that new optical - scan systems must meet " applicable voluntary voting systems guidelines " and says nothing about 2005 standards .
Despite that , Hargett went so far as to issue an official " Questions and Answers about the Tennessee Voter Confidence Act " document in June of this year , asserting to his constituents , incorrectly , that " The act requires counties to use equipment that meets the security and reliability standards adopted by the federal Election Assistance Commission in 2005 . "
Hargett was making up that assertion out of whole cloth .
His document , once posted on the SoS website here , has since been removed , but can still be found in Google 's cache here .
" The TVCA does not require the voting system to be implemented by the State of Tennessee to meet 2005 standards , " Chancellor Perkins said in his ruling on Thursday .
" The Court determines that the State is obligated to take prompt , effective steps to meet the statutory deadline using compliant voting systems . "
GOP To Continue Fight For Unverifiable Systems
Nonetheless , Republicans in the state plan to continue their fight against the law and are expected to take up yet another attempt to delay it when the legislature reconvenes in January .
In addition to their now - failed argument concerning the 2005 /2002 standards , GOP officials are attempting to exploit hard economy times as yet another reason to avoid following the rule of law .
In his statement following the ruling , SoS Hargett said " Responsible legislators argue with these hard economic times upon us , it is not the time for additional taxes or government spending . "
But Democratic proponents counter that the state has plenty of funds to meet the statute , as they 've received some $ 35 million in federal funding from the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) of 2002 .
Clearly Hargett plans to continue dragging his feet in hopes the state will change the law when the legislature revisits it in January .
He noted in his statement that he's " preparing " to move to paper ballots " as directed under current law . " [ emphasis ours ]
Projecting his intention of further delay , he also added , " We understand this debate will continue in the next legislative session . "
A History of Problems , Republican Denialists
Tennessee was one of several states where serious problems with touch - screen voting were reported during the 2008 election cycle .
One notable , and perhaps ironic , case was that of Nashville filmmaker Patricia Earnhardt , executive producer of 2008 's award - winning election integrity documentary , Uncounted : The New Math of American Elections .
In October , during early voting for the 2008 general election , as The BRAD BLOG reported at the time , Earnhardt first had trouble convincing her ES&S touch - screen voting machine to register her selection at all in the Presidential contest .
After calling for help from a poll worker , she then saw her vote for Barack Obama flipped on the screen to another candidate .
In 2007 , The BRAD BLOG sat in on a meeting of the Davidson County , TN , Election Commission in Nashville as the three hapless Democrats , who enjoyed the majority on the commission at the time , were steamrolled by the two Republicans who virtually ran the session on their own .
Afterwords , Republican Commissioner Lynn Greer --- who we had attempted to warn about the troubles the county would eventually face with their unverifiable touch - screen voting systems --- told us , with a straight face , that " paper ballots are the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on America . "
Greer has since become the official chair , not just the ostensible one , of that commission .
Whether Republicans like Greer , Hargett and state elections Coordinator Mark Goins will continue to defy the will of the people , the legislature and the rule of law remains to be seen .
We suspect they will try everything they can to do so , though Common Cause is likely to return to court if the stalling tactics and failure to meet the state statute continue .
The Proofers
In the meantime , Nashville progressive radio host --- and election integrity advocate --- Mary Mancini has used her show , Liberadio , to call for evidence from anyone in the state that any vote ever cast during an election , on any of the state 's unverifiable touch - screen voting machines , for any candidate or initiative on the ballot , has ever been recorded as per the intent of any voter .
To date , no official has been able to present a shred of evidence to her towards that end in her ongoing " Operation : Please Offer Proof ( P.O.P. ) " campaign .
It 's unlikely any such evidence will be presented , as none --- absolutely zero --- actually exists ... and all indications seem to suggest that the state 's lead Republicans , as they barrel towards the crucial 2010 re-apportionment elections , enjoy things exactly that way .
I like Android and all , but one thing the iPhone absolutely kicks every other smartphone 's ass at is media playback — until now .
This video of Sony Ericsson 's " Rachael " Android UI shows its media capabilities , and it looks un - freaking - believable .

Looks like Sony Ericsson borrowed heavily from the Zune HD playbook for this one , but we 're not complaining — the Zune HD has the only media UI that 's capable of competing with the iPhone's .
Let 's count the influences :
First is the homescreen , which has a layout very similar to the Zune HD 's Quick Play menu .
Instead of just giving you a boring list of Artists , Albums , and Snoooore , it shows Favorites ( like the Zune HD's Pins ) , Recently Added and Recently Played , not - so - coincidentally the exact same options in the Zune HD menu .
Below that you get two options from PlayNow , a kind of Pandora - like Sony store , including Top 30 and Recommendations .
This stuff is super useful for anyone with a large , frequently - updated media collection .

At the bottom of every screen is a crossbar much like the Zune HD's , but that one 's legitimate Sony — they pioneered that UI with XMB on PS3 and PSP .
It 's a great idea , so we 're glad it shows up here as well .
Other Zune HD influences ?
How about the art on the artist and album pages ?
When selecting Kanye West from the artist list , a photo of his smug little chipmunk face shows up on the top of the list of albums , and when selecting his album The College Dropout , the album art pops up above the tracklist — just like on the Zune HD .

Of course , a warning before the video says that this is for conceptual and internal use only ( whoops ! ) so for all we know , Rachael 's media playback wo n't look anything like this .
But we hope it does —
Android 's music playback software is embarrassingly dated and this video shows a level of gloss that frankly blows me away .
We could be seeing the first smartphone featuring Rachael very soon , too : Like , four days from now soon .
We 've got no idea on carrier , price , capacity , or any other hard details quite yet .

Increasingly , scientific breakthroughs will be powered by advanced computing capabilities that help researchers manipulate and explore massive datasets .
The speed at which any given scientific discipline advances will depend on how well its researchers collaborate with one another , and with technologists , in areas of eScience such as databases , workflow management , visualization , and cloud computing technologies .
In The Fourth Paradigm : Data -Intensive Scientific Discovery , the collection of essays expands on the vision of pioneering computer scientist Jim Gray for a new , fourth paradigm of discovery based on data - intensive science and offers insights into how it can be fully realized .
Critical praise for The Fourth Paradigm
“ The individual essays — and The Fourth Paradigm as a whole — give readers a glimpse of the horizon for 21st - century research and , at their best , a peek at what lies beyond .
It ’s a journey well worth taking . ” — James P. Collins

Tilings have adorned buildings from ancient Rome to the Islamic world , from Victorian England to colonial Mexico .
In general , the word tiling refers to any pattern that covers a flat surface , like a painting on a canvas , using non-overlapping repetitions of one or more shapes , so that the design does not leave any empty spaces .
Contemporary tilings can be found in African - American quilts , Indonesian batiks , molas from the San Blas de Cuna Islands , and Aboriginal paintings .

Tiling was a favorite means of expression for the Dutch artist M. C. Escher ( 1898 - 1972 ) , who repeatedly expressed his love for this art form , acknowledging at the same time the influence on his work of the mosaics he admired and sketched from Moorish buildings in Southern Spain .
In spite of this influence , Escher 's art went far beyond anything seen before .
He produced enigmatic tilings , with strange creatures and mutating landscapes that suggest a craft free from any worldly limitation .
This perception however , owned to Escher 's mastery , is far from true .
Tiling is a very precise art , where not much can be left to chance .
Even the simplest tilings fall to the spell of mathematical principles .
We can push and turn and wriggle , but if the maths is not right , it is n't going to tile .
Not all tiles are created equal
To see how mathematics can limit the fancy of the best tile installer , we first try our hand at tiling with copies of just one regular polygon , that is to say a shape having sides of the same length and equal angles .
One of these regular polygons , a square , is shown in figure 1 ( a ) , while figures 1 ( b ) and 1 ( c ) show polygons that are not regular .
In figure 1 ( b ) not all the angles are equal , and in figure 1 ( c ) not all the sides have the same length .
Figure 1 : Regular and non-regular polygons .
Not only do we want to use copies of just one regular polygon , but we also want to place them vertex to vertex , that is to say , with the vertices of one copy touching only the vertices of other copies .
These tilings are called regular .
For instance , in figure 2 , tilings ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are regular , while tilings ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) are not : the squares in tiling ( d ) lie in a sliding mood , while tilings ( e ) and ( f ) use more than one kind of regular polygon each , regular octagons and squares for ( e ) , regular hexagons and equilateral triangles for ( f ) .
Figure 2 : Regular and non-regular tilings .
As the tilings ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in figure 2 show , squares , equilateral triangles and regular hexagons do make up regular tilings , a fact that was known to Pythagoras ' followers in the fifth century BC .
But Mother Mathematics says that no other regular polygon can claim the same .
Why ?
If we look at the regular tilings in figure 2 , we see that the angles meeting at each vertex add up exactly to a complete revolution , or 360° .
What happens with , say , regular octagons ?
Figure 3 : Not all tiles are created equal .
As figure 3 illustrates , two regular octagons fall short of a complete revolution , while three regular octagons produce some overlapping .
Tiling ( e ) in figure 2 shows that the perfect tiling companion of two regular octagons is a smaller square wedged between them .
So , our claim about which regular polygons can tile a plane regularly is really a claim about the size of their angles .
To say that a regular polygon will produce a regular tiling of a plane is the same as saying that the size of its angle divides exactly into 360° .
It is easy to check that this is true for the regular tilings in figure 2 : the square , triangle and hexagon have internal angles of 90° , 60° and 120° and each of these numbers divides 360° .
Now , if we want to show that only equilateral triangles , squares and regular hexagons make up regular tilings , we need to show that the angle of any other regular polygon will not divide exactly into 360° .
We can do this using a mix of geometry and algebra .
Figure 4 ( a ) shows a regular polygon with sides and angle .
The generic number of sides can be 3 , 4 , 5 , and so on .
We have n't completed the picture of our polygon because we do not want to fall into thinking about a particular polygon .
In figure 4 ( b ) we have highlighted one of the isosceles triangles that compose our polygon .
Figure 4 : Size of an inner angle .
A little thought shows that the angles of the triangle must be equal to , , and , as the figure suggests .
We also know that the sum of these three angles has to be .
Or , in symbols ,
soNow we are looking for those regular polygons for which the ratiois a whole number .
If we substitute this condition in our newly acquired formula for , we see that we are looking for those values offor whichdivides exactly into 360 .
In other words , must be equal to a whole number .
At this point , our geometric problem of tiling has become the following algebra problem :
To show that is divisible by only when By division , we can write
Sliding the tile
Now the only waycan be a number greater or equal to 1 is when , and it is easy to see thatis not a possibility .
So we are done .
We now know for sure that the only regular tilings of the plane using one regular polygon are the first three tilings depicted in figure 2 .
It has been said that mathematicians do not know where to stop , meaning that we always find yet another wrinkle to explore .
Here is our new wrinkle : Tiling ( d ) in figure 2 shows that we can build a sliding tiling using copies of a square .
Is this true for an equilateral triangle ?
How about a regular hexagon ?
How about other regular polygons ?
Let us consider first the case of equilateral triangles .
We can start with two equilateral triangles sitting as in figure 5 ( a ) .
Figure 5 : Sliding the tile .
Since 3 × 60° = 180° , we should be able to exactly fit another four copies of the triangle , two above and two below , as shown in figure 5 ( b ) .
The result is a regular hexagon broken into two halves , with one half slid along the other .
Now we can see what is going on : if we break the regular tiling ( b ) in figure 2 along all or some of the horizontal lines , or along all or some of the slanted lines , and if we slide the strips along the fracture lines , we obtain a tiling , like the one shown in figure 5 ( c ) .
We could try to reason in the same way with regular hexagons , but as it happens , doing the same thing does not always guarantee the same outcome .
As figure 6 suggests , the angles refuse to cooperate , leaving annoying empty spots .
Figure 6 : Sliding does not always work .
So , the answer for the triangular wrinkle is yes , while the answer for the hexagonal wrinkle is no .
What happens with other regular polygons ?
A moment 's reflection will show that a regular polygon will produce one of these sliding tilings only when its angle divides exactly into 180 .
Or ,
Anything wrong with the pentagon ?
must be a whole number .
Moving around this expression as before , we can see that the viability of the sliding tiling using one regular polygon , goes hand in hand with the condition thatmust be a whole number .
Butis a whole number only for
In other words , only equilateral triangles and squares can produce this kind of sliding tiling using just one regular polygon .
You can see how the rules and regulations of mathematics appear very quickly even in the simplest tiling designs .
No pentagons in the bathroom floor !
No pentagons ?
Figure 7 : The bathroom floor in Bob Jenkins ' house .
Well , let us unveil the secret .
We only know that regular pentagons do not work .
But , what if we drop the word regular from the specifications ?
What if we just want to tile with copies of one convex pentagon , which means a five sided shape with all its inner angles less that 180° ?
If we do , a very different and interesting story will unfold , because there are quite a few convex pentagons that will tile a plane .
For instance , how would you like to have one of these patterns on your bathroom floor ?
Figure 8 : Choosing a pentagonal design .
As you can see , each of them consists of copies of just one convex pentagon .
Observe that the third tiling is not vertex to vertex , which is fine .
For each of these tilings , we highlight in figure 9 the shape of the convex pentagon tiler and the conditions on its sides and angles .
Figure 9 : Some good pentagon tiles .
How many kinds of convex pentagons can tile the plane ?
Before 1968 , it was thought that there were five types , which had been discovered by K. Reinhardt in 1918 .
But between 1968 and 1985 nine new types were discovered .
As of today , no new types are known and no one has shown either that the list is complete at fourteen ( see here for an illustration of the fourteen known pentagonal tilings of the plane ) .
In other words , the problem of tiling with copies of one convex pentagon remains open .
How about trying to come up with other examples of convex pentagon tilers within the known fourteen types ?
Of course the really serious challenge would be to come up , if possible , with a new type .
Mixed tilings
Summing up , we know now that one regular polygon makes a regular tiling only when it is an equilateral triangle , a square or a regular hexagon .
We also know that non-regular pentagons give a lot of choices and seem quite difficult to handle .
How about if we get back to regular polygons , but this time we allow more than one shape and size to be used ?
We have already seen examples of this kind of tilings : tiling ( e ) in figure 2 uses at each vertex one copy of a square and two copies of a regular octagon , while tiling ( f ) in figure 2 uses at each vertex one copy of a regular hexagon and four copies of an equilateral triangle .
Figure 2 again : tilings ( e ) and ( f ) are mixed tilings .
Inspired by these tilings , we demand of our tilings that polygons with the same number of sides have the same size , that vertices meet at vertices and that the same number of polygons of each shape is used at all the vertices .
We will call these patterns mixed tilings .
Actually , the three regular tilings ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) of figure 2 could be considered particular cases of mixed tilings , that use at each vertex four copies of a square , or six copies of an equilateral triangle or three copies of a regular hexagon .
So let 's find all possible mixed tilings .
As before , we can do it by combining geometry and algebra and , in this case , with some help from a computer .
Indeed , let us say that at each vertex a total of regular polygons meet , with number of sides respectively ( note that the numbers may be repeated ) .
The basic principle is again that the sum of all the angles meeting at a vertex has to be .
Using the formula we found earlier for the angle of any regular polygon , we can write the basic principle as
( 1 )
Getting rid of some common factors , we haveOr , moving things around , which is a rather nasty formula since it has too many unknowns .
To simplify things , let us see if we can say something about the number of regular polygons we can use .
For starters , the valuesor , that is one or two regular polygons , do not work as they lead to the impossible equalitiesandSo a mixed tiling has to use no fewer than three regular polygons at each vertex .
Could it use any number of regular polygons , say , three , twenty , thirty , two million ?
Fortunately the answer is no .
More precisely , six regular polygons is the maximum number we may be able to use .
Regardless of what the combination of regular polygons might be , we know that each regular polygon will have at least three sides .
This means that the numbersshould all be at least 3 .
Using this information in ( 1 ) , we can writeSo , the numberof regular polygons used at each vertex has to satisfy the conditionSolving forin this inequality we readily conclude that .
So , it is true , we cannot have seven or more regular polygons meeting at each vertex .
Having settled this point , the next step is to see which combinations of regular polygons are allowed .
To do this , we need to find , for each value ofall - tuplesof whole numbers that satisfy ( 1 ) .
Some cases are quite easy to solve , for instance , whenthe only possibility is all ( equilateral triangles ) since the angle of a regular polygon is at leastand ( one revolution ) .
We could , of course , check by hand all other cases , but it 's easier to use a computer .
See here for a computer algorithm that will do the trick .
The algorithm provides the 17 possible solutions listed in the following table :
For example , this table tells us that solution 1 uses one equilateral triangle , one regular heptagon and one regular polygon with 42 sides .
This makes sense because if we substitute in ( 1 ) and we get the correct identity
Figure 10 : We cannot tile with just the three polygons from Solution 3 .
If you wish , you can verify in this way each of the solutions displayed in the table .
We notice right a way that solutions 10 , 14 and 17 produce the three regular tilings we obtained before ( figures 2 ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) ) .
Moreover , solution 8 appears in figure 2(e ) and solution 16 appears in figure 2 ( f ) .
So we know that all these combinations are doable .
That is to say , they not only work at one vertex , but they can be repeated again and again at every new vertex , producing a mixed tiling of a plane .
This is not the case however , with solutions 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and 9 .
In solution 3 , for instance , we can see that once we place the equilateral triangle , the nonagon and the 18 - side regular polygon vertex to vertex , as in figure 10 , we cannot place a new copy of any of the three polygons that yields a good tiling of the plane .
However , we can get a good tiling by combining solutions .
For instance , solution 11 cannot work by itself , but when combined with other solutions , like 5 , 15 , and 17 one gets a good tiling of the plane .
Each one of the other solutions , 5 , 7 , 12 , 13 , 15 , and 16 , produces a mixed tiling of the plane .
The catch is that the regular polygons can be rearranged in more than one way !
For instance , figure 11 shows two mixed tilings that use solution 12 and figure 12 shows two mixed tilings that use solution 15 .
Figure 11 : Two arrangements of solution 12 .
Figure 12 : Two arrangements of solution 15 .
Observe that in searching for mixed tilings , it is not enough that the shapes work well one vertex at the time , but rather , they have to click at all the vertices simultaneously .
Recall that we did not encounter this situation when searching for regular tilings .
Semi-regular tilings
If we now want to eliminate all but a few special mixed tilings , we can make the following additional requirement : at each vertex , the regular polygons should always appear in the same order .
For instance , this is the case in figure 12 ( a ) , because if we go around any vertex , say , counterclockwise , the regular polygons always appear as a chunk of length five of the sequence ... STSTTSTSTTS ... , where S and T mean square and triangle , respectively .
Similar chunks can be found in sequences corresponding to figure 12 ( b ) and figure 11 ( b ) .
However , in figure 11 ( a ) , we can see that at some vertices the arrangement is ... THTHTHTHT ... , where H stands for hexagon , while at others the arrangement is ... TTHHTTHHTT ... .
Here is the final scoop : there are eight mixed tilings that keep the same arrangement at every vertex and are not regular tilings .
They are called semi-regular tilings , and they correspond to solutions 5 , 7 , 8 , 12 , 13 , 15 ( two of them ) and 16 .
Solutions 8 and 16 are illustrated in figures 2(e ) and 2 ( f ) respectively , while solutions 12 and 15 are shown in figures 11 ( b ) and 12 ( a ) respectively .
The remaining three semi-regular tilings are illustrated in figure 13 .

You can see that we could go on forever with this tiling business .
What if we allow the polygons to get smaller and smaller ?
What if we use copies of any triangle or copies of any figure with four sides ?
What if we want to emulate Escher and try to draw some figurative meaning into the tiles ?
What if we look for patterns that , in some sense , never repeat ?
Each of these " what ifs " , and pretty much any other you may imagine , will open up new fascinating possibilities .
The British mathematician and cosmologist Roger Penrose , for example , has designed non-repeating tilings that now seem to agree with the internal structure of real materials , such as some combinations using aluminum .
In a lighter note , Penrose 's designs have also caught the attention of a toilet paper manufacturer , because paper embossed with a non-repeating pattern can be rolled without leaving bulging spots .
But Penrose had copyrighted the pattern and the manufacturer got a legal spank .
Beyond the fun side of tiling and its more , or less , serious applications , Penrose 's interest in tiling relates also to his interest in artificial intelligence and the works of computers .
For instance , the tiling problem , that is , whether a given bunch of shapes will tile a plane , belongs to a class of mathematical problems called non-recursive .
The tiling problem is answerable in each particular case , but , Penrose says , " there is no systematic procedure that , once implemented on a machine , could give an answer in any case , without requiring any more thinking . "
From looking at pretty pictures or making them , to doing mathematics , the choice is yours .
For now , we draw the line here .

In the Battle of the Health Bills , the Senate wins out , bulk - wise – weighing in at 2,074 pages .
The House health reform bill was a mere 1,990 pages when introduced .
That means the Senate bill -- like the one in the House -- runs more pages than War and Peace , and has nearly five times as many words as the Torah .
The table of contents alone is 14 pages .
“ Read the bill ! ” was a rallying cry of some health reform opponents over the summer .
And if Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) gets his way , senators will get a chance to hear every word of it .
He ’s threatening to the read the legislation from start to finish , which by some estimates could take as long as 48 hours .

Off - label marketing makes a mockery of modern medicine
( Natural News )
In the largest criminal fine ever levied against any drug company in the world , a unit of U.S. - based Pfizer , Inc. was sentenced to pay $ 1.3 billion in criminal fines and revenue forfeiture .
It 's all part of a $ 2.3 billion settlement announced by the Justice Department .
The case centers around Pfizer 's criminal " off- label marketing " of four drugs , including the painkiller Bextra .
After whistleblowers filed lawsuits in three states , the U.S. Justice Department took an interest in the case and prosecuted Pfizer for criminal acts .
In the settlement , Pfizer admitted to a felony crime and agreed to pay $ 2.3 billion in fines and other fees .
The investigation of Pfizer reportedly turned up evidence that Pfizer engaged infor nine drugs , including Viagra and Lipitor .
Part of the reason the penalty against Pfizer was so large is because the company was considered a " repeat offender " in promoting drugs for unapproved uses ( which is a violation of federal law ) .
So - called " off- label " marketing of drugs is rampant in the pharmaceutical industry .
Although the FDA , drug companies and many conventional doctors claim the drug industry is guided by a " gold standard " of scientific scrutiny , the truth is that ... much less actually approved by the FDA .
The fact that this continues today makes a mockery of any " scientific credibility " the pharmaceutical industry claims to possess .
Drug companies take advantage of this gaping hole in regulatory oversight by getting their drugs approved by the FDA for one health condition , then heavily promoting it for numerous unrelated conditions .
A drug approved for high blood pressure , for example , could be openly marketed for diabetes or Alzheimer 's disease even though there is no evidence whatsoever showing the drug to be either safe or effective for such conditions .
The same is true with the intended demographics of pharmaceuticals :
Drug companies often get their drugs approved for adults , then they market those drugs to children even though the drugs have never been tested with children .
The result is a pharmaceutical industry thatto be highly regulated , but is n't .
Virtually any drug can be pushed for any disease for almost any reason -- all with virtually no oversight by the FDA .
In fact , in this Pfizer case , even with the Justice Department filing criminal charges against Pfizer , the FDA has stood by and done absolutely nothing to prevent such actions from being repeated in the future by Pfizer or another drug company .

ALBANY 
The fate of same - sex marriage collided with the often - dysfunctional political process here on Tuesday as the State Senate delayed a vote on a bill that would make it legal for gay and lesbian couples to marry in New York .
After an entire day of deliberations , Senate leaders emerged from the governor ’s office late Tuesday with only a vague agreement that the bill would come to a vote before the end of the year .
Gov. David A. Paterson had placed the bill on the agenda for an emergency session that convened Tuesday , and gay rights advocates had been aggressively lobbying for an immediate vote .
But the legislation ’s prospects have grown cloudier in recent days .
Supporters have had difficulty securing the 32 votes they need for approval in the Senate , and a dispute between Mr. Paterson and legislative leaders over how to close a budget deficit that now exceeds $ 3 billion has held up votes on major legislation .
Mr. Paterson said he would continue negotiating with legislative leaders on budget cuts this week and would call lawmakers back to Albany on Monday and Tuesday of next week .
He said he would again include marriage on the agenda , but it remained unclear whether the Senate would debate it next week or wait until later in the year .

In multicellular organisms , every cell has a definite life span .
The old worn out cells have to be continuously replaced by the new cells .
For this reason , cell divisions occur incessantly in the body .
During each cell division , the DNA must also replicate and divide .
DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid is the storehouse of genetic information that helps the body to develop and function properly .
Chemically , DNA comprises of two long strands of polymers that run in opposite direction to each other , and form the double helix that is the characteristic feature of DNA .
Each strand is made up of four types of nucleotides — adenine , cytosine , thymine and guanine .
In the nucleotide , a triphosphate and base are attached to deoxyribose sugar ; they together form triphosphate deoxyribonucleoside .
As the result of the chemical interaction between the nucleotides phosphodiester linkages are formed , and in this manner the backbone of the DNA strand is created .
Between the two strands , the nucleotides form base pair through hydrogen bonds , Adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine .
As stated above , each DNA strand has a definite directionality .
The two ends of a single strand are called 3 ’end and 5 ’end .
The term denotes the carbon atom of the ribose sugar to which the next phosphate is attached .
The directionality helps in DNA synthesis , while the sequence of nucleotides in one strand ascertains the sequence of nucleotides in the new strand of DNA during the replication process .
For the cell to divide successfully , the DNA should replicate .
DNA has specific points called origins where the replication process begins .
The replication initiator proteins recognize the origins and instruct other proteins to separate the two strands and form replication fork .
After the formation of the replication fork , the RNA primers are produced on the template strands .
These primers are used by the DNA polymerase enzyme to synthesize the entire new strand of DNA .
The replication process comes to an end when two replication forks meet one another .
Multicellular organisms have linear chromosomes , and DNA replication usually does n’t synthesize the end of the chromosome called telomere .
Due to this , after a few cycles of DNA replication , the telomere shortens substantially .
Thereafter , the cell stops dividing to prevent further loss of DNA .
In the germ line cells , as the DNA has to be passed to the next generation , therefore DNA loss has to be prevented .
This is done by the enzyme called Telomerase , which in each replication cycle extends the telomere region and prevents DNA degradation .
Sometimes , the telomerase enzyme becomes active in the somatic cells and this lead to the formation of cancer .

SLEEPBOX
Imagine the situation that you are in the modern city , where you are not a local resident , and you have not booked a hotel .
It is not comfortable situation , because in the modern , aggressive cities there are no opportunity to rest and relax .
If you want to sleep , while waiting your plane or train , it may cause many security and hygiene problems .
We believe that urban infrastructure should be more comfortable for people .
For this purpose we have developed a device SLEEPBOX .
It provides moments of quiet sleep and rest from the city without wasting time searching for a hotel .
Here are the possible locations for SLEEPBOX :
Railroad stations
Airports
Expocentres
Public and shopping centers
Accommodation facilities
In countries with warm climate SLEEPBOX can be used on the streets .
Thanks to SLEEPBOX any person has an opportunity to spend the night safely and cheaply in case of emergency , or when you have to spend few hours with your baggage .
SLEEPBOX is a small mobile space ( box ) 2mx1.4mx2.3 m ( h ) .
The main functional element in it is a bed 2x0.6 m , which is equipped with automatic system of change of bed linen .
Bed is soft , flexible strip of foamed polymer with the surface of the pulp tissue .
Tape is rewound from one shaft to another , changing the bed .
If a client wants to sleep in maximum comfort , he can take the normal set of bed linen for an extra fee .
SLEEPBOX is equipped with a ventilation system , sound alerts , built - in LCD TV , WiFi , sockets for a laptop , charging phones .
Also under the lounges is a place for luggage .
After the clients exit , automatic change of bed linen starts and quartz lamps turns on .
Payment can be made on a shared terminal , which provides the client with an electronic key .
It is possible to buy from 15 minutes to several hours .
SLEEPBOX is intended primarily to perform one main function - to enable a person to sleep peacefully .
But it can also be equipped with various additional functions , depending on the situation .
Application of the device can be very broad , not only in the form of paid public service , but also for internal purposes of organizations and companies .

The catch however is that what we do n’t have is a level of clear domination when it comes to single - card solutions .
AMD was shooting to beat the GTX 295 with the 5870 , but in our benchmarks that ’s not happening .
The 295 and the 5870 are close , perhaps close enough that NVIDIA will need to reconsider their position , but it ’s not enough to outright dethrone the GTX 295 .
NVIDIA still has the faster single - card solution , although the $ 100 price premium is well in excess of the < 10 % performance premium .
- From Our Radeon 5870 Review , On The GTX 295 vs. The 5870
Let ’s get straight to the point , shall we ?
Today AMD is launching the 5970 , their dual - GPU card that finishes building out AMD ’s technical domination of the high - end market .
With it AMD delivers the absolute victory over NVIDIA ’s GTX 295 that the Radeon 5870 could n’t quite achieve and at the same time sets the new high water mark for single - card performance .
This also marks the last AMD product introduction of the year .
The rest of the Evergreen series , composing the sub -$ 100 low - end parts , will be launching next year .
AMD Radeon HD 5970 AMD Radeon HD 5870 AMD Radeon HD 5850 Stream Processors 2x1600 1600 1440 Texture Units 2x80 80 72 ROPs 2x32 32 32 Core Clock 725MHz 850MHz 725MHz Memory Clock 1GHz ( 4GHz data rate ) GDDR5 1.2GHz ( 4.8GHz data rate ) GDDR5 1GHz ( 4GHz data rate ) GDDR5 Memory Bus Width 2x256 - bit 256 - bit 256 - bit Frame Buffer 2x1GB 1GB 1GB Transistor Count 2x2.15B 2.15B 2.15B TDP 294W 188W 151W Manufacturing Process TSMC 40nm TSMC 40nm TSMC 40nm Price Point $ 599 $ 400 $ 300
The 5970 serves as the nowadays obligatory dual - GPU part .
It is 2 Cypress dice mounted on a single , dual - slot video card .
AMD clocks it at 725MHz core and 1GHz ( 4GHz effective ) for the GDDR5 memory .
The card comes equipped with 2GB of GDDR5 , which is split between the two GPUs , giving it an effective memory capacity of 1GB .
The card will be selling for $ 600 , at least so long as vendors and retailers hold the line on MSRP .
In practice this makes the card something between a 5850 in Crossfire mode and a 5870 in Crossfire mode .
The clocks are the same as the 5850 , but here all 20 SIMD units are enabled .
This is a 15 % clockspeed difference between the 5970 and 5870CF , so officially the 5870CF will continue to be the faster setup .
However as we ’ll see in a bit , looking at the stock 5970 can be a bit deceiving .
This also brings up the matter of the name of the card .
We asked AMD what happened to the X2 tag , and the answer is that they did n’t want to use it since the card was configured neither like a 5850 nor a 5870 – it was closer to a mythical 5860 .
So rather than call it an odd ( or worse yet , wrong ) name , AMD just gave it a new model number entirely .
We suspect AMD wanted to be rid of the X2 name – their processors go up to X4 after all – but there you go as far as an official reason is concerned .
It looks like special multi-GPU tags are now gone in both the NVIDIA and AMD camps .
Moving on , for power , the 5970 uses an 8 pin and a 6 pin power connector ( although the 6 pin sits on top of a spot silk - screened for anther 8 pin ) .
The TDP is 294W , bringing it in just under the 300W ATX limit .
Idle power is 42W , thanks to AMD ’s aggressive power optimizations present in the entire 5000 series .
As some of you may have noticed , in spite of the fact that this card is at least a pair of 5850s , it consumes less than the 320W ( 2x160W ) such a setup would .
In order to meet the 300W limit , AMD went and binned Cypress chips specifically for the 5970 , in order to find chips that could operate at 725MHz at only 1.05 v ( the 5850 runs at 1.088v ) .
Given the power creep coming from the 4800 series , binning for the best chips is the only way AMD could get a 300W card out .
AMD ’s official guidance for this card is that the minimum requirements are a 650W power supply , and they recommend a 750W power supply .
The recommended power supply will become more important later on when we talk about overclocking .
Finally , AMD is also launching Crossfire Eyefinity support with the 5970 , and thus far only the 5970 .
Currently Eyefinity does n’t work with Crossfire mode on any of AMDs cards due to driver limitations .
The drivers that the 5970 will be shipping with enable Crossfire Eyefinity support on the 5970 for 22 games – currently AMD is using whitelisting and is enabling games on a case - by - case basis .
Crossfire Eyefinity will make its way in to the mainstream Catalyst drivers and be enabled for other cards early next year .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans of all ages are being hurt by the weak job market , but the nation 's teens are in a particularly bad spot .
The unemployment rate for teenagers in the labor force soared to 27.6 % in October , up 1.8 percentage points from the month before and hitting a third straight record high , the Labor Department said Friday .
That compares with a 10.2 % jobless rate for the nation at large .
" What we 're seeing is a very tough market for everyone , but teens in particular who are looking for work just can't seem to find it , " said Jim Borbely , an economist at Labor Department .
The surge in unemployment among 16 to 19 year - olds comes as the weak economy has forced a growing number of adults to compete for jobs that teens normally fill in industries such as retail and food service .
That 's a big problem for teens , who are generally seen as less qualified than adults because they have fewer years of work experience .
At the same time , older workers with families and mortgages typically elicit more sympathy from employers than teens , who are seen as mostly interested in pocket money .
Given the challenges facing teens in the workforce , many have chosen to give up looking for a job altogether .
According to Labor Department statistics , the participation rate -- the percentage of teens who work -- fell to 36.2 % in October , which was the lowest since record keeping began in 1948 .
" Because of this dearth of opportunities , many teens are n't even bothering to look for work , " said Sophia Koropeckyj , an economist at Moody 's Economy.com who specializes in labor issues .
Many of the teens who are looking for work , however , are doing so to help contribute to household expenses like educational and medical costs that unemployed parents can't pay .
" When a family is struggling with one or two parents out of work , obviously kids are feeling the need to work , " said Matthew Segal , co-chair of youth job advocacy group 80 Million Strong .
" When a family is struggling with one or two parents out of work , obviously kids are feeling the need to work , " Segal said .
The plight of teen workers has attracted some attention on Capitol Hill .
Last month , the House Education and Labor Committee held a hearing to address high unemployment among young people .
" More needs to be done to help young workers find meaningful employment , " said George Miller , a California Democrat and the chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor , in an e-mailed statement .
" The recession has only made a bad situation worse for younger workers , " Miller said .
" If these dramatic trends are not reversed , our nation faces the potential of a generation of youth disconnected from the employment market -- a fate we cannot afford to risk . "

Boing Boing Video proudly debuts a new piece from the " great god almighty could it get any more awesome ? "
N.A.S.A. music project , this one from two personal music heroes : Tom Waits , and Kool Keith .
The track is called Spacious Thoughts , and you can pick it up on the project 's debut album , Spirit of Apollo ( Amazon link . )
NASA , short for " North America South America , " is a music collaboration project assembled by Squeak E. Clean ( aka Sam Spiegel , brother of film director Spike Jonze ) and DJ Zegon ( Ze Gonzales , professional skateboarder ) .
The music video embedded above was created by Montreal - based Fluorescent Hill , and I asked collaborators Mark Lomond and Johanne Ste - Marie a few questions about how all that crazy magic came together .
Below , and after the jump , are their replies .
BB : Tell me a little about Fluorescent Hill ?
Who are you guys , where are
you , what do you do ?
Fluorescent Hill :
Well , we 're a very small collective of artists , basically myself ( mark
lomond ) and johanne ste-marie .
we started working together while in school here in Montreal , along with
some other friends .
So we've
been together for almost eight years .
We do design , illustration ,
animation , live action ,
basically anything artistic , but with a primary focus on film .
BB : How did the NASA video project come together , and what were your first
thoughts when you learned what track and what
musical artists would be involved ?
Fluorescent Hill :
We got an email one day describing the entire
NASA project , the musicians involved the visual
artists involved and it just blew our minds .
As soon as I saw the list of
musicians , deep in my brain I already was hoping
to work on the Kool Keith and Tom Waits collab .
They 're two artists that I
go way back to my early tape buying days with .
So when we finally got on the phone , and they said it was this track
" Spacious Thoughts " a small peice of my brain exploded .
Then when they sent the track I was absolutely just ecstatic .
Then came the realisation that our work would be seen by such artists as
Marcel Dzama , Syd Garon , Barry McGee ,
Shepard Fairey , etc.. and panic set in .
So we had to step it up in every way .
BB : Can you tell us a little about the characters we see in the video ?
I
love the anthropomorphization of Tom Waits '
voice — it 's as if the very sound of his voice , not Waits as a person , is
being brought to life .
Same thing with the
bouncing , spherical ball critter .
How did these beings take form ?
Fluorescent Hill :
Well the characters went through a couple stages of redesign .
At first he
was more of a giant oninon , and then cleaned
up into a drop of oil .
We initially were going to do the character in 2D
and the backgrounds would be 3D .
But then
we just flipped everything 180 degrees as a challenge to ourselves ,
because we had never really done a fully animated
3d character and it would force us to rethink how we approach everything .
Also the challenge of going from 2d drawing to realizing it in 3d
changed the overall design adding more to it and streamlinig other aspects .
We also wanted both Tom Waits Oil Drop / Bouncing Ball character and Kool
Keiths ' to essentially be the same in design but different in
movement and colour , like different aspects or personalities of the same
person .
The giant Cloud in the chorus was the first thing we came up with .
We felt
the chorus had to be big , and Waits ' voice is just so huge
you just have to go with something towering over the rest of the video ,
and in this case the city …. which ended up working out really
well for the lyrics in that section .
Also we did n't want to do caricatures
of the singers , it had been done before with waits , I believe
Ralph Bakshi had anmiated / rotoscoped him , so to try and just get at the
quick pop of Kool Keith and the growl and bark of Tom Waits .
BB : How did the project progress , how long did it take ?
Can you talk us
through a little of the " making of " ?
Fluorescent Hill :
For the video we tried to mix as many mediums as possible .
We had access
to the shipping docks here in Montreal and so we went down and
photographed all the nooks and crannies , then made collages out of th
photos , then redrew the collages .
The character animation took a
long time , one because we had never done 3d before , and two because it 's
just the two of us .
OUr friend and frequent collaborator
Jacques Khouri modeled and rigged the character , he 's a wizard ….
and
also teaches at Savannagh college of art and design .
The cloud character is made up of so many things it'd be pretty hard to
explain 3d 2d vector hand drawn particle etc .
you name it , we did it .
This was the longest production we 've ever done .
BB : What do you love most , and hate most , about animation ?
Fluorescent Hill : I love everything about animation , sounds cheezy , but it 's true .
You can
really do everything you can think of and more .
The only thing we hate
is the amount of time it takes , but i guess if we had more people it would
go faster , but we like the control we have over every frame .
BB : Favorite part of this project ?
Fluorescent Hill :
Our absolute favourite part is the mix of the music and visual .
We think
it 's a really fun mix , and hope people get some enjoyment out of it
and will want to watch it over and over again .

In its infamous Kelo decision in 2005 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5 - 4 that a New London , Conn. , redevelopment agency could seize people 's private homes by eminent domain not only for public works but also for corporate development .
The well - laid plans of redevelopers , however , did not pan out .
The land where Susette Kelo's little pink house once stood remains undeveloped .
The proposed hotel - retail - condo " urban village " has not been built .
And earlier this month , Pfizer Inc. announced that it is closing the $ 350 million research center in New London that was the anchor for the New London redevelopment plan , and will be relocating some 1,500 jobs .
" They stole our home for economic development , " ousted homeowner Michael Cristofaro told the New York Times .
" It was all for Pfizer , and now they get up and walk away . "
John Brooks , executive director the New London Development Center , told the Associated Press : " Development 's going to happen once the economy rebounds . "
But attorney Dana Berliner of the Institute for Justice , who represented Kelo and other homeowners , noted , " There was evidence back when we had the trial that nothing would be built on the land that was taken , and the courts just did n't want to look at that . "
The courts were too rapt at the notion of shiny and tax - rich waterfront development to care about the impact on largely blue - collar taxpayers who so desperately wanted to hold on to their ocean - view homes .
How can the government take citizens ' homes so that private corporations can take the land for their own profit ?
Explaining the decision to the Clark County Bar Association in 2005 , Justice John Paul Stevens asserted that the court " focused on the purpose of the entire project , rather than its impact on the individuals who happen to own property in the targeted area . "
There 's a problem with painting the public good with such a broad brush .
As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her dissenting opinion : " The specter of condemnation hangs over all property .
Nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz - Carlton , any home with a shopping mall , or any farm with a factory . "
When it goes wrong , to paraphrase that Joni Mitchell song , they take paradise and put up an empty lot .
The beams were injected at 450 billion electron volts Engineers working on the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) have successfully injected beams of particles into two sections of the vast machine .
An LHC spokesperson said this was the first time particle beams had been inside the LHC since it was shut down late in September 2008 .
Scientists working on the giant particle accelerator described the success as " a milestone " .
They plan to circulate a beam around the 27 km - long tunnel in November .
The LHC was closed down shortly after its switch - on last year , when a magnet problem called a " quench " caused a tonne of liquid helium to leak into its tunnel .
This is a work of synchronisation
Gianluigi Arduini , Cern Since then , engineers have been working to repair the damage .
Recently , all eight sectors of the LHC were cooled to their operating temperature of 1.9 kelvin ( - 271C ; - 456 F ) - colder than deep space .
On 23 and 25 October , beams of protons and of lead ions were injected into the LHC ring , and successfully guided both clockwise and anti-clockwise through two of the eight sectors .
Each sector is approximately 3.5 km long .
The extreme cold allows the magnets inside the LHC , which align and accelerate the beam , to become " superconducting " .
This means they channel electric current with zero resistance and very little power loss .
Gianluigi Arduini , deputy head of hardware commissioning for the LHC , told BBC News the beam test showed that the collider 's systems were operating properly .
The LHC 's tunnel runs for 27 km under the Franco - Swiss border
" This is a work of synchronisation , " he said .
" The fast magnets must be synchronised to accelerate the beam and transfer it from one accelerator to the next and eventually to the LHC , which must be synchronised to accept it .
" This whole process happens within 100 picoseconds - one picosecond is a millionth of a millionth of a second . "
The beams were injected at 450 billion electron volts , only a fraction of the energy that scientists will aim for when they attempt to collide two particle beams .
Two beams of particles will be fired down pipes running through the magnets - travelling in opposite directions at close to the speed of light .
Mr Arduini said : " The aim once the beam is circulating is to accelerate [ it ] up to 3.5 [ trillion electron volts ] .
" But that will be in stages .
We will first go to one , then 3.5 ... then from 2011 we 're going to try to go to seven . "
At allotted points around the tunnel , the proton beams cross paths , smashing into one another .
Scientists hope to see new particles in the debris of these collisions that could reveal insights into the " Big Bang " and the nature of the Universe .

Rating : 5 stars I subbed peanut butter for the tahini as it was what I had on hand .
( Any nut butter would work . ) 8 is too many cloves of garlic - cut it in half and you 'll still have plenty .
I sauteed my garlic in olive oil before adding it to the food processor with the rest of ingredients .
Took care of that raw garlic unpleasantness .
I also had to add extra oil and lemon juice ; it was dry without .
Very good final product !

Rating : 4 stars I thought this hummus was almost perfect .
I followed the recipe exactly but thought the garlic flavor was a little overwhelming and drowned out the other flavors .
I would reduce to 4 cloves of garlic so the flavors balance a little better .
Mixing the garbonzo beans can be a bit challenging .

Rating : 5 stars I just made this recipe today and it is wonderful !
A nice garlicky spicy bite to it .
I used the pepper cayenne and oregano in amounts to suit my taste .
I also made mine in a food processor and needed a little more liquid to blend it properly .
I had saved the liquid from the beans just in case I needed it although water would have been fine .
This recipe is definitely a keeper .

Rating : 4 stars Technically mine was Spicy " Two " Pepper Hummus as I got halfway through making it and realized I was out of jalapenos !
( A rarity in my house ! )
But it still turned out great and was very spicy !
Like many of the other reviews I needed to add more liquid so I switched off water & EVOO until I got the right consistency .
I also felt it needed more cumin so I added ( roughly ) another 1 /2 tsp .
The first time I ever had hummus was in Jerusalem so I guess I 'm kind of a hummus snob .
Store bought just dose n't cut it !
This recipe was a great spicy version !

My search for the Ultimate Hummus Recipe has ended .
I will cut down on the spice next time around due solely to the wimpiness of my palate but give the recipe a wholehearted thumbs - up .
Amazing eaten with multigrain Tostitos .

This is a great spicy hummus recipe .
Though I made a few changes .
First I used two slices of a fresh jalapeno pepper ( seeded and ribs removed ) .
Secondly I added 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar since I did n't have the juice from the jar of jalapenos .
Lastly I added 2 tablespoons of plain Greek yogurt to the recipe since I like my hummus very creamy .
With these slight changes I will definitely make this recipe over and over again - thanks !

This was pretty yummy but WAY too much garlic .
I 'm a huge garlic fan and add it to everything so I ignored other reviewers comments about it .
Next time I 'll roast the garlic along with a red pepper that way it wo n't have the same raw garlic bite .
I halved the recipe but still had to add another can of beans to make it edible .
Also had to add extra liquid .
Will definately make again with a few changes .
Thanks !

Jeanne - Claude , who collaborated with her husband , Christo , on dozens of environmental art projects , notably the wrapping of the Pont Neuf in Paris and the Reichstag in Berlin and the installation of 7,503 vinyl gates with saffron - colored nylon panels in Central Park , died Wednesday in Manhattan , where she lived .
She was 74 .
A statement on the couple ’s Web site , christojeanneclaude.net , said the cause was complications of a brain aneurysm .
Jeanne - Claude met her husband , Christo Javacheff , in Paris in 1958 .
At the time , Christo , a Bulgarian refugee , was already making art of wrapped packages , furniture and oil drums .
Three years later , they made their first work together , a temporary installation on the docks in Cologne , Germany , that consisted of oil drums and rolls of industrial paper wrapped in tarpaulin .
Image Christo and Jeanne - Claude in 2004 , announcing “ The Gates . ” Credit ... Sara Krulwich / The New York Times
To avoid confusing dealers and the public , and to establish an artistic brand , they used only Christo ’s name .
In 1994 they retroactively applied the joint name “ Christo and Jeanne - Claude ” to all outdoor works and large - scale temporary indoor installations .
Other works were credited to Christo alone .

For over 30 years , your personal computer has been , well , your personal computer .
You could install whatever software you liked - provided it was compatible .
After installing an app or an operating system , if you then decided you preferred the previous version , you were free to uninstall the new and revert to the old .
But nowadays , that 's not entirely true .
You can't revert software on your iPhone .
Why ?
Because Apple does n't trust you .
Last month , after Apple unveiled the new iPhone 3.1 OS , more than a few Reg readers asked how - or , indeed , if - they could revert their iPhone operating systems back to version 3.0 when they experienced battery , WiFi , and other problems after upgrading to version 3.1 .
The answer is they can't .
At least not officially .
And much the same goes for iPhone applications .
After our recent story about Rogue Amoeba - the iPhone App developer who was snuffed for too much Appleness - one reader pointed out the simple truth : " If an update [ to an iPhone app ] introduces a bug , then you 're screwed until the developer fixes it and the fix is approved by Apple ( say 3 weeks ) .
In contrast on any other platform you could just revert to the previous version immediately . "
What does Apple say about this ?
Very little , of course .
Focusing first on the ability to revert to a previous version of the iPhone 's OS , we contacted Apple with three quick questions :
1 . What is Apple 's official position on reverting from a current iPhone Software version to a previous one ?
2 . If such a reversion is not supported by Apple , does doing so void any existing and current iPhone warranty ?
3 . If such a reversion is supported by Apple , does Apple offer any tools / advice / support for such a reversion ?
Simple and straightforward , do n't you think ?
But nothing is ever simple and straightforward when dealing with Apple .
After over a week of back - and - forth exchanges with an Apple spokeswoman who wanted to know why we were asking , what kind of a story we were planning , and the like , we finally received a one - line response : " Apple always recommends that iPhone customers keep current with software updates for the best user experience . "
Now , we have no personal beef with any Apple spokesfolks .
They do their jobs , and we do ours .
And their prime directive is to not deviate from the oh - so - carefully controlled company line .
If anything , we look upon their daily deflection duties with sympathy .
To be honest , we did n't expect much help from Apple , so while we were waiting for the spokeswoman 's non-response response we conducted a series of tests that led us to suggest a one - word edit to her statement : " Apple always requires that iPhone customers keep current with software updates for the best user experience . "
Operating - system reversion can , indeed , be accomplished - but no thanks to Apple .
In fact , in our experience Apple makes it as difficult as possible to install a previous version of your iPhone 's OS then restore the iPhone 's iTunes backup of apps and data .
Our test iPhone was a 3G model running iPhone Software version 3.1.2 .
We first backed up the phone using iTunes 9 , then followed instructions published on BenM.at to revert the iPhone from 3.1.2 to 3.0 .
Doing so was not rocket science - the most difficult part was timing the button dance needed to slip the phone into DFU ( device firmware update ) mode .
But whether performing this relatively simply hack is easy or not is n't the point .
What is the point is that it 's not supported by Apple - and that for the vast majority of iPhone users , using the command - line Terminal utility to run iRecovery is an unfamiliar , not to say daunting , task .
Why does n't Apple make it easy to switch back to a previous version of the OS if you 're dissatisfied with an upgrade ?
Because " Apple always recommends that iPhone customers keep current with software updates for the best user experience . "
Blogger James Chartrand came out today as a woman — and her experiences reveal that the blogosphere , and the job market in general , are n't as egalitarian as some people claim .

James — she 's still going by the pseudonym , has n't revealed her real name , and that 's not her in the pic — says she started blogging to help support her kids during a tough financial time .
She began using a male pen name one day simply to distance a project from her still - struggling business , and , she writes , " jobs became easier to get . "
She continues ,
Taking a man 's name opened up a new world .
It helped me earn double and triple the income of my true name , with the same work and service .
No hassles .
Higher acceptance .
And gratifying respect for my talents and round - the - clock work ethic .
Business opportunities fell into my lap .
People asked for my advice , and they thanked me for it , too .
Did I quit promoting my own name ?
Hell yeah .
Under her male name , James made enough money to buy a small house and give her kids a comfortable life .
She 's only coming out now because " someone I trusted got mad and decided to out me " ( a motivation with echoes of Belle de Jour ) .
Interestingly , the copywriting and web design blog she owns ( whose About Us section reads , " Owner James Chartrand is the pen name of a female thirty - something copywriter , problogger and online entrepreneur from Quebec , Canada " ) has a very stereotypically male aesthetic , with a bullet ripping through its title , Men with Pens .
The About Us section even describes another female blogger as " the team 's rogue woman who wowed us until our desire for her talents exceeded our desire for a good ol ' boys club . "
Chartrand 's disguise was , it seems , rather thick .

The success of BlogHer and the mommy blogger movement have led some to hail the blogosphere as a place of gender equality .
While some mommy bloggers snag Wal - Mart endorsements , the world of business blogging — Men with Pens advertises its " business sense , branding expertise , and savvy sales and marketing smarts " may still be more of a Mad Men type of place .
It 's impossible to tell whether the bullets - and - bricks aesthetic of Men with Pens was a calculated decision , but it 's possible that a male name and a stereotypically male persona are favored in the web marketing industry .

At this point , James seems to have built a brand , and it 's unlikely that she 'll suffer too much from her outing .
But a post she wrote last year now seems eerily apt .
In " Would You Become Someone Else To Achieve Your Dreams ? , " James writes , " Think about how you would react if someone told you that who you are is holding you back – and you knew they were right .
This person tells you that if you were someone else , you could live your dream . "
She adds ,
If you had the chance to be someone else , would you do it ?
Would you take on a role that makes opportunity possible , makes life easier , and makes your dreams become reality ?
More importantly … who would you be ?

For James , it appears the answer was yes — and it's easy to understand why .
Still , it 's pretty sad that the " role that makes opportunity possible , makes life easier , and makes your dreams become reality " still has to be that of a man .

In Georgia , as in other states , you will likely need to establish another driver 's negligence after suffering injuries in a car accident .
Proving negligence requires you to show that another driver failed to follow the rules of the road or other laws and that this failure caused the accident .
Often , insurers will try to find ways to pin the blame for a car accident on you , making it critical that you speak to your own personal injury attorney in the Alpharetta area before answering their questions .
If you are found 50 % or more at fault , you will be barred from recovering damages .
However , if you are successful in establishing the defendant ’s liability , you may be able to recover compensation for your medical costs , lost income and earning capacity , property damage , and general damages for pain and suffering .
This can make a huge difference in a victim ’s ability to move forward from an accident .
Commercial trucks like tractor - trailers and big rigs are large and heavy .
When they collide with a smaller vehicle or pedestrian , the truck driver may sustain hardly any damage , while the other person may be seriously injured or killed .
To recover damages in a truck accident case , you will need an attorney who can look closely at what happened and develop a strategy to ensure that you pursue all of the responsible parties .
Sometimes the negligence of truck drivers and the trucking companies that employ them consists of violations of the strict government regulations that trucking companies are required to follow regarding background checks , drug and alcohol testing , hours of service , and driver training , among many other requirements .
Motorcycle accidents often result in catastrophic injuries to a motorcyclist , changing their life forever .
Damages that you may be able to recover if you can show that another driver was at fault include medical expenses , physical therapy , vocational rehabilitation , lost wages , lost earning capacity , and pain and suffering .
As with other motor vehicle accidents , insurers for a driver often look for ways to blame the victim and reduce the damages by finding evidence of comparative negligence .
However , Alpharetta personal injury attorney Casey W. Stevens can thoroughly investigate the case from a victim ’s perspective and make sure that crucial evidence is preserved .
He also can make sure that procedural deadlines like the statute of limitations are met so that a defendant cannot evade liability on technical grounds .
In Georgia , all property owners and occupiers are required to exercise ordinary care to keep their property safe for invitees and guests .
However , many victims are seriously injured on commercial property because of such dangerous conditions as liquid on the floor , collapsing balconies , defective stairs , inadequate lighting , unsecured swimming pools , and insufficient security .
Generally , property owners should inspect their property regularly for dangerous conditions and either provide warnings to guests or make repairs .
Property owners that know or should know of dangerous conditions that injure an invited customer or guest may be held accountable for damages .
When a health care provider deviates from the professional standard of care and thereby causes injuries to a patient , there may be a basis for a medical malpractice lawsuit .
In addition to filing a complaint , a plaintiff needs to file an expert 's affidavit .
The expert should be qualified to testify as to the health care provider 's negligence and be able to cite at least one act of negligence committed by the defendant health care provider that gives rise to the medical malpractice claim .
If you suspect that you have been a victim of medical malpractice , you should consult a personal injury lawyer in the Alpharetta area as soon as possible to allow for an investigation of your medical records and other evidence .
When you put your loved one in a nursing home , you expect that he or she will be properly treated .
Nursing home residents , unfortunately , are sometimes subject to abuse , neglect , or exploitation while living in nursing home facilities .
They are often vulnerable and dependent on nursing home staff .
The staff may not be properly trained , or the facility may be understaffed .
Nursing facilities that accept Medicare and Medicaid funding must abide by federal regulations .
Not all do , and the result may be serious injuries .
You can recover damages against a nursing home for injuries or wrongful death to a loved one as a result of the nursing home 's negligence or abuse .
In Georgia , you may be able to hold a manufacturer liable for defective products that cause injuries by filing a product liability lawsuit .
There are three types of actionable defects : marketing , design , and manufacturing defects .
You may be able to bring a lawsuit on the basis of more than one defect .
For example , if a drug is dangerous because it has been formulated such that it results in a patient having a much higher likelihood of developing cancer , there may be both design and marketing defects involved .
If you are injured on the job , your remedy against your employer may be found through the workers ' compensation system .
However , workers may not realize that there may be third - party claims that they can simultaneously pursue following a workplace accident by filing a personal injury lawsuit .
For example , there are many contractors , subcontractors , and suppliers on a construction site , and in some cases , it may be possible to hold a non-employer contractor accountable for negligence for causing your injuries .
A personal injury attorney may be able to help you obtain compensation for failure to follow OSHA safety standards , failure to mark openings , falls , improperly installed scaffolding , unsecured staircases , and more .
Boating accidents are often caused by drivers who are under the influence of alcohol or are inadequately trained to operate the vessel .
Sometimes accidents happen because an inexperienced boater encounters a dangerous condition , such as severe wind or a large wake from another vessel .
If you are injured in a boating accident , you may be able to recover damages from a negligent boater , whether you were a passenger on the boat or in another boat affected by the negligent boater .
The key question will be whether the defendant acted as a reasonable boater would act under similar circumstances .
Injuries and deaths can also occur due to defects in the design of the boat .
If your child was seriously injured because you entrusted the child to a daycare that negligently supervised them , you should call an attorney who is experienced in child injury cases .
You will likely need to show that the caregiver failed to adequately monitor or supervise the children in its care .
Damages that you may be able to recover include medical bills , expenses related to future long - term care , and emotional distress .

President Bush ’s last press secretary , Dana Perino , is almost as forgetful as Vice President Dick Cheney , who repeatedly told investigators he ’d forgotten details about the outing of CIA officer Valerie Plame .
Perhaps more so .
In an interview with Fox News ’ Sean Hannity Tuesday night , the onetime Bush spokesperson attacked President Barack Obama ’s administration for not labeling the recent killings at Ft. Hood a terrorist attack .

She then took one step further — and claimed there had been no terrorist attacks under President George W. Bush .
“ We did not have a terrorist attack on our country during president Bush ’s term , ” Perino quipped .
“ I hope they ’re not looking at this politically .
I do think that we owe it to the American people to call it what it is . ”
Either Perino was deliberately lying — or she forgot about the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States : Sept. 11 , 2001 .
In addition , a July 4 , 2002 shooting at Los Angeles International Airport was determined by federal investigators , the Department of Justice and the FBI to fit the “ definition of terrorism . ”
CNN reported in April of 2003 :
Hesham Mohamed Hadayet , a 41 - year - old Egyptian national , opened fire at the airport , killing two Israelis and wounding four others before being shot dead by a security guard for the Israeli airline .
The earlier report concluded that Hadayet hoped to influence U.S. government policy in favor of the Palestinians .
During the extensive worldwide investigation , sources said , investigators found no evidence linking Hadayet to any terrorist group .
They characterized the shooting as an act of terrorism because Hadayet espoused anti-Israeli views and was opposed to U.S. policy in the Middle East , the sources said .

Despite being tapped by President Obama last week , for a key post on a board overseeing government - sponsored international broadcasting , former Bush spokesperson Perino ( and current Fox News contributor ) has n’t stopped attacking the Obama administration on Fox .
Earlier this week she blasted the current administration for creating a “ mockery ” out of the justice system and suggested that the president should know better than to be captured on video playing golf during wartime .
UPDATE
Perino is now disputing that she meant to say that no terrorist attacks occurred during President George W. Bush ’s tenure .
In a Twitter posting on Wednesday afternoon , Perino wrote : “ Last night on Hannity , I obviously meant no terror attack on U.S. post 9/11 during Bush 2nd term . ”

Larry Silverstein began spending every morning at the World Trade Center shortly after he inked a 99 - year deal to operate the complex in July 2001 .
The New York developer would have breakfast at Windows on the World , the restaurant on the 107th floor of the North tower , and then meet for several hours with tenants .
But on the morning of Sept. 11 , 2001 , he was at home , dressing for a doctor 's appointment his wife had made for him , instead of at his usual table at Windows .
" I had said to my wife , sweetheart , cancel my doctor 's appointment .
I have so much to do at the Trade Center , " he recalls .
" She got very upset and told me I had to go .
As it turns out , that saved my life . " [ WSJ ]
Larry Silverstein , WTC 7 , and the 9/11 Demolition [ Details ]
We are told that World Trade Center 7 collapsed through fire , but Larry Silverstein has indicated the building was " pulled " ( i.e. demolished ) .
Videos of the collapse and other evidence shows that the building was indeed demolished .
When and why was WTC 7 rigged for demolition ?

Campaigns to get women cycling seem to focus on how to look good over other concerns .
Is this really all girls care about ?
Teenage girls do n't ride bikes .
Or so says the Darlington Media Group , who have set about trying to rectify the problem with a campaign to get young women cycling .
Several years ago , the National Children 's Bureau published research that revealed that on average , boys cycle 138 miles a year and girls only 24 miles .
This still rings true .
Christie Rae , 16 , from Newcastle told me : " I do have a bike , but I do n't really use it .
Only sometimes in the summer when my friends and I cycle round to see each other .
I do n't know many girls that do , actually . "
Darlington 's project began with the production of a documentary called Beauty and the Bike , chronicling a trip made by a group of teenage girls to Bremen in Germany , where they met their cycling - loving peers and found out about the joys of the open road .
It all sounds slightly twee , but addresses the important issue that girls tend to get to a certain age and it's no longer the done thing to get about by bike .
I have every admiration for such attempt to get women enjoying the numerous benefits of cycling , but what is frustrating is the focus on appearance that is often so integral to said schemes .
Aside from the title , BATB , which incidentally has been used for a similar scheme in the past , Darlington 's site makes it clear they are keen to address the important issue of remaining fashionable while cycling .
But as I recall , it was an overprotective mother that stopped me from spending too much time around the bike sheds in my teenage years , rather than any personal concerns over the way I looked .
Another offender is the site Bike Belles , run by the otherwise excellent charity Sustrans , which encourages women of all ages to take up cycling .
One helpful section dedicated to beauty tips provides such gems as : " Use waterproof mascara when it 's raining on your bike , and take a powder compact for a quick refresher on arrival . "
Admittedly , I write as someone who occasionally arrives at the office sporting a minor oil slick on my face , but I sincerely doubt that women are so image conscious that this is what is stopping them .
As many a female cyclist will confirm , it is more hassle than it 's worth looking attractive while travelling by bike .
Aside from fashion tips , the beauty bikers and belles both voice concerns over the lack of decent cycle lanes and safety issues that make our roads a wholly unappealing prospect .
Those two are serious issues that would put inexperienced riders off , and are much more worthy of a campaign to get people , regardless of gender , on their bikes .
While looking through some recent customer submissions a particular filename caught my attention .
It was called “ googlewaveinvitegenerator.exe ” .
Google Wave is a new communication application being developed by Google .
Many people who missed the initial sign up for this application are now seeking invites to the service .
Certain bad guys have latched onto this and are attempting to take advantage of the situation to push malware .
In this case the malware in question is Backdoor .
Tidserv .
It ’s also worth pointing out Google Wave was only selected because of its current popularity .
Using a trusted brand like this also increases the chance of success for the attacker .
This technique is something we see all of the time .
This particular campaign tries to trick people who want to get into the Google Wave community by promising not only an application that generates Google Wave invites , but also untold riches by selling these invites to other people who want to ride the Google Wave .
This is typical of this type of marketing campaign — promise the world but give nothing !
( Just to be clear , the invite generator does not work ! )
Yet another campaign that is peddling malware to unsuspecting victims .
What is interesting about this particular campaign is that it accidentally gave valuable insight into how the bad guys are making these campaigns successful .

molly - guard installs a shell script that overrides the existing shutdown / reboot / halt / poweroff commands and first runs a set of scripts , which all have to exit successfully , before molly - guard invokes the real command .
One of the scripts checks for existing SSH sessions .
If any of the four commands are called interactively over an SSH session , the shell script prompts you to enter the name of the host you wish to shut down .
This should adequately prevent you from accidental shutdowns and reboots .
This shell script passes through the commands to the respective binaries in / sbin and should thus not get in the way if called non-interactively , or locally .
The tool is basically a replacement for halt , reboot and shutdown to prevent such accidents .
Install molly - guard in ubuntu
sudo apt - get install molly - guard
or click on the following link
apt://molly-guard
Now that it 's installed , try it out ( on a non production box ) .
Here you can see it save me from rebooting the box Ubuntu- test
Ubuntu - test : ~$ sudo reboot

Please type in hostname of the machine to reboot : ruchi
Good thing I asked ; I wo n't reboot Ubuntu- test ...
W : aborting reboot due to 30 - query - hostname exiting with code 1 .
Ubuntu - Test : ~$
By default you 're only protected on sessions that look like SSH sessions ( have $ SSH_CONNECTION set ) .
If , like us , you use alot of virtual machines and RILOE cards , edit /etc / molly - guard /rc and uncomment ALWAYS_QUERY_HOSTNAME=true .
Now you should be prompted for any interactive session .

Mary
Fox helped her 17 - year - old son jump out of a window on the first floor
The family of a mother - of - nine who died in a house fire after a firework was thought to have been put through the door , have paid tribute to her .
Mary
Fox died in the fire in Wallace Road , Bodmin , Cornwall on Thursday after helping her 17 - year - old son , Raum , jump out of a first floor window .
The 59 - year - old has been described by her family as a self - sacrificing woman who was " loving and caring " .
A murder investigation has begun into her death .
In a statement , her family said : " We , the sons and daughters of Mary , would like to thank everyone for their kind words at this difficult time .
" We would also like to say a huge thank you to the fire service who tried to rescue our mother from this horrific fire that makes no sense .
She never did anything to hurt anyone and never would
Family statement " Our mum devoted her life to us , her nine children , and went without herself to provide the best that she could for us .
" She was at times , shall we say , eccentric ; she had a sense of humour and was loving and caring .
" She never did anything to hurt anyone and never would .
She would give her last penny to help those in less fortunate circumstances than herself . "
Bullying ' speculation ' Earlier reports that Ms Fox 's son had mild learning disabilities and may have been harassed by local youths were played down by police .
Superintendent Martin
Orpe said : " Initial enquires have revealed that there are no mental health issues in relation to either the deceased , Mary Fox , or her son Raum .
However it is fair to say that Mary could have been regarded as eccentric .
Mary
Fox had nine children and was also a grandmother " In relation to evidence of intimidation and bullying towards either Mary or Raum , again there is no obvious evidence ...
To suggest that earlier press reports regarding the systematic intimidation or bullying of either of them was a cause of this incident is purely speculation and is unfounded at this time . "
A joint investigation is under way with Cornwall Fire Service into the cause of the blaze which broke out shortly after 1900 GMT .
Together with the fire service , police are also investigating suggestions that a firework may have started the blaze after one was found behind the door in the property .
Det Ch Insp Paul Burgan said : " We can not say how they got the firework in there , but it appears from the location inside the property that it was put in through the letterbox .
" At the present time we cannot find any other seat of fire . "
Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward and say that the " key to solving the murder inquiry lies within the local community of Bodmin " .

Psychologists in Canada have revealed new research suggesting that people who become eco-conscious " green consumers " are " more likely to steal and lie " than others .
The new study comes from professor Nina Mazar of the University of Toronto ’s Rotman School of Management and her colleague Chen - Bo Zhong .
" Those lyin ’ , cheatin ’ green consumers , " begins the statement from the university .
" Buying products that claim to be made with low environmental impact can set up ' moral credentials ' in people ’s minds that give license to selfish or questionable behavior . "
" This was not done to point the finger at consumers who buy green products , " insists Mazar , who claims to be a green consumer herself .
" If we do one moral thing , it does n’t necessarily mean we will be morally better in other things as well . "
Mazar and Zhong 's paper can be read in full online ( pdf here ) .
In it , the two psych eggheads write :
In line with the halo associated with green consumerism , people act more altruistically after mere exposure to green than conventional products .
However , people act less altruistically and are more likely to cheat and steal after purchasing green products as opposed to conventional products ... purchasing green products may produce the counterintuitive effect of licensing asocial and unethical behaviors by establishing moral credentials .
Thus , green products do not necessarily make us better people .
In this experiment that underlined the moral turpitude of eco-conscious consumers , two groups carried out purchases either in a " green store " or a normal store .
They were then told they were to participate in an exercise intended to help design new tests , in which they would be paid money based on answers given .
It was revealed to them in a dry run beforehand that they could lie about the answers in order to increase their earnings .
They were also told to pay themselves - unsupervised - from an envelope of cash .
As the profs put it :
Thus , in addition to having the opportunity to lie , participants could also steal ...
Those who had made purchases in the green store lied and stole significantly more than the normal - store buyers , according to Mazar and Zhong .
Comment
So there you have it : People who buy green - who offset their carbon , who purchase greened - up electricity , who put windmills on their roofs etc etc - are in the main thieving , lying , holier - than - thou scumbags .
The old adage is right :
You can never trust a hippy .
Much as we'd love to believe it , though , the whole study - like all of its News McNugget fast - food psychobabble kind - has caused the needle on our bullshit meter to flick far across into the brown zone .
Green consumers , we 'd suggest , are far more likely to be ripped off by unscrupulous charlatans than they are to be charlatans themselves . ®
Bruce Wayne may be stranded in prehistoric times instead of dead , but if you thought bringing him back would be easy , think again .
DC have unveiled The Return Of Bruce Wayne , a time - travel tale hyped as " Batman vs. history itself . "

As we all know , Batman 's alleged death in DC 's big Final Crisis series actually just saw him dumped amongst cavemen with his trusty utility belt , while Dick Grayson took over the cape and cowl in current times .
But today 's announcement of the six - issue Return series shows that getting him back to the future is going to require a lot of pitstops - and alternate Batman costumes .
Writer Grant Morrison explains :
The first episode is set in the Late - Paleolithic Era , the second is in Pilgrim - era Gotham Village , and we also get to see Gotham in Western or noir style .
Each of the stories is a twist on a different " pulp hero " genre - so there 's the caveman story , the witchhunter / Puritan adventurer thing , the pirate Batman , the cowboy , the P.I. - as a nod toward those mad old 1950s comics with Caveman Batman and Viking Batman adventures .
It 's Bruce Wayne 's ultimate challenge ...
So far I 've had him overcome the Devil , Madness and Death ; now we see him , truly lost , amnesiac , and stripped down to basic human survival mode in some extremely hostile environments and unfamiliar situations .
He 's the best fighter in his world , he 's one of the smartest and most driven men who ever lived , but we 've seen him outwit the Joker 10,000 times .
This was a way of taking the character off the grid , as they say , and reminding readers what kind of man he is and what he 's capable of .
If you wonder why Batman is so cool - here 's why Batman is so cool .

With each issue illustrated by a different artist , The Return Of Bruce Wayne is set to launch in April next year .

Grant Morrison on return of original Batman [ USA Today ]
The head of the US central bank said Saturday he was “ concerned ” by some congressional proposals aimed at regulating the US financial system that infringe upon the powers of the Federal Reserve .
“ I am concerned , however , that a number of the legislative proposals being circulated would significantly reduce the capacity of the Federal Reserve to perform its core functions , ” Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote in an op - ed piece in The Washington Post .
ADVERTISEMENT
He said some proposals considered by the US Senate as part of attempts to strengthen US government regulation of the financial sector would strip the Fed of all its bank regulatory powers .
He also noted that a House committee had recently voted to repeal a 1978 provision that was intended to protect monetary policy from short - term political influence .
“ These measures are very much out of step with the global consensus on the appropriate role of central banks , and they would seriously impair the prospects for economic and financial stability in the United States , ” Bernanke wrote .
“ The Fed played a major part in arresting the crisis , and we should be seeking to preserve , not degrade , the institution ’s ability to foster financial stability and to promote economic recovery without inflation , ” he stressed .
“ Independent does not mean unaccountable .
In its making of monetary policy , the Fed is highly transparent , providing detailed minutes of policy meetings and regular testimony before Congress , among other information , ” Bernanke argued .
“ Now more than ever , America needs a strong , nonpolitical and independent central bank with the tools to promote financial stability and to help steer our economy to recovery without inflation . ”

Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , who has sought to audit the nation ’s largest bank for nearly 27 years , does not believe Bernanke ’s fears are substantiated .
“ There is no reason why the world ca n’t know , eventually , what the Fed is doing , ” he said recently .
His legislation , House Resolution 1207 , cleared a key congressional panel on Nov. 19 by a vote of 43 to 26 .

“ [ It ] would require the Government Accountability Office to audit the central bank ’s interest rate policy , agreements with foreign governments , foreign central banks and the International Monetary Fund , ” according to MarketWatch .
“ It also would permit audits of a roughly $ 800 billion Fed mortgage - backed securities purchase program , which could grow to $ 1.25 trillion , Paul said . ”

Honest Statism Beats a Fake “ Free Market ” Every Time
In an article for the January issue of Reason , Matt Welch compared his experiences in the “ private ” American healthcare system and the French “ socialized ” system , and found the latter a lot more attractive from the perspective of the average healthcare consumer .
The “ waiting lines ” were a lot less of a problem in France than in the U.S. , and the French system was a lot more user - friendly and simple from the standpoint of bureaucratic hassle .
While people rich enough to pay for major procedures out of pocket might prefer the American system , the average American insurance policyholder would probably find the French system heaven on earth .
The point , Welch said , is not that a socialized system is better than a private system .
The point is that their honestly socialized system is better than our socialized corporate system masquerading as a “ private ” one .
He ’d prefer a genuinely free market system to either the French or American system .
But enemies of Obamacare need to drop the bullshit about the American healthcare system being “ the best in the world , ” and defending it as “ our free market system . ”
Anyone with direct experience of foreign healthcare systems will be more than happy to expose such lies .
One of the commenters on Welch ’s article , at Reason Hit&Run blog , made a good point : there ’s really nothing all that astonishing about a comparatively well - run socialized system beating a really incompetent and slipshod mixed government - private system .
But a genuine free market system was n’t even in the running .
The fact that we ’re dealing in the U.S. with a choice between two or more alternative state - private mixes is one reason I have n’t gotten too worked up about the whole Obamacare debate .
I especially do n’t understand why the public option , of all things , is where self - described opponents of a “ government takeover of healthcare ” chose to draw a line in the sand .
The features of the plan that the Democrats , Republicans and Blue Dogs all agree on are far more statist than the public option as such .
An individual mandate , coupled with taxpayer subsidies of hundreds of billions over a ten year period to people at various multiples of the poverty rate strikes me as about as statist as you can get–especially when the “ reform ” maintains the insurance cartel ’s jacked - up prices .
As far as I ’m concerned , a “ private ” insurance company that gets a huge share of its income from the taxpayers , and “ sells ” insurance to people who were forced to buy it , is as much a component of the state ruling class as a straightforward government agency .
Even more so , in a sense , because the taxpayer - funded overhead includes an additional layer of parasites known as “ shareholders . ”
Prohibitions against denial of coverage for preexisting conditions , and other forms of denial of coverage , do n’t bother the insurance companies at all .
Since the entire industry is required to do these things it ’s not a competitive issue , and the lack of cost controls means they can simply pass on increased costs to policyholders with a generous markup .
They will subsidize coverage of the sick and currently uninsured by increasing everyone else ’s premiums .
Consider this in light of the principles of dialectical libertarianism .
A particular government measure is not to be evaluated on an atomistic basis , but in light of its contribution to the level of statism in the system of the whole .
As Brad Spangler pointed out , when you ’re held up at gunpoint the bagman who collects your money is just as much a robber as the guy holding your gun .
The corporate bagmen who lobby for government intervention and profit from it are , therefore , part of the government .
And when government intervenes to grant special privileges for nominally “ private ” actors , that is a net increase in statism .
On the other hand , when a second government intervention qualifies or limits the exercise of this grant of privilege for the sake of ameliorating the worst effects of privilege , it is a net decrease in statism .
In this light , the public option would actually have represented a net decrease in statism .
The major components of the healthcare “ reform ” that everyone agreed on were a naked power grab by a state - enforced cartel , forcing the entire population to purchase insurance at cartel prices and taxing the public to buy it for those who ca n’t afford it .
The public option , on the other hand , would have been entirely self - financed after the initial seed money of a few billion , and nobody would have been forced to buy it .
But it would have offered price competition to members of the insurance cartel .
It ’s interesting , do n’t you think , that all the professed enemies of “ big government ” and friends of “ our free market system ” objected to the public option of all things .
Lieberman and others explicitly said that competition to “ private ” insurance companies was what they could n’t abide .
But holding up taxpayers and forcing them to buy insurance at gunpoint , at whatever price the insurance companies choose to charge , with no competition–why , that ’s not “ big government ” at all .
Because the insurance companies are businesses , you see , and anything that benefits business is part of “ our free market system . ”
Whenever you see a Republican or beltway “ libertarian ” talking about “ our free market system , ” remember that they ’d have been using the same rhetoric about Krupp and I .
G. Farben if they ’d lived in Nazi Germany .
We and everyone else that has managed to get some hands on time with the Motorola DROID came to the same two conclusions — it ’s a damn good smartphone , but its camera could n’t focus for beans .
Overnight , however , our tips line was literally flooded with reports that the DROID ’s autofocus camera was finally doing its job and , well , automatically focusing .
First reporters were humorously utterly convinced that their wiping off the anti-glare coating on the lens was responsible for the improvements , but as more and more people starting chiming in it became increasingly apparent that someone , somewhere was hard at work behind the scenes pushing out a silent update ahead of the oft - discussed OTA update due out on December 11th .
Such a silent update is a bit of an odd move , but to be perfectly honest , it could go either way .
We ’re not convinced it improved our camera performance as we never had an issue focusing .
Our issue was even though the boxes went green to signal a “ lock ” our pictures still came out blurry .
But we ’re curious ; how many of our readers with a DROID have experienced a tremendous improvement in camera performance ?
Thanks to everyone that sent this in !

Coleridge was an enthusiastic quaffer of laudanum
A POINT OF VIEW
Even if you accept the idea that the war on drugs cannot be won and that legalisation could be the answer , persuading people that real life is better than narcotics is not an easy job , writes Clive James .
" Weave a circle round him thrice , " raves Coleridge in the last few lines of his poem Kubla Khan , " and close your eyes with holy dread / For he on honey - dew hath fed / And drunk the milk of paradise . "
Coleridge is talking about himself .
This , he is saying , is the impression he would make on anyone who saw him while he was all fired up by the excitements of Kubla Khan 's pleasure dome in Xanadu , where there were gardens bright with sinuous rills , and the earth breathed in fast thick pants .
FIND OUT MORE ...
A Point of View is on Fridays on Radio 4 at 2050 BST
Or listen to it here later Even to modern ears , however , the fast thick pants are the only discord in the poem , which is indeed as fabulous as it was meant to be , a ride on a rocket sled into the lyrical sublime .
Coleridge , by his own account , was high on opium when he wrote it .
He was in the early stages of an oil - burning habit which would rule him for the rest of his life .
Opium , in the liquid form of laudanum , was legally available at the time , but it 's a miracle that anybody else got any , because Coleridge was drinking it at the rate of two quarts a week .
Since , in his last years , he managed to write Biographia Literaria , which TS Eliot later hailed as the work of the greatest literary critic in the English language , the question of whether drugs ruined Coleridge , or else helped him to express his genius , is not easily answered .
But one thing we can say for sure .
Even more than his contemporary Thomas De Quincey , who wrote Confessions of an English Opium Eater , Coleridge was the one who established the romantic connection between getting wasted on drugs and yet being granted the entree to a deeper reality than the rest of us get to see .
Later on , in France , Baudelaire and Rimbaud followed Coleridge down the same road , but even if they thought they were opening up a French autoroute , they were in fact only extending a British motorway , the road to Xanadu .
If Trainspotting was about normal people doing the shopping it might have fallen short Here in the 21st Century , we tend to think that the drug problem started in the 20th Century , forgetting that it acquired its most insidious element in the 19th Century , with the notion that the world of drugs might be more exciting than the real world .
That notion has bedevilled the whole discussion ever since .
What do you do if people actually want this stuff ?
The discussion never ends and probably never will , but it 's been especially hot news in the last week or so after the Home Secretary , Alan Johnson , fired the chairman of the government 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , Prof David Nutt , for talking out of turn .
I wo n't go into details , because the newspapers have been going into nothing else for day after day , but broadly we can say that this particular brouhaha would never have arisen if the government had not put itself into a position of asking for advice that it might not want to take .
If the government is still there after the next election , it might eventually want to take the advice which Prof Nutt was apparently all set to offer , which is that cannabis is not so bad after all .
The government might even eventually want to legalise cannabis , or at least follow the example of California , where you can buy it for medical purposes .
But suppose one or more of the panel offered the advice that a much more powerful drug , namely heroin , would be less destructive to society if it were made legal ?
It 's not impossible to imagine that advice being given , and given by an expert , because there was a time within living memory when heroin , in Britain , was legal .
Heroin was n't criminalised until 1968 , and when I arrived in London in the early sixties you could still see the famous midnight queue at Boots in Piccadilly , where the addicts gathered to get tomorrow 's allowance of their prescribed heroin pills .
Nowadays , however , when the stuff is banned , even the less privileged look glamorous if they are sticking needles in themselves
The point was that there were n't many addicts .
There were n't many in the whole country .
After the drug was banned , however , it became more popular .
The gangsters got in on the act , and whole thing escalated until now you not only have thousands of adults shooting up with needles , you have children shooting each other with guns .
The reasons for this disaster have been analysed to shreds , but one factor hard to rule out is that it makes a story .
Drugs are n't humdrum .
There is danger , special kit , a racy vocabulary , a ritual .
That was already true for Sherlock Holmes , whose creator , the physician Arthur Conan Doyle , for some reason equipped the world 's greatest detective not just with a super brain but with a taste for the needle .
Way back before World War I , there was an element of the young upper crust that fooled with morphine .
It was legal and available , but the fact that older people frowned upon it made it look glamorous to the bright young things .
If you read the diaries of Duff Cooper , you find Lady Diana Manners and her glittering friends getting off on the stuff all the time .
Nowadays , however , when the stuff is banned , even the less privileged look glamorous if they are sticking needles in themselves .
Nobody would make a movie like Trainspotting if the characters were just holding down jobs and going to the supermarket .
With exotic powders in the picture , the drug world can so easily be made to seem more intense than the real world .
Sinatra had a poor time of it in The Man With The Golden Arm In America cocaine was banned in 1914 and heroin in 1925 .
Traffic in the banned drugs quickly became a major theme for crime fiction .
In some of the pre-war crime movies , and in almost all of the post - war ones , drugs are fuel for the action .
It 's been said of modern Hollywood that it's a factory where people high on cocaine make movies about people high on heroin , but somebody must have his head screwed on because people want to see the movie even when it makes drugs look awful .
Back in 1955
The Man With the Golden Arm should have finished off heroin 's career as a desirable product - Frank Sinatra got so strung out he could barely react to Kim Novak .
Fast forward to the 1983 version of Scarface , and you can see Al Pacino destroy his criminal career with a nose - dive into a pile of cocaine bigger than his head .
But no amount of didactic condemnation from the big screen has ever slowed the trade down , and on the small screen it 's doubtful if even that magnificent series
The Wire has done much to persuade the corner boys that they would be better off trying to improve their grades .
The Wire is a test case .
If you have n't seen it , it 's about how the whole black inner city of Baltimore is turned into a war - zone by drugs .
It 's a tremendous piece of work , The Wire .
It 's got everything , including a precision of language that you have to call poetic .
And it 's got an unpalatable message - the war on drugs can't be won .
The pipe was n't Holmes 's only vice
To coincide with the last episode , the creators of The Wire published an article in Time magazine which recommended that nobody should be jailed for a drug crime unless violence was involved .
If the work of art they had created was true , and it seemed terribly true , then this advice was in conformity to the facts .
To the minds behind The Wire , legalisation is the only answer .
But in addition to that article they have also published a couple of books , and one of the books , called The Corner , has a couple of pages that do n't quite fit with the rest .
Almost every character in the book is sucked into the system .
But there is one character who volunteers for it .
He makes only a fleeting appearance , but I can't get him out of my mind .
His name is Gary McCullough and he has brains , energy and a gift for organization .
He assembles all the necessary equipment for busting out of the free - fire zone he was born into .
But he tries a taste of the stuff and he is lost .
His previous life was exciting , but not as exciting as this .
Religious vacuum
Here , I 'm afraid , is a way through to a further fact that we might still be faced with even if the whole vast mess of drug crime could be made to go away .
Decriminalise all the drugs , put things back the way they were before the roof fell in , and you might still be stuck with people for whom real life simply is n't thrilling enough , even when they are otherwise quite good at it .
I think they 're wrong , but it is n't easy to make a case .
Western civilization is up against it in that respect .
Now that religious faith is so weak a force , how do you convince people that ordinary life is worth the effort ?
It 's not just a matter of persuading the young in America 's black inner cities that it 's worth going to school even if it leads only to some boring everyday job such as the Presidency of the United States .
It 's a matter of persuading young people in all the liberal democracies that the real world has a glamour of its own .
Charlie Parker , the wonderful saxophonist who ruined himself with drugs , tried to tell his fellow musicians that they were fooling themselves if they thought they could play better when they were high .
Few musicians listened to what he said , so why would anyone listen to Nancy Reagan saying " Just Say No " ?
She sounded so square .
Even when all the drugs in the world are freely available at a special booth in every block , to advocate the opposite of self - destruction will always sound square , unless we can summon the language to persuade the candidates for a waking sleep that real life , with all its complications , is the only worthwhile mystery , and drugs are an escape to simplicity , which is no mystery at all .
But finally it would be up to them .
Would fewer choose oblivion if all were free to do so , at the booth marked Xanadu ?
Below is a selection of your comments .
An interesting article but its worth stressing that the heroin addicts were getting their fix from Boots the chemist .
It was clean , pharmaceutical grade drugs of known strength and purity not the street rubbish cut with rat poison .
Decriminalisation , where we turn a blind eye to criminals selling the dodgy stuff is the worst possible outcome .
Drugs either need to be banned outright or sold by pharmacies .

Unlike most criminal activity , the use of illegal drugs is largely a victimless crime , and yet there must be thousands of otherwise law - abiding citizens who have had their lives ruined , not by taking drugs , but by being caught in the act of taking them , and then being subject to the often draconian processes of the so - called justice system .
That injustice alone is sufficient to justify legalisation .
Furthermore , despite the possibility that legalisation would cause some casualties , just as the ready availability of alcohol also causes some casualties , for the vast majority of users , legal drugs would be a positive thing , a life - enhancing experience .
Anyone who has been to a " rave " under the influence of ecstasy , or discovered new depths to a piece of music under the influence of cannabis would agree .
There 's a world of difference between " use " and " abuse " - most drug users are hard - working people who hold down regular jobs , contribute positively to society and use drugs sensibly and recreationally on an irregular basis .
Legalisation would n't change this , the money currently wasted on prohibition could be better spent on helping people to make informed choices via education ( without Alan Johnson 's political prejudices please ! ) and people need no longer get criminal records for choosing to do something that 's less dangerous than riding a horse .

Yes , the war on drugs may be lost , and decriminalisation is possibly the only way out of this social , political and economical mess the illegal drug industry has brought upon us .
But , still , drugs are NOT glamorous - and drug users should not be glamorised .
Drugs are a tool of alienation , self - destruction and ruin of others around .
It affects everyone in a chain , starting by those countries which have been completely wrecked and demoralised by drug production - only to satisfy the desire of self centred and ignorant individuals who think being high is cool .

It appears to be in human nature to want an escape or release from what is for some the tedium and stress of existence - how many of us have a glass of wine or beer when they get home from work ?
How many have a guilty cigarette ?
If you include these then the number of drug users in the world is huge - I suggest it is a deep need in many - perhaps genetic ?
Therefore , drugs should be legalised & given away to people who want them , along with help quitting for those who want that too .
That way there is no glamour attached to drugs & addicts do n't have to turn to crime to fund their habit .
The only losers are the dealers .
People who want recreational drugs and can afford them should be charged for them .
The evidence shows that we will get the drugs we want whether legal or not .
Marco , Northampton Losers will always be users .
Do n't make drugs legal .
Users want all barriers and responsibilities removed - they become parasites .
Permit a smoker to smoke and he will do so in your face - everywhere .
Toughen drugs laws as much as possible - everywhere possible .
Ian Beveridge , Aime , France Drugs usually give you a pleasant experience , at first anyway .
That is why they are taken .
And not everyone is a brilliant musician or actor and they may be stressed and poorly paid if they are .
With a drug you can give yourself the sensation of reward that you feel that you deserve and the world denies you , although there 's a probably over - simplistic point of view that that only gives you a neurological overdraft that leaves you in debt afterwards , like spending the money for Christmas at the pub .
As for oblivion , though , plenty of that waits for us at the end of our lives , unless you have the sort of religious belief where the supernatural powers that be recreate you after you die just in order to punish you as they decide you deserve .
Robert Carnegie , Hamilton , Scotland Everyone looks for a means of escape , you just have to look at the front page of this very website to see why .
There is nothing positive in this world .
The stories of hope and strength are few and far between , and they look so unattainable .
It is n't just the so called hard drugs that people are using , alcohol of course is another but also so are online games .
Immerse yourself in another world , another life , one where you can make a difference , fight for something greater than yourself , feel like a hero .
It sounds so good it is unsurprising that millions of people all round the world play games in universes from fantasy and science fiction .
Different people react to the world around them in many different ways but it seems no matter which route you take to escape it seems clear that the real world is needing to improve in order to get its inhabitants back into living a real life .

If we 're quoting from TV shows , I like the final view of the great series Traffik , which says explicitly that as we can't stop people trying to escape from society , we ought to be spending our energy making society better .
It should be stressed though that not every adult in Britain is on drugs - in fact a tiny minority even use cannabis regularly - and I suggest that most people seem quite happy with their lives .
John Gammon , Brighton , UK I heard someone say that intoxication is the fourth great human need after warmth , food / drink and sex .
And why should n't it be .
We are a species given the dubious delight of a self conscious intellect .
For every pleasurable treat life can give us , we are aware it can be equally painful .
Ultimately we know we have no control of the end of our life .
Is it not a surprise some seek distraction ?
The lawmakers and the newspapers still cling on to their puritan morality that pleasure for its own sake is sinful , hence the " war on drugs " .
Why has another individual got the right to stop me doing anything to my self that would not hurt another ?
The hideous hypocrisy that allows a government to make a vast amount of its revenue through a tax on cigarettes and alcohol whilst at the same time proclaiming these to be deadly , shows quite clearly that it's not drugs that are bad for your health , it 's politicians .

It is quite possible to dabble in exotic substances .
Much as enjoying a few drinks does n't necessarily lead to alcoholism or an occasional flutter at the races does n't always lead to gambling addiction .
Addictive personalities are a problem , a day trip to Xanadu is n't .
Dave , Kuala Lumpur
See , the problem with all this is the idea that a choice must be made - that somehow an entirely sober life is more REAL than an ( even occasionally ) inebriated one .
In fact , this is deeply questionable - Coleridge 's Kubla Khan is still beautiful to those of us who have never tried an opiate .
It is fairly clear , from the statistics during America 's Prohibition period and countries that have different attitudes to substances ( Saudi Arabia and alcohol , for instance ) that illegalisation causes the concentration of the most base " high " within a substance .
Witness the hype around skunk for example .
Cannabis should be illegal , we are told , because it is stronger now than 30 years ago - a very consequence of the initial illegality .
But , in fact , it is just certain potent elements that have become concentrated - THC , which causes paranoia and intoxication .
Other elements that would previously have been part of the enjoyment have become reduced .
Similarly , millions of South Americans chew the coca leaf for a similar stimulating buzz to coffee .
They do not all suddenly turn to crack cocaine .
What I am trying to hint at , is the idea that , given the free , legal , and informed choice , perhaps many would not turn to the most dangerous form of a drug - but to alternatives with different characteristics , just as wine buffs do not constantly enquire as to a vintage 's alcohol content .
We need to think differently about what human beings find enjoyable in substances , before we can reach any kind of resolution with them ....
Daniel Johnston , Aberdeen , Scotland
In the 80s I had purchased a Scientific American which ran a series of articles based on studies into drug related problems .
After reading these articles there was one interesting fact which has remained with me .
Long term addicts who managed to survive and extricate themselves from a dependency all gave the similar reason for doing so .
" They just wanted to feel normal again . "
I guess that after a while even Xanadu becomes boring .
Clive , Melbourne / Australia
After the novelty wore off , yes , eventually fewer would " queue at the booth " , but there would always be a line .
Keeping it acceptably small would be the challenge .
An egalitarian society , providing a mind opening education , would enable all people who crave excitement , to work at " new frontiers " , such as science and technology .
Currently the vast majority , at best , get a monotonous job at the wrong end of an ever growing rich - poor divide .
That 's not enough for the random " pioneers " that nature creates and distributes regardless of class .

The beauty of a temporary structure , Mr. Koshalek realized , is that he would only need to consult with the members of his own board .
The budget would be around $ 5 million , a relatively paltry sum by the standards of recent museum expansions , even in today ’s rough economic climate .
And the design ’s extreme flexibility  it can be blown up at a moment ’s notice , and the interior can be easily reconfigured  could allow the museum to respond nimbly to cultural issues of the moment .
( Worst case , if it turned out that people hated it , it could be packed away forever . )
The architects imagine the installation process as a performance piece in itself , something like watching event organizers blow up the balloons for the Macy ’s Thanksgiving Day Parade .
Two refrigerator - size air pumps would be used to inflate the baby - blue structure , which would fill the entire four - story courtyard and bulge out of the top .
A smaller , globulelike form would swell out of the bottom of the building to create a public lounge overlooking the mall .
The aura of lightness  of a building that seems ready to float off into the sky  is counteracted by the structural systems that hold the addition in place .
A gigantic tube of water , like an inner tube , encircles the interior of the structure to weigh it down .
A series of big steel cables , tethered to the inner tube at one end and to a roof - level truss at the other , would wrap several times around the translucent form as it rises through the core of the building , making it resemble an uneven stack of donuts or an act of ritual bondage .

The planned Hirshhorn addition would have a lounge protruding into the Mall and an auditorium in the building ’s central court .

Most visitors would enter the structure through a short , tube - shaped corridor located at the seam between the lounge and the main courtyard space .
In the current version of the design , which is still being refined , the lounge ’s translucent blue skin becomes progressively more transparent at the base , so that visitors will be able to see out into the mall .
The inner tube that would anchor this room ’s outer edge serves as an informal bench .
The main hall , by contrast , would be slightly more formal .
A temporary stage would be built over the courtyard ’s off - center fountain , with up to 1,000 seats arranged in a semicircle around it .
Further up , a few transparent areas in the fabric would allow visitors occasional views of people up in the galleries .
( Given the height of the interior , the architects might consider adding one or two levels of balcony space , which would add richness to the design and take advantage of what is now a four - story - tall void . )
However the world does not reach those levels by continuing in the business as usual mode for the next 21 years , and then suddenly have production drop off a cliff one Friday night .
Rather it is a problem that inexorably will grow , year on year , between now and then .
I was struck by this thought as I looked through the latest comments from CERA / IHS on their view of the future of oil supply .
Their view , as we have come to expect , is an optimistic one , and though we are not still living in the days of $ 30 oil that they had , at one time predicted , it is worth looking into so as to provide some explanation of the difference between their view and mine .
One of the features of many models that are used to predict future events is that they focus on target years .
Decadal years are the most common target years , so that whether talking of climate or the amount of oil or natural gas available , models focus on , for example , the amount that will be available in 2030 .
The problem with this approach is that it leaves the public to think that a problem is not yet serious .
For example if the prediction is that the production of oil will only be 75 mbd , in 2030 then there is an implication that until 2030 that the situation will remain fine .
Let me begin with a reason why I tend not to be immediately and totally swayed by the thinking behind the CERA report , and their conclusion that :
Global oil productive capacity will grow though 2030 with no evidence of a peak of supply before that time .
It has not been that long since we were assured that production of oil from Mexico would be maintained at levels of 4 mbd through 2015 .
In 2005 we have :
CERA said that oil from non-conventional sources would widen to 35 % of capacity in 2015 compared with 10 % in 1990 .
The research points to growth in output from ultra deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico , Brazil , Angola and Nigeria ; 250 % more heavy oil production capacity from Canada and Venezuela ; and the expansion of condensate and natural gas liquids to 23 million barrels per day from 14 million barrels per day currently .
The EIA is anticipating that Mexico will produce an average of 2.9 mbd in 2009 , falling to 2.7 mbd in 2010 .
And the latest chart from CERA ( downloadable at their site ) shows a much reduced increase in production of the heavy oils by 2015 , for a start .
CERA has , unfortunately , not only continued to shine an overoptimistic light on future production , but has also tended ( as sadly it has also done in the past ) to gloss over some of the problems – vide :
Though a peak in global production is not imminent , there are major hurdles above ground to negotiate .
These surface hurdles no doubt include the minor details as to how to get significantly more production out of Iraq .
It is all well and good to read reports such as :
Iraq is planning to increase its production capacity to approximately six million barrels per day within 80 months , following the signing of service contracts with a number of major international oil companies .
This is in addition to the other agreements which are expected to be reached by next December , whereby Iraq ’s production capacity may be increased to reach around 10 million barrels per day at the end of the next decade , compared to 2.5 million barrels per day at present .
The overall cost that will be borne by the international companies investing in developing the Iraqi oil fields will amount to about one hundred billion dollars .
Needless to say , these agreements are considered to be a historic event ( both economically and politically ) , not only for Iraq , but also for the oil industry itself in the Middle East , and for the global oil industry .
Adding 7.5 mbd to existing world supplies would certainly go a substantial way toward meeting the existing and well documented declining production from so many of the major fields of the world .
But is that target a realistic one – let me sound perhaps a little more cynical than some and raise a slight modicum of doubt .
While it is nice to be optimistic , the reality still fills the headlines of too many papers and news reports .
Of course , it is expected that these companies will face some obstacles and delays as a result of terrorist attacks against their employees and sabotage against its installations .
Also , the need arises to increase export capacity that can accommodate the ensuing increase in production , in addition to attracting a sufficient number of professionals and technicians to work in Iraq under the current circumstances , and procuring the necessary machinery and equipment on time .
Despite all these potential obstacles , the delays in these projects are not expected to be significant , since similar experiences in other oil producing countries have shown that such delays only cost a relatively limited and not long amount of time .
Thus even though there are some big players moving into that game , it is a little premature to be optimistic .
In other aspects of the report the average field decline rate , which CERA ties to 4.5 % - but includes fields with rising production in the calculation , masks the reality of an increasing level of decline in fields that are past peak .
As we saw with Cantarell , post - peak collapse can come more rapidly and severely than earlier forecast .
At the same time the move to produce alternate fuels , such as cellulosic ethanol for vehicles , seems to have hit more technical and economic snags that may well considerably delay the target production that has been anticipated for this alternate fuel , feeding into an overall reduction in “ other ” fuels beyond the level that CERA still optimistically holds to ( raising unconventional liquids , in their view , from 14 % of global capacity today to 23 % by 2030 ) .
It is notable that in the version of the report I got , while CERA lists three scenarios , Asian Phoenix , Global Fissure and Break Point , it only briefly mentions the assumptions and impacts that the different scenarios will have on both demand , and thereafter supply .
Given that I noted just recently that China is signing up for another 1 mbd delivery from Saudi Arabia , and that sales of cars in both countries are rising at significant rates , one can anticipate that that market is likely to develop into the Asian Phoenix that one might imagine is presaged by the title of the CERA scenario .
The growth of that new market is recognized with the opening of the new port of Kozmino by Russia with the potential for shipping up to 1 mbd of oil , with China as a major customer .
( Which raises a question for another post on which customers will lose out as China gains . )
But to now get to the nub of my point ; this is that there is already a changing market and demand for oil and its products that is developing in the short term .
The longer term view of potentially available resources that are not yet found , does not address the problem of how big a tap can be made available to meet demand over the next six years .
There are serious questions , within that time frame , of the ability of some of the largest fields in the world to sustain production at their current levels .
Longer term forecasts will be forgotten long before they are called to face reality .
Unfortunately the optimism they project can lead people astray in the shorter terms , where the conditions have been glossed over .

IMAM : Sheikh Anjem Choudary claims the country 's war dead are being punished by GOd
Sheikh Anjem Choudary , the leader of Islam4UK , also dismissed the two world wars as having no purpose .
As the country prepares for Remembrance Day , the British - born former law student delivered a hate - filled rant insulting the memory of the millions who laid down their lives in the name of freedom .
He said : “ We have a different understanding of wars .
“ The wars which are fought for nationalism , tribalism and land , I feel , need to be condemned .
When we fight , it ’s to please God or to defend our honour , not land .
We are not allowed to feel sorry for any non-Muslim nation .
“ Those nationalistic wars served no purpose and we cannot praise any of those who were involved in them .
“ Anything that happens to those non-Muslims is a punishment from God .
As a Muslim I have to believe they died and went to hell fire . ”
His comments were attacked yesterday by ex-soldiers and veterans ’ groups .
Gary McKinnon has two more chances to save himself from being extradited to America , his lawyer said tonight .
Campaigners who have fought for almost eight years to prevent the 43 - year - old computer hacker , who suffers from a form of autism , from being tried in the United States , were dealt a blow today when Home Secretary Alan Johnson refused to block his extradition on medical grounds .
Mr McKinnon faces up to 70 years in jail if found guilty of hacking into Pentagon computers soon after the 9/11 terror attacks .
While he insists he was simply looking for evidence of UFOs the American authorities have likened him to a terrorist .

" Each time there has been a change of Home Secretary I have had a glimmer of hope that someone will finally have the courage to intervene .
I hoped that would be the case with Alan Johnson but that does n't seem to have been the case , " his lawyer Karen Todner said tonight .
However , she said that they had not given up hope and planned to apply for a judicial review within seven days .
If the application is successful , the case should be heard within the next few weeks .
However , if it fails Ms Todner said they would apply to go before the European Court of Human Rights once again with the new evidence that Mr McKinnon had been diagnosed with Asperger 's Syndrome .
" The ECHR would be our last option , " she explained .
" ( The Home Secretary 's decision ) is a devastating blow but we are not going to give up .
We are certainly coming to the end of the road .
We 're just hoping at some point someone sees sense and steps in .
" All the legal team do know is we cannot give up because in some ways it 's like dealing with a Death Row case , and we genuinely believe that Gary 's life is at stake here . "
A host of high profile campaigners , who remain adamant he is too vulnerable to survive the rigours of the American penitentiary system , have insisted sending him to the US would be a travesty of justice .
But today Mr Johnson finally dashed hopes that the Government would intervene in the case , insisting there was no evidence that the extradition would breach Mr McKinnon 's human rights .
His mother Janis Sharp said : " To force a peaceful , vulnerable , misguided UFO fanatic like Gary thousands of miles away from his much - needed support network is barbaric .
This is a cruel and miserable decision . "
The " naïve " computer hacker , who has attracted support from such high profile names as musicians Sting and David Gilmour , actress Julie Christie former home secretary David Blunkett and London mayor Boris Johnson , insisted he was merely motivated by curiosity when he hacked into 97 military computers at the Pentagon and Nasa between 2001 and 2002 , searching for proof of UFOs .
However Mark Summers , an official representing the US government , told a London court that McKinnon 's hacking was " intentional and calculated to influence and affect the US government by intimidation and coercion " .
I certainly was n’t worrying about our operations manual , though I knew , of course , that flight attendants caught sleeping on duty could lose their wings .
But I was n’t on duty , not in the strict sense .
What ’s more , I was exhibiting initiative and adaptability , some of those attributes most cherished by Northwest Airlines .

It was a sound sleep .
Suddenly I woke to a voice on the public address system : “ Morning , folks .
This is your captain speaking .
We ’re No. 4 for takeoff , up near the end of the runway .
So if you ’ll just sit back and relax , we ’ll be taking off in a few minutes .
The flight attendants will do the best they can for you this morning , even though they are one short in the second cabin . ”
I opened my eyes and gasped .
The passengers and crew had boarded , and no one had checked my overhead bunk .
If only someone had tried to store a coat up there or grab a blanket !
I should have been down on the cabin floor , on duty and with my one - inch grosgrain ribbon tying my hair in place , my gold logo centered on the front of my hat .
Instead , I was up on that rack , breaking into a cold sweat .
If I ever needed that Northwest Airlines initiative , it was then .
I poked my head out and down .
The cabin was packed with businessmen reading the financial papers .
I hitched up my skirt  hemmed precisely one and three - quarter inches above the knee  and lowered a leg .
This snagged the attention of the last 10 rows , as well as my pantyhose .
Then I lowered my other leg .
By this time , the rows in front had turned around and were watching too .
Luckily , no one laughed .
I swung down and planted my navy blue pump half on a passenger ’s arm rest and half on his pinstriped leg .
My hat was in the overhead rack , I told him , and I had been digging around for a long time trying to find it .
I pointed out that I had to wear my hat , or I would be fired .
Book Review A- Poem Strip Author Dino Buzzati Publisher NYRB Classics
Based on the Greek mythological story of Orpheus and Eurudice , Dino Buzzati ’s pioneering graphic novel Poem Strip was originally published in Italy in 1969 ( as Poema A Fumetti ) , and it ’s surprising that it ’s taken four decades to see print in the U.S. — Marina Harss ’ English translation is its first .
Comics have been described as movies on paper , and this one reads like a rock ’ n ’ roll - sexploitation - fantasy - occult midnight cult favorite .
Advertisement
Poem Strip is mostly an excuse for Buzzati to reimagine Milan as a phantasmagoria as alluring as any of the artists he liberally borrows from :
His plot centers on a guitar - carrying young male singer who pines for the love of his life , the spectral Eura , and literally goes to hell and back to find her .
( Buzzati ’s prefatory note cites a number of painters , filmmakers , and photographers — including Salvador Dali , Irving Klaw , F.W. Murnau , Hans Bellmer , and Federico Fellini — for “ their valuable input ” to specific pages . )
Buzzati ’s linework is wonderfully loose , but always concise .
One agent of the underworld looks to be modeled on James Dean , then the young Ronald Reagan , though his green coloring keeps him identifiable ; even Buzzati ’s super - long - shot stick figures have a wiggly , wriggling life .
This being Italy in the swinging late ’ 60s , there ’s a lot of sexuality on display : Buzzati clearly reveled in drawing nude women , setting one passage in a brothel ( whose host , humorously , is an uninhabited , anthropomorphic overcoat ) and crafting several of his more disturbing images around sexual torture , as with his simultaneously gauzy and hellish rendering , largely in dots , of a nude woman in the shape of a rubber duck .
( Eura seems to have left her clothes behind in the afterworld as well . )
Buzzati intersperses these with several outright classical images , such as the classical Greek profile , times seven , of our hero asking to see Eura , as well as more modernist touches like the buildings of Milan ’s Via Saterna collapsing into each other after he knocks on the door Eura has entered .
The writing itself can be windy — surrealism does n’t always translate well .
But Buzzati ’s eye - stopping linework makes up for that .
End - of - the - world doomsayers and brand - new - day optimists are locked in a heated debate over what 's likely to happen in the coming year — a divergence of opinion that some market veterans say is the worst they 've ever seen .
" You have Nobel Prize laureates on either side of the bull - bear equation with arguments that are as forceful and cogent on either side , " says Quincy Krosby , general market strategist for Prudential Financial .
" If you 're a retail investor you listen to this and you wonder : Which way are we going ? "
The market 's 60 percent rally off its March lows , coupled with gradually improving economic data , has done little to settle the argument .
In fact , questions over whether the positive signs are for real or merely the product of a cheap US dollar and government stimulus have only intensified the dogfight .
" They do n't believe the perma - bulls or the perma - bears , " Krosby says .
" They pay attention to the economists who are pretty practical , who change their minds when the information changes . "
" That said , " she adds , " the divide between the bulls and bears on macroeconomic forecasts is intense .
I have n't quite seen anything like it . "
Indeed , the condition of the economy — not the stock market — could well be the more fractious of the debates .
The amount of money flowing into stock funds has consistantly shown that investors do n't buy completely into the rally , though the numbers seem to be swinging a bit .
Individual investors cut cash holdings to 19 percent of total assets in October , the lowest level since July 2007 , according to the American Association of Individual Investors .
Yet even with that trend , investors are putting more of their money into emerging market and commodity funds , with net outflow from US funds at $ 8 billion in October .
Confusion over what to do is only natural considering that stocks lost more than half their value from October 2007 to March 2009 .
" Usually when you 've gone through a downturn , there 's the getting - out - even mentality , " says John Buckingham , chief investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management in Laguna Beach , Calif .
" Most people are n't back to even .
There 's still a lot of concern , a lot of fear about what the future will bring . "
Surveys show that investors are as divided about the future as the pros .
The most recent AAII Sentiment Survey , for the week ended Nov. 12 , found bulls and bears equally divided at 38.6 percent , with 22.8 percent neutral .
The previous week had bears at 55.6 percent and bulls at 22.2 percent , but previous weeks showed the divided considerably closer .
Market analysts usually view a high level of bearishness as a contrarian " buy " signal as that generally means when market indicators turn , it will force short - sellers into long positions and boost the market 's value .
As such , should the pessimists start winning the sentiment war , that could be a good signal for the market .
" The data bear out the contrarians , " Prudential 's Krosby says .
" If you 're a contrarian you actually want to see more negative sentiment regarding the markets .
The more bullish these surveys the more you 've got to question the strength of the rally and the duration of the rally .
For the market to move higher , you need new buyers . "
Dealing with investors in such times requires a delicate calculus for advisors who must convince clients to stick with their investment strategies and not be misled by market noise .
" There 's a tremendous amount of angst about where the economy is going to be next year and whether or not this is a good opportunity to take some profits , " says David Twibell , president of wealth management for Colorado Capital Bank in Denver .
" There 's more confusion among investors than I 've probably ever seen . "
Bulgaria 's Health Ministry announced Friday afternoon the declaration of a state of national swine flu epidemic over the rising number of patients with A( H1N1 ) .
The Health Ministry made the decision based on the grounds that the number of people with swine flu has reached 210 per 10 000 .
On Thursday , Bulgaria 's Health Minister Bozhidar Nanev announced a little over 100 000 Bulgarians were infected with A( H1N1 ) .
Thus , all schools in Bulgaria will be in a swine flu break all of next week ( November 9 - 14 ) .
The Health Ministry recommends limiting the number and scope of public events .
Any decisions for closing nursery schools and universities over the epidemic will be made on the local level .
There will be no mandatory closing of cinemas , theaters , libraries , or other public facilities despite the declaration of a national epidemic .
The news from the Health Ministry came shortly after the Bulgarian capital Sofia declared a swine flu epidemic starting Monday .
Thus , 20 of Bulgaria 's 28 administrative districts had declared swine flu epidemic before the news for the national emergency .
Earlier on Friday it was announced that a 53 - year - old man had died in a hospital in Sofia as a result of complications of the A( H1N1 ) virus , bringing Bulgaria ’s total swine flu death toll to six .
According to Chief Health Inspector Tencho Tenev , the man had schizophrenia and cirrhosis .
He did treat himself at home for a week , when he finally saw a doctor , and was taken to hospital in critical condition .
As the epidemic has been worsening , Bulgaria 's MPs adopted Friday emergency amendments to the Medical Products in Human Medicine Act .
The aim of the amendments is to simplify the regime for purchasing medical products with state funds outside of the mandatory health insurance system in a time when the country is facing " epidemics , pandemics , or confirmed use of chemical and biological weapons , or the spread of nuclear radiation . "
The MPs were in a rush because of what has been termed " a rising tension " in the Bulgarian society because of the fast spread of the A( H1N1 ) virus and the lack of any vaccines .
Bulgaria 's Health Minister , Bozhidar Nanev , has said that the legislative changes were going to shorten the period for getting and applying the swine flu vaccines by between 1 and 3 months .
Bulgaria 's Chief Epidemiologist , Angel Kunchev , has told the BNT that unfortunately there were no A( H1N1 ) vaccines available in Bulgaria at the moment but said that medications and vaccines would soon be procured from Germany and Sweden .
Young children , doctors , pregnant women , and people with chronic diseases will be the priorities group for immunization .
Kunchev has called upon all Bulgarians to still get the regular seasonal flu shots .
In his words , the only vaccines available in drug stores are Tamiflu and Relenza .
Ha , using a corrupt branch of government to fight a corrupt government administration eh ?
Why bother ?
You may as well give up .
The level of corruption and outright fraud are beyond the reach of any form of justice now , stop fooling yourselves , and stop believing in romantic delusions of revolution that cannot nor will ever happen .
Trust me , I know it is a fight that can't be won period .
Fear the dark side of our government , they truly are capable of evils that would make Satan himself envious .
As for the American people , your best position going forward is one that has you bent over and ready to take it ...
Because you are all going to be so screwed , and most of you will feel good about it .
It 's the right thing to do , saving the climate , reforming health care and giving up your freedom , your money , your jobs , your opportunity , all in exchange for a life of dependence on a government of a dying nation .
Yes , it is time to bend over America . [ edit on 22-11-2009 by Walkswithfish ]
NEW YORK , Nov 19 ( Reuters ) - U.S. mortgage delinquency rates and the percentage of loans that entered the foreclosure process jumped in the third quarter , with both reaching record highs , the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Thursday .
The percentage of loans on which foreclosure actions were started rose to 1.42 percent in the third quarter , an all - time high and up from 1.36 percent in the second quarter .
Rising U.S. unemployment propelled more mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures , a trend that will continue into next year , the MBA said .
“ It is all about unemployment , everything else is secondary , ” MBA ’s chief economist Jay Brinkmann said in an interview .
“ We expect unemployment to keeping rising into the first quarter of 2010 , which means we will most likely see even higher rates of delinquencies and foreclosures , ” he said .
The delinquency rate for mortgage loans on one - to - four - unit residential properties rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 9.64 percent of all loans outstanding as of the end of the third quarter of 2009 , up 40 basis points from the second quarter and up 265 basis points from one year ago , the MBA said in its National Delinquency Survey .
The delinquency rate broke the record set last quarter .
The records are based on MBA data dating back to 1972 .
Do you think ideas do n’t matter , that what people believe about themselves and their world has no real consequence ?
If so , the following will not bug you in the slightest .
A new BBC poll finds that only 11 percent of people questioned around the world — and 29,000 people were asked their opinions — think that free - market capitalism is a good thing .
The rest believe in more government regulation .
Only a small percentage of the world ’s population believes that capitalism works well and that more regulation will reduce efficiency .
One - quarter of those asked said that capitalism is “ fatally flawed . ”
In France , 43 percent believe this .
In Mexico , it is 38 percent .
A majority believes that government should rob the rich to give money to poor countries .
In only one country , Turkey , did a majority say that less government is better .
It gets even worse .
While most Europeans and Americans think it was a good thing for the Soviet Union to disintegrate , people in India , Indonesia , Ukraine , Pakistan , Russia , and Egypt mostly think it was a bad thing .
Yes , you read that right : millions freed from socialist slavery : bad thing .

That news must lift the heart of every would - be despot the world over .
And it comes as something of a shock twenty years after the collapse of socialism in Russia and Eastern Europe revealed what this system had created : backward societies with citizens who lived short and miserable lives .
Then there is the China case , a country rescued from bloody barbarism under communism and transformed into a modern and prosperous country by capitalism .
What can we learn ?
Far from not having learned anything , people have largely forgotten the experience and have developed a love for the ancient fairytale that all things can be fixed through collectivism and central planning .
As to those who would despair at this poll , consider that it might have been much worse were it not for the efforts of a relative handful of intellectuals who have fought against socialist theory for more than a century .
It might have been 99 % in support of socialist tyranny .
So there is no sense in saying that these intellectual efforts are wasted .
Ideas also have a life of their own .
They can lie in waiting for decades or centuries and then one day , the whole of history turns on a dime .
Especially these days , no effort goes to waste .
Publications and essays , or any form of education , is immortalized , ready for the taking by a desperate world .

As for the opinion poll , we have no idea just how intensely these views are held or even what they mean .
What , for example , is capitalism ?
Do people even know ?
Michael Moore does n’t know , else he would n’t be calling bailouts for elite , Fed - connected financial firms a form of capitalism .
Many other people reduce the term capitalism to : “ the system of economics in the U.S. ”
It is no more complicated than that .
This is despite the reality that the U.S. has a comprehensive planning apparatus in place that is directly responsible for all our current economic troubles .
Now , let ’s take this further .
Among the people around the world who do not like the U.S. empire , many believe they do n’t like capitalism either .
If the U.S. economy drags the world down into recession , that is a prime example of capitalism ’s failure .
Even more preposterous , if you did n’t like George W. Bush , his ways and his cronies , and Obama is something of a relief , then you do n’t like capitalism and you do like socialism .
Another point of view misunderstands the idea of capitalism itself .
It is not about creating economic structures that benefit capital at the expense of labor or culture or religion .
It is about a system that protects the rights of everyone and serves the common good .
Capitalism is just the name that happened to be identified with this system .
If you want to call freedom a banana , fine .
What matters is not words but ideas .
I do know that none of these messed - up definitions of capitalism follow .
You know this too .
But for the world at large , serious ideological analytics are not the animating force of daily life .
Many people attach themselves to vague slogans .

Further , as Rothbard has forcefully argued , free - market capitalism serves no more than a symbolic purpose for the Republican Party and for conservatives .
Economic liberty is the utopia that they keep promising to bring us , pending the higher priority of blowing up foreign peoples , jailing political dissidents , crushing the left wing on campus , and routing the Democrats .
Once all of this is done , they say , then they will get to the instituting of a free - market economic system .
Of course , that day never arrives , and it is not supposed to .

All of which leaves true capitalism — a product of the voluntary society and the sum total of all the exchanges and cooperative acts of people all over the world — with few actual intellectual defenders .
They are growing , but the educational work we need to do is daunting , and we are facing the most powerful forces in the world .
There is nothing new in this .
In the history of the world , freedom is the exception , not the rule .
It must be fought for anew in every generation .
Its enemies are everywhere , but the leading enemy is ignorance .
For this reason , the main weapon we have at our disposal is education .
Education includes explaining that socialism is an unworkable idea .
There is nothing better than Ludwig von Mises ’s 1922 book Socialism , a comprehensive presentation of the fallacy of the socialist idea .
Another essential work is the Black Book of Communism .
Here we have a wake - up call that shows that the dream of socialism is actually a bloody nightmare .
Then there is the issue of the positive case for capitalism .
One can do no better than Mises ’s own Human Action , which is not likely to ever be surpassed as a treatise on the free economy .
True , it is not for everyone .
And that ’s fine .
There are many primers out there too .
The fashion for socialism and the opposition to capitalism should alarm every lover of freedom the world over .
We have our jobs cut out for us , but with numbers this bad , it is not difficult to make a difference .
Every blow you can land for free markets helps protect freedom from its enemies .

Virtually every novelist in America fantasizes about being picked to appear on Oprah Winfrey ’s talk show .
But now an increasing number of writers have discovered a new champion : Glenn Beck , the outspoken media darling of populist conservatism .
On his radio show and cable television programs , first on CNN Headline News and now on the Fox News Channel , Mr. Beck has enthusiastically endorsed dozens of novelists , a majority of them writing in the thriller genre .
Mr. Beck , who now attracts 9 million weekly listeners on radio and 2.7 million daily viewers on television , often selects authors whose plots or characters reflect political stances that mirror his own .
But he also promotes the work of authors who may disagree with many of his views .
“ He ’s our Oprah , ” said Brad Thor , a writer of political thrillers who has appeared on Mr. Beck ’s radio and television programs several times .
“ God love him , we ’re very fortunate . ”
At a time when the book industry is struggling to maintain , much less increase , sales , publishers and authors say an appearance on Mr. Beck ’s television or radio programs helps attract new readers .
After James Rollins , the author of “ The Doomsday Key , ” a thriller about a group of Defense Department scientists trying to solve an ancient mystery , appeared this past summer on Mr. Beck ’s radio program and then his television show  on which Mr. Beck promised viewers “ it will keep you on the edge of your seat  Mr. Rollins met several people at a book signing who told him they had bought the book based on that recommendation , he said .

Any Health Care Reform That Is n't Medicare For All Is Just A Fraud On The American People
A new video every week .
Check back !
The whole premise of the American people consenting to being forced to buy health care insurance in a new government insurance " market " was that there would at least be an option for us to participate in an economical public plan .
Now , at that last minute , the one thing that the American people were counting on has been chased out the door by the Senate .
And President Barack Obama now says this is what he always had in mind .
Our president promised he would keep the insurance companies honest , and we believed him .
Now without even a token fight he has surrendered the one thing that would actually protect the American people from corporate price gouging .
Indeed , he ORDERED Congress to take out the proposed Medicare buy - in , and even any semblance of a public option , from the bill .
Tell Barack Obama and your members of Congress the Medicare buy - in option must be put back into the bill .
There must be a real and robust public plan , and not just a feeble impersonation of one .

Dennis Gartman addresses the critical issue of Illinois and the downgrade of its debt yesterday by Moody's .
Essentially , Illinois is in line to become the next California , if not already :
The Gartman Letter : Regarding the Illinois downgrade , Moody ’s downgraded Illinois ’ general obligation bond rating from A1 to A2 and cited Illinois ’ problems stemming from the U.S. recession .
Making matters worse , Moody ’s also cut other Illinois bond ratings from A1 to A2 including sales tax revenue bonds , also cut to A2 London from A1 .
In the process , Moody ’ has taken Illinois ’ rating to the second lowest in the US , ranking it just above California Baa1 .
In so doing , Moody ’s said that the state has not yet taken action of any sort to deal with the budget gap that it is facing ... a gap that Moody 's says shall be on the order of $ 11 billion or more than one third of its total expenditures .
Moody 's said that The downgrades are the result of high structural imbalances and little time to effect modifications to the budget in the current fiscal year , which ends June 30 , 2010 , as well as evidence of significant weakening in the state 's 2009 results .
The problem here is not just one that Illinois is suffering through , for if Illinois , with a double digit unemployment rate is downgraded , what then of Michigan ; what then of Nevada ; what then of Ohio perhaps ?
The point here is that “ There is never just one cockroach . ”
This problem in California , now in Illinois , is going to spread to other states very , very quickly , for once Moody ’s has the courage to make the credit change there , it will be swift to make the same changes to the credit ratings of these other states too .

El Consejo Nacional de Seguridad P�blica acord� crear una comisi�n que revise el modelo de organizaci�n policial en el pa�s , luego de que el presidente Felipe Calder�n pidi� examinar el esquema actual “ para hacer frente y derrotar a una criminalidad sin escr�pulos y sin territorios delimitados ” .
El mandatario record � que la sociedad civil y los gobiernos estatales han planteado la necesidad de fortalecer las polic�as estatales y municipales , en muchos casos superadas por la delincuencia organizada .
Calder�n inaugur� ayer la sesi�n 27 del Consejo .
Propuso analizar la posibilidad de tener cuerpos policiales “ m�s compactos , mejor organizados , mejor vigilados , con mayor capacidad de fuego y log�stica que los actuales ” .
Calder�n reconoci� que las polic�as municipales enfrentan serias limitaciones ante el poder de intimidaci�n del crimen , por lo que se requiere fortalecer los eslabones m�s fr�giles de la cadena de protecci�n ciudadana .
Un diagn�stico preliminar de la Secretar�a de Seguridad P�blica afirma que unas mil 200 corporaciones municipales no tienen m�s de 30 integrantes , por lo que las funciones de seguridad que cumplen podr�an ser absorbidas por la polic �a estatal .
La dependencia estim� que el nuevo modelo , que plantea unir las aproximadamente 2 mil 100 corporaciones municipales en 32 grupos estatales , podr�a funcionar a m�s tardar en 18 meses .
El proyecto plantea la creaci�n de polic�as estatales fuertes y s�lidas , pero tambi�n prev� mantener en operaci�n las corporaciones municipales s�lo si cumplen esas caracter�sticas , pero bajo control de los cuerpos de los estados , y con la cobertura de la Polic�a Federal .
Los gobernadores de Tabasco , Andr�s Granier ; de Veracruz , Fidel Herrera , y del estado de M�xico , Enrique Pe�a Nieto , apoyaron la propuesta .
Recomendaron tomar en cuenta experiencias de polic�as unitarias exitosas , como la Montada de Canad� , los carabineros de Chile y la Nacional de Espa�a .
Charities and other nonprofits may put their brand at risk when they partner with corporations on social responsibility ( CSR ) initiatives .
The public can easily construe such connections as a seal of approval of the corporation by the nonprofit .
That 's what two marketing professors found when they examined consumer perceptions in a controlled experiment .
" Our results suggest that some CSR initiatives may produce consumer inferences that are wrong but desirable for the company , " says Stacy Landreth Grau , associate professor of marketing in the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth .
" And these inferences can have potentially negative consequences for the nonprofit . "
" Explicit Donations and Inferred Endorsements : Do Corporate Social Responsibility Initiatives Suggest a Nonprofit Organization Endorsement ? , " by Amanda B. Bower , a marketing professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia , and Stacy Landreth Grau of TCU , appears in the Fall 2009 issue of the Journal of Advertising .
The professors designed an experiment with a fictional childhood learning company .
They created variations of a print ad with several levels of connection to a pair of fictional nonprofits : the Alliance Against Childhood Obesity and the Alliance for Early Literacy .
Some ads had only the nonprofit 's logo on them .
That 's a simple licensing agreement .
Other ads promised a donation to the nonprofit when the consumer made a product purchase .
This is called cause - related marketing .
Still other ads featured explicit seals of approval where the promotion included a specific endorsement by the nonprofit organization .
Then they asked respondents a series of questions about the ads .
The most surprising finding was that respondents made little distinction in the level of endorsement .
" An explicit seal of approval statement was not necessary for consumers to assume a seal of approval , " says TCU 's Grau .
" The mere presence of a nonprofit logo was enough to infer endorsement . "
That should be a warning sign to nonprofits , many of which have policies like the American Cancer Society 's forbidding use of their logo " … in any way that would imply endorsement of the company . "
Previous studies , says Bower , have established that companies benefit from improved product evaluations when they partner with nonprofits .
There has been little research , however , into what happens to the " brand " of the nonprofit in such situations — until now .
" For nonprofits , licensing arrangements appear to be a risky type of CSR initiative , " says Grau .
" The perception of …the licensing agreement was not significantly different from the explicit seal of approval condition . "
She cautions that a firm 's participation in a licensing agreement could be one way for the company to get the " seal of approval " from a nonprofit that does not grant endorsements .
An estimated $ 1.5 billion was spent in 2008 by companies on CSR initiatives with nonprofits , according to the Cause Marketing Forum .
Nonprofits typically believe these alliances increase their visibility and reach , add to their bottom line , and further their mission .

Alonso tops the podium after the race
An investigation by the FIA has led to Formula One team Renault to be called to appear before the World Motor Sport Council to answer a race fixing allegation .
The charge stems from last year 's Singapore Grand Prix .
Renault Fernando Alonso won the race after taking an early refuelling stop .
Fellow Renault driver Nelson Piquet Jr. then crashed , causing a safety car to come out .
One by one the cars ahead of Alonso pitted for fuel , allowing him to move up from nineteenth to take victory .
Piquet 's wrecked car is removed from the track
Piquet has always maintained that the crash was an accident .
If the charges are upheld , the punishments could include a fine , exclusion from races or complete disqualification from the current championship .
Renault are due to appear before the council in Paris on September 21st , days before this year 's race in Singapore .
The team has refused to comment before the hearing .
Renault have already been in trouble this season , being suspended for one race after releasing Alonso 's car with an unsafe wheel , which came off on the track .
The team succeeded in appealing this .

Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer went on the offensive against Apple in a recent interview , stating that Windows has gained market share on OS X , and that the browser Safari is a " rounding error . "
In the third part of an interview with TechCrunch , Ballmer said that he believes the higher price of Mac hardware has turned away some consumers .
He said the lower price of Windows 7 is meant to meet the current economic climate .
" Weâ re gaining share .
Apple is expensive , " Ballmer said .
" And in tough economic environment , people get it .
Their model is , by definition , expensive .
And weâve actually held or maybe even gained just a tiny bit of share relative to the Mac in the last 12 months .
And itâs not really Snow Leopard .
Itâs really Windows PCs versus Mac . "
Since the debut of new MacBook Pros with cheaper prices this summer , Apple has seen its sales grow , while the rest of the PC industry has shrunk .
In July , Apple was the fourth - largest computer maker in the U.S. Mac sales are expected to continue to expand in the just - concluded September quarter .
And at $ 29 , Snow Leopard , Apple 's new operating system , comes at a much cheaper price than Windows 7 .
Initial sales figures showed that OS has had sales twice as high as Leopard and four times better than Tiger .
However , earlier this year , Mac sales were relatively flat before new products were released .
And the popularity of netbooks has been a growing market for PC makers .
In his interview , Ballmer said that netbooks are " just the first battleground . "
Another fight for Microsoft lies in the world of browsers , where Firefox has made significant inroads on Internet Explorer .
Ballmer acknowledged the success that Firefox has had , but also took the opportunity to discredit the market share of Google Chrome and Apple 's Safari .
" The most successful by far is Firefox , " he said .
" Chrome is a rounding error to date .
Safari is a rounding error to date .
But Firefox is not . "
The Microsoft chief executive used similar language in July , when he told financial analysts that the rate of Mac adoption is statistically insignificant .
He said quarter - to - quarter market share changes between Windows and OS X amount to a " rounding error . "
HOW FDA , BIG PHARMA , AND DOCTORS CAUSE INJURY FOR PROFIT
By Byron J. Richards , CCN
November 4 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
In some ways the health care in America is the finest in the world .
In other ways it is a severe risk to health , even deadly .
The dark side of this issue involves medication profits at the expense of human health .
This questionable health care approach costs at least 200 billion dollars a year and involves the costs of the drugs themselves , the injuries they cause , and the appropriate law suits that follow .
The perpetrators of this fraud are the pharmaceutical companies acting in tandem with the FDA , doctors paid under the table by Big Pharma , and gullible doctors willing to write off - label prescriptions based on the hype they hear from doctors on the take and Big Pharma sales reps .
Creating a market demand for this fraud is a health care system that blindly pays for it .
This issue is causing millions of injuries a year and tens of thousands of deaths .
It makes the Ponzi scheme run by Bernie Madoff pale in comparison .
It is ruining the legitimate health care needs of a nation .
Any expansion of mandatory health care funding will only make it worse , since the current scheme is set to feed off patients who do n’t pay full price ( or often any price ) for the medications they “ need . ”
The scandals involving inappropriate use of medications are so numerous they defy believability , with FDA management either tacitly allowing or actively helping the various drug companies .
The FDA has a long history of pretense dating back to its inception over 100 years ago .
It is part of the DNA of the FDA ’s dysfunctional culture .
FDA managers act in a revolving door capacity with the various industries they are supposed to be regulating .
What FDA mangers actually do is more akin to the activities of a police - force bully .
They seek to knock out competition for their friends in Big Pharma , Big Biotech , and Big Food , while acting as the gatekeepers of profits for the chosen few – often in disregard of the health consequences .
It was only a few years ago that the FDA did n’t even know what drugs it had approved to be on the market .
Far worse , the FDA is quite lax on requiring the mandatory follow - up safety testing for the drugs that have been approved .
On October 26 , 2009 the Government Accountability Office released a report blasting the FDA on this issue .
The lack of FDA due diligence has resulted in a situation wherein doctors and patients do not have a clear picture of the actual risks of virtually any drug , including the blockbusters in common use ( such as birth control pills ) .
Big Pharma would rather not do these studies because when they do they often show the drug is far more dangerous than previously thought – which typically causes a drop in sales .
Why would any drug company want to shoot itself in the foot ?
The negative data submitted to the FDA during the drug approval process is seldom ever published in any meaningful way or context .
Rather , Big Pharma ensures that mostly the positive studies submitted to the FDA find their way into the literature .
Again , this skews the public understanding of the drug .
FDA management has been known to coerce and threaten its scientists to suppress negative news about drugs , often over - ruling their scientists so that a dangerous drug can be put on the market .
Such FDA management coercion of its own scientific staff came into full public view when it was discovered how Avandia , a diabetes drug , could get on the market without any warning that it causes heart failure
A classic example of Big Pharma intentionally suppressing the negative studies so as to paint a false rosy picture of a medication ’s benefits are the anti-depressants .
In fact , the entire theory of the use of antidepressants upon which FDA - approved drug dispensing is based has recently been called into question .
Yet , these near - useless drugs are top sellers to our children .
The FDA yawns when antidepressant use is strongly linked to heart disease .
Advertisement
The issue is complicated by the fact that the scientific literature was intended as a communication format between doctors , scientists , and other health professionals .
It was never intended to have defense mechanisms against large financial interests trying to game the system for profit .
The pharmaceutical industry ghostwrites many of the studies that promote the values of its drugs .
Doctors and scientists put their names on the studies for a fee .
Celebrity doctors are paid large amounts by Big Pharma to act as sales reps at “ scientific ” conferences .
Universities and researchers who might publish negative data know they will be blacklisted from Big Pharma research spending in the future .
Many doctors are on the Big Pharma payroll , taking what amounts to bribes , kickbacks , and other “ gifts . ”
All doctors are subjected to intense Big Pharma propaganda as a major part of their training in medical school .
A drug company does n’t even have to prove a drug fixes anything .
Drugs simply have to prove they can move numbers on paper ( surrogate endpoints ) .
This lax standard of effectiveness causes individuals to go on drugs to change numbers , take more drugs due to the side effects of the ones they are taking , and before long they are on ten drugs that do n’t fix anything – piling on cost to the health care system and taxpayers .
Once drugs are on the market , Big Pharma uses all manner of illegal marketing to create buzz and demand for their drugs in ways that have never been tested for safety ( off - label use ) .
Some regulatory action has been taken in recent months against these crimes , although the damage is already done and the false markets have been created as doctors seem to have little ethical concern writing prescriptions for uses that have never been demonstrated as safe or effective .
And then the Big Pharma lobby goes to work trying to get laws passed to expand its market ( even tagetting children ) .
Big Pharma builds the cost of the fines into the cost of the drugs , which are paid for in higher health care costs and taxes .
It is how Big Pharma does business .
The FDA is impotent in defending the public from harm .
It has been proven that all the newer drugs of the past decade are twice as likely to injure .
While the FDA manages to report on the problem , it fails to do anything effective about it ( which is how they plea to get more funding from Congress to spend on their pet projects , not safety ) .
This shifts the burden of demonstrating proof of harm to lawyers representing individuals who have been harmed and independent , poorly funded researchers who must risk the wrath of their colleagues to shine a light lot on huge problems .
Such researchers are often operating without the original data submitted to the FDA .
It takes years to pin down a problem .
By then , the drug in question has already made its money ( and caused its harm ) or its patent is about to expire ( meaning it is no longer a top priority for the drug company ) .
Even when researchers present their findings of rather alarming harm , the FDA management yawns , drags its feet several more years , and then waters down its findings on the obvious problems so as to limit legal liability for its friends .
The examples of the drugs involved in this fraudulent charade are numerous , and especially involve drugs known as blockbusters ( the big sellers ) .
One of the most egregious examples is the atypical anti-psychotic medications – poisoning our children and elderly with unthinkable off - label use that is incredibly damaging to health .
The atypical anti-psychotics include Zyprexa ( Eli Lilly ) , Seroquel ( AstraZeneca ) , Risperdal ( Johnson & Johnson ) , Geodon ( Pfizer ) , and a handful of others .
Since Eli Lilly knew that Zyprexa caused diabetes and did n’t let patients know this , they have already settled numerous “ failure to warn ” lawsuits totaling 1.2 billion dollars .
This year they agreed to another 1.42 billion , $ 615 million to settle the Justice Department ’s criminal investigation and approximately $ 800 million to settle the civil investigations brought by the states for Medicaid fraud .
“ Specifically , the plea states that Lilly promoted Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia , including Alzheimer ’s dementia , although Zyprexa is not approved for such uses , ” the company said in a statement .
Eli Lilly agreed to a misdemeanor charge , which is apparently the new standard for what a drug company gets when it kills elderly Americans ( previously it was nothing ) .
A May 2009 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine shows that even a single dose of anti-psychotic medication to an elderly patient doubles the risk of a serious adverse event leading to hospitalization and / or death .

Anti-psychotics have become popular for their off - label use as the “ drug of obedience . ”
If you want a zombie , give the person an atypical anti-psychotic .
They became incredibly popular in nursing homes , especially if a senior citizen arrived upset at the idea of being put in a nursing home .
Or to keep patients with dementia from stirring up trouble .
Likewise , children in orphanages are another popular target .
These are extremely expensive drugs paid for by Medicare and Medicaid ( taxpayers ) .
On October 29 , 2009 AstraZeneca reached a $ 520 million agreement to settle two federal investigations and two whistle - blower lawsuits regarding Seroquel .
One of the investigations was over improper activity of physicians involved in Seroquel clinical trials , apparently hiding the results of a negative drug trial prior to FDA approval and the other was over off - label use resulting in many children and elderly taking Seroquel .
Pfizer has agreed to pay $ 2.3 billion to settle criminal and civil liability due to its illegal off - label promotion of Bextra ( a painkiller already pulled from the market ) , Geodon ( like Zyprexa , an atypical anti-psychotic that injures children ) , Zyvox ( an antibiotic ) , and Lyrica ( an epilepsy drug ) .
Pfizer will plead guilty to one felony count violation of the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act for misbranding Bextra with the intent to defraud .
Geodon has a smaller percentage of the 12 - billion - dollar - a - year poisoning campaign of our children and elderly , pulling in around $ 750 million .
It was widely promoted in an off - label manner for ADHD and behavioral issues facing children - a market that has been fraudulently created and continues to rack up sales .
And this past week Risperdol went on trial for its off - label uses .
The opening day of testimony saw one of its salesman admit he promoted the drug for off - label uses and did so knowing what he was doing was illegal – expect another large settlement .
While these settlements seem large they are costs that are passed on to the health care system as part of the price of the drug .
Off - label financial penalties are nothing more than a marketing cost .
And once the market is created doctors keep prescribing the medications for off - label use , thereby sustaining sales far in excess of any penalty .
None of these financial penalties is as the result of FDA actions .
To the contrary , in the midst of major controversy the FDA was found encouraging the use of these drugs on children !
It is the lawsuits that are defending public safety because the FDA does not do its job .
And then there are the independent studies that finally prove what the FDA likely knew over a decade ago .
This past week a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that children taking atypical anti-psychotic medication gained on average 18 pounds in 12 weeks .
The shocking part of the study was not the massive weight gain – it was that it took over a decade for independent researchers to prove what the FDA and Big Pharma already knew .
Needless to say , these children are on a fast track to heart disease , as changes in their LDL cholesterol and triglycerides clearly indicated .
The anti-psychotic medications serve as an example of the disregard for human health on the part of Big Pharma , the FDA , doctors and psychiatrists on the take , and those standing ready with their off - label Rx pads .
Tens of billions in fraudulent profit has been made and continues to pile up .
There are numerous other blockbuster drugs with similar sordid tales .
This is how business is done .
It is fraud .
The FDA drags its feet and will continue to drag its feet , regardless of what studies are published .
The FDA management is part of the fraud .
In the short term the only way to stop this fraud is to prevent federal programs ( Medicare and Medicaid ) and insurance companies from paying for any off - label medication use .
Also in the near term , off - label prescribing laws need to be drastically changed to protect the public .
The use of all types of psychotropic medications on children needs to be drastically curtailed or outright banned .
Over the next five to ten years medications already on the market need to prove their safety and actually prove they fix something in a definable period of time .
If all a drug can do is change numbers it is , once again , nothing that taxpayers and insurance companies should have to pay for .

It ’s as a chronicle of Carver ’s growth as a writer that Sklenicka ’s book is invaluable , particularly after his career path crossed that of the editor Gordon Lish , the self - styled “ Captain Fiction . ”
Any readers who doubt Lish ’s baleful influence on the stories in “ What We Talk About When We Talk About Love ” are apt to think differently after reading Sklenicka ’s eye - opening account of this difficult and ultimately poisonous relationship .
Those still not convinced can read the corresponding stories in “ Beginners , ” now available in the sublimely portable and long - overdue “ Raymond Carver : Collected Stories . ”
In 1972 , Lish changed the title of Car­ver ’s second Esquire story — which he edited heavily — from “ Are These Actual Miles ? ” ( interesting and mysterious ) to “ What Is It ? ” ( boring ) .
When Carver , wild to be published in a major slick , decided to accept the changes , Maryann accused him “ of being a whore , of selling out to the establishment . ”
John Gardner had once told Carver that line - editing was not negotiable .
Carver may have accepted that — most writers willing to submit to the editing process do — but Lish ’s changes were wide and deep .
Car­ver argued that “ a major magazine publication was worth the compromise . ”
Lish , who tried unsuccessfully to edit Leonard Gardner ( who would go on to write “ Fat City ” ) with a similarly heavy hand , got his way with Carver .
It was a harbinger .
Was Gordon Lish a good editor ?
Undoubtedly .
Curtis Johnson , a textbook editor who introduced Lish to Carver , claims that Lish had “ infallible taste in fiction . ”
But , as Maryann feared , he was — in Ray Carver ’s case , at least — much better at discovery than development .
And with Carver , he got what he wanted .
Perhaps he sensed an essential weakness at Carver ’s core ( “ people - pleasing ” is what recovering alcoholics call it ) .
Perhaps it was the strangely elitist view he seems to have held of Carver ’s writing , branding the characters “ grossly inept ” and speaking of “ their blatant illiteracies , of which Carver himself was unaware . ”
This did not stop him from taking credit for Car­ver ’s success ;
Lish is said to have bragged that Car­ver was “ his creature , ” and what appears on the back jacket of “ Will You Please Be Quiet , Please ? ” ( 1976 ) , Car­ver ’s first book of stories , is not Raymond Car­ver ’s photograph but Gordon Lish ’s name .

Sklenicka ’s account of the changes in Carver ’s third book of stories , “ What We Talk About When We Talk About Love ” ( 1981 ) , is meticulous and heartbreaking .
There were , she says , three versions : A , B and C. Version A was the manuscript Car­ver submitted .
It was titled “ So Much Water So Close to Home . ” B was the manuscript Lish initially sent back .
He changed the name of the story “ Beginners ” to “ What We Talk About When We Talk About Love , ” and that became the new title of the book .
Although Carver was disturbed by this , he nonetheless signed a binding ( and unagented ) contract in 1980 .
Soon after , Version C — the version most readers know — arrived on Carver ’s desk .
The differences between B and C “ astounded ” him .
“ He had urged Lish to take a pencil to the stories , ” Skle­nicka writes .
“ He had not expected . . . a meat cleaver . ”
Unsure of himself , Carver was only three years into sobriety after two decades of heavy drinking ; his correspondence with Lish over the wholesale changes to his work alternated between groveling ( “ you are a wonder , a genius ” ) and outright begging for a return to Version B .
It did no good .
According to Tess Gallagher , Lish refused by telephone to restore the earlier version , and if Carver understood nothing else , he understood that Lish held the “ power of publication access . ”
This Hobson ’s choice is the beating heart of “ Raymond Carver : A Writer ’s Life . ”
Any writer might wonder what he ’d do in such a case .
Certainly I did ; in 1973 , when my first novel was accepted for publication , I was in similar straits : young , endlessly drunk , trying to support a wife and two children , writing at night , hoping for a break .
The break came , but until reading Sklenicka ’s book , I thought it was the $ 2,500 advance Doubleday paid for “ Carrie . ”
Now I realize it may have been not winding up with Gordon Lish as my editor .
One needs only to scan the stories in “ Beginners ” and the ones in “ What We Talk About ” to see the most obvious change : the prose in “ Beginners ” consists of dense blocks of narration broken up by bursts of dialogue ; in “ What We Talk About , ” there is so much white space that some of the stories ( “ After the Denim , ” for instance ) look almost like chapters in a James Patterson novel .
In many cases , the man who did n’t allow editors to change his own work gutted Carver ’s , and on this subject Sklenicka voices an indignation she is either unwilling or unable to muster on Maryann ’s behalf , calling Lish ’s editing of Carver “ a usurpation . ”
He imposed his own style on Carver ’s stories , and the so - called minimalism with which Carver is credited was actually Lish ’s deal .
“ Gordon . . . came to think that he knew everything , ” Curtis Johnson says .
“ It became pernicious . ”
I had subscribers send in some words to inspire some comics .
Kaleidoscope was the first .
Thanks ,
Micha !

If the victim is unable to cough , speak , or breathe , complete the following : Send someone to call 9-1 - 1
Lean person forward and give 5 back blows with heel of your hand .
Give 5 quick abdominal thrusts by placing the thumbside of your fist against the middle of the victim ’s abdomen , just above the navel .
Grab your fist with the other hand .
Repeat until the object the person is choking on is forced out and person breathes or coughs on his or her own .

Debt
Thanksgiving Survival Tip 8 : A Turkey takes longer than a day to Thaw If you ’ve bought a frozen turkey and you have n’t pulled it out of the freezer as your reading this , go do that now .
Those suckers take forever to thaw in the fridge .
You can help speed the process up by filling your freshly cleaned sink with cold water covering the turkey .
This will greatly decrease the thawing time .
Just be sure to change the water every 30 minutes .
Salmonella is not your friend .
The rule of thumb is that it takes 24 hours per 5 pounds in the fridge to thaw and 30 minutes per pound to thaw in the sink .
You can always by a fresh one if it ’s too late , just do n’t go into debt to do it .
Speaking of debt … .

The word " fed " had been written on his chest in magic marker and his Census identification taped to his head .
Rudzinski said investigators concluded Sparkman wrote on his own chest because the letters had been written from bottom to top .
They also found no signs he had struggled with anyone and no one else 's DNA was on evidence recovered at the scene .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the House floor about 6:30 p.m. to say , ' Today we will pass the Affordable Health Care for America Act …
We will make history .
We will also make progress for America 's working families . '
Sources : Pelosi , Dems lock up 218
Hours before an expected vote on a sweeping health care bill , House Democrats believe they 've secured the 218 votes they need to approve the bill , several party insiders said .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the House floor about 6:30 p.m. to say , “ Today we will pass the Affordable Health Care for America Act …
We will make history .
We will also make progress for America 's working families . "

In response to a question about whether the bill would pass when she brought it up , Pelosi told reporters Saturday night , " That is our expectation . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , also on the House floor , called the requirement that individuals purchase insure " the most unconsitutional thing I 've seen in my life . "
Thirty - four Democrats have publicly declared their opposition to the bill , giving party leaders the narrowest possible margin to push the bill across the finish line .
But numerous sources said Democrats believe they do have the votes after a day of intense lobbying of wavering Democrats .
Only one Republican is expected to break ranks and vote yes on the bill , Louisiana Rep. Joseph Cao , who represents a heavily Democratic New Orleans - area previously occupied by indicted former Rep. William Jefferson .
Votes have a tendency to shift in the final hours before a controversial vote , but Democratic leaders were expressing more genuine confidence as the sun set over the Capitol than they had exhibited all week .
Word started spreading around 5 p.m. that leaders had the votes they needed to pass the $ 1.2 trillion bill .
Pelosi had all but predicted passage of a House health reform bill earlier Saturday , following an emotional appeal from President Barack Obama to fellow Democrats urging them to “ answer the call of history ” and vote yes .
But she and her top lieutenants earlier stopped short of saying they had the 218 votes needed for passage – signaling a day of vote - wrangling and arm - twisting that has stretched into Saturday night .
And Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami declined to comment .
“ We are not commenting on whip counts , ” Elshami said .
The stakes for Obama and Pelosi are high – and Obama has made health care his signature legislative priority this year .
But vulnerable Democrats ’ concerns about of backing the $ 1.2 trillion measure increased after Tuesday ’s Democratic election washout and Friday ’s unemployment rate showed unemployment rising above 10 percent for the time in a generation .
Obama urged Democrats not to pass up the chance to make history .
“ Now ’s the time to finish the job , ” Obama said in the Rose Garden , following a 30 - minute closed - door meeting with the House Democratic caucus on Capitol Hill .
“ I reminded them that opportunities like this come around maybe once in a generation , ” Obama said .
“ This is their moment , this is our moment , to live up to the trust that the American people have placed in us — even when it 's hard ; especially when it 's hard .
This is our moment to deliver . ”
In his last - minute appeal in the Cannon House Office Building , Obama steered clear of legislative details to focus on the historic impact of the vote , comparing this reform push to the establishment of Social Security and Medicare – and reminding Democrats that both were criticized by those who predicted they would eventually lead to the country 's collapse .
Obama also reminded them that voting no on the health care bill would n’t insulate them from Republican attacks anyway .
“ Are we going to stop now , or push forward ? ” Obama asked .
“ Push forward , ” a dozen or so Democrats shouted back .
Rep. Joe Crowley ( D - N.Y. ) said he thought Obama may have shifted some undecided Democrats into the " yes " column .
" I think there were a number of folks in there moved by what [ Obama ] said , no question about it , " Crowley said .
Ahead of Obama ’s visit , House leaders won the backing of the nation ’s Catholic bishops for a last - minute abortion compromise , a critical boost that could give the health reform bill enough momentum – and enough votes – for passage Saturday .
“ I think you ’re seeing a level of pragmatism settling in , ” said House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller ( D - Calif. ) of the different factions in his caucus .
“ This is a roll call people will remember for the rest of their lives . ”
" The things that are up in the air now are what happens after final passage — I hope , " said Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , whose House Energy and Commerce Committee moved the legislation .
But one of the chief vote - counters , Rep. James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) , warned , " Anytime you add an amendment to a bill there 's an additional challenge . ”
During the day 's first round of votes to corral support for the bill , Majority Leader Steny Hoyer made a rare appearance in the Speaker 's Lobby , just off the House floor , to look for colleagues .
He told a group of reporters , " I 'm always gun-shy ... At this moment , I 'm counting . "
Abortion flared up as a last - minute obstacle to passage , as anti-abortion members pressed for – and won – a vote on an amendment barring insurance companies that participate in the exchange from covering abortions .
That prompted the letter of support for the compromise from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops .
" Passing this amendment allows the House to meet our criteria of preserving the existing protections against abortion funding in the new legislation , " the bishops wrote in a letter to individual members .
" Most importantly , it will ensure that no government funds will be used for abortion or health plans which include abortion . "
It ’s another bitter pill for liberal Democrats but party leaders are gambling that the amendment will be just the breakthrough they need to secure a majority .
Rep. Marcy Kaptur ( D - Ohio ) says she 'll vote for the bill if the amendment by Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) is adopted but remains undecided if it fails .
" I hope that wo n't happen , " she said .
Stupak said he has about 220 votes for his amendment , making him confident of passage .
Boehner and Reps. Eric Cantor and Mike Pence will all vote “ yes ” on the Stupak amendment and are putting that word out to members , said a senior Boehner aide .
On the left , most Democratic advocates of abortion rights appear likely to swallow hard and vote for a health care overhaul anyway .
“ I do n't believe any of us believe we can hold up what we 've been fighting for ... and that 's health care , " said Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D - N.Y . ) .
Asked whether her allies in the pro-choice movement would support the bill with the Stupak language , Pelosi offered a one - word answer : " Yes . "
Boehner fired a warning shot at Democrats this morning , saying “ we ’re going to do everything we can to try to stop ” the bill from passing .
Boehner did not specify what delay tactics he might employ to try to slow the passage of the bill , but as the leader of the party it is customary that he would have unlimited time to speak on the floor about the bill .
He once read an entire bill on the floor .
“ As the day goes on , we ’re going to do everything we can to make sure this does n’t happen , ” Boehner said .
With a slew of conservative Blue Dog Democrats still on the fence about supporting the legislation , Boehner said several members of his party are talking to “ friends across the aisle ” about their support .
“ We ’re going to see what those who profess to be conservative Democrats are made of , ” said Pence ( R - Ind. ) , House Republican Conference Chair .

Amy lost oxygen to her brain for 15 minutes and was taken to the nearby Conquest Hospital , where she had a baby girl .
The baby , named Summer Louise , died five days after being delivered and Amy was left in a persistent vegetative state after suffering brain damage .
A picture of her mother , Thelma Pickard , kissing her gravely ill daughter on the forehead in hospital highlighted the devastating effects of drug experimentation .
Two years ago Amy featured as part of a BBC documentary titled The Waking Pill after hopes that the drug Zolpidem could help revive her .
Weeks after taking the drug , she began to breathe by herself , instead of through a hole in her throat , she reacted to food and showed signs of awareness .
But , after years of receiving round the clock care , Amy died on October 10 at Mary House care home in Hastings , aged 25 , a Sussex Police spokesman said .
Ms Pickard told the Hastings Observer : " I am in total shock .
Her spirit was so strong .
I have to use that strength to inspire me . "

An old NES that ’s seen better days and does n’t load games at all .
Let ’s fix it up together !
What you ’ll need :
3.8 mm security bit
Brasso
Isopropyl alcohol
Pencil eraser
Q-tips
Cloth rag
Dust , dirt , grime , and what appears to be crusty hunks of dried phlegm .
You never know what you ’ll find stuck on your cartridge ’s connector blade - and that gunk can prevent your games from loading properly .
Removing the layer of filth that builds up on the connectors in your carts is the easiest and quickest way to improve your NES experience .
The best way to clean your carts is to open them up so you can really go to town on the connector blade .
The tricky bit is getting your hands on a tool that ’ll let you open your cartridge so you can give the connectors a serious scrubbing .
The tool you ’re looking for is a 3.8 mm security bit that ’ll work with the special screws on your NES games .
It ’s sometimes called a gamebit , and you can easily find one on sites like eBay and Amazon.com for about $ 6.00 .
Above :
You 'll need a 3.8 mm security bit to open up your NES cartridges
If you get your hands on a security bit , open your cartridge and take the game board out .
Then , just give the connector blade a rub with a pencil eraser .
It ’s that simple .
Wipe off the eraser bits when you ’re done .
You can also go over the connector with a Q - tip dipped in rubbing alcohol .
Wipe off any remaining residue with your cloth rag .
Above :
Some online will try to sell you " special " cleaning solutions for your NES .
Save your money and use a pencil eraser instead
Above :
These household items also work just fine
If you ca n’t get your hands on a security bit , it ’s tough to clean the connector blade with a simple pencil eraser .
However , you can still clean the blades with some Q- tips , Brasso metal polish , and isopropyl alcohol .
Apply the Brasso to your Q-tip and apply the polish to both sides of the blade .
Continue swabbing the blade on both sides .
Next , go over the blade and surrounding area within the lip of the cart with a Q - tip dipped in alcohol several times to remove any residue from the Brasso .
Finally , just go over it one last time with a dry Q - tip to remove any residue from the alcohol .
Above :
If you ca n’t get a security bit , your next best option is to use Q- tips , Brasso , and isopropyl alcohol
Above : Look how much grime we got off with a few quick swabs
What you ’ll need :
Phillips screwdriver
72 - pin connector
A pencil eraser
Cleaning your carts is only the first step in getting your NES to play games properly again .
It does n’t matter how clean your carts are if the inside of your NES is full of dust bunnies and cat hair .
Also , the 72 - pin connector , the part that connects with the blade in your games , is notorious for wearing out .
So we ’re going to walk you through the process of opening upthe console so you can clean it up and replace the 72 - pin connector .
Above : A new 72 - pin connector is easy to find online and will cost you about $ 7 or $ 12 , a small price to pay for a near new NES

The People ’s Republic of China basked in its 60th anniversary on Thursday with jaw - dropping pageantry , but there were no solemn pauses for the lives lost during the Communist Party ’s rise to power  not for the estimated tens of millions who died during the civil war , nor the millions of landlords , Nationalist sympathizers and other perceived enemies who were eradicated during Mao ’s drive to consolidate power .

“ Changchun was like Hiroshima , ” wrote Zhang Zhenglu , a lieutenant colonel in the People ’s Liberation Army who documented the siege in “ White Snow , Red Blood , ” a book that was immediately banned after publication in 1989 .
“ The casualties were about the same .
Hiroshima took nine seconds ; Changchun took five months . ”
The 40,000 who survived did so by eating insects , leather belts and , in some cases , the bodies that littered the streets .
By the time Communist troops took over the city , every leaf and blade of grass had been consumed during the final desperate months .
There are no monuments or markers recalling the events that decimated Changchun ’s populace .
Most young people have no knowledge of the darker aspects of the siege , and the survivors , now in their 70s and 80s , are reluctant to give voice to long - buried trauma .
“ I ’ve always heard that Changchun was captured without bloodshed , ” Li Jiaqi , a 17 - year - old high school student , said as she sat on the steps in front of the city ’s Liberation Memorial .
Chinese scholars have largely steered clear of the subject .
Several historians , when asked about the episode , declined to be interviewed .
Zhou Jiewen , a retired nuclear physicist in Changchun who has become a self - taught expert on the siege , explained that many key details , if widely disseminated , would tarnish the army ’s reputation as defenders of the common man .
Those include shooting civilians who tried to escape the city and ignoring the pleas of mothers holding aloft starving children on the other side of the barbed - wire barricades .
“ To cause so many civilians to die was a great blunder by the P.L.A. and tragedy unparalleled in the civil war , ” Mr. Zhou said .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Job openings fell and layoffs rose in October , according to a government report released Tuesday .
Job seekers still outnumber openings by more than six to one , the greatest differential since the Labor Department began tracking job openings in December 2000 .
Job openings :
There were 2.5 million job openings in October , down 26 % from a year ago , according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The job openings rate , an indicator that compares the nation 's job openings to the number of jobs and openings overall , was unchanged at 1.9 % .
Hiring :
For now , employers are still hesitant to add workers .
The number of new hires remains near its low since the report began being produced nine years ago , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The survey showed that employers across the board hired fewer than 4 million workers during the month , down slightly from the month earlier .
Compared to other industries , hiring has been strongest in the construction , leisure and hospitality sectors in recent months , which have seen hiring rates of 5.7 % , 5 % and 4.9 % respectively , according to the report .
By comparison , the government hiring rate was only 1.2 % in October .
Still , construction , leisure and hospitality experienced enormous job losses earlier in 2009 and hiring overall in these industries is down versus a year ago .
Meanwhile , government jobs have largely held steady .
Separations :
The number of total separations , or turnover , was little changed in October from the previous month .
The report showed that layoffs in October were up slightly from a year earlier and the percentage of workers quitting jobs remained low , indicating that people are still nervous about changing jobs in the current market .
Altogether , this report " does n't have much in the way of good news , " said Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics , a consulting firm in New York .
But the report is based on October data , he noted , " a period when the economy was n't doing better . "
More recently , the Labor Department 's November jobs report showed that employers trimmed the fewest jobs of any month since the start of the recession and the unemployment rate posted the biggest one - month decline in more than three years .
In November , the U.S. unemployment rate improved to 10 % .
Before that , the unemployment rate had risen in 12 of the previous 13 months .
Barcelona , Spain , 31 August : Raising livestock also accounts for around 18 % of greenhouse gases .
It is therefore possible to act against climate change and reduce cardiovascular and cancer deaths , by cutting the production and consumption of ' red meat ' from these animals .
The World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research have recommended that an individual should eat no more than 500 grams of red meat per week .
Cardiovascular disease and cancer are two human diseases caused by similar factors influencing climate change .
Others are the infectious disease influenza and salmonella , which are also related to animal elevation ( zoonoses ) .
Further examples not specifically related to agriculture , are respiratory diseases resulting from the burning of fossil and other fuels for transport and heating .
A different group of diseases cannot be said to share the causes of global warming .
Instead they are caused by , or exacerbated by global warming .
Examples are thermal stress , accidental and intentional injuries , and malnutrition or famine , all of which are expected to occur more frequently as the planet warms up and the climate becomes less stable .
Health care systems all over the world will have to adapt to these changes .
Human disease and global warming are therefore related in several ways , and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as well as national medical associations , have adopted policies to take these interrelationships into account .
In contrast , professional societies within cardiovascular medicine and research have not yet addressed the relationships of climate change to cardiovascular disease , but they should consider doing so for at least two reasons .
The first is the relationship already described : risk of cardiovascular disease can be reduced by interventions which also reduce the risk of climate change .
For example recommendations could be given regarding the consumption of red meat such as those already made by oncology institutions .
The second is advocacy .
Physicians and biomedical researchers have the training to understand the physics , chemistry and statistics used in the climatological research that has demonstrated the gravity of the climate problem .
Sea levels were for example , at least 15 to 25 meters higher than they are now when the earth 's atmosphere last had the same CO2 capacity as now ( about 387 parts per million ) which was three million years ago .
Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are currently rising at 2 ppm / year .
It is difficult for politicians in democratic countries to make the necessary changes in national and international policies for energy , transport , agriculture , urban planning , family planning , etc , without general public understanding of the issues .
Physicians and scientists devoted to understanding , preventing and treating cardiovascular disease also have the ability to understand the climate issue .
Most importantly , they have the authority to promote this understanding through private and public debate .
Not least because they can make statements , backed up by science , demonstrating that reducing the risk of heart attack can also impact upon climate change .

In a 13 - minute interview on CNBC's Squawk Box last week , Congressman Ron Paul stated one phrase that really stuck out at around 4:50 :
“ Gold is money .
Gold measures the value of currencies .
And right now gold is telling us , in spite of the fact that the gold price is rigged by central banks and various entities , gold is telling us that the dollar is in danger – great danger !!
We 're in worse shape than we were in the 70's , and it was rather chaotic then .
So we 're moving into a very dangerous era according to what the gold price is telling us . ”
What does Congressman Paul mean ?
Now , I certainly cannot speak for him , but I am re-posting below my July 2009 article “ The Summers Gold Price Suppression Scheme . ”
Another recent , well - document essay is GATA 's Chris Powell 's speech “ Gold Suppression is Public Policy and Public Record . ”
Be sure to check out my reference to rarely - discussed London Gold Pool of the 1960s , we are living through its modern equivalent currently .
Take a look , decide for yourself , and leave any questions you may have below .
_______________________________________________
“ Gold is the sovereign of all sovereigns . ” – Democritus , Greek scientist and philosopher , circa 430 BCE .
by Jake Towne , the Champion of the Constitution
Monday , July 13 , 2009
July 24 , 1998 , was an epic day for the global financial system .
In “ The Money Matrix – Bring Light to Dark Derivatives ! ( PART 11/15 ) , ” we reviewed the consequences of FED Chairman Alan Greenspan 's decision to allow negotiation of OTC derivative contracts without the use of an exchange to make transactions transparent and reduce counterparty risk .
( emblem )
Greenspan also stated :
“ Nor can private counterparties restrict supplies of gold , another commodity whose derivatives are often traded over - the - counter , where central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise . ”
Translated , this comment simply means that the international central banks will suppress the gold price by releasing central bank gold reserves .
Why is the gold price so important ?
Is n't it just a yellow metal mostly used for jewelry ?
How exactly is this manipulation accomplished ?
These are the questions this article will answer .
THE LONDON GOLD POOL AND THE “ REAL RATE OF INTEREST ”
Before proceeding , I recognize that many hearing this for the first time may be incredulous .
To that end , please read “ R.I.P. – The London Gold Pool , 1961 - 1968 “ .
This article painstakingly demonstrates – using the FED 's own documentation – that the international central bankers secretly colluded to manipulate the gold price in the 1960s to hide the dollar 's debasement .
Note the severe aftermath : the London Gold Pool was utterly destroyed in 1968 and the end result was the national bankruptcy of the United States in 1971 when President Nixon blocked the redemption of dollars for gold by foreigners .
The collapse of the London Gold Pool heralded the era of free - floating fiat currency .
If additional proof is needed , please read this 1961 FED document and analysis by James Turk from the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee ( GATA ) entitled “ The FED 's Blueprint for Market Intervention . ”
In the recessions and energy crises of the 1970s , the gold price rose from $ 35 to $ 875 per troy ounce .
With the vast increase of powers granted by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 , FED Chairman Paul Volker jacked interest rates into the stratosphere to squeeze the inflation out of the dollar .
In 1981 , the federal funds rate reached a maximum of 19 % , and would not subside to single digits until 1985 .
[ And what was Volker 's only regret from his memoirs ?
That “ Joint intervention in gold sales to prevent a steep rise in the price of gold , however , was not undertaken .
That was a mistake . ” ]
The next part is crucial to the plot .
In 1988 , a young economist out Harvard , Larry Summers wrote a verbose paper entitled “ Gibson 's Paradox and the Gold Standard . ”
In the paper , Summers explains that when the real interest rate is positive , the gold price will not increase and even decrease as parties will prefer fiat currency that increases in purchasing power .
However , when the real interest rate is negative , the price of gold will increase as parties will seek to preserve their purchasing power .
Gold serves as “ the canary in the coal mine ” for all fiat currencies .
When the price of gold rises , this is the prime signal that the currency is being debased .
Summers well understands the world gold market and the axiom “ at all times , in all places , gold is money . ”
Few today recognize that gold ( XAU ) and silver ( XAG ) are internationally recognized currencies and compete with the USD , EUR , and all others .
Few recognize that the daily trading of gold on the London Bullion Market Association exceeds $ 80 billion USD per trading day .
To put this in perspective , the London market accounted for $ 20 trillion USD in 2007 which by itself is larger than the $ 14 trillion GDP of the United States , which is the trade from all the goods and services our country produced .
Gold is not just a currency , not just money , gold is a commodity that is the world 's smallest major financial market .
Now , the real interest rate remained positive until 1990 due to Volker 's draconian inflation - fighting measures .
As explained in “ Unlocking the Money Matrix – The Real Interest Rate ( PART 12/15 ) “ , the real interest rate not only went negative , but it kept plummeting .
The prime reason for this is the massive creation of new dollars that debased the currency by the FED , or classical Austrian monetary inflation of the money supply .
In the 1990s , the American government in collusion with the central bankers decided to execute the Summers ' scheme although they may have simply been building on his mentor Robert Rubin 's gold trading practices at Goldman Sachs .
By suppressing the price of gold AND silver – a far smaller and easier - to - manipulate market than gold – and publishing rigged CPI numbers , they could slowly and steadily confiscate the purchasing power of their populations while masking the debasement of the dollar and hence all other fiat currencies while not causing a loss of consumer confidence .
THE SUMMERS GOLD PRICE SUPPRESSION SCHEME
Here is how the scheme works :
Central banks , like the FED , takes gold bars from their vaults and leases them to cartel entities like Goldman Sachs at a low rate typically around 1 % .
Unless the sale is announced like Gordon Brown 's infamous sale of 60 % of England 's gold reserves from 1999 - 2002 at $ 275 / oz. , the central bank continues to carry gold on lease and gold in the vault as one line item on their balance sheet .
The cartel then sells the physical gold into the futures market at spot price .
The spot and future prices were suppressed by this extra supply .
Large dumps can be orchestrated to cause “ waterfalls ” in the price due to algorithm or stop - loss trading .
Now the cartel has plenty of capital which could be leveraged by an investment bank at 30:1 or higher and used for ANY transaction .
( Similar plays on interest rate mismatches were also executed on fiat currencies , most infamously the Japanese Yen -US Treasury carry trade , but these plays were made far easier with the golden ' canary ' silenced . )
The physical gold bars leave the exchanges .
Most of the central bank gold is melted down to meet the supply deficit , and now adorns the necks of Indian women or rests in the vaults of investors .
There are approximately 160,000 metric tons of aboveground gold stock .
The World Gold Council reports that the world 's central bank gold reserves are at 29,698 metric tons as of June 2009 , and this is a fall from the 35,582 metric tons reported in 1990 while the world 's money supply has more than tripled since then .
However , the WGC statistics do not have the rigor of independent audits and are incorrect as shown by the abrupt doubling of China 's disclosed reserves overnight .
As Ed Wener of GATA reported in 2005 and James Turk related in 2009 , it is highly probable that 12,000 to 15,000 additional metric tons has been leased by the central banks into the marketplace .
In the March 2001 audit of the Exchange Stabilization Fund ( ESF ) , the Treasury refers its ( unconstitutional ) powers to “ deal in gold , foreign exchange , and other instruments of credit and securities the Secretary considers necessary ” to promote “ orderly exchange arrangements and a stable system of exchange rates . ”
Along with the blatant remark by Greenspan above , this appears to me to be a carte blanche to trade in the gold market , and as late as 2000 the FED still publicly reported the ESF as controlling an unspecified portion of our nation 's gold .
To this day , the US government and the FED report gold stock on lease and gold in the vault as a single line item .
It is not outside the realm of possibility though unproven – that the US government completed a gold swap transaction with Germany , where we traded gold stored in the US for gold stored in Germany as Turk surmised in “ Behind Closed Doors , ” which was based on FED meeting minutes in 2001 .
Of course , the swapped gold from Germany would then have been used by the US government to dump gold on the London market .
Recent events with Germany and subsequent Obama - Merkel meetings hint that they may be calling for the return of their gold .
The Bundesbank even published a document back in 2000 that gave a hypothetical example of a gold swap with the FED , see page 37/56 .
THE COMMITTEE THAT COULD DESTROY THE WORLD
In February 1999 , Time magazine published a cover with the bold title “ The Committee to Save the World . ”
In the future , the truth may be revealed as quite the opposite .
Now , almost certainly , Summers , Rubin , Greenspan and the rest of the cartel believed in the mid-1990s that the gold suppression scheme could be carried out for 40 - 50 years before its failure enough time for either a new solution to be found or to see the Keynesian wet dream of one or very few regional fiat currencies realized .
Unfortunately , if the global monetary system melts down , the entire world will be adversely affected .
( Photo Rubin Summers Greenspan )
A key component of the plan was also psychological .
Robert Rubin , Treasury Secretary from 1995 - 1999 , first coined the “ Strong Dollar ” policy .
When these words needed to be turned into action , Greenspan over at the FED could manipulate interest rates , create dollars , and conduct foreign currency operations .
Summers worked under Rubin and continued the policy as Treasury Secretary until 2001 .
Summer 's successor was Paul O'Neill who had this to say in 2008 :
“ When I was Secretary of the Treasury I was not supposed to say anything but “ strong dollar , strong dollar . ”
I argued then and would argue now that the idea of a strong dollar policy is a vacuous notion …
When people say strong dollar , if they do n't mean that “ we believe intervention can work and we 're prepared to intervene , ” then strong dollar is ridiculous . ''
Any veteran investor also realizes the powerful effect of FED statements by Greenspan and now Bernanke have had on stock and bond market volatility .
In 2001 , the gold price began its slow upward march , starting at $ 275 / oz .
As James
Turk has documented , gold has risen eight years in a row , with an annual average gain of 16 % .
The gold cartel has been beating a retreat .
However , the plan to quietly confiscate the wealth of the American people has an Achilles heel , the same which destroyed the London Gold Pool .
If physical gold becomes too scarce on the futures exchange and enters backwardation , or if the fiat currency debasement becomes too obvious , the gold price will skyrocket in response and the exchange will lose all its metal and the cartel will default .
Furthermore , the gold on lease cannot be repaid to the central banks without causing the gold price to soar , and as more people realize the scam worldwide , or become more alarmed by the price rising , the more physical gold is saved .
THE WILES OF “ PAPER GOLD ” AND “ PAPER SILVER ”
As previously stated , Gold is the world 's smallest major market .
In 2007 , the last reported year , the London Bullion Market Association ( LBMA ) exchanged over $ 20 Trillion USD in gold .
This was larger than America 's GDP of $ 14 Trillion USD , and the LBMA trading only represents about 75 % of the world totals .
Furthermore , the IFSL estimates the LBMA 's volume is quite likely three - to - five times larger since much of the transactions are increasingly netted out and cleared without appearing in the statistics .
This is despite the fact that all of the aboveground gold stock 160,000 metric tons melted down would fit inside of a cube roughly 20 meters to a side .
Due to industrial consumption , a shocking surprise to many is that silver 's aboveground stocks are far less than gold's .
The best estimates range from 30,000 metric tons on the low end to 60,000 metric tons on the high end – a cube that is at most 18 meters to a side .
As seen in the graph , the market capitalization of silver is just a small fraction of gold 's which makes it far easier to manipulate .
In 1974 , New York 's COMEX futures market was opened to gold trading , paving the way to the “ paper gold ” derivatives and ETF 's of our modern day .
In December 2008 , the notional value of all gold derivative contracts was $ 395 billion USD , or roughly equivalent to 15,000 metric tons of gold .
To put this in perspective consider than futures markets are typically used as hedging operations for commodity producers , trading basis risk for price risk .
Since the annual production of gold is around 2,500 metric tons , and the contracts are all within a year , the large notional value becomes questionable .
And to put this in perspective with silver , in 2007 the equivalent of the entire aboveground stock of gold was exchanged every 269 trading days while the equivalent of the entire aboveground stock of silver is exchanged every 9 trading days .
Here is another little known fact I dare not omit since gold is saved and not consumed , it 's stocks - to - flow ratio is about 60 .
This means that there is the equivalent of ~ 60 years worth of production in aboveground stock for every year of mine production .
This is in stark contrast to all other commodities , where the stock - to - flow ratio hovers around 1 .
Please see the graph .
This ratio is the key reason why gold is money and a currency .
Perhaps this chart Theodore Butler graciously allowed me to publish from his article “ Making the Case ” most aptly demonstrates the gold and silver manipulation by U.S. Banks below .
Furthermore , in a 2003 lawsuit against the world 's largest gold producer , Blanchard and Company charged Barrick Gold with manipulation of the gold price by using central bank gold , Barrick replied that they could not be sued without the central bank and other bullion dealers present as necessary parties , and that the central banks had sovereign immunity .
Barrick 's motion to dismiss was also a confession of the state of the gold market .
“ Termination of the forward sales contracts would leave the bullion banks with no right to recover the promised gold from the gold producers ; yet , they will remain obligated to repay the borrowed gold to the central banks .
In order to satisfy their obligations to the central banks , the bullion banks would have to purchase gold on the spot market at prices that may be substantially higher than the price at which they sold the borrowed gold …
It would expose the bullion banks to monumental financial losses . ” ( p. 20-21/24 )
Barrick 's motion to dismiss was settled out of court , and shortly thereafter Barrick announced its hedging operations were terminated .
The Barrick Gold case was preceded by Howe vs. BIS , where , as a BIS shareholder , Reginald Howe charged the Bank of International Settlements , Alan Greenspan , Treasury Secretary Larry Summers , Goldman Sachs , Deutsche Bank , and others with fraud and manipulation of the gold price in the derivatives market and on the COMEX in 2000 .
In along , twisting decision , U.S. federal Judge dismissed the case due to lack of standing .
However , none of the claims were refuted and Lindsay resorted to questionable logic that Greenspan and Summers were above the law and unable to be sued in 2002 .
James
Turk picks apart the decision in his commentary here .
One final but quite important note that due to the nature of futures markets , the gold cartel just as easily can profit when the price rises as when it falls .
It is typically rare ( ~1 % ) for a paper gold futures contract to be settled in gold .
Most often , it is simply rolled over .
The game of golden musical chairs stops when the expected deliveries of physical metal off the exchange shake the confidence that metal will be delivered , resulting in a heightening of counterparty risk .
CONCLUSION
It took me extensive amounts of research to conclude that the gold and silver prices are manipulated , and GATA was the first and prime source of this information .
For many seeing this for the first time , I apologize if the above is too complex .
Looking back , it should have been much easier if you listen to the central banks , they literally state they doing this .
One must not forget that central banks are simply government - sanctioned tools of the elite to debase and manipulate the currency in an orderly and politically - expedient manner , regardless of their claims to maintain “ political independence . ”
The simple truth is that the central banks were designed to control the “ money power ” which eventually MUST and WILL BE returned to We the People .
However , I expect no one to believe the same as I without doing the same research as I have , and to that effect , please see the below source list .
Any questions , especially feedback to the contrary , please ask them below and I will do my best in replying in a timely fashion .
Lastly , let 's ask what if I am wrong , what are the consequences ?
Nothing .
But what about the possibility that GATA , myself , and many others are correct ?
Then Larry Summers , the director of the Obama administration National Economic Council , should receive a trial by jury , not left free to continue to meddle with the world economy .
As individuals , we must end this charade and help destroy the gold cartel or the gold cartel will proceed to annihilate what 's left of the free market in our America , the greatest nation to ever be conceived in the liberty of the individual by the minds of men .
Got physical gold ?
Physical silver ?
( Please note ETF funds like GLD and SLV , run by cartel members HSBC Bank and JP Morgan Chase Bank , do not count . )

Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania say they 've discovered a way to circumvent the networking technology used by law enforcement to tap phone lines in the U.S .
The flaws they 've found " represent a serious threat to the accuracy and completeness of wiretap records used for both criminal investigation and as evidence in trial , " the researchers say in their paper , set to be presented Thursday at a computer security conference in Chicago .
Following up on earlier work on evading analog wiretap devices called loop extenders , the Penn researchers took a deep look at the newer technical standards used to enable wiretapping on telecommunication switches .
They found that while these newer devices probably do n't suffer from many of the bugs they 'd found in the loop extender world , they do introduce new flaws .
In fact , wiretaps could probably be rendered useless if the connection between the switches and law enforcement are overwhelmed with useless data , something known as a denial of service ( DOS ) attack .
Four years ago , the University of Pennsylvania team made headlines after hacking an analog loop extender device they 'd bought on eBay .
This time , the team wanted to look at newer devices , but they could n't get a hold of a switch .
So instead they took a close look at the telecommunication industry standard -- ANSI Standard J- STD - 025 -- that defines how switches should transmit wiretapped information to authorities .
This standard was developed in the 1990s to spell out how telecommunications companies could comply with the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ( CALEA ) .
" We asked ourselves the question of whether this standard is sufficient to have reliable wiretapping , " said Micah Sherr , a post - doctoral researcher at the university and one of the paper 's co-authors .
Eventually they were able to develop some proof - of - concept attacks that would disrupt devices .
According to Sherr , the standard " really did n't consider the case of a wiretap subject who is trying to thwart or confuse the wiretap itself . "
It turns out that the standard sets aside very little bandwidth -- 64 K bits per second -- for keeping track of information about phone calls being made on the tapped line .
When a wire tap is on , the switch is supposed to set up a 64 K bps Call Data Channel to send this information between the telco and the law enforcement agency doing the wiretap .
Normally this channel has more than enough bandwidth for the whole system to work , but if someone tries to flood it with information by making dozens of SMS messages or VoIP ( voice over Internet protocol ) phone calls simultaneously , the channel could be overwhelmed and simply drop network traffic .
That means that law enforcement could lose records of who was called and when , and possibly miss entire call recordings as well , Sherr said .
Back in 2005 , the FBI downplayed the Penn team 's loop extender research , saying that it applied to only about 10 percent of wire taps .
The J- standard studied in this paper is much more widely used , however , Sherr said .
An FBI representative did not return messages seeking comment for this story .
The researchers wrote a program that connected to a server over Sprint 's 3G wireless network 40 times per second , enough to flood the Call Data Channel .
They say that they could get the same results by programming a computer to make seven VoIP calls per second or to fire off 42 SMS messages per second .
These techniques would work on mobile phones or VoIP systems , but not on analog devices , Sherr said .
Because the researchers were n't able to test their techniques on real - world systems they do n't know for certain that they could thwart a wiretap .
But Sherr believes that " there are definitely dangers " in the way the standard is written .
" Because it 's a black - box system , we do n't know for sure . "
Of course , criminals have plenty of easier ways to dodge police surveillance .
They can use cash to buy prepaid mobile phones anonymously , or reach out to their accomplices with encrypted Skype calls , said Robert Graham , CEO with Errata Security .
Luckily for the cops , criminals usually do n't take their communications security that seriously .
" Most criminals are stupid , " he said .
" They just use their same cell phone . "
Peter Crouch has admitted frustration at the bit - part role he has played for England under Fabio Capello , but conceded the team 's impressive record in World Cup qualifying has damaged his chances of inclusion .
The Tottenham Hotspur forward , who returns to his former club Portsmouth tomorrow , scored twice in the 3 - 0 win over Belarus to swell his international goal tally to 18 in 35 caps .
He has scored in all three of the competitive games he has started under Capello – and in each of his last six starts for his country – but was offered little indication that he could expect to retain his place in next month 's friendly against Brazil in Qatar .
Capello prefers the brawn and movement provided by Emile Heskey , despite the Aston Villa forward having struggled to hold down a place at his club in recent months and his relatively meagre tally of seven goals in 57 caps .
" Emile 's situation is one of those things and the manager picks the best team he sees fit , " said Crouch .
" I can't argue too much because the record in qualifying has been very good .
The team has done fantastically well and Emile has played the majority of those games .
" Obviously I would prefer to be Plan A than Plan B .
If we were losing games I could go and speak to the manager , but I 'm not going to be the first one to argue with him .
He picks the team and the side has done fantastically well .
I want to be playing all the time for England , it 's a dream to play at Wembley and wear the No9 shirt , but when called upon I will continue to do what I have done .
" I feel confident , I 've never let anyone down .
Whenever I 've come in I 've scored goals and played well .
Hopefully , I will continue to do that .
When you get a chance you 've just got to go out there and take it .
Hopefully , I 've given the manager something to think about . "
Crouch 's toils have actually been mirrored at club level in recent times , the forward scoring a hat - trick in a League Cup tie at Preston North End last month only to find himself relegated to the bench behind Jermain Defoe and Robbie Keane for the subsequent 5 - 0 drubbing of Burnley .
" I 'm not starting every game at Tottenham , but I 'm at a top , top club and , with the squad we 've got , we can really compete and do well , " he said .
" The manager has brought me in and he 's going to play me .
He 's not going to leave me on the bench .
I know I will get a good share of games . "
The return to Fratton Park , where Crouch has enjoyed two season - long spells in his career , will be a reunion of old friends given the number of players who have transferred between the clubs in the last few years , and with Harry Redknapp having coached both .
The focus will be on the manager , who has already declined touchline protection at the game , though Crouch anticipates " a tasty game and a hot atmosphere " .
" It 'll be like Portsmouth Old Boys , " he added .
" Harry did fantastically well for Portsmouth .
He was probably the best manager in their history .
He won the FA Cup and took the club into Europe .
It 's understandable the fans are angry he left them , but that 's football .
" I 've got absolutely no idea how the Portsmouth fans will react to me going back .
I loved every second at the club , but most of the players had to move on with things the way they were .
It was n't a great situation [ with the finances ] , and I do n't think I was talking out of turn when I spoke about that in the summer .
Everyone knows the situation there was n't great , the manager has admitted that .
I hope they have sorted things out with the new owner .
I 've got a great admiration for the club and it will be good if they 've got stability . "
Verizon Wireless loves to nickel and dime its customers and the upcoming Motorola Droid presents new opportunities .
Droid supports Microsoft Exchange 's ActiveSync feature that lets users access e-mail , calendar and contacts from their corporate servers running Exchange .
But they could end up paying extra for the privilege , says InfoWorld .
Droid users could pay at least an additional $ 15 to $ 20 a month on top of their data plan for Exchange access .
That means $ 45 to $ 50 a month including Exchange support instead of $ 30 a month for a data - only plan .
Droid will be exclusively available on the Verizon network for $ 200 with a two - year contract .
The higher rate , though , will only apply for customers on a corporate or business account .
" Most customers will pay $ 30 for the data plan that gets them internet access and push e-mail , " Brenda Raney , a spokesperson for Verizon Wireless told Wired.com .
" Customers who use an enterprise server are , in general , business customers and an IT department is facilitating the access .
[ Those ] are the ones who need the $ 50 plan . "
In some cases , Droid users who get the $ 30 data plan could still access Exchange , says Raney .
But that will be a decision for their companies to make .
" Many companies required a corporate - approved device for it to access Exchange , " she says .
" In those cases , Droid users will have to get a business account with Verizon . "
The policy is not just for the Droid .
It applies to all Verizon smartphones , including the BlackBerry , that want to get corporate e-mail , says Verizon .
But that may not be telling the whole story .
BlackBerry users pay additional fees because the phones connect with a company 's BlackBerry Enterprise Systems and not the consumer - focused BlackBerry Internet System , points out Mashable .
And that involves additional licensing fees .
The Droid , though , runs the open source Android 2.0 platform with ActiveSync support already built in .
That means users should n't have to pay extra fees for their device to connect with their corporate servers .
It also defeats some of the good intentions behind Android .
Was n't Android expected to help bring in cost savings for carriers and consumers ?

Oprah Winfrey also uses the phrase on her website
Oprah Winfrey 's production company Harpo and a US insurance firm have reached an amicable settlement over rights to the phrase " aha moment " .
Earlier this year , Harpo asked the Mutual of Omaha to stop using the phrase to promote its products and creating an association with Winfrey .
The talk show host has often used the slogan on her programme to describe " flashes of understanding " .
Representatives for Harpo and Mutual declined to give any further details .
Campaign
The Omaha - based company responded to Harpo 's request with legal action stating it had obtained preliminary approval of a trademark on " aha moment " .
Mutual also said it had conceived the slogan in early 2008 and encountered no opposition when it made its application to the US patents office .
Harpo made no response to Mutual 's move asking a court to declare it had not infringed Winfrey 's rights .
The insurance company asked for their claim to be dismissed last month .
They used the slogan in a website campaign in which users chose the best " aha moments " to be at the heart of a series of TV adverts .
The 10 stories are still appearing on their internet site , while the company calls itself " proud sponsor of life 's aha moments " .
According to data from the research firm Strategy Analytics , Apple became during 2009th third quarter " the world 's most profitable handset manufacturer " .
So I launched calc.app to figure out what 's their secret .
Apparently Apple made a $ 1.6 billion profit while Nokia only attained $ 1.1 billion over this quarter .
For comparison , analysts of the Deutsche Bank in 2008 had already announced that in their calculations Apple was taking about 20 % of the market 's profit while holding 1 % of the market shares .
At the time Nokia was taking about 55 % of the market 's profit .
So what does it mean ?
Basically Apple is putting on incredibly high margins on its products .
They receive approximately $ 550 per iPhone sold , so if Strategy Analytic 's numbers are right , , how do you feel about that ?
Here is the famous " Apple Tax " .
Furthermore by subsidizing the handset , customers do n't even notice the margin .
Those are incredible numbers , especially in such an industry .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 17/11/2009 ( 3969 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
OTTAWA --
The federal transport minister 's office worked in lock step with the airline industry to draft the government 's passenger rights campaign , despite concerns from the bureaucracy about how the plan was being developed , according to internal correspondence obtained by Canwest News Service .
The Conservatives launched Flight Rights Canada last fall to inform air travellers of their rights , but only after airline executives reviewed several drafts , provided input and approved the final product -- a process that raised the ire of a top bureaucrat involved .
The transport minister at the time , Lawrence Cannon , also ignored warnings from the senior bureaucrat about a tiny communications budget of $ 15,000 to fund the initiative , so the promised rollout of " prominent signage " at key airports has never materialized .
No billboards or posters were put up at airports and only $ 3,640 was spent to develop the initiative .
This includes material posted on the departmental website , Transport Canada said Tuesday .
Details of the development of Flight Rights are revealed in correspondence between the minister 's office and senior bureaucrats .
The government intended to block their release in response to an Access to Information request , but the full , uncensored documents were sent to Canwest News Service , apparently by mistake .
Governments often consult with stakeholders when developing initiatives .
In this case , the minister 's office did not consult consumer groups .
Liberal and NDP MPs took shots at the Tories .
" This is outright collusion on the part of the Conservatives and the airline industry , " NDP MP Jim Maloway said .
Before developing Flight Rights , the minister 's office had privately pleaded with major airlines to step up their lobby campaign to kill a Liberal motion for the government to bring forward legislation to protect the rights of air travellers -- even as the minister publicly rallied behind the initiative , documents obtained by Canwest News Service show .
Newly released records show how the minister 's senior policy adviser at the time , Paul Fitzgerald , sent the " latest , latest version " of Flight Rights to the airline industry 's national lobby group on July 10 , 2008 , for feedback and comments .
He boasted a few weeks later to Brigita Gravitis - Beck , Transport Canada 's director general of air policy , that the initiative had been approved by the three airlines and he was awaiting " similar approval " from the national lobby group .
Gravitis - Beck was not pleased with this early involvement of the airline industry , according to correspondence .
The revelations come as the current transport minister , John Baird , is fighting to kill a private member 's bill authored by Maloway to legislate a Canadian version of the European Union 's 2005 Airline Passenger Bill of Rights .

At long last , Leonardo DiCaprio has hired a screenwriter for his big - screen adaptation of The Twilight Zone .
His choice has cut his teeth writing science fiction and horror , and has a surprising credit in softcore porn .

It 's been a year since we first announced that DiCaprio 's production company , Appian Way , was hunting down scripts for a Twilight Zone film .
And it appears that they have finally chosen their scribe , writer and television producer Rand Ravich .
Ravich is probably best known for creating the NBC police drama Life , but he also scripted the B - movie - inspired thriller The Astronaut 's Wife ( which he also directed ) and the horror sequel Candyman : Farewell to the Flesh .

And , in fact , Ravich has also written for a series modeled on TV anthologies like The Twilight Zone — but instead of science fiction or horror , the stories featured in Playboy 's Inside
Out anthology are , naturally , based around sex .
Still , the description from IMDB of his entry " Put Asunder " suggests that Ravich would have rather been writing for Rod Serling than Hugh Hefner :
A battling divorced couple cannot keep their hands off of each other , so they hire a hitman to kill one of them , based on chance .
Still no word from Appian on whether the film , like its ill - fated 1983 predecessor , will feature remakes of old Twilight Zone episodes or an original ( and potentially pornographic ) tale from Ravich .

Chinese chemists have made ’ Russian - doll ’ - style fullerenes , containing three distinct molecules trapped within one another .
At the centre is a small C 2 species which is nestled inside a tetrahedron of four scandium atoms .
This metal cluster is then trapped inside a large C 80 ball .
Fullerenes containing different atoms or molecules are termed ’ endohedral ’ - and the @ - symbol is used to distinguish what is trapped inside .
This research marks the first time that a three - layer fullerene has been produced : C 2 @Sc 4 @C 80 .
The filled fullerenes were made by a typical arc discharge method , where a large current is passed between two graphite electrodes .
This produces a sooty residue containing many fullerenes .
By adding scandium to the mix , the team was able to extract small amounts of C 2 @Sc 4 @C 80 using high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) .
’ According to our spectroscopic and quantum chemical characterisations , the metal cluster rotates freely inside the C 80 fullerene cage at room temperature , and the inner C 2 species has an unusually high charge state of - 6 , ’ researcher Chun-Ru Wang from the Institute of Chemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences told Chemistry World .
These unique properties could lead to many interesting applications , he says , as the rapid rotation of the inner core should behave like a quantum gyroscope .
Additionally , the molecule is expected to be super - conducting , and the associated unusual electronic properties may prove promising in designing a molecular capacitor .
Kyriakos Porfyrakis , an expert on endohedral fullerenes at the University of Oxford , UK , is interested by the research .
’ Endohedral fullerenes in general have attractive electronic properties .
There is potential for photo - physics applications such as photovoltaics , or as MRI contrast agents , particularly if the fullerenes can be made to contain gadolinium atoms . ’
One possible advantage of multi-layered fullerenes , Porfyrakis adds , is that it may be possible to use the arrangement of layers to fine - tune the electrical properties - optimising the fullerenes for specific applications .
Since there is still space inside the C 80 fullerene , Wang ’s team are already working on packing more complicated molecules inside .
But the main thing holding this technology back , Porfyrakis says , is the difficulty of producing high quality fullerenes on a large scale .
And until this is addressed , fullerenes may struggle to find practical applications .

Silicon Alley Insider is running an article titled 15 Google Interview Questions That Will Make You Feel Stupid .
Several of the questions are interesting , but several are chestnuts that if you know puzzles , you barely remember where you heard them the first time .
On the other hand , if you are n’t a puzzle person you ’re not likely to solve them quickly and under pressure during a job interview , making them less than useless .
It does n’t help that the article does n’t display a good understanding of the puzzles , and gets several answers wrong .
Here they are :
Stupid Interview Questions
Wanted : Boys
In a country where people want only boys every family continues to have children until they have a boy .
If they have a girl , they have another child .
If they have a boy , they stop .
What is the proportion of boys to girls in the country ?
This one is perhaps interesting from a can - you - be - misled standpoint : since the probability of any given child being a boy or girl has n’t changed , the overall proportion ca n’t be changed by decisions you make after the child is born .
It ’s a nice puzzle , but I first heard it at least ten years ago .
If you know puzzles , you ( almost certainly ) know this one .
Manhole Covers
Why are manhole covers round ?
Seriously ?
This is supposed to make you feel stupid ?
Again , if you have any interest in puzzles whatsoever , you ’ve heard this one before .
The answer to give is definitely not the one they give — so they ca n’t fall in — at this point that ’s trite .
The trick now is to come up with some other answer that has at least some plausibility : making them round makes it easier to move them by rolling them since they ’re heavy ; a round hole makes sense from a “ get the most access for the least hole ” standpoint ; round holes are sturdier and easier to dig ; a circular cover does n’t need to be oriented before being put in place .
Or point out that any shape with a constant diameter will prevent falling in , the most common being the reuleaux triangle .
Or if you want to be cheeky point out that not all countries use round manhole covers .
Handy
How many times a day does a clock ’s hands overlap ?
I actually like this one , old as it is .
For some reason the answer never sticks in my mind ( now that I ’ve said that it will ) and I have to think it through .
Sometimes I even get it wrong 🙂
Thinking Laterally
A man pushed his car to a hotel and lost his fortune .
What happened ?
A classic lateral thinking ( or situation ) puzzle .
Generally these are followed by a series of yes / no questions to attempt to figure out the intended meaning of the misleading original clue .
Obviously the interviewer ’s goal with this is more to see how clever you are at asking questions rather than how quickly you can solve the puzzle ; but again , if you know lateral thinking puzzles this one is n’t going to pose much of a challenge ( I solved it after about fifteen seconds , obviously without asking any questions , and I ’m not even very good at lateral thinking puzzles ) , and if you do n’t know about them , you ’re unlikely to make much of an impression with your question - asking .
Logical Pirates
You ’re the captain of a pirate ship and your crew gets to vote on how the gold is divided up .
If fewer than half of the pirates agree with you , you die .
How do you recommend apportioning the gold in such a way that you get a good share of the booty , but still survive ?
The answer they give here is just plain wrong .
The wording of the puzzle itself is weak as well .
This puzzle is at least five years old ( albeit a good puzzle ) and fairly well - known .
It ’s ridiculously hard to solve on the fly and fairly likely to be known by anyone interested in puzzles .
The puzzle is usually put something like this :
There are five pirates on a ship , with 100 gold pieces to divide between themselves .
The pirates are logical , self - preserving , greedy , and bloodthirsty in that priority .
They agree that they will each in turn propose a way to divide up the gold , starting with the captain .
If the majority of the pirates agree with the proposal , that is how the gold will be divided .
Otherwise the pirate making the proposal will be tossed over , and the next in terms of seniority will make a new proposal .
What proposal should the captain make ?
To find the answer , number the pirates and work backwards :
4 . If it comes down to pirates 4 and 5 , then 4 is out of luck ; even if he proposes giving all the gold to 5 , 5 ’s bloodthirsty and he ’ll say no , kill 4 , and take all the gold .
3 . If it comes down to 3 , 4 , and 5 , 4 will vote yes to 3 ’s proposal no matter what , in order to save his own life ( see 4 above ) .
Therefore 3 can propose that he ( 3 ) gets 100 pieces of gold and 4 will vote yes , and the proposal passes .
2 . If it comes down to 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , since 4 and 5 get nothing under 3 ’s proposal , 2 can propose 98 pieces of gold for himself and 1 each for 4 and 5 , and they will vote yes , giving a three - to - one majority .
1 . Therefore the captain , pirate 1 , should propose 97 pieces of gold for himself , 1 piece for 3 , and 2 pieces for either 4 or 5 , and have a three - to - two majority .
Ballsy
You have eight balls all of the same size .
7 of them weigh the same , and one of them weighs slightly more .
How can you find the ball that is heavier by using a balance and only two weighings ?
Seriously , I first encountered this puzzle in a book my parents gave me when I was eight .
Guess I should have applied to Google back then , eh ?
Egg Drop Soup
You are given 2 eggs , which are identical .
You have access to a 100 - story building .
Eggs can be very hard or very fragile , which means the eggs might break if dropped from the first floor or might not even break if dropped from 100th floor .
You need to figure out the highest floor of the 100 - story building an egg can be dropped from without breaking .
The question is how many drops you need to make .
You are allowed to break the 2 eggs in the process .
( I ’ve now updated their wording to correct their grammar and make it clearer )
As with the pirate puzzle , the answer given is incorrect ( Update : their answer has been corrected ) .
The correct answer is 14 drops .
You start on the 14th floor ; if the first egg breaks there you start at the first floor with the second egg and work your way up each floor , potentially to the 13th floor .
If the first egg survives the 14th floor , you go to the 27th : thirteen ( not fourteen ) floors higher because you burned a drop on the 14th floor .
If the first egg breaks there you start at 15 and try each floor from there potentially up to 26 .
This pattern continues .
If the first egg survives , you go up twelve floors to the 39th , eleven to the 50th , and on to the 60th , 69th , 77th , 84th , 90th , 95th , 99th , and finally the 100th .
Note that 13 drops is not possible ; if you start on the 13th floor ( and the first egg survives ) you will reach the 88th floor , then the 90th , then the 91st , and be out of luck .
Shrinky - dink
You are shrunk to the height of a nickel and your mass is proportionally reduced so as to maintain your original density .
You are then thrown into an empty glass blender .
The blades will start moving in 60 seconds .
What do you do ?
The answer given here is wrong .
“ This one is all about the judging interviewee ’s creativity . ”
No .
This is all about understanding physics .
Again , this is a common puzzle .
As any seasoned puzzler will tell you , if you maintain density and proportions , your strength decreases as the square of the change , but your mass decreases as the cube of the change .
So you would simply jump out of the blender .
Trying to break the electric motor as suggested would be far less possible than it would be if you were full - sized , i.e. impossible ( since you would n’t be able to throw it ) .
Conclusion
Interview puzzles fail on two fronts : for anyone who has a taste for puzzles , you ’re more likely to give them a puzzle they already know than to truly stump them ; and for those who do n’t happen to like puzzles , your attempt to find out how clever they are is more likely to simply frustrate them and mislead you .
Finally , asking more difficult / obscure puzzles perhaps solves the first issue , at the cost of making the second issue far worse .
That said , I love interview puzzles in general , so bring ’em on !
Activision Blizzard may create a Call of Duty MMO , the Los Angeles Times said Wednesday .
* " * One person close to the company said it also was considering adapting Call of Duty as a massively multi-player online world , " Times reporter Ben Fritz wrote in a story on Modern Warfare 2's launch .
The impulse makes tons of sense .
Activsion has already made a record - breaking $ 550 million since Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 launched on November 10 .
What company would n't be tempted to add a monthly revenue stream to the flood of money flowing from the franchise , especially when said company already owns and operates World of Warcraft ?
The Times also said that the game publisher is adding a third studio to the Call of Duty roster , to generate even more games under the brand .
Activision Blizzard has the cash , resources and experience to make something like this work .
And we all know the company is n't afraid of milking a franchise .
Then again , just to keep ourselves grounded here , what company has n't at least pondered the notion of turning its most valuable franchises into MMOs ?
The monthly millions brought in by Warcraft have surely inspired execs to float the idea around a meeting room .
But the massive initial investment , long development time and potential for failure surely has a chilling effect .
Even Activision Blizzard must think twice about the risks here .
Besides , a good part of Modern Warfare 's appeal is that the devoted can get hundreds of hours of play out of the game for $ 60 .
Additional fees might take the bloom off of that particular rose .

The paedophile priest Brendan Smyth is led from the Four Courts in Dublin after being sentenced to 12 years in July 1997
AT the height of Ireland 's clerical child sexual abuse scandals , American canon lawyer Fr Tom Doyle predicted the archdiocese of Dublin rated " at the top of the heap " on a world scale for its appalling quota of rapist offenders whose heinous crimes were blithely covered up by the church authorities .
Confirmation of the accuracy of Fr Doyle 's assessment has appeared in the first leak from the report of the Commission of Investigation into the Dublin Archdiocese which is with the Government for edited approval at tomorrow 's Cabinet meeting .
Its damnable and sordid details of how pervert clergy preyed on children -- while four successive archbishops of Dublin failed to inform the gardai of indictable crimes -- also confirms what for almost a year now Archbishop Diarmuid Martin has lost no opportunity in warning " will shock us all " .
It is a tragic horror story of how three powerful archbishops -- John Charles McQuaid , Dermot Ryan and Kevin McNamara -- put the honour and respectability of the institutional Church above the dignity and the welfare of innocent children under their pastoral care in a tightly controlled system of clerical authority from the school desk to the hospital bed .
It is also a nightmarish tale of how Cardinal Desmond Connell , an academic of international repute , proved to be a slow learner in his handling of the legacy from his three predecessors when confronted with an unstoppable tide of revelations and complaints .
The report recognises that the cardinal was appalled at the scale of abuse after taking over in 1988 but became too reliant on legal and medical advice , as well as feeling constrained by canon law .
These dignitaries of the Church were more concerned with elevating secrecy and confidentiality as primary policy priorities at the expense of safeguarding boys and girls from flesh - lusting clerics .
Hiding behind the mask of not giving public scandal to " the simple faithful " long conditioned by their spiritual leaders to owe them utter deference , the Lord Archbishops of Dublin , their chancellery officials and clerical courtiers covered up time and again .
They sent errant clerics either to paid sabbaticals in clinics for psychological assessment or , worse , moved them on to pastures new , where the unsuspecting flock was unaware of their past -- and voracious appetites .
In a telling phrase , one priest called child molestation " merely innocent pleasure " , a blasphemous euphemism which rationalised child carnality as being only a venial -- and certainly not a mortal -- sin .
However , no excuse for such moral laxity and abdication of duty can be extended to the four rulers of Catholic Dublin who were all well educated in theology , attending learned institutes of education both in Ireland and abroad .
Furthermore , all four archbishops had been educators by profession before their call by Rome to assume sole governance of one of the biggest and most prestigious archdioceses in Europe .
Astonishingly , not one of the four archbishops who held awesome power over the Dublin diocese from 1940 to 2004 deemed it necessary to inform the gardai until late 1995 when Cardinal Connell did so as a civil obligation under hostile media attention .
The shameful reality is that since the foundation of the State in 1921 until very recently , the media , as well as the gardai , politicians , lawyers , doctors and members of the caring professions regarded the Church as a divine institution that was above and beyond the law .
This collusion , ingrained into their secular compatriots by bishops , that the ultimate purpose in life was to save their immortal souls goes a long way to explaining how even a garda commissioner felt it was the remit of Archbishop McQuaid , not the law , to decide the fate of fallen clergy .
Such was the arrogance of the Church 's ' officer class ' that they regarded any outside lay intrusion into their internal affairs as interference in the temporal work of God invested in them as successors of the apostles .
They demanded unquestioning obedience .
This mindset also gives an insight into how the complaints of courageous victims and the occasional priest whistleblower were met with dismissive contempt , even denial .
Of how the families of victims would be ostracised by the pious for smearing the good name of the clergy .
At a time too when the Irish Church in Dublin dominated the property market with its expanding church and school - building programme into the then sprawling working - class suburbs of Cabra and Crumlin , its preoccupation with Mammon comes chillingly in how Archbishop McNamara from 1986 to 1987 purchased insurance against clerical sexual misconduct .
This insurance protection undermines the subsequent protestations that it took time for the church leaders to recognise both the seriousness of allegations against priests and that paedophiles were devious and recidivist .
Cardinal Connell inherited a legacy of pervasive child sexual abuse among the Dublin diocesan clergy and religious orders , which shows that this evil had become an integral part of a corrupt clerical system that Archbishops McQuaid , Ryan and McNamara had presided over .
Falteringly , Cardinal Connell came to see the appalling vista and give cooperation to the secular authorities , but his 16 - year reign was devastated by the abuses , and it was left for Archbishop Martin to cleanse the Palace in Drumcondra of its murky abuse secrets .

Maybe they got it right .
Maybe not .
Since scoring the UFC light heavyweight title fight Saturday night in favor of defending champion Lyoto Machida over Mauricio Rua , judges Nelson " Doc " Hamilton , Marcos Rosales and Cecil Peoples have been roundly criticized .
Their knowledge of mixed martial arts and their integrity have come under scrutiny .
This is unfortunate .
It 's one thing to disagree with the officiating crew 's scores , another to question their professionalism .
Hamilton , Rosales and Peoples are among the most experienced judges in mixed martial arts .
Toss in referee Herb Dean , and the California State Athletic Commission could not have put together a more qualified team to handle Machida - Rua at the Staples Center in Los Angeles .
Each judge has scored hundreds of MMA bouts , professional and amateur .
They have met every requirement set forth by this country 's most influential athletic commissions , and each attends judging seminars regularly .
Hamilton , Rosales and Peoples are more than qualified to score fights .
On Saturday night , they had a very difficult one to score .
Machida - Rua was a strategic , carefully contested bout .
Several rounds could have gone either way .
When the fight was over , all three judges scored it 48 - 47 for Machida ( ESPN.com had Rua winning 48 - 47 ) .
The judges , however , were n't totally in sync .
They did n't agree on how the champ won .
Peoples and Rosales gave the first three rounds to Machida .
However , Hamilton had the champ taking the middle rounds .
Round 5 was the only one in which all three judges favored Rua .
While most observers disagreed with the judges ' scorecards , they also did n't see eye - to - eye on which rounds to give Rua .
" I noticed that a lot of people on the Internet gave the first , second and third rounds to Machida , " Nevada State Athletic Commission Executive Director Keith Kizer told ESPN.com .
" Almost everybody gave the fourth and fifth rounds to Rua .
" There were also a lot of people who gave the first , second and third rounds to Rua .
You could have went 50 - 45 for Rua or 48 - 47 for Machida and not have been wrong .
" Some fans are under the impression that if two judges scored it the same , then the third judge must be wrong .
Not necessarily .
It depends on the angles from which the judges saw the fight . "
Where a judge is seated at a particular time during the action must be taken into account .
Judges have the best seats in the house , but they do n't always have a clear line of vision .
Depending on your perspective -- literally and figuratively -- either Lyoto Machida or Mauricio Rua could have won Saturday 's fight .
Ed Mulholland for ESPN.com
" I 'm not going to say every judge 's score is perfect , " Kizer said .
" That is definitely not the case .
" Judges can make mistakes or overemphasize a particular aspect of a round compared to other rounds , but it is so important where you sit -- not just the different sides of the Octagon , but are you watching it on TV ?
Are you six rows back from the cage ?
Are you in the best seat in the house , the judge 's chair ?
" Sometimes a judge 's chair might be on the opposite side of the Octagon and members of press row will have a better view of the action . "
In this fight , Hamilton is the judge who saw things a little different from his colleagues .
Hamilton scored the first and fifth rounds for Rua .
Scoring the rounds differently does n't mean Hamilton got it wrong .
He simply viewed the fight from another vantage point .
One thing Hamilton and the other judges who scored Machida - Rua can't be accused of is not paying attention .
These highly skilled judges never take their eyes off the action , and they let nothing outside the cage distract them .
They possess something else most fans do not : a thorough knowledge of the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts .
Peoples , Rosales and Hamilton know the rules inside - out .
" I 'm not talking about this specific fight , I 'm talking in generality :
The judge does n't care what the crowd is saying , he or she is n't listening to what the commentator is saying , " New Jersey State Athletic Control Board attorney Nick Lembo told ESPN.com .
" You have three judges sitting there who are totally ignoring the crowd , not listening to the broadcast , not having a beer .
How many of these fans were drinking a beer , sitting there with friends looking at other things ?
" The judges are trained to zone in , block everything out and just score that 5 - minute round .
That makes a difference sometimes .
" If you look under the rules -- and I do n't think a lot of people have read the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts -- it gives you a pretty good guide for how to score a fight . "
There is no evidence to suggest that the judges who scored Machida - Rua did not focus on or ignored the Unified Rules .
By all accounts , they did their job .

Thanks , it was a nice way to spend my Sunday afternoon .
I 've been going through videos and information on some of the Lander Challenge vehicles to get an idea of what we are working with .
With so many teams building these vehicles it shows that it is definitely possible to do on a small budget .
The issue of the ladder is definitely something that I have thought about .
I assume that we will have simple handrails ( maybe just tensioned cables to save weight ) that run along the propellant tanks .
To be honest , it is difficult to work with spherical and cylindrical shapes in Sketch Up so I did n't bother .
The size of the fuel tanks is essentially based on the biggest tanks that I could fit in the space provided .
If they get any larger you have to move them out from the vehicle center line .
This is n't necessarily bad though , because as it is the buffer springs extend well past the edge of the vehicle .
My solution to this problem may be to attach the buffer springs to the legs themselves and then allow them to swing with the leg until it contacts the leg rotator main frame .
I 'll measure the outside diameter of the tanks tomorrow and calculate how much they can hold .
I 'm not sure what ratio the hypergolic fuel that we will be using is mixed in .
If it is 1:1 then we are golden , but if it is something like 3.6:1 then the tanks will have to be re sized and rearranged .
The Texel lander looks like its tanks are all the same size so that gives me a good feeling .
Not a finished product , but I hope that it can be used to help draw attention to the project .

Rather than remaining an outsider , however , she decided to try to effect change from within .
Initially she worked as a British Foreign Ministry employee detailed to the American command ; more recently , she has become an American contractor .
DESPITE her insider ’s post , she prides herself on retaining an outsider ’s view of the military , saying things to top brass that others will not .
During the troop buildup in 2007 known as the surge , she said that attacks on insurgents that also resulted in civilian casualties were tantamount to “ mass murder . ”
“ When you drop a bomb from the air and it lands on a village and kills all those people and you turn around and say , ‘ Oh we did n’t mean to kill the civilians , ’ well , who did you think was living in the village ? ” she said .
That is now conventional wisdom .
The first thing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal did when he took over the command of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan was to prohibit attacks that might harm civilians .
Just as she has tried to help the military pay more attention to civilian points of view , the commanders have given her a new appreciation for the role of force .
She came to believe that increasing troop numbers in 2007 and 2008 was the best way to bring Iraqi civilians the security they needed so badly .
Suprised this kid did n't eat it ..... Josh BroadwaterA 17 - year - old self - professed stuntman has been charged with trespassing after authorities found online video of him jumping off bridges and dams and into the water .
Josh Broadwater has a page at the social networking site Myspace.com that lists his occupation as " stuntman " and his heroes as the stars of MTV 's stunt show " Jackass . "
" I 'm just doing it for , like , fun , and I put them on the Internet so people can watch them for entertainment , " Broadwater told The Associated Press on Friday in a telephone interview .
He acknowledged he trespassed to jump off a privately owned railroad bridge spanning the North Branch of the Potomac River for a video recorded May 8 .
He was charged as a juvenile Wednesday and released to the custody of a parent , according to the Combined County Criminal Investigation unit , an operation of the Maryland State Police and local agencies .
Operations Supervisor Jon Dudiak confirmed the defendant was the youth shown in the online videos .
Broadwater first came to authorities ' attention May 18 , when he was injured after jumping off the 90 - foot spillway of a reservoir dam into the water in Pennsylvania .
Tammi Dolan said her son suffered a concussion and an elbow gash in the stunt , first reported as a fall .
Investigators later got a tip that the tumble had been deliberate -- and videotaped , Dudiak said .
They then found online videos of Broadwater leaping from bridges in the Cumberland area , including some posted with " No Trespassing " signs .
" It 's dangerous .
There 's an inherent danger any time you do something like that , " Dudiak said .
A Pennsylvania Waterways Conservation officer is investigating the spillway jump , said Don Lauver , a regional manager with the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission .
Dolan said in a telephone interview that she has ordered him to stop doing dangerous tricks .
" Josh just wants to be a professional stuntman .
Basically , I do n't think he actually knew how to go about it , " she said .

Bloomberg survives scare
Mayor Mike Bloomberg ’s stunningly narrow re-election in New York was a moral defeat for the billionaire incumbent , and a profound embarrassment for a Democratic establishment – from the White House on down — that abandoned his rival , City Comptroller Bill Thompson , as a hopeless loser .
Bloomberg ’s meager five - point win left Democrats pondering what might have been if New York ’s Democratic donors had n’t turned their back on Thompson , if its politicians had worked for him , and most of all if President Barack Obama had offered anything more than the lamest words of praise .

“ Maybe one of those Corzine trips could have been better spent in New York .
Who knows ? " remarked New York Rep. Anthony Weiner , who weighed his own run for mayor , referring to the White House ’s devout attention to the New Jersey contest .
“ Maybe Anthony Weiner should have manned - up and run against Michael Bloomberg , ” shot back a White House official , who attributed the night ’s results across the board to anti-incumbent fervor .
The New York race deepened the impression that a White House that prides itself on resisting conventional political analysis had badly misjudged the key contests Tuesday — committing itself most heavily to a New Jersey election that Republican Chris Christie won handily , studiously avoiding a referendum to preserve same - sex marriage that was defeated in Maine and giving up too early in New York City .
But Obama was n’t alone in abandoning Thompson .
The city ’s Democratic donors – source of millions for the likes of Obama and Senator Chuck Schumer – closed their wallets to the Brooklyn - born Thompson , who spent less than 10 percent of the $ 90 million spent by Bloomberg .
The city ’s top politicians also kept their distance , with City Council Speaker Christine Quinn , a Bloomberg ally , endorsing Thompson so late that he , out of pique , refused to appear with her to accept her backing .
But the president ’s tepid endorsement appeared particularly calculated , and held particular sting .
Obama ’s spokesman at first refused even to say Thompson ’s name .
And Obama ’s late , weak backing did little to soothe irritation among New York ’s black leaders that the first black president – who had already tried to torpedo the state ’s floundering African - American governor – kept the African - American mayoral candidate at such a distance .
For Obama , the political reward was in associating himself with the independent Bloomberg and his non-partisan national image , not a fellow urban politician – and especially one who had appeared headed for a crushing defeat .
That might have been the smart , unsentimental political choice , but locally , it made Obama seem just a bit too infatuated with the billionaire mayor .
Thompson , in his concession speech Tuesday night , declared a kind of moral victory , looking as buoyant as he ever had in the course of a bruising campaign .
“ Some told me to sit this one out , ” he said .
“ This campaign was about defying conventional wisdom .
This campaign was [ about ] never backing down in the face of a formidable challenge . ”
Bloomberg , in turn , made no reference to the unexpectedly slim margin , but downplayed his differences with Thompson , whom he ’d pummeled with endless negative television advertisements .
The mayor appeared to write off the surprising squeaker – he beat Thompson 51 percent to 46 percent -- to anti-incumbent sentiment .
“ The public has been very clear and some incumbents have learned that they are tired of politics as usual , ” Bloomberg said , and indeed , a neighboring executive , Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi appeared Tuesday to be struggling to hold on Tuesday in another surprising outcome .
Bloomberg could not have run with more institutional support .
He had the backing of dozens of newspaper editorial boards , including the major papers – the New York Times , Daily News , and Post – and a score of ethnic publications .
The city ’s main Russian - language newspaper seemed to capture the spirit of the race on the Friday before the election with a front page endorsement under the headline : “ There is only one choice : Mike Bloomberg . ”
Voters , however , clearly saw two choices , and the result shocked and confounded the city ’s political class .
“ I ’m stunned , ” said Doug Muzzio , a professor of public affairs at Baruch College who closely follows city politics .
“ Good thing he spent $ 100 - plus million -- unless the relentless multimedia barrage reminded folks that Bloomberg was an arrogant , out of touch plutocrat . ”
Others said a round of Democratic primaries should have pointed to an electorate ready to push back .
" The primary proved that voters were deeply unhappy about term limits , " said a consultant to incoming Public Advocate Bill de Blasio , Rebecca Kirszner Katz .
" The runoff showed that polling is highly unpredictable in this environment . "
And Bloomberg ’s aides found themselves explaining a narrow margin that is well under the numbers posted even by incumbents more widely viewed as embattled , like Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , who won reelection earlier this year with 55 percent of the vote .
Bloomberg aide Howard Wolfson defended the mayor ’s victory to reporters at Bloomberg ’s victory party at a Manhattan hotel , the New York Observer reported .
" This is the most difficult environment for incumbents that I 've seen since 1994 , " he said .
“ You know , whether the Yankees win in four , or five , or six or seven , they 're going to be world champions .
On January 1 , Michael Bloomberg is going to be the mayor of New York . "
Splash Back - How Google Wave 's Beta selection is FLAWED .
This post will appear in every single Technology Blog comment section that deals with Google Wave .
On May 27th , 2009 I remember waking up early that morning because I heard that Google was going to announce something special .
As we all know that product turned out to be Google Wave , a product that Google claims to be what email would be if it were invented today .
On that day they announced that the sandbox was going to be open for developers only , and that a limited release would come later in the year to a select few people who signed up using their sign up form .
I immediately signed up because I knew that Google Wave would be very useful for my two lines of work .
As the days and months passed I read every single article from blogs like this one , I viewed countless Youtube videos that demoed exactly how Google Wave works .
My excitement grew .
It was then announced that September 30th , 2009 " 100,000 " new users would be allowed into the Google Wave beta .
I figured since I signed up early and I put in a detailed reason how I would use Google Wave I would certainly be among the first to get an invite .
I was wrong .
I have been a loyal Googler .
When the search engine launch I shared with my then High School friends why Google was better then that altavista / dogpile site they were using .
When Gmail came out I announced to my College friends that they should make the switch as I called Gmail revolutionary .
When Google acquired Blogger I bought a damn Blogger logo sweater and wore it around campus .
Google - why was n't I invited to Google Wave ?
I know of countless individuals on twitter who did n't even use your pathetic sign - up form that I filled out on May 27th who have since gone on to receive invitations just for begging on twitter !
One of my twitter friends was " nominated " 12 hours before he received an account .
Meanwhile , my wait has been over 6 months .
Your process for rolling out products is COMPLETELY UNFAIR .
You claim that there are scalability issues when it comes to your new service and this is why you are only limiting " 100,000 " invitations initially .
I call BS on this .
Your plan is to create hype around the product with a limited release like you did with Gmail and Google Voice .
Who are we kidding ?
You are Google , you have enough resources to copy every single website around the world every few minutes , but you can't scale new users on this new product ?
The only people who can activate new Google Wave users are located in Australia .
How about flying two employees to the great western hemisphere and keep them knocking off people in the original queue - you know , the list of people who signed up the morning of May 27th , 2009 .
I understand the importance of Google Wave .
I work part - time with a news gathering organization and I see how Google Wave can be very useful for the journalism world .
I also work full - time as a web developer and Google Wave will be a benefit in the collaboration of building websites .
I would be a person who would be using Google Wave every minute of every day - but I probably wo n't get invited for another 6 months because of some idiotic sign up process .
Screw you Google .

Much of our planet 's mineral wealth was deposited billions of years ago when Earth 's chemical cycles were different from today's .
Using geochemical clues from rocks nearly 3 billion years old , a group of scientists including Andrey Bekker and Doug Rumble from the Carnegie Institution have made the surprising discovery that the creation of economically important nickel ore deposits was linked to sulfur in the ancient oxygen - poor atmosphere .
These ancient ores -- specifically iron - nickel sulfide deposits -- yield 10 % of the world 's annual nickel production .
They formed for the most part between two and three billion years ago when hot magmas erupted on the ocean floor .
Yet scientists have puzzled over the origin of the rich deposits .
The ore minerals require sulfur to form , but neither seawater nor the magmas hosting the ores were thought to be rich enough in sulfur for this to happen .
" These nickel deposits have sulfur in them arising from an atmospheric cycle in ancient times .
The isotopic signal is of an anoxic atmosphere , " says Rumble of Carnegie 's Geophysical Laboratory , a co-author of the paper appearing in the November 20 issue of Science .
Rumble , with lead author Andrey Bekker ( formerly Carnegie Fellow and now at the University of Manitoba ) , and four other colleagues used advanced geochemical techniques to analyze rock samples from major ore deposits in Australia and Canada .
They found that to help produce the ancient deposits , sulfur atoms made a complicated journey from volcanic eruptions , to the atmosphere , to seawater , to hot springs on the ocean floor , and finally to molten , ore - producing magmas .
The key evidence came from a form of sulfur known as sulfur - 33 , an isotope in which atoms contain one more neutron than " normal " sulfur ( sulfur - 32 ) .
Both isotopes act the same in most chemical reactions , but reactions in the atmosphere in which sulfur dioxide gas molecules are split by ultraviolet light ( UV ) rays cause the isotopes to be sorted or " fractionated " into different reaction products , creating isotopic anomalies .
" If there is too much oxygen in the atmosphere then not enough UV gets through and these reactions can't happen , " says Rumble .
" So if you find these sulfur isotope anomalies in rocks of a certain age , you have information about the oxygen level in the atmosphere . "
By linking the rich nickel ores with the ancient atmosphere , the anomalies in the rock samples also answer the long - standing question regarding the source of the sulfur in the ore minerals .
Knowing this will help geologists track down new ore deposits , says Rumble , because the presence of sulfur and other chemical factors determine whether or not a deposit will form .
" Ore deposits are a tiny fraction of a percent of the Earth 's surface , yet economically they are incredibly important .
Modern society cannot exist without specialized metals and alloys , " he says .
" But it 's all a matter of local geological circumstance whether you have a bonanza -- or a bust . "
Enlarge By Mike Gullett , AP O'Sullivan Industries , Lamar , Mo , employed 700 workers before it closed in 2007 .
WASHINGTON  Many communities hit hardest by job losses , those built around dying factories and mills , have been slowest to see relief from President Barack Obama 's stimulus plan , underscoring how hard it is for Washington policymakers to create lasting work in areas that need it most .
The manufacturing industry has shed hundreds of thousands of jobs during the recession as plants have closed or scaled back .
Places such as the southwest Missouri city of Lamar , tucked amid endless fields of winter wheat and soybeans , have seen the cornerstones of their economies disappear , leaving a gap that even billions in roadwork and government aid cannot fill .
Lamar began feeling the recession ahead of the rest of the country , when the furniture - maker O'Sullivan Industries closed its doors in mid-2007 , immediately leaving 700 workers unemployed and turning its factory into a million - square - foot vacancy .
That began what city manager Lynn Calton calls " a slow death . "
Stores folded .
A 50 - year - old car dealership went under .
One in 10 jobs disappeared last year .
Everyone suffered , from the downtown florist to the dentist who cleaned the factory workers ' teeth .
Even Mayor Keith Divine filed for unemployment when his furniture store went out of business .
He now sells carpet and mattresses and says he has n't seen evidence of the 650,000 jobs saved or created nationwide thanks to the $ 787 billion stimulus .
" What work ?
Where ? "
Divine asks .
For the Obama administration , Lamar is as much a problem of expectations as it is of policy .
For all the items contained in the stimulus , from tax cuts to road work to new schools , nothing could quickly replace what factory towns like Lamar had lost .
That 's why the White House says it 's unfair to judge the stimulus by the unemployment rate because no amount of stimulus was going to keep Lamar 's unemployment rate from approaching 12 % .
Nationwide , only 2,500 of the 650,000 stimulus jobs announced Friday were in the manufacturing industry , and many of those appear to be mislabeled .
Teachers were the biggest winners because states used federal aid to fill budget gaps , then credited the money with avoiding layoffs — even if no such layoffs were planned .
" We have n't seen any improvements in our town , " said Gary Macklem , the mayor of Croswell , Mich. , a small city in a county built on farming and factories , where unemployment has hovered just below 20 % all year .
" We lost two factories and the other factories are hanging by a shoe string . "
One of the goals written into the stimulus was to help " those most impacted by the recession . "
And there are provisions to do just that , from increasing unemployment and Medicaid benefits to paying for worker retraining .
Places such as Croswell and Lamar also probably would have been worse off if their states had endured their budget crises without federal help .
And there are billions of dollars to upgrade the electrical grid and encourage alternative energy , an historic investment expected to spur manufacturing of wind turbines , solar panels and clean - running buses .
" Will the stimulus program by itself turn around the decades - long decline in that sector ?
Of course not , " said White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein .
" But it will help , and it will help in some of the most key areas , where manufacturing can shift from contracting to expanding . "
Such benefits are harder to see than a job and a paycheck .
In manufacturing towns , those have been difficult to create .
When they appear , they 're not what the town is used to .
O'Sullivan Industries was the kind of company that hired kids right out of high school , a company where workers could eventually pull down $ 16 an hour and work overtime when the plant was running six days a week .
Some employees had been there for 30 or more years .
People who wanted to start a family and put down roots in their hometown could go get jobs at O'Sullivan .
The stimulus can't create those types of jobs , at least not directly and not right away .
So despite Lamar 's need , the county saw just 22 jobs from the stimulus .
They are temporary positions working on a local highway project , not the kind of thing someone from O'Sullivan could easily walk into .
" They were building ready - to - assemble furniture .
Somebody out there pouring concrete is a whole different job , " said Calton , the city manager .
" I do n't know if those people were able to get on with someone doing a highway project . "
They were n't .
The highway contract went to a company that brought in crews from hours away .
Those workers count themselves as lucky , but already fear what may come next .
One man has a toddler and said he 'll take dishwashing jobs to get by once the stimulus project is over .
Word down at the union hall is that things have n't been this bad in 10 years .
" You put your name on the list , and you 're No. 90 or No. 106 , " said Bob Williams , who has worked construction since 1968 .
" You ain't going to work tomorrow . "
In Monroe County , Ala. , Georgia - Pacific Corp. idled its plywood mill this year , leaving 300 workers without jobs .
In August , Fruit of the Loom closed its dye plant , laying off more than 100 .
These were good jobs with benefits and retirement plans , said Mike Kennedy , the mayor of the county seat of Monroeville , the childhood home of author Harper Lee and the likely inspiration for the town in her book " To Kill a Mockingbird . "
Unemployment is approaching 19 % and the city budget is strained .
Kennedy said he 's hoping to receive stimulus money to make buildings more energy efficient .
That would create some jobs .
But so far , Monroeville has seen just 8 jobs from the stimulus , according to the latest data .
" We got stimulus money to build sidewalk , " Kennedy said .

We recently sat down with 36th District Representative Mary Lou Dickerson to talk about what she ’s working on for the upcoming legislative session , which convenes on January 11 , 2010 .
One bill she ’s looking to sponsor is one which would legalize marijuana .
Below are her words :
“ We have spent a fortune investigating and incarcerating people for using marijuana .
We have not only spent huge sums in this failed effort , we have required individuals and families to spend huge sums on lawyers and other expenses in order to avoid drug - abuse violations on their records .
Those who could n’t afford an effective legal defense have often seen their jobs and lives seriously harmed by the record of the legal violation .
And what have we accomplished with these societal , personal , and family costs ?
I do n’t see the positive benefits .
The expensive emphasis on prosecution and fines or other punishment has not deterred marijuana smoking , nor has it had any noticeable impact on accessibility to marijuana .
The fact that other countries which have legalized marijuana have not seen consumption rates rise sharply is further evidence that our present policy is a monumentally expensive failure .
The people I represent have made clear how they feel by their votes on medical marijuana and their votes on the local ordinance that made marijuana investigations the lowest police priority .
As Chair of the Human Services Committee , which oversees corrections and juvenile justice issues , it ’s long been clear to me that we need to make smarter investments in criminal justice , drug and mental health treatment and other efforts that DO work to reduce criminal and unhealthy behavior .
We simply ca n’t afford to waste more time , money or human resources on efforts that do n’t work and that can actually backfire to harm people we want to help .
Treating marijuana more like liquor will turn a drain on our scarce resources into a net benefit that can help us fund drug treatment and other strategies that really do make a positive difference to people ’s lives . ”
Senior monetary officials usually talk in code .
So when Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , spoke recently about Asia , international imbalances and the financial crisis , he did n’t specifically criticize China ’s outrageous currency policy .
But he did n’t have to : everyone got the subtext .
China ’s bad behavior is posing a growing threat to the rest of the world economy .
The only question now is what the world  and , in particular , the United States  will do about it .
Some background :
The value of China ’s currency , unlike , say , the value of the British pound , is n’t determined by supply and demand .
Instead , Chinese authorities enforced that target by buying or selling their currency in the foreign exchange market  a policy made possible by restrictions on the ability of private investors to move their money either into or out of the country .
There ’s nothing necessarily wrong with such a policy , especially in a still poor country whose financial system might all too easily be destabilized by volatile flows of hot money .
In fact , the system served China well during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s .
The crucial question , however , is whether the target value of the yuan is reasonable .

Going from releasing GNOME 2.27.x unstable releases of GNOME Shell to GNOME 2.29.x unstable releases of GNOME
Shell naturally involves crossing 2.28 in the middle , so we thought we ’d take the opportunity to make a set of tarballs that are little more stable than the typical Friday snapshots .
A good place for people to try things out .
I ’ve just uploaded mutter - 2.28.0 and gnome - shell - 2.28.0 tarballs to ftp.gnome.org .
If you want to building things yourself , you still should use the JHBuild setup described on our wiki page .
It ’s the easiest way to do it .
The tarballs are really designed for people creating distribution packages .
Looking back , I have n’t blogged about GNOME Shell changes since February .
That ’s a very long time so I ’m not going to make any attempt to describe here what all has changed since then .
( 693 commits just to the gnome - shell Git module . )
To find all the nooks and crannys of the GNOME
Shell user interface you can use the neat cheat sheet that Marina created .
It ’s a good way to learn about the secret commands supported by the Alt - F2 dialog without going to the source code , as well as to get an overview of the more user - oriented parts of the shell .
Considering only at the changes in the last few weeks , the biggest change recently has been to the Alt - Tab dialog ; Jon McCann and Jeremy Perry ( one of the designers here at Red Hat ) came up with some ideas about how the Alt - Tab could better integrate with the way we group windows by application in the Activities Overview , and Dan Winship did a lot of work to make those ideas into something we could try out .
Steve Frécinaux also jumped in more recently to help out with this .
Jon ’s going to describe the design ideas involved in more detail soon , so save your ideas for improvement for his post , but here ’s a quick screenshot to whet your appetite :
The other big recent change is n’t so screenshot - able , but Colin and I took some interesting parts of the NBTK library from Moblin and imported it into GNOME Shell as ST ( the Shell Toolkit ) .
( We ’re still cooperating closely with Moblin on the work ; the rename is just to keep things non-confusing . )
We get several nice things from this : scrolling , better layout capabilities , but the big change is the ability to use CSS for styling .
NBTK already had a good start on this , and I then merged in some work I did last year for hippo-canvas to get extra capabilities like CSS styling of borders and fonts .
This is really intended to make development easier – so we do n’t have to have all sorts of hardcoded fonts , colors , and pixel sizes in the code , but also should provide a good entry point for artists to work on alternate appearances for the shell .
Oh , and I quickly used ST to hack up a drop - down calendar when you click on the clock .
So you can finally find out what day of the month it is in GNOME
Shell without having to run ‘ cal ’ in a terminal .
We hope people will try it out , and see how it works for them in practice ; packages will be in Fedora rawhide shortly and the JHBuild I mentioned above really is easy to get going on any recent Linux distribution if you are n’t running something quite so up - to - date .
If you are in the Boston area , come to the GNOME Summit this weekend .
All the developers working at Red Hat on the shell will be there , and hopefully a few other shell developers as well .
You can see the shell in action , talk to us , and just in case you are having trouble getting it compiling , we ’ll help you with that too .
MELBOURNE has new train and tram operators , with the staff behind the Connex and Yarra Trams brands having handed over the system to new management at 3.01 am today .
Connex bowed out with a whimper on Friday , announcing its failure to run the city 's trains on time in the past month meant yearly and monthly ticket holders could claim two free tickets as compensation .
In its final days , the operator was also forced to impound another of the city 's Siemens trains because it had overshot a train platform last week .
Meanwhile , it has emerged that the new French operator of Melbourne 's tram system , Keolis , will have to run fewer trams on time than the previous operator managed to do .
The tower has been redesigned more than once
The Freedom Tower is being built on the site of the Twin Towers destroyed in the 11 September 2001 attacks .
Architects redesigned it after police expressed concern that the 1,776 - foot ( 540 - metre ) building could be vulnerable to truck bomb attacks .
Under new plans it is further from the road and has a strengthened structure .
The redesign calls for a concrete and steel pedestal , clad in ornamental metalwork , and topped by a tower of glass .
The building is capped with a mast incorporating an antenna , which is meant to evoke the torch of the Statue of Liberty .
" This new design reflects a soaring tribute to freedom and a bedrock commitment to safety and security , " New York Governor George Pataki said .
Completion delay
The symbolic height - which in feet refers to the year of the American Declaration of Independence - is one of the few features left from the initial plans .
The building 's chief architect said he felt better about the new one than the original .
WORLD TRADE CENTER SITE TIMELINE July 2002 : Lower Manhattan Development Corporation ( LMDC ) releases six initial design concepts and , in following months , launches global search for design and planning professionals Dec 2002 : LMDC releases nine initial designs and launches outreach campaign to engage public in planning process Feb 2003 : Memory Foundations by Studio Daniel Libeskind selected as plan Sept 2003 : Release of refined master site plan July 2004 :
The cornerstone of the new building is laid
Libeskind : Visionary architect
The Freedom Tower 's cornerstone was laid last July , but an assessment by the New York Police Department urged architects to rethink some elements of its structure .
Police feared it would be difficult to protect the building against a possible truck bomb because of the heavy traffic along nearby West Street .
Under the new plans , the distance from West Street has been increased from 25 feet ( 7.6 metres ) to an average of 90 feet ( 28 metres ) , AP reports .
Rows and hitches
The project has been mired in controversy .
Initial designs for a replacement for the World Trade Center were greeted with disappointment by the public .
In 2003 the plan submitted by architect Daniel Libeskind was selected , but the boldness of his original proposals was later toned down .
A lower insurance payout on the Twin Towers than had been expected by the leaseholder further complicated the project .
And victims ' relatives argued that construction would damage the foundations of the Twin Towers , which they regard a piece of American history .
The building is due to be completed by the end of the decade .
The skyscraper is planned to be among the tallest buildings in the world .
