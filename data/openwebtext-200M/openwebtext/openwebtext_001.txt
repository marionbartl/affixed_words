Introduction
The Holy Grail of online music sales is the ability to offer iPod - compatible tracks .
Like the quest for the mythical cup itself , the search for iPod compatibility has been largely fruitless for Apple 's competitors , whose DRM schemes are incompatible with the iconic music player .
For a music store that wants to succeed , reaching the iPod audience is all but a necessity in the the US market , where Apple products account for 78 percent of the total players sold .
Perhaps that 's why eMusic CEO David Pakman sounds downright gleeful when he points out that " there 's only two companies in the world that can sell to them Apple and eMusic . "
It 's rather a startling point — given the worldwide success that Apple has had selling iPods , one would think that music stores would do whatever it takes to make their offerings iPod-compatible .
Attempts at bypassing or emulating Apple 's FairPlay have not been successful , however , and FairPlay is ( famously ) unavailable for licensing .
So what 's a music store to do ?
To eMusic , the answer was simple : you offer songs as high quality , variable bit rate MP3 files instead .
DRM is removed , consumers are happy , and the vast white fields of the iPod are ready for harvest .
It sounds like such a simple idea , but in the context of the music business , this is radical , French Revolution - type stuff .
What 's perhaps even more interesting is the fact that eMusic 's decision to offer unprotected MP3 files was not an ideological one ; the idea made great business sense , and has established eMusic as the # 2 retailer of downloadable music behind the iTunes Music Store .
The fact that it opened the way for iPod compatibility was really just a bonus , since a couple of years back , it was much less clear that Apple would come to dominate the market in the way that it does today .
" It 's really not a philosophical decision ; it 's a practical one , " says Pakman .
" Early on , the belief was that we had to sell music in the only universally compatible format that existed .
TiVo was just about to come out with MP3 playback on their machine and we did n't know if that was going to be big .
There were a bunch of MP3 players on the market , including the iPod , and that market was growing .
There were MP3 car stereos happening .
There were n't any phones , but you can see that 's where it was going .
Everyone was putting MP3 in their device , so why not sell in a format that works in all those places ? "
Indeed , when put this way , it sounds amazing that no one else ( apart from some dubious Russians ) has released music that will play on the widest possible array of devices .
There 's a reason this does n't happen , of course : the music labels wo n't allow it .
Actually , the major music labels wo n't allow it — but there 's a whole ecosystem of independent music labels that want nothing more than wide exposure and fair compensation .
What eMusic has done is to construct a business model built around indie music — and they 're now selling 5 million tracks a month doing it .
That 's because indie music does n't ( necessarily ) mean bands with a fan club of six .
A good chunk of the best work being done today comes from indie musicians like Bloc Party , the Drive - By Truckers , Gomez , Interpol , Belle & Sebastian , Tom Waits , Nick Cave , Pedro the Lion , Dolorean , Calexico , Arcade Fire , Spoon , Dar Williams , Ron Sexsmith , Modern Skirts , and Ryan Adams , all of whom are carried by eMusic .
The company has built itself into an indie music powerhouse that now offers more than a million tracks and 175,000 subscribers , and it sells its songs for about a quarter each .
Though in no danger of eclipsing Apple 's one billion track sales , the company looks well - placed to cater to the over - 25 music lover , a group not always well - served by the major labels .
But things have n't always gone so well for the company ...

Tony Robbins says that thinking is a process of asking and answering questions .
He stresses the importance of asking the right questions to get the right answers and therefore the right results .
I agree with him .
Most people ask lousy questions that cripple their results .
Lousy questions turn your focus away from what you want and towards more of what you do n’t want .
And since we ask and answer mental questions every day , our questions wield great power over our results .
Here are some examples of weak questions vs. strong questions :
Upon waking up early
Weak : Can I fall back asleep again ?
Should I go back to bed ?
Strong :
What would be the best way to start my day ?
How can I energize myself ?
Where can I find something inspirational or motivational to read right now ?
When contemplating exercise ( and feeling unmotivated )
Weak :
Is it too hot / cold to exercise ?
Can I skip it for today ?
What difference will it make if I just skip a day ?
Do n’t I deserve a day off ?
Strong :
Wo n’t it feel great hitting the showers afterwards ?
What should I listen to while I workout ?
Wo n’t it be wonderful to achieve my fitness goals ?
How can I make this session more fun ?
When considering a dietary improvement
Weak :
What foods am I going to have to give up ?
How am I going to deal with the deprivation ?
Am I going to have to eat like this forever ?
Strong :
What foods that I like will I get to eat more of ?
What new foods can I experiment with ?
Wo n’t it be great when I reach my goal weight ?
Wo n’t it be wonderful to finally master this area of my life once and for all ?
Once I succeed at this , who else can I help ?
Nearing the end of the workday
Weak :
Have I done enough that I can justify quitting for the day ?
Is this a good time to stop ?
Can I finish this tomorrow ?
Strong :
What ’s next ?
How can I complete one more task ?
How much more can I get done today ?
When spending time with the kids
Weak :
Why do I have to do so much childcare ?
How can I keep the kids from draining my energy this evening ?
What ’s the bare minimum I can do to keep them out of my hair ?
How early can I put them to bed ?
Strong :
What can I do with the kids that will leave me feeling energized ?
What do I appreciate most about my kids ?
What would I enjoy doing with them this evening ?
What would happen if I let my kids direct how we spend our time together ?
When facing an unfamiliar social situation
Weak :
How can I avoid looking like an idiot ?
What should I talk about ?
How can I keep from being too nervous or shy ?
How did I get myself into this situation ?
Can I get out of going ?
Strong :
Wo n’t it be fun to meet some interesting new people ?
If I see someone there who ’s a bit shy , what can I do to make him / her feel more comfortable ?
What can I expect others at this event to have in common with me ?
When feeling depressed , anxious , or otherwise negative
Weak :
Why do I feel so down ?
Why ca n’t I be happy ?
How come I never get any time to myself ?
Strong :
What can I do to energize myself ?
Who can I talk to that would help cheer me up ?
What can I read or listen to that would inspire me ?
Are these feelings trying to tell me something — should I go journal about them ?
How long can I hold a fake smile before it forces me to start feeling good again ?
What ’s the difference ?
Weak questions are disempowering .
They keep your focused on your own ego , your problems , and your shortcomings .
Weak questions keep you focused on what ’s wrong … on what is n’t working .
That might seem like a good idea , but all it does is further reinforce the situation you ’d like to change .
Weak questions will lead your brain to come up with answers that are useless , circular , or even destructive .
Yet weak questions are addictive .
At first glance they may even seem helpful , and that ’s why they ’re so insidious .
You might think that if you ’re depressed , the best thing you can do is to ask , “ Why am I so depressed ? ” Perhaps if you could diagnose the problem , you could cure it .
But it does n’t work that way .
When you ’re in a negative state or situation , you are n’t thinking clearly to begin with .
You ’re in no position to accurately diagnose yourself .
Effectively you ’re blind .
So the answers you get back will be worthless .
At best you ’ll merely come up with a temporary solution , but the underlying condition will remain , and the problem will simply submerge and crop up again later , sometimes in a different form .
Asking why you ’re depressed merely feeds your depression .
In answering the why question , now you ’ve added a story on top of your depression .
That goes way beyond acknowledging your depression and trying to do something about it .
Strong questions are empowering .
They keep you focused on solutions , on what you can control .
When you focus on what you can do , you avoid falling into analysis paralysis .
Ultimately the way out of any negative situation is right thinking .
Wrong thinking leads you in circles .
Right thinking leads to action .
Going back to the depression example , the first thing you need to do is to get yourself to a more positive emotional state .
And with practice that can be done in a matter of minutes — even seconds if you ’ve studied NLP .
Strong questions will help you shift your focus away from depression and the thoughts that reinforce it and towards action .
When you focus too much thought on what you ca n’t control and do n’t like , depression is a natural consequence .
When you ask different questions to focus on what you can control and what you like , depression will lift .
Mediocre results largely come about from asking mediocre questions .
Great results come from asking great questions .
If you do n’t like the results you ’re getting , try asking completely different questions from the ones you ’re used to asking .
Ask questions that turn your focus towards your goals instead of away from them .
Ask questions that allow you to enhance the pleasure in your life instead of creating greater pain .
消えるルー プ
簡単だけど、よくありそうな例として、こんなのを考えてみよう。
入力テキストの行数を数える関数 count_lines を書きたい。 Cで書くとすれば、こんな感じだ。
/* 例 1 */ int count_lines ( void ) { int count = 0 , c ; for ( c=getchar ( ) ; c!=EOF ; c=getchar ( ) ) { if ( c == '
' ) count ++ ; } return count ; }
Schemeにも明示的なループを記述する do 構文がある。 敢え てC風に記述すれば、こんな感じになる。
; ; 例2 ( define ( count - lines ) ( let ( ( count 0 ) ) ( do ( ( c ( read - char ) ( read- char ) ) ) ; c=getchar ( ) ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ; EOF な らreturn count ; ( if ( char= ? c #
ewline ) ( set! count (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) )
do構文ではループ終了テストが2番目の引数に来ることを除けば、ほぼ一対一に
コードが対応しているのがわかると思う。 しかし、do構文はカッコがたくさんあってどうもわかりにくい
( *1 ) 。Scheme好きな私でさえそう思うくらいだ。
もちっと 、「 Schemeらしい 」 書き方( 私の主観だが ) をしてみよう。
;; 例3 ( define ( count - lines ) ( define ( loop count ) ( let ( ( c ( read - char ) ) ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char= ? c #
ewline ) ( loop (+ count 1 ) ) ) ( else ( loop count ) ) ) ) ) ( loop 0 ) )
ループ構文が消えてしまった。代わりにローカル関数 loop を定義して、 そいつを再帰的に呼び出している ( * 2 ) 。 そう 、Schemeプログラマは再帰が大好きで、 とにかくなんでもかんでも再帰で書きたがる。
手続き型言語では、再帰はイメージが悪い。 よく例に出され るQuick Sortみたいに 本質的に再帰的なアルゴリズムならともかく、ループで書けるものを
わざわざスタックを消費して再帰にするなんて、というわけだ。 だが、Schemerが再帰を好むのは、単に「ループは再帰で書き直せる」という
アルゴリズムのクラスの教科書の記述を確かめたいからじゃない。
ちゃんと実用上の利点があるんだ。
再帰は重いの か
まず、あなたが 「再帰は重い」という概念を持っているとしたら、
それを捨ててもらわなくちゃならない。
ローカル関数loopの定義をよく見てみよう、EOFの場合以外は、
それぞれ分岐した枝の最後でloopそれ自身を呼んでいる。
カッコをとっぱらって疑似コードで書いてみると分かりやすいかも。
; ; 例 4 define loop ( count ) c = read - char ( ) c == EOF な らcountを返す c == '
' なら loop ( count +1 ) を呼ぶ それ以外なら loop ( count ) を呼ぶ
関数ボディ内で、条件によって処理が3つに分岐している。こんなふうに、
処理がフォークのように分岐してゆくパターンは、普段のプログラミングで 良く出て来る。 関数の一番最後の処理(分岐がある場合は、それぞれの分岐した枝の先の最後の処理)
が関数呼び出しである場合、それを末尾呼び出し( tail call ) という。 この例のように、末尾呼び出しが再帰的に行われるのは末尾再帰という。
Schemeの大きな特徴は、tail callがgotoと等価になることだ( * 3 ) 。
すなわち、例4の疑似コードは、あたかも次の疑似コードのように評価される。
; ; 例 5 ( * 4 ) loop : c = read - char ( ) c == EOF な らcountを返す c == '
' なら count = count + 1 ; goto loop ; それ以外なら count = count ; goto loop ;
Gotoと言ってもブロックの先頭に飛んでいるだけだから、Perlでのnext文や Cのcontinue文と同じことだ。これは、理論上そうなるってだけじゃなくて、
実際に計算機の上で実行されるコードが、next文やcontinue文と同じってことだ。
例3に示した再帰のプログラムは、実行時型検査などの点を除けば
例1のCプログラムと同じように実行される。実際、型情報も取り扱えるように 拡張されたSchemeコンパイラなら、例1のCプログラムをコンパイルしたのと
ほとんど同じ機械語を生成するはずだ。
末尾再帰がループと同等に実行されるのは、コンパイラによるオプショナルな最適化ではない。
Schemeは、末尾呼び出しでスタックを消費しないことを言語規格上要求している。
Schemeプログラマは、例3のコードから例5の処理を一瞬で思い浮かべる。
いや、思い浮かべるというよりも、例3のコードと例5の処理は全く同一、
不可分なものとして認識されていると言ったほうがいいかな。
「処理」という漢字を見て「しょり」という読みを思い浮かべるみたいなもんだ。
もちろん、プログラムを書く時には、例5の様なアルゴリズムを考えて、
それを自然にコードに書き下すと、例3のコードになるというわけだ。
ループと末尾再帰のコードを同一視するには多少慣れが必要だけれど、
よく現われるパターンというのはある。 CやPerlのループ構文では、何もしなければループが継続し、
中断したいときは break や last を使う。 再帰で繰り返しを書く時には、逆に何もしないとループから抜けて、 繰り返したい時に末尾呼び出しを使うんだ。 これは 、Perlの名前つきブロックに良く似ている。
相互末尾再 帰
再帰より明示的ループの方がわかりやすいのに、なんでわざわざ再帰にするの?
という疑問がまだあるかもしれない。ちょっと問題を複雑にしてみようか。
今度は、行数のかわりに単語の数を数えてみよう。ここで、単語とはひとつ以上の空白文字
で区切られた文字列であるとする。Cで書くならこんな感じだ。コメント内の数字は、 後 のSchemeコードとの対応をわかりやすく示すためのものだ。
/* 例 6 */ int count_words ( ) { int count = 0 ; /* カウンタ */ int ws = TRUE ; /* 直前に読んだ文字が空白ならTRUE
*/ int c ; for ( c=getchar ( ) ; c!=EOF ; c=getchar ( ) ) { if ( isspace ( c ) ) { ws = TRUE ; /* [ 1 ] */ } else { if ( ws ) count ++ ; /* [ 2 ] */ ws = FALSE ; /* [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] */ } } return count ; }
再帰を使って書く場合、ループ内で変更される変数を引数にする。こんな感じだ。
; ; 例7 ( define ( count - words ) ( define ( loop c ws count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( loop ( read - char ) #t count ) ) ; [ 1 ] ( ws ( loop ( read - char ) #f (+ count 1 ) ) ) ; [ 2 ] ( else ( loop ( read - char ) #f count ) ) ) ) ; [ 3 ] ( loop ( read - char ) #t 0 ) )
Cのコードにあった、代入やインクリメントが消えてしまった。それらは、再帰的に
呼び出す関数への引数渡しという形に変換されている。例えば、読んだ文字 c が空白文字で無く、かつフラグ ws が真の場 合 ( [ 2 ] ) 、 次の ループの ws には偽が渡され、 count には (+ count 1 ) が渡されている。 ( なお、ここでは読み込んだ文 字 c も引数にしてしまっているが、 スタイルの問題 。 例 3のように、loopのボディでlet文を使ってもいい。 私はわりと何でも引数にしてしまう質だ ) 。
ところで、上の実装では、直前に空白文字を読んでいるかどうかという
状態を記憶しておくためにフラグ ws を導入していた。 変数を使うかわりに、直前に空白文字を読んだ時に呼ばれる関数と そうでない場合に呼ばれる関数とを別々に定義しておいて、どちらの関数が 呼ばれているかで現在の状態を表す、という手法がある。 前者を in - space 、後者を in - word という 関数で表現してみたものが、次のコード例だ 。
; ; 例8 ( define ( count - words ) ( define ( in - word c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - space c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( in - space ( read - char ) 0 ) )
in - space と in - word がお互いを 再帰的に呼び合っているので、相互再帰と言ったりする。 この場合でも、お互いの呼び出しは必ず関数のいちばん最後にあるから、 末尾再帰と言える。末尾呼び出しをgotoに置き換えて処理の流れを 疑似コードを示してみよう 。
; ; 例9 define count - words ( ) c = read - char ( ) ; count = 0 ; goto in - space ; in - word : if c == EOF return count ; if whitespace ( c ) { c = read - char ( ) ; goto in - space ; } else { c = read - char ( ) ; count += 1 ; goto in - word ; } in - space : if c == EOF return count ; if whitespace ( c ) { c = read - char ( ) ; goto in - space ; } else { c = read - char ( ) ; goto in - word ; }
さらに、ダブルクオートで囲まれた部分については、そのダブルクオートが閉じられるまでを
( 例え空白文字が中にあっても)一単語と数える、という仕様にしてみようか。
クオートされた文字列注にダブルクオートを含める場合はバックスラッシュでエスケープ するものとする。
現在、ダブルクオートで囲まれた文字列を読んでいる、という状態を
関数 in - quote に対応させてみたものが次のコードだ 。
; ; 例 10 ( define ( count - words ) ( define ( in - word c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - space c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - quote c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) ( error " EOF in quoted word " ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \\ ) ( read - char ) ( in - quote ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( in -quote ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( in - space ( read - char ) 0 ) )
各々の関数が現在の状態を表しており、次に呼び出す関数が次の状態への遷移であると
考えると、上記のコードは状態遷移図そのままであるとも言える。フラグによって
状態を管理する実装と、どちらが見やすいか、というのはケースバイケースだが、
条件が入り組んで来ると、相互再帰で書かれたコードの方が見やすいと私は思う。
これでもまだ再帰のメリットに納得しない?
なら、こんな仕様はどうかな。 上記の仕様に加えて、開き括弧が出て来たら、閉じ括弧が出て来るまでを
一単語とみなす。但し、括弧はネスト可能、つまり、 `abc ( def ( ghi ) jkl ) mno' は、`abc ' , `( def ( ghi ) jkl ) ' , `mno ' の 3単語とみなすんだ 。 但しダブルクオートで囲まれた文字列の中では括弧は機能しないとする。さてどうだ ( * 5 ) 。
; ; 例 11 ( define ( count - words ) ( define ( in - word c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) # f ) ) ( ( char= ? c #\() ( in - paren ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) # f ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - space c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) # f ) ) ( ( char= ? c #\() ( in - paren ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) # f ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - quote c count nested ? ) ( cond ( ( eof - object ? c ) ( error " EOF in quoted word " ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( if nested ?
count ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \\ ) ( read - char ) ( in - quote ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ( else ( in - quote ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - paren c count nested ? ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) ( error " EOF in parenthesis " ) ) ( ( char= ? c #\() ( in - paren ( read - char ) count # t ) ( in - paren ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ ) ) ( if nested ?
count ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) count # t ) ( in - paren ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ( else ( in - paren ( read - char ) count nested ? ) ) ) ) ( in - space ( read - char ) 0 ) )
ネストした括弧の処理は、本質的に再帰的な処理だ。
だから、括弧の中を処理するルーチン in - paren の中で、 括弧やダブルクオートが出て来た場合に、それぞれを処理するルーチンを再帰的に 呼んでいる。ネストした処理に関わる in - paren と in - quote はネスト中かどうかのフラグを取り、もしネスト中であれば in - space に制御を渡さずにそのままリターンする ( 例11ではcountを返しているが 、 実はその結果は無視されるので何を返しても良い。)
単語の数を数えるという処理に限っていえば、Cでも括弧のネスティングレベルを
数えることにより実現できるけれど、もしこれが入力を解析して何らかの構造を
組み立ててゆくようなプログラムだったらどうだろう。
Cだと、結局自分でスタック的な構造を書くか、再帰を使うしかなくなるだろう。
Schemeでは、全く同じパターンでコードが書ける。
本質的な処理の流れが同じなら、コードも同じように書けてしかるべきだ。
これが、プログラミング言語の抽象化の能力だ。
開かれたルー プ
ま、再帰を使おうがフラグ＋ループ構文を使おうが、コードの見やすさは慣れの問題だ。
しかし、再帰コードには、ループ構文ではちょっと出来ない芸当もできる。
次のコードは、 例8 のコードに加え、引数 user - char で 与えられた文字に出会った際に、引数 user - proc で与えられた 関数に制御を移すものだ。つまり、この関数を使う人が振舞いをカスタマイズできる と思ってもらえば良い 。
( define ( count - words user - char user - proc ) ( define ( in - word c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c user - char ) ( user - proc ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( define ( in - space c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) count ) ( ( char - whitespace ? c ) ( in - space ( read - char ) count ) ) ( ( char= ? c user - char ) ( user - proc ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ( else ( in - word ( read - char ) (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( in - space ( read - char ) 0 ) )
この関数を次のように呼び出せば、例10と同じ動作をする。
( define ( in - quote c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) ( error " EOF in quoted word " ) ) ( ( char= ? c # \ " ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( count - words ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( count - words # \ " in - quote )
関数 count - words が複雑な動作をするブラックボックスであったとしても、 ユーザーは自分の好きな動作をプログラムした関数を渡して、部分的に処理を 置き換えることが出来る。 末尾再帰を正しく処理す るScheme実装ならば、 user - proc の末尾呼び出しはスタックを消費しない。 また、ユーザが定義した関数 in - quote から count - words を呼び出す時もスタックを消費しない。それぞれの関数ブロックへの先頭へジャンプすることで、 あたかも count - words と in - quote 全体が 一つのループになったかのように実行される*6 。
また、ユーザ関数は、繰り返しを続けたい時のみ count - words を呼べば良い。 繰り返しを途中で止めたければ、普通に値を返すだけだ。 それが最初に呼ばれた count - words の戻り値となる 。
Cでループ構文を使った場合でも、関数ポインタを渡すようにすれば
ユーザによる拡張は実現できる。しかし、ユーザ関数を呼ぶ時に
スタックフレームが消費されるし、ユーザ関数がループを中断できるようにするには
また別のメカニズムが必要になる。
in - quote は任意のクロージャで良いから、 in - quote 自身が 他の関数の内部で定義された関数であってもよい。次の関数は、 ユーザから渡された文字 quoter をクオート文字として、 count - words を呼び出す関数だ。 この例では、 二つの独立した関 数 ( count - words , count - words - with - quote ) の中でローカルに定義されたコードブロックをまたがって処理のループが構成されることになる。
( define count - words - with - quote quoter ) ( define ( in- quote c count ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) ( error " EOF in quoted word " ) ) ( ( char= ? c quoter ) ( in -quote ( read - char ) count ) ) ( else ( count - words ( read - char ) count ) ) ) ) ( count - words quoter in - quote )
Schemeプログラマが再帰を好んで使う理由は、こんな柔軟性なんだ。

EXPERIMENTS WITH CASCADING STYLE SHEETS
What it 's all about ...
" Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) is a simple mechanism for adding style ( e.g. fonts , colors , spacing ) to Web documents . "
The above quote , taken from the W3C website , is one of the reasons for this site .
Whilst I agree that it is a mechanism for adding style to web documents , I do not agree that it is a SIMPLE mechanism .
It can be very complicated , as I found out when I took my first steps down this path .
CSS PLAY , by the way , is now listed on the w3c.org website .
So I have created this site in the hope that it will help newcomers to CSS and show old hands that it is more than just a mechanism for styling your documents .
It is oh so much more .
Because CSS PLAY deals with experimental CSS that is exactly what you get JUST CSS , no javascript or any other programming language has been used in any of the demonstrations .
For javascript demonstrations please visit the iStu website which will take you to another of my sites which is dedicated to demonstrations using CSS and minimal , unobtrusive , javascript .
Use the correct DocType Definition ( DTD )
Please , please , please note that for most of my demonstrations to work , especially in Internet Explorer , you MUST use a standards compliant !
DOCTYPE , and for Internet Explorer this MUST be the first line of your ( x ) html .
Using < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> will switch IE into quirks mode .
A list of the recommended DTDs can be found at the following link :
Recommended DTDs to use in your Web document .
A little bit about us
CSS PLAY is a partnership between myself and my wife .
My name is Stuart Nicholls , but known to everyone as just Stu .
I am 73 years old , married with two children , worked as an electronics design draughtsman , until I resigned to become a self employed ( freelance ) web designer / adviser , and have a passion for computers and photography .
My wife is Fran Nicholls who assists in the day to day running of the site and also controls the accounts as well as having an input into the demonstrations .
We started out with computers in the 1980s when I began writing articles on the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum for the computer magazines of the time .
I was also commissioned by McGraw - Hill to write two books on Z80 programming for the ZX Spectrum , Fran helped to produce the manuscripts for these books .
The web was the next big attraction and once more I have become hooked , as you can no doubt tell , with CSS .
This site has been around since 2005 and is now at the forefront of CSS development .
We thank you all for your support and comments and should you wish to link back to CSS PLAY please feel free to use this button .
What has happened to my previous home pages ?
The alternative styles and my javascript switcher have been dropped from this new layout , primarily because any changes I wanted to make to this home page required updating the CSS for every style .
However , these styles have not been lost , but note that they are not responsive .
If you wish to see these previous home pages then visit my archives .
But where 's the code ?
I have had many emails asking where the code / style can be found for the various demonstrations .
Well the html is always placed in the # info div , so examine the source code , find the < div id = " info " >.....</ div > and in between is the ' code ' .
In most case the style is embedded in the page < head > ...</ head >.
This is done to keep it all together on the same page making it easier to find .
In some cases the css is held in a separate file ( where it should be ) and is loaded in the normal way < link rel= " stylesheet " media= " all " type =" text / css " href= " path to css file.css " /> so just add this path to the address in your browser to see the css file .
There are different kinds of meetings in IT companies .
Some make sense , and others do n’t ; some are interesting , and others boring .
Specifically , we can categorize meetings into two different types , as far as developers are concerned :
The short meeting .
In this type of meeting , the developer is n’t present at all until a technical question pops up .
This results in someone running to the developer ’s desk asking the developer to please attend the meeting for a minute .
When the developer enters the room , the question posed from someone in the puzzled meeting crowd will be along the lines of “ Is it possible to export Excel files to XML , and then print the XML ? ”
Now , the answer to this question is always “ Yes , that ’s technically possible . ”
Ask a cook if it ’s possible to boil 10 fish heads for a week and them stack them up vertically on a plate , and you ’ll get the same answer .
When the developer turns around to leave the meeting room he ’ll be thinking “ Yes , it ’s possible , but no sane soul on earth would ever wanna do that ” but that ’s really besides the point .
The long meeting .
Now , with long meetings for which the developer is asked to be present at all times , we can further subdivide into two groups : 1 . Non-developers listen and talk .
This one might end up being a constructive meeting .
Surviving it is a breeze .
2. Non-developers talk , but never listen .
This one is a bit more tough .
From a developer perspective it ’s useless to try to say something in those meetings , but that ’s not necessarily bad .
There are two cases here ; a ) the non-developers tell you something interesting , and b ) the non-developers tell you something old , boring and redundant .

Over the last two years , more than 30 people died awaiting liver transplants at UCI Medical Center in Orange as the hospital turned down scores of organs that might have saved them , according to a federal report .
More than 100 UCI patients still are waiting for transplants , and 28 have joined the roster this year alone -- despite a staffing shortage that dampens their prospects for a transplant .
Although patients may not know it , the UC Irvine medical center has not had a full - time liver transplant surgeon since July 2004 .
The center has performed just five liver transplants this year and has consistently fallen below the minimum number required by the federal government to maintain funding , according to the report from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .
Advertisement
The low number of surgeries was not for lack of offers .
Between August 2004 and July 2005 , the hospital received 122 liver offers , most of them from the regional organ procurement agency , which coordinates donations and offers in Southern California .
But only 12 were transplanted , including two that went to the same patient because the first one failed , according to the Aug. 5 federal report , obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act .
Even when patients did get transplants , the report says , they did not fare as well as they should have .
Only 68.6 % of patients who received liver transplants at UCI from January 2002 to June 2004 survived at least a year -- well below the 77 % survival rate required for federal certification .
Research has shown that surgical success rates at hospitals are linked to the number of procedures performed .
The report suggests that UCI ’s problems existed for years .
The review was prompted by a complaint from a former UCI patient who had languished on the list from 1998 to 2002 .
The woman , who ultimately received a transplant at another hospital , discovered only through a lawsuit that UCI had turned down more than 90 organs offered for her .

In refusing organs over the last year , the center often cited their poor quality .
But most of the livers turned down by UCI this year were subsequently accepted by other hospitals and transplanted into their patients , said Thomas Mone , chief executive officer of OneLegacy , the organ procurement group in Southern California .
On its website , the UCI program projects professionalism and stability .
The site includes a brief biography of its chief of transplantation , Dr. Marquis Hart .
It makes no mention that Hart spends most of his time as a transplant surgeon at UC San Diego .
UCI ’s other liver transplant surgeon , Dr. Ajai Khanna , also is on staff at UC San Diego , 90 miles away .
Federal standards require that a surgeon be constantly available .

When federal inspectors visited UCI on July 19 and 20 , a liver transplant surgeon “ was nowhere in the immediate vicinity of the hospital , ” according to the report .
On the 19th , staff at the hospital told inspectors , the on - call surgeon was operating on patients all day at another hospital -- apparently UC San Diego .
The following day , the same “ covering ” physician was out of state and unavailable .
All the while , one of the hospital ’s patients was “ on the highest priority list for transplantation should a liver be available , ” the report says .
A UCI official on Wednesday did not address the specific allegations in the federal report , saying only that the medical center was making improvements to its liver program .
Dr. David Imagawa , who since July has overseen the liver transplant program , said the hospital had recruited a full - time transplant surgeon who would start early next year .
Until then , part - timers will continue providing coverage .
Advertisement
“ We agree that there were some problems , and we ’re moving forward to change them , ” said Imagawa , who founded UCI ’s liver transplant program in 1994 , left in 2002 and only recently returned .
The medical center has been shaken by two other major healthcare scandals in recent years .
In an internationally publicized case , fertility doctors in the mid-1990s stole the eggs of patients , implanting them in infertile women who in some instances gave birth .
The university paid out nearly $ 20 million to settle legal claims .
And in 1999 , UC Irvine fired Christopher Brown , the director of its donated cadaver program , amid suspicion that he had improperly sold spines to an Arizona research program .
The buyers paid $ 5,000 to a company owned by a business associate of Brown .
Brown was not prosecuted .

In the case of the liver program , patients apparently had no idea that UCI was passing up livers on their behalf .
When a potential donor is near death , the regional organ procurement agency looks for the sickest patient at the hospitals within its region and moves down the list until a hospital accepts the organ .
Patients generally are told only of the offers that are accepted .
Elodie Irvine , 51 , whose case gave rise to the federal inspection , went on the waiting list in 1998 with polycystic kidney and liver disease , a condition in which her organs developed large cysts .
Her liver eventually swelled to five times its normal size .
In 1999 , Imagawa wrote to the national organ oversight agency pleading Irvine ’s case .
Advertisement
“ We believe that due to the mass of her liver if she is not transplanted ... within the next year , she will become too malnourished to survive this operation . ”
She moved up the list .
By 2002 , UCI had turned down 38 livers and 57 kidneys offered on her behalf , according to a log from the national organ network that she obtained during her subsequent lawsuit against UCI .
The liver offers stopped coming in February 2002 , after the hospital failed to submit critical information on Irvine ’s condition to the national group overseeing organ transplants , which caused her to drop to the bottom of the list for a transplant .
Doctors “ kept saying , ‘ You ’re on top .
You ’re on top . ’
They led me to believe that there were no offers ....
They left me to die . ”
Advertisement
Irvine did not die , though .
One of her doctors outside UCI encouraged her to transfer to Cedars - Sinai Medical Center , telling her she had a better chance of getting a transplant there .
Indeed , within two months of transferring , she received her transplant , in December 2002 .
Irvine settled her case earlier this year , a decision she regrets because she believes she received bad legal advice .
Her attorney said her settlement was fair .
Federal officials , in their report , faulted UCI ’s handling of her case .
Imagawa acknowledged that the hospital had made some errors but said the organs offered on her behalf were of poor quality and “ not suitable for someone without life - threatening emergency . ”

In a separate case cited by regulators , miscommunication between the liver program and the cardiac unit delayed a patient ’s placement on the transplant waiting list for at least eight months this year .
There was no indication that the patient had ever been told about the reason for the delay , the federal report said .
The people who oversee liver transplantation have long known about what was going on at UCI .
Mone of OneLegacy said Wednesday that his staff noticed that UCI turned down an increasingly large number of organs after Imagawa stopped performing transplants in late 2001 .
Mone said his agency did not have authority to take action against the program and that all he could do was report the numbers to the national overseer of transplantation , the United Network for Organ Sharing .
Advertisement
The network , which controls a massive database of transplant information , renewed its accreditation of UCI ’s liver program in December despite the fact that it failed to meet federal requirements in a number of areas .
UC Irvine failed , for instance , to meet the federal requirement of 12 liver transplants in each of the past three years .
In 2002 - 04 , only eight transplants were performed each year .
The AJAX response : XML , HTML , or JSON ?
Since my last AJAX project I 've increasingly been wondering about the " ideal " output format for the AJAX response .
Once you 've succesfully fired an AJAX request , what sort of response should the server give ?
An XML document ?
An HTML snippet ?
A JSON string which is converted to a JavaScript object ?
Or something else ?
In this entry I 'd like to discuss the three formats , with examples , and ask you which format you 've used in your practical AJAX applications .
( This article has been translated into Spanish . )
When you receive an additional bit of data for your AJAX application , you should start up a script that incorporates this extra data into your single - page HTML interface .
Of course the form of the script heavily depends on the format of the data you 've received .
Should you search an XML document for specific nodes and copy their text to the HTML ?
Or did you receive an HTML snippet that should be added to the page " as is " ?
In my last project I received some data as XML documents and some as HTML snippets , and they needed different kinds of scripts to write the data to the page .
Both formats , and both kinds of scripts , have their advantages and disadvantages .
After I 'd finished the application I delved a bit deeper into JavaScript Object Notation , invented by Douglas Crockford and recently chosen as the default output format for most Yahoo services , and I think I like it , although I 've never yet used it .
I 'm left wondering : which format is the best ?
Which format do you think is best , or at least most useful in a practical AJAX environment ?
Example
As an example of the three formats , let 's take an AJAX - driven online bookstore .
We ask for the JavaScript books they have in store , and by a staggering coincidence they have exactly those three JavaScript books I keep lying around on my desk .
An AJAX request returns these three results , and you have to incorporate them in the HTML of your single - page interface .
I 'll give examples of all the three formats , and a simple script to show the results in a < div id =" writeroot " > .
XML documents
The first and most obvious choice for an output format is the XML document .
The original idea behind the XMLHTTP object was the importing of XML documents , so it 's no surprise that most of the attention went to XML and it 's still considered the default output format .
Example
The server returns this XML document :
< books > < book > < title > JavaScript , the Definitive Guide < / title > < publisher > O' Reilly </ publisher > < author > David Flanagan </ author > < cover src= " /images/cover_defguide.jpg " /> < blurb > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .</ blurb > </book > < book > < title > DOM
Scripting </ title > < publisher > Friends of Ed</ publisher > < author > Jeremy Keith </ author > < cover src= " /images/cover_domscripting.jpg " /> < blurb > Praesent et diam a ligula facilisis venenatis .</ blurb > </ book > < book > < title > DHTML
Utopia : Modern Web Design using JavaScript & DOM </ title > < publisher > Sitepoint </ publisher > < author > Stuart Langridge </ author > < cover src= " /images/cover_utopia.jpg " /> < blurb > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .</ blurb > </ book > </ books >
We need this script to show the results in our < div > .
function setDataXML ( req ) { var books = req.responseXML.getElementsByTagName(' book ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ;i< books.length ;i++ ) { var x = document.createElement ( ' div ' ) ; x.className = ' book ' ; var y = document.createElement ( 'h3 ' ) ; y.appendChild(document.createTextNode( getNodeValue( books [ i ] , ' title ' ) ) ) ; x.appendChild(y ) ; var z = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; z.className = ' moreInfo ' ; z.appendChild(document.createTextNode (' By ' + getNodeValue( books [ i ] , 'author ' ) + ' , ' + getNodeValue( books [ i ] , 'publisher ' ) ) ) ; x.appendChild(z ) ; var a = document.createElement ( 'img ' ) ; a.src = books[i].getElementsByTagName( ' cover ' ) [ 0].getAttribute('src ' ) ; x.appendChild(a ) ; var b = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; b.appendChild(document.createTextNode( getNodeValue( books [ i ] , 'blurb ' ) ) ) ; x.appendChild(b ) ; document.getElementById('writeroot').appendChild(x ) ; } } function getNodeValue ( obj , tag ) { return obj.getElementsByTagName(tag ) [0].firstChild.nodeValue ; }
Rather a lot of code , as you see .
Although the W3C DOM gives us full access to both the XML document from the server and the HTML document the data should be shown in , it does n't give us an elegant , simple way of extracting exactly that data we need : we have to delve into the XML document time and again .
It 's here that XSLT would come in handily , since this language is meant precisely to convert an XML document to another kind of XML , and since XHTML is XML , we can also use it to create Web page snippets .
I have n't studied XSL ( T ) since 1999 , though , and doubtless there are many minor compatibility issues that I 'd have to solve before getting a workable demo .
We 'll leave XSLT for another time .
Advantages
The most important advantage of XML is that it 's the most easily readable format for other humans .
A secondary advantage is that XML has been around for quite a while and that many developers are already accustomed to it .
Saying " I 'd like your server side script to return an XML document " wo n't cause raised eyebrows , while saying " I 'd like the script to return a JSON object " might .
Disadvantages
The JavaScript required to insert the data into the HTML page is quite verbose .
I wrote a little convenience function getNodeValue ( ) to get rid of the most verbose and boring part of the script : reading out the text in an XML tag .
Nonetheless the script wo n't ever win a beauty contest .
HTML snippets
The second , and maybe the most interesting , output format is an HTML snippet .
Note that I call it a snippet , since we do not receive a complete HTML page .
Instead , we get exactly that HTML that has to be inserted into our < div > .
Example
The server returns this HTML snippet :
< div class= " book " >
< h3 > JavaScript , the Definitive Guide </ h3 > < p class= " moreInfo " >
By David Flanagan , O'Reilly </ p> < img src= " /images/cover_defguide.jpg " /> < p > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .
</ p> </div> < div class= " book " >
< h3>DOM Scripting </h3 > < p class= " moreInfo " >
By Jeremy Keith , Friends of Ed</ p> < img src= " /images/cover_domscripting.jpg " /> < p >Praesent et diam a ligula facilisis venenatis .
</ p> </div> < div class= " book " >
< h3>HTML Utopia : Modern Web Design using JavaScript & DOM </h3 > < p class= " moreInfo " >
By Stuart Langridge , Sitepoint </ p> < img src= " /images/cover_utopia.jpg " /> < p > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .
</ p> </div>
The script is extremely simple : just put the responseText in the innerHTML of the correct object and you 're ready .
function setDataHTML ( req ) { document.getElementById(' writeroot') .innerHTML
= req.responseText ; }
Advantages
The script 's simplicity is the most important advantage of this method .
In addition , this format offers interesting accessibility options .
We could cleverly write the server side script to build a complete , accessible HTML page that can be shown to any device .
If the request happens to be made by an AJAX script , the server side script would discard all HTML except for the search results , or the AJAX script itself would search for the results .
It 's of course perfectly possible to create similar accessibility features when you 're working with XML or JSON , but the HTML snippet format is the easiest one for this job .
Disadvantages
If the HTML snippet contains forms , or if the receiving HTML element is a form , this method give horrific errors in Explorer .
In addition , HTML snippets may become quite complicated .
The example above is n't , but as soon as you want to use advanced CSS techniques that require more elements than strictly necessary , the snippet would have to contain extra < span > s or whichever elements you need .
Thus the server side script that generates the HTML may become quite complicated .
JSON
The third method is JSON , JavaScript Object Notation .
Personally I pronounce it as " Jason " , so that yet another ancient Greek hero enters modern JavaScript development .
( And please remember that Ajax 's father Telamon accompanied Jason as an Argonaut .
Jason was older , and on the whole more succesful , than Ajax )
The general idea is to deliver a bit of text ( a string , really ) which can be interpreted as a JavaScript object .
Once it has arrived , you use JavaScript 's eval ( ) method to convert the string into a real JavaScript object , which you then read out .
Example
The server returns this JSON string :
{ " books " : [ { " book " : { " title " : " JavaScript , the Definitive Guide " , " publisher " : " O' Reilly " , " author " : " David Flanagan " , " cover " : " /images/cover_defguide.jpg " , " blurb " : " Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit . " } } , { " book " : { " title " : " DOM Scripting " , " publisher " : " Friends of Ed " , " author " : " Jeremy Keith " , " cover " : " /images/cover_domscripting.jpg " , " blurb " : " Praesent et diam a ligula facilisis venenatis . " } } , { " book " : { " title " : " DHTML Utopia : Modern Web Design using JavaScript & DOM " , " publisher " : " Sitepoint " , " author " : " Stuart Langridge " , " cover " : " /images/cover_utopia.jpg " , " blurb " : " Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit . " } } ]}
The script looks rather a lot like the XML script .
It does the same things , it just reads out the data from another format .
Here , too , XSLT might come in handy .
function setDataJSON ( req ) { var data = eval ( ' (' + req.responseText + ' ) ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ;i< data.books.length ;i++ ) { var x = document.createElement ( ' div ' ) ; x.className = ' book ' ; var y = document.createElement ( 'h3 ' ) ; y.appendChild(document.createTextNode(data.books[i].book.title ) ) ; x.appendChild(y ) ; var z = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; z.className = ' moreInfo ' ; z.appendChild(document.createTextNode(' By ' + data.books[i].book.author + ' , ' + data.books[i].book.publisher ) ) ; x.appendChild(z ) ; var a = document.createElement ( 'img ' ) ; a.src = data.books[i].book.cover ; x.appendChild(a ) ; var b = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; b.appendChild(document.createTextNode(data.books[i].book.blurb ) ) ; x.appendChild(b ) ; document.getElementById('writeroot').appendChild(x ) ; } }
Advantages
The most important advantage is that JSON circumvents JavaScript 's same - source policy , if you import the JSON file as a new < script > tag .
See Simon Willison 's example for the gory details .
JavaScript does not allow you to access documents ( be they XML or HTML ) that come from another server .
However , if you import a JSON file as a script tag you circumvent this problem , and any JSON data can be imported into any website .
It depends on your business goals whether this is a Good or a Bad Thing , but right now it 's the only data format that allows unrestricted access .
A secondary advantage is that scripts for JSON data are slightly simpler and slightly more in line with the rest of the JavaScript language than scripts for XML data .
Disadvantages
The most important disadvantage of JSON is that the format is very hard to read for humans , and that , of course , every single comma , quote , and bracket should be in exactly the correct place .
While this is also true of XML , JSON 's welter of complicated - looking syntax , like the }}]} at the end of the data snippet , may frighten the newbies and make for complicated debugging .
Your choice ?
These are the three output formats you can use for getting AJAX data .
Although I 'd love to be able to say that one of them is " the best " , I think choosing the right format depends on the circumstances , and not on any theoretical musings .
Nonetheless , let 's take a stab at finding " the best " format .
I have four questions for you :
Can you think of another output format ?
Which output format did you use in a practical , commercial AJAX application ?
( Demos and the like do n't count )
Will you switch to another output format in the future ?
If so , which one and why ?
Can you think of other advantages or disadvantages of the three formats ?
My own answers are :
No .
Mainly XML documents , a few HTML snippets .
I 'm going to study JSON carefully and might switch to it for an unrestricted access application I have in mind .
Nonetheless
I feel that XML remains the best overall format for the time being , mainly because people are used to it .
I wrote down all advantages and disadvantages I could think of .

By Paul Rincon
BBC News science reporter , at the Kennedy Space Center
The events were captured in onboard video and the agency says it now needs to consider their significance .
In one case , a heatshield tile seems to have been affected on the underside of the shuttle .
Discovery 's astronauts are to use a 15 m - long robotic arm to inspect the orbiter 's exterior .
The arm is equipped with sensor and camera attachments .
A full sweep of the shuttle 's key surfaces will take several hours .
It appears the tip of the shuttle 's external fuel tank also hit a bird as it launched from Kennedy Space Center on Tuesday .
Spot investigation
John Shannon , STS - 114 mission operations representative , pointed out video frames apparently showing a piece of heatshield tile breaking off from the underside of the shuttle .
SHUTTLE RETURN TO FLIGHT Mission known as STS - 114 Discovery 's 31st flight 17th orbiter flight to ISS Payload : Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module Lift - off : 1039 EDT , 26 July Location : Kennedy Space Center , Launch Pad 39B Discovery crew : Collins , Kelly , Noguchi , Robinson , Thomas , Lawrence and Camarda
Guide to key shuttle changes
" We 're very interested in that , " he told reporters .
" That 's something we 're going to get better pictures of on flight - day three . "
Mr Shannon said it could simply be that part of the black covering on the orbiter 's underside was damaged exposing the heatshield tile .
But he added that it was equally possible the tile itself had been dented or sheared .
The missions operations representative also showed journalists video footage of a dark object falling from the external tank .
Experts cannot yet determine its size , but it did not appear to hit the shuttle , they said .
News outlets had reported details of this piece of debris falling off the tank earlier in the day .
Parts and supplies
Tuesday 's successful launch was Nasa 's second go at a lift - off in the current launch window .
PERFECT FLORIDA DAY
Everything seemed to go right for Nasa and the cheering spectators
In pictures
Nasa says it has learnt the safety lessons of the Columbia disaster , which cost the lives of seven astronauts , and has made this the most scrutinised shuttle flight ever .
Columbia broke up as it attempted to re-enter Earth 's atmosphere .
Nasa has been considering the issue of bird - strike on launch
Nasa had positioned more than 100 cameras , both on the ground and in the air , to capture as much detail as possible on Discovery 's ascent into orbit .
Discovery will take parts and supplies to the ISS and test new safety features such as a repair - kit for heatshield tiles and a 15 m - long robotic arm that will inspect the shuttle for damage in orbit .
Discovery is due to touch down at Kennedy Space Center on 7 August at 0546 EDT ( 0946 GMT ; 1046 BST ) .

Apple 's chief executive Steve Jobs , the man behind the iPod phenomenon , gives an exclusive interview to Bobbie Johnson about his drive to make technology simple
In a parallel world , Steve Jobs could have been a poker player with a reputation as a cool hand .
After three decades at the top table of technology , all the required skills are there : patience , self - belief , bravado - and , most importantly , the ability to ride a streak of luck .
" Some people thought we got really lucky with the iPod , and we did , " says Jobs .
But , he adds , real winners do n't just enjoy the breaks , they exploit them .
It is necessary to stay on top , especially when everybody 's out to get you .
As he puts it : " We have world - class competitors trying to kill us . "
So far , the competition is not doing a great job .
Apple 's hand in the home computer market might be weak , but it holds all the cards in digital music .
Thanks to phenomenal sales of the iPod over the past few years , the company is at an all - time high and its dominance of music downloading is almost total .
More than 6 m iPods were shipped in the past three months , underpinned by a pervasive marketing campaign and growing consumer awareness .
No wonder , then , that Jobs is in confident mood .
Dressed in the regulation outfit of a Californian intellectual - black , black and more black - he is upbeat about the future of Apple , the company he founded almost 30 years ago in his parents ' garage .
He believes that central to the company 's success is Apple 's vision - his vision - of making technology simple .
" There 's a very strong DNA within Apple , and that 's about taking state - of - the - art technology and making it easy for people , " he says .
Jobs 's targets are busy , modern consumers ; " people who do n't want to read manuals , people who live very busy lives " .
Ultimate salesman
There are certainly a large number who buy into that concept .
But while many are drawn in by the slick advertising and fashionable branding , those who stick around are often motivated by the man himself .
On stage , and with an audience to play with , Jobs is the ultimate salesman .
His speeches are famous for generating the " reality distortion field " , a sense of devotion to the cause that most rival technology bosses would kill for .
Some fans will go wild for each new product that Jobs delivers , and his enthusiasm and charisma pour out across the stage .
In person , though , he is quiet , determined and relatively inscrutable .
It is as if the qualities that make him a great showman turn inside out when put under the magnifying glass ; a bluff worthy of any hardened Las Vegas gambler .
Despite his value on stage , Jobs did not make a keynote speech at Apple 's annual Paris expo earlier this week , and for one simple reason : there was nothing new to announce .
The company had unveiled its autumn product , the iPod nano , two weeks before .
The other big news , the iTunes - compatible ROKR phone from Motorola , is being re-aligned as little more than a test run .
Jobs blames speculative media interest for imagining it was anything more than " dipping our toes in the water " .
Apart from nano - which , as a replacement for the best - selling iPod mini , is a major move for the company - Apple 's cupboard is fairly bare .
It is a low point in the product cycle , with much of the behind - the - scenes work focusing on the Intel - based computers due next summer .
But new iPods are on the way , and Jobs promises " a lot of new things in the pipeline " .
This relative downtime is giving Jobs a chance to promote Apple itself , and the company 's wider beliefs .
It is an important time : while the long - standing computer business remains just as important as the newer focus on music - he wonders whether anyone would ask which of his children was more important to him - it is clear that Apple is changing .
Lifestyle brand
At the centre of it all , Apple is now a lifestyle brand , rather than a technology company .
Each iPod comes inscribed with the words " designed in California " , a seemingly throwaway statement that gives a fundamental insight into the company 's outlook .
The message is straightforward : we are innovators , we are cool , we are friendly .
It 's an extended new age mantra that betrays Apple 's west coast roots and has proved crucial to its image - both good and bad - over the years .
Remaining friendly in the eyes of consumers is at the heart of Apple 's motivations .
Green issues , for example , are becoming a real concern .
With so many units being shifted across the world , like many other computer firms , Apple has come under increasing scrutiny about its environmental policies .
Jobs is clear that reducing the footprint of products is important , but it should , he feels , be put into context .
" One automobile is , I 'm sure , greater in impact than 100,000 iPods , " he says .
" The one part of consumer electronics that you have to worry about is the battery .
I 'm glad we got rid of cathode ray tubes , because they were horrible , full of lead .
Flat displays are much better .
The batteries ... you have to watch .
But you can bring your iPod into an Apple store and get it recycled , and we run a battery replacement scheme .
" Even our packaging reflects these concerns .
It is dramatically smaller these days , and we have removed styrofoam and such things . "
The image might be soft , but it is clear that nobody gets to be the chief executive of such a large company without a killer instinct .
Part of the Jobs mystique is that he simply does n't give up .
He bounced back from a boardroom fight that saw him leave the firm in 1985 , returning triumphantly in 1997 .
He also bounced back from a financial and commercial precipice , launching a series of iconic products including the iMac and iPod .
And he even bounced back from death , beating a rare form of pancreatic cancer last year .
Ease of use might be in Apple 's DNA , but there is grit and determination in there as well .
There is a cruelty , too , about the dismissive way in which the company treats its fresh lineup of competitors , or the way Jobs relates to those he disagrees with .
Part of it is executive braggadocio , of course , but there are clearly subjects - and people - he does n't like .
Questions about his feelings on hackers attempting to " improve " Apple 's operating system , for example , are batted away with a wide - eyed stare .
" You 're asking me whether theft is a good idea ? " he responds , incredulously .
" If people want to change our software , then they should come to work at Apple ...
We might choose to give it away , but it should be our choice to make . "
Shrewd politician
It 's clear that ownership is important to Jobs .
He might not own Apple , but as the public face of the company he does lay claim to the firm 's image , and understands the necessity of being seen as " the good guy " .
For instance , when it is suggested that record labels might look to increase their income by bumping up the price of iTunes downloads , he brings in the spectre of illegal downloading .
" Music companies make more money when they sell a song on iTunes than when they sell a CD , " Jobs says .
" If they want to raise prices , it 's because they 're greedy .
If the price goes up , people turn back to piracy - and everybody loses . "
This is how things work : with a swift shuffle , he asserts Apple 's ownership of the music download market , and distances it from the messy decisions .
It is clear , he says , that a price bump will be a terrible move made by a music industry only interested in short - term profits .
It is the kind of subtle statement that suggests Jobs would be a shrewd politician - something that has been suggested , and his links to the Democrat party in the US are good : last year he offered himself as an advisor to the campaign to elect John Kerry as president , while former vice president Al Gore is on Apple 's board .
But even if Apple 's stereotypical users - young , fashionable and metropolitan - are sympathetic to his personal views , he insists that his politics are n't important to the company 's strategy .
" We 're not trying to sell belief - we 're just who we are .
Apple has values we care about ; Apple cares about tolerance .
We are not a political company , but a company with a set of values . "
And over the years , Apple has had the perfect foil for those values , in the guise of the unfriendly giant Microsoft .
It is something that has benefited the Californian firm , even if it would be loathe to admit it .
As the perennial underdog in a round of high - stakes poker , it has learned how to play its cards with enough skill to survive .
Now , entering into new markets , Apple has discovered that it's a much better player than it ever realised .
Not even Jobs would claim that this was winning a 30 - year - long bet .
But it is a gamble which is paying off , for now at least .

A lot of programmers have lost all hope after seeing this website .
After all , most of the code I post here was found out in the wild , on real , live , production systems that some of you actually maintain .
But today I 'd like to offer a glimmer of hope : there are actually people who are out there who are fighting the good fight , doing their best to makes sure that code like today 's never makes it to production .
You should all be thanking Kirk L. for being one of those guys .
He discovered this in a code review of a colleague .
The code also explained why there were hundreds of temp files in the working directory came and a huge leakage of file pointers .
If you 're not well - versed in C++ , suffice it to say that while most people would simply use sprintf , our coder felt it better to format strings by writing temporary files to disk and reading them back ...
void printf_to_string ( int first , char * fomat , ... ) { va_list marker ; va_start ( marker , first ) ; // this is required , or it will not work for some reason *( char * ) * va_arg ( marker , char * ) ; // string to write to // ** MUST BE FIRST AFTER FORMAT IN FUNCTION COMAND LINE ** {} /* make the variable */ char * string_write_to = va_arg ( marker , char * ) ; char temporary_file_name [ 19 ] ; char * temorary_file_name_name ; strcpy ( temporary_file_name , " thefileXXXX " ) ; temorary_file_name_name = _mktemp ( temporary_file_name ) ; {} FILE * FILE1 = fopen ( temporary_file_name , " w " ) ; vfprintf ( FILE1 , fomat , marker ) ; fclose ( FILE1 ) ; {} FILE * FILE11 = fopen ( temporary_file_name , " r " ) ; {} // 2 is to the end ... it took some experamenting // - 1 is so we go back and dont get the blank after it fseek ( FILE11 , - 1 , 2 ) ; {} double bignumberjustincase = ftell ( FILE11 ) ; fclose ( FILE1 ) ; FILE * FILE111 = fopen ( temporary_file_name , " r " ) ; read ( _fileno ( FILE111 ) , string_write_to , ( short ) bignumberjustincase ) ; int stopHere = ( long ) string_write_to + ( int ) 0 ; stopHere = stopHere + ( bignumberjustincase ) ; if ( stopHere != 0 ) { ( ( char* ) stopHere ) [ 0 ] = ' \0 ' ; strcpy ( string_write_to + int( bignumberjustincase ) , " " ) ; va_end ( marker ) ; } }

Emerging WiFi and WLAN Technologies
WiFi and WLAN technologies are evolving to allow for faster transmission speeds and greater bandwidth .
FierceWiFi takes a look at trends in the market in order to understand what services are on the horizon .
Here ’s a quick overview of some exciting new or potential services FierceWiFi covers :
Voice Over WLAN ( VoWLAN or Wireless VoIP )
Everyone understands the benefits of VoIP , but with the growth of WLANs , wireless VoIP via WLANs , called VoWLAN or VoWiFi , now makes a lot of sense .
Combining the network cost savings of WiFi with the voice efficiency of VoIP , companies such as TeleSym offer software enabling PDAs with WiFi cards to make calls over WLANs .
These calls are as clear or clearer than cell phone calls and are a lot less expensive .
Spectralink is another company in the VoWLAN market providing phones operating over wireless LANs .
Spectralink has identified numerous markets such as healthcare , hospitality , homeland security , etc. , which need in - building systems for workers who spend a lot of their time away from their desks .
The VoWLAN systems have proven more efficient and effective than two - way radios or pagers .
Spectralink and Symbol Technology shipped only 30,000 VoWiFi handsets last year , but the market is expected to grow as Cisco releases VoWLAN handsets and prices drop to under $ 400 / handset .
WiMAX
WiMAX is the recently approved IEEE 802.16 wireless metropolitan area network ( MAN ) standard for broadband wireless access .
WiMAX is real wireless fidelity with connectivity up to several miles as opposed to a couple hundred feet for 802.
11a/b/g.
Because WLAN technology is much less expensive than cellular infrastructure equipment , some industry experts claim that WiMAX could become a threat to the cell phone industry , which is investing in 3G to offer advanced mobile data services .
Similar to the WiFi alliance , the WiMAX Forum is a trade group formed to verify and certify products based on the 802.16 standard .
802.11n
Now that the 802.11g standard is approved , the IEEE will look at even faster standards like the proposed 802.11n for release in 2005 or 2006 .
At this point , 802.11g , which runs at rates of up to 54 Mbps , is more than adequate for most WiFi users .
Although most users would not notice a difference between 50 Mbps and 320 Mbps , there will eventually be many applications which would run better at a higher speed .
UWB
Similar to Bluetooth but around 100x faster , Ultra - wideband or UWB is used to transmit data at high speeds over very short distances ; making UWB perfect for the home market .
The main challenge to UWB is that the standard works across a wide range of frequencies as opposed to most other networking and consumer electronic technologies which are assigned a narrow band of spectrum .
The potential interference problems have raised the eyebrows of major media players like AOL Time Warner who feel that UWB interferes with programming distributed through satellites .
The Department of Transportation has also raised concerns about UWB interfering with the GPS systems essential for flying .
Despite these concerns , UWB product development is moving forward in the home networking market due to its fast transmission rates .
Sign up today for the latest news on VoWLAN , WiMAX , 802.11n , and UWB , as well as other emerging WiFi and WLAN technologies .

Mob Software : The Erotic Life of Code
An Essay in First Person by
Richard P. Gabriel & Ron Goldman
Let ’s rock !
I ’ve got good news :
That way of hacking you like is going to come back in style .
Over the years I ’ve despaired that the ways we ’ve created to build software matches less and less well the ways that people work effectively .
More so , I ’ve grown saddened that we ’re not building the range of software that we could be , that the full expanse of what computing could do to enhance human life , to foster our creativity and mental and physical comfort , to liberate us from isolation from knowledge , art , literature , and human contact is left out of our vision .
It seems that high - octane capitalism has acted like an acid or a high heat to curdle and coagulate our ways of building software into islands that limit us .
But like survivors , we ’ve managed to make these islands homes .
We ’ve found the succulent but bitter fruit that can sustain us , the small encrusted or overfurred creatures we can eat to survive , the slow - moving and muddy streams from which we drink against the urge to spit it out .
Being survivors , we can make do with little .
But how little like life is such an existence .
So gloomy .
Bitter and depressing .
Deeply conflicted .
The way out requires just one thing from us a strange , frightful thing something slant .
It is this : Find a way to fight our fear of death .
First , though , the gloom .
Feel it .
Maybe there are n’t too many in this audience old enough to recall the early attempts at putting capsules and rockets into space .
What most people remember are the many successful launches in the 1960s and ’ 70s where astronauts first were launched into space but not into orbit ; then there was a series of orbital flights , then forays near the moon , then a moon landing , and finally the boringly routine trips gathering rocks and dust , playing golf and goofing off .
This is the way to do engineering , many say .
Large teams superbly coordinated producing success after success .
Software should be like this , they say .
But these folks do n’t remember these other scenes :
One rocket lifted up about a dozen feet , fell over , then accelerated horizontally toward a launch building ; another lifted up a few hundred feet and started spinning in a Yeatsian gyre before being blown up remotely ; others simply exploded somewhere in the sky .
Once I viewed an unnarrated series of these explosions , one after another in nothing less than a ballet of destruction and failure .
NASA began operation on the first of October , 1958 .
Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space on the fifth of May , 1961 , launched on the tip of a Redstone rocket .
On the twenty - first of July , 1961 , Gus Grissom became the second American in space , also launched by a Redstone rocket .
And on the twentieth of February , 1962 , John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth , launched by an Atlas rocket .
Up until Alan Shepard ’s launch into space , the Redstone rocket had experienced failures including launchpad and downrange explosions 23 times the last failure was 2 months before Shepard ’s flight .
My favorite failure took place on the twenty - first of November , 1960 , when the Redstone ’s engines shut off 1 second after ignition :
The rocket lifted off a couple of centimeters , and then sat down with no significant damage .
Between Alan Shepard ’s flight and Gus Grissom ’s , there was a Redstone failure .
Atlas rockets experienced 36 failures before John Glenn ’s flight one occurred the day after Glenn went into orbit .
We like to think we can simply imitate a mature engineering practice and get the same results .
As if a Little League baseball team could watch the New York Yankees and say , " hey , let ’s just imitate them we ’ll win all the time ! "
But success requires fundamentals , and we do n’t have them .
The highlights of NASA ’s history represent a false view of even a mature engineering practice .
The early days of major American rocketry were filled with failures , some of them disasters .
To get to the moon , we needed crashes and endless fiddling .
Why do we think that software practice , still in its infancy , can do better ?
Software is full of failure , and will be until we can learn how truly to build it .
Fear of failure is fear of death .
In fear of failure , we seek order .
The Mob Introduced
The Oxford English Dictionary defines " mob " this way , among others :
A multitude or aggregation of persons regarded as not individually important .
 Oxford English Dictionary , Second Edition , definition 4a , part 2
Let me say it plainly :
We know how to produce small portions of software using small development teamsup to 10 or so but we do n’t know how to make software any larger except by accident or by rough trial and error .
Because the software we ’re trying to build is too massive it is simply too difficult to plan it all out , and we have no idea how to coordinate the number of people it takes .
Every piece of software built requires tremendous attention to detail and endless fiddling to get right .
In response to this problem we have clung to fads : structured and object - oriented programming , UML , software patterns , and eXtreme Programming .
We grasp for mathematics or engineering to come to our rescueperhaps even the law :
By requiring licenses for our developers maybe we can force improvement in software making .
It just wo n’t happen it ’s like those rockets :
We simply do not know how to get massive software off the ground without crashing and endless fiddling .
But we do n’t accept that .
The way out of this predicament is this simple :
Set up a fairly clear architectural direction , produce a decent first cut at some of the functionality , let loose the source code , and then turn it over to a mob .
The Commerce of the Creative Spirit
Ever compare poetry to newspaper articles ?
Maybe poetry is n’t for everyone , but everyone can see there is a difference in quality , in beauty , in its appeal to humanity .
One is daily news ; the other is " news that stays news " ( Ezra Pound , " ABC of Reading " ) .
Poetry is constructed , is it not ?
In fact , are n’t all creative acts the result of deliberately envisioned , carefully planned work by single individuals ?
This passage by the poet and playwright Harold Pinter is typical of how poets envision :
The thing germinated and bred itself .
It proceeded according to its own logic .
What did I do ?
I followed the indications .
I kept a sharp eye on the clues I found myself dropping .
The writing arranged itself with no trouble into dramatic terms .
The characters sounded in my earsit was apparent to me what one would say and what would be the other ’s response , at any given point .
It was apparent to me what they would not , ever , say , whatever one might wish ....
When the thing was well cooked I began to form certain conclusions .
The point is , however , that by that time the play was now its own world .
It was determined by its own engendering image .
" The Gift , " page 144
... created by the single individual ?
Writers learn by workshopping .
Every night across the country , writers sit in groups of 3 to 20 , reading and critiquing each other ’s work .
Not only are these professional writers but amateurs who simply want to improve their diaries .
Steven Levy said this in " Hackers " :
Years earlier , Buckminster Fuller had developed the concept of synergy the collective power , more than the sum of the parts , that comes of people and / or phenomena working together in a system and Homebrew [ a Bay Area computer club in the 1970s ] was a textbook example of the concept at work .
One person ’s idea would spark another person into embarking on a large project , and perhaps beginning a company to make a product based on the idea .
Or , if someone came up with a clever hack to produce a random number generator on the Altair , he would give out the code so everyone could do it , and by the next meeting someone else would have devised a game that utilized the routine .
" Hackers , " Steven Levy , page 218
... built as the result of detailed plans ?
Christopher Alexander said this :
Let us start by seeing how the great cathedrals , Chartres and Notre Dame , were made within a pattern language ....
There were hundreds of people , each making his part within the whole , working , often for generations .
At any given moment there was usually one master builder , who directed the overall layout ... but each person in the whole had , in his mind , the same overall language .
Each person executed each detail in the same general way , but with minor differences .
The master builder did not need to force the design of the details down the builders ’ throats , because the builders themselves knew enough of the shared pattern language to make the details correctly , with their own individual flair ....
We imagine , because of the distorted view of architecture we have learnt , that some great architect created these buildings , with a few marks of the pencil , worked out laboriously at the drawing board .
The fact is that Chartres , no less than the simple farmhouse , was built by a group of men , acting within a common pattern language , deeply steeped in it of course .
It was not made by " design " at the drawing board .
" The Timeless Way of Building , " page 216
... but software is different , right ?
Donald Eastlake said this in 1972 about the creation of the Incompatible Timesharing System at MIT :
The ITS system is not the result of a human wave or crash effort .
The system has been incrementally developed almost continuously since its inception .
It is indeed true that large systems are never " finished " ....
In general , the ITS system can be said to have been designer implemented and user designed .
The problem of unrealistic software design is greatly diminished when the designer is the implementor .
The implementors ’ ease in programming and pride in the result is increased when he , in an essential sense , is the designer .
Features are less likely to turn out to be of low utility if users are their designers and they are less likely to be difficult to use if their designers are their users .
 Donald Eastlake , 1972 , quoted in " Hackers , " page 127
The Swarm
In " The Lives of a Cell , " Lewis Thomas wrote about termites building arches :
Termites are even more extraordinary in the way they seem to accumulate intelligence as they gather together .
Two or three termites in a chamber will begin to pick up pellets and move them from place to place , but nothing comes of it ; nothing is built .
As more join in , they seem to reach a critical mass , a quorum , and the thinking begins .
They place pellets atop pellets , then throw up columns and beautiful , curving , symmetrical arches , and the crystalline architecture of vaulted chambers is created .
It is not known how they communicate with each other , how the chains of termites building one column know when to turn toward the crew of the adjacent column , or how , when the time comes , they manage the flawless joining of the arches .
The stimuli that set them off at the outset , building collectively instead of shifting things about , may be pheromones released when they reach committee size .
They react as if alarmed .
They become agitated , excited , and then they begin working like artists .
" The Lives of a Cell , " Lewis Thomas , ( New York : Viking . 99 1974 ) , p. 13 .
One of the remarkable discoveries of recent times is that complex behavior by a group of individuals requires only that each individual follow simple rules , and the collective behavior of the group can display facets and filigrees nowhere apparent in those rules .
Here are three simple rules :
Each individual shall steer toward the average position of its neighbors .
Each individual shall adjust its speed to match its neighbors .
Each individual shall endeavor to not bump into anything .
With a group of individuals each following these rules , we observe the simple but beautiful and graceful flocking patterns of birds and schools of fish .
Simulation is the main tool of complexity investigation .
One of the better known simulations is " Sugarscape , " which became noted over the past 5 years by revealing that complex societal behavior could emerge from a small number of individual behavioral rules alongside simple genetic characteristics .
This is the setup : a simple 2 - dimensional grid , a population of individuals initially spread randomly over the squares .
Each square can be occupied by only one individual .
Some squares contain sugar , which the individual can collect and consume .
In the initial setup , an individual can move and see a certain distance .
Movement costs energy regulated by metabolism .
An individual scans the horizon for sugar and goes to the square with the most of it while avoiding squares with other individuals .
Individuals can hoard sugar .
Each cell in the grid has a sugar capacity , and sugar can " grow back " at some rate after it is harvested .
If we place two large piles of sugar in the grid , the population splits in two and feeds as if each pile were covered by a swarm of ants .
If we introduce seasons during which the density of sugar moves according to time , we ’ll see the population migratesimply as a result of the simple rules and their interaction through individuals with the environment .
Of course , because not all individuals are the same they are created with a distribution of traits such as metabolism rate , visual acuity , and collection capacity some fare less well than others .
Some become fat and live forever ; others starve , having been born in sugarfree badlands .
The next step is to add some simple mechanisms for evolution and social networking : mating and genetic exchange , meme exchange , actor status , affinity for similar agents , repulsion from different ones , and conforming .
Each of these is expressed as simple , local rules .
The general principle for complexity design is this :
Think locally , act locally .
When inheritance is added the ability of a parent to pass on its sugar hoard to offspring visual acuity decreases and the gap between the rich and the poor widens dramatically .
Cultural transmission and diffusion behaviors emerge .
By creating varieties of sugar , economic behavior can be studied .
Fads , norms , and fashions emerge .
Isolated areas become closed societies .
Adding combat - related rules creates wars and power struggles .
Is this eerie ?
Silly ?
Important research ?
Or just so - what ?
Such phenomena point to an interesting locale in complex systems the border between order and chaos .
Chaos is unpredictability : Combinations that might have lasting value or interest do n’t last the energy for change is too high .
Order is total predictability :
The only combinations that exist are the ones that always have the energy for stability is too high .
Stuart Kauffman , formerly of the Santa Fe Institute , wrote :
It is a lovely hypothesis , with considerable supporting data , that genomic systems lie in the ordered regime near the phase transition to chaos .
Were such systems too deeply into the frozen ordered regime , they would be too rigid to coordinate the complex sequences of genetic activities necessary for development .
Were they too far into the gaseous chaotic regime , they would not be orderly enough .
 " At Home in the Universe , " page 26
and
... cell networks achieve both stability and flexibility ... by achieving a kind of poised state balanced on the edge of chaos .
 " At Home in the Universe , " page 86
Between order and chaos , interesting and unexpected combinations come about and last long enough to have repercussions .
Trends can be observed .
Patterns emerge .
The connection to poetry is remarkable :
One way to look at poetry is that release the wild imagination of Whitman and Garcia Lorcais reined in by restraint : requirements of form , grammar , sentence - making , echoes , rhyme , rhythm .
Without release there could be nothing worth reading ; the erotic pleasure of pure meandering would be unapproached .
Without restraint there cannot be sense enough to make the journey worth taking .
Poetry is at the margins of understanding , in the fractures of our reality , in the space between order and chaos .
Listen for a minute to Federico Garcia Lorca at the end of the poem " Scream to Rome , " written in New York around 1930 :
Meanwhile , meanwhile , oh ! , meanwhile ,
the blacks that take out the spittoons ,
the boys that tremble beneath the pale terror of the directors ,
the women drowned in mineral oils ,
the crowd of hammer , violin , or cloud ,
will scream although their brains may blow out on the wall ,
will scream in front of the domes ,
will scream maddened by fire ,
will scream maddened by snow ,
will scream with their heads full of excrement ,
will scream like all the nights together ,
will scream with a voice so torn
that the cities tremble like little girls
and the cities of oil and music break ,
because we want our daily bread ,
flower of the alder and threshed tenderness ,
because we want to be fulfilled the will of the Earth
that gives its fruits for all .
This is a poem of duendeneither angel who dazzles but hovers above nor muse who whispers and dictates .
Duende is a force that dares us when we empty ourselves , approach ourselves to see truly ; taunts us into being serious ; battles order .
All that has black sounds has duende .
Garcia Lorca says :
The duende ... is a power , not a work .
It is a struggle , not a thought .
I have heard an old maestro of the guitar say , " the duende is not in the throat ; the duende climbs up through the soles of the feet . "
Meaning this :
It is not a question of ability , but of true , living style , of blood , of the most ancient culture , of spontaneous creation .
" In Search of Duende , " Garcia Lorca , page 49
Garcia Lorca says the duende
will not approach at all if he does not see the possibility of death
" In Search of Duende , " Garcia Lorca , page 162
and
we only know that he burns the blood like a poultice of broken glass , that he exhausts , that he rejects all the sweet geometry we have learned , that he smashes style .
" In Search of Duende , " Garcia Lorca , page 51
Fear of failure is the fear of death , the fear of duende .
Christopher Alexander said ,
All of the Japanese arts recognize that , finally , you have to meet the fear of death in order to do anything landscape painting , flower arrangements , and so on .
" Christopher Alexander : The Search for a New Paradigm in Architecture , " Stephen Grabow , page 86
Allen Ginsberg said that to be a poet you must abandon fear of failure by
... abandoning the glory of poetry and just settling down in the muck of your own mind ...
" The Gift , " page 145
When you do this when you do battle with the duende you might find a gift , a gift of talent or insight that will make you think , " Did I say that ? "  " Did I do that ? "
Gifts like this are worth cultivating , even in the software world .
Lewis
Hyde wrote this in " The Gift " :
So long as the gift is not withheld , the creative spirit will remain a stranger to the economics of scarcity .
Salmon , forest birds , poetry , symphonies , or Kula shells , the gift is not used up in use .
" The Gift , " page 146
Duende , poetry , and perhaps life itself and life in our works of artifice are denizens of the boundary between order and chaos .
When we look too deeply into chaos for inspiration , we find only nonsense ; when we look too deeply into order for completion and closure , we find only the botfly of boredom and the disease he carries : failure and deathlike morphology .
Such an interesting place is the border between order and chaos that
Dee Hock coined a word for it : chaord .
His work from the mid-1960s has focused on how to replace outworn hierarchical , command - and - control organizations and what to replace them with .
Command - and - control systems are based on the need for control , predictability , and order , things that Stuart Kauffman says have no real place in biologically based systems .
What is needed is the vigor at the border of chaos and order .
Dee Hock reasoned that if organizations based on biological principles were to replace traditional command - and - control systems , then the basis for the self - organization and emergent behavior of a group of people would have to be the same as what forms the similar basis in life : a genetic code .
In the Sugarscape simulation the genetic code is represented by local rules of behavior .
A rule of behavior is like a principle .
If a group shares the same principles ( Dee Hock figured ) then they would be able to work in emerging concert without the need for command and control .
But nothing can be built without a purpose , some idea of what to build .
Dee Hock was trying to construct a system that would accomplish the electronic exchange of value that is , money .
To build this , he needed to build an electronic infrastructure a network and accompanying software and an organizational infrastructure that would carry out the exchange of money the electronic transfers promised .
Because Dee Hock took seriously the motto , " think locally , act locally , " he intuited that the best organizational concept for such an undertaking would move decisions as close as possible to those who feel their effects .
The result was known as Visa International , and it still exists today , though not entirely in the same form .
Dee Hock ’s ideas should sound very familiar .
Building a cathedral is the shared purpose , and the builders from the master builder down to the most insignificant member of the mob engaged in its construction knew the elements :
Nave , aisles , transepts , the great rose window in the west end , and the chapels round the east end .
The builders shared a set of principles the common pattern language .
Alexander said :
But still the power and beauty of the great cathedrals came mainly from the language which the master builder and his builders shared .
The language was so coherent that anyone who understood the language well and devoted his whole life to the building of a single building , working at it slowly , piecemeal , shaping all the parts within the common pattern language , would be able to make a great work of art .
The building grew slowly , magnificently , from the impact of the common pattern language from which it was made , guiding its individual parts , and the acts which created them , just as the genes inside the flower ’s seed guide and then generate the flower .
" The Timeless Way of Building , " page 216
The Changing Face of Software
Founding assumptions can echo for decades .
In software we have suffered especially from such echoes .
From the earliest days of software from the mid-1950s a particular view has prevailed of what software is and why it is created that now or soon will make doing our work intolerable .
Computing practice was first developed as a branch of computability theory based on a particularly inhospitable set of mathematical constructs : group and semi-group decidability , Thué and and other transformational systems , recursive function theory , lambda calculus , and Turing machines , to name some .
In mathematical terms , these constructs are equally expressive , universality being the touchstone of expressiveness .
With this set of blinders firmly in place , there is no difference between any of these models , and the same logic is applied with equal blindness to programming languages .
Early computing practices evolved under the assumption that the only uses for computers were military , scientific , and engineering computation along with a small need for building tools to support such activities .
We can characterize these computational loads as numeric , and the resulting computational requirements as Fortran - like .
Early attempts to expand the realm of computing such as John McCarthy ’s valiant attempt with Lisp and artificial intelligence , Kristen Nygaard ’s similarly pioneering attempt with Simula , Doug Englebart ’s intriguing attempt to expand our usage options , Alan Kay ’s later attempt with Smalltalk , and Alain Colmerauer ’s attempt with Prolog were rebuked .
The very architecture of almost every computer today is designed to optimize the performance of Fortran programs and its operating - system - level sister , C. Further , attempts to consider neuron - based , genetic , or other types of nonstandard computational models were soundly rejected , snubbed , and even ridiculed until the late 1980s .
Programming languages have hardly shown one scintilla of difference from the designs made in the first few years of computing .
All significant programming languages are expressively , conceptually , and aesthetically equivalent to Fortran and assembly language .
In fact , what it means to program is hopelessly outdated .
Early models persist .
In 1960 , one generally coded up a single program , linked its parts together in a monolithic , monochronic puddle of behavior and dataeverything brought together in one place at one time , everything made consistent by tools that ensure such consistency .
Software development methodologies evolved under this regime along with a mythical belief in master planning .
Such beliefs were rooted in an elementary - school - level fiction that great masterpieces were planned , or arose as a by - product of physicists shovelling menial and rote coding tasks to their inferiors in the computing department .
Master planning feeds off the desire for order , a desire born of our fear of failure , our fear of death .
How can we tolerate these indignities ?
The frustratingly simple answer is the universal nature of programming languages the fact that one can program in any one of them what can be programmed in any other .
We are able to clever our way out of any programming box .
The more difficult the task , the more pride we can take in the accomplishment .
We are loathe through either our natures or our upbringing to admit that the programming tasks we are called upon to do are too hard with available tools or that better tools would improve our lives .
We cannot easily see that we are boxed into a corner by the assumptions of our ancestors as correct as those assumptions were or seemed to be at the time .
The reality today of programming ’s needs are so far off from that early view that we really should be belly - laughing .
Until recently , the model of software creation and use held that programmers put together software behind closed doors and people used it only after copies had been distributed on floppy disks and CDs , or by downloading .
This view of software distribution is being overturned by the concept of performing software .
In this notion , software is created whichever way makes sense , but its only executing incarnation is on a single or a few machines connected to the Net , and its users connect to that machine or those machines to use it .
On the horizon is an obvious tipping point beyond which there is just one , immense distributed system made up of a large number of performing programs that interact with each other .
Such future distributed systems will have been built by vastly diverse , dispersed , and different - minded people and massive numbers of them .
Each such system will never go down , cannot be recompiled from scratch , and can never be in total version coherence .
Even in monolithic systems we find the same thing .
For every major operating system , there are people who absolutely demand and rationally require the newest backwardly incompatible features , and others who absolutely and rationally require the oldest features to remain as they are forever .
A simple example can be found in the Java ( tm ) language and Jini( tm ) Technology .
Jini is a simple distributed computing model based on the Java programming language .
Among other things , it was intended as a model for services small bits of functionality to discover each other dynamically and create a network of interoperating program parts .
These services could be housed within devices physically separate computing platforms as far as Jini is concerned .
Because such a model is new , the definition of each service is likely to require a maturation period , in which an initially immature service is defined and released , with perhaps numerous improvements subsequently being released .
Service definitions are specified by Java interfaces : API ’s , in other words .
The natural way for a community of service developers to work is to start with a provisional service definition and move through a series of improvements , culminating , perhaps , in a ratified service definition residing in the net .
jini package .
Jini quite cleverly handles this in some cases because the implementation of the service comes along with the device , but the Java interfaces may not match very well .
Perhaps they will not obey even the Java binary compatibility rules .
There are no mechanisms within Java to handle mismatched interfaces .
There are not even any mechanisms to migrate an interface from one package to another .
This is a problem of interface evolution and simple renaming .
If it ’s true that software systems must be living systems , our views on the static construction of programs need to be updated .
Indeed , there are some programming languages that can handle this form of interface evolution , modeled on similar mechanisms in the database world ( so - called schema evolution mechanisms ) , but these languages are not looked on favorably .
One of the languages that supports schema evolution for classes operates by allowing developers to specify repair code that scampers about when an unrepaired instance is found and repairs it .
Even though the designers of this system did n’t think of it this way , this is a clearly biological approach to the problem : a swarm of small repair agents fixing up code on the fly to make it work when the context of its operation has changed .
Every single programming language we have including Javais predicated on the physicists ’ model of figure it out , code it up , compile it , run it , throw it away .
All our computing education is based on this , all our methodologies , all our languages , environments , tools , attitudes , mathematics , prejudices , and principles are based as solidly and firmly on this rock as Gibraltar is based on the stone it rests on .
Many if not most development headaches come from precisely this model headaches that programming language theorists ridicule .
Every attempt to define a language to handle this or a computing device to make it simpler is met with laughter and rejection .
And all this in the face of the fact that the reality of programming must be based on precisely the opposite assumptions :
Everything changes , every version is necessary , evolution happens .
Resource Limits
The history of computing is rife with resource limitations to the extent that there was an attempt at a theory in the 1970s to explain intelligence and other human - level performances using " resource - limited computation . "
We have labored under three types of resource limitations :
Until the 1990s we did not routinely use computers with much more than a few dozen mips and 48 megabytes of RAM .
We typically run development projects undermanned by a factor of 2 or 3 and schedules about 50 % too short .
We typically underspend per unit time by a factor of 2 or 3 .
Because of this we ’ve managed to build only very small pieces of software , and even those are horribly error - ridden .
Because of the apparent need to constantly innovateor obsolete hardware and to renew ourselves creatively , and because development has been done primarily in a landscape riddled by many isolated islands of similar or identical activities , we have , over the last 40 50 years , written the same code over and over .
How many versions of Unix do we need ?
Do we really need the few dozen that we have ?
How about a text editor more advanced than Emacs ?
Are Word , Excel , and Powerpoint really the best possible programs in those categories ?
We ’ve built these programs many times , and we do n’t get particularly better at them .
We have gotten OK at building cathedralsonly we are building the same dozen or so over and over again .
Our patterns are too limited and focused on efficiency , our vision outworn ; sources of new language have dried up , and it ’s as if we are caught in a delirium of mere rephrasings .
However , the commercial software community has developed one particular response to resource limitation : a fevered , workaholic approach to software development error prone , hectic , family - destroying , health - degrading , night - haunting .
If you are undermanned by a factor of 2 , add a second 8 - hour workday per physical day .
If you are operating under a schedule 50 % too short , add in another 32 hours per week by working weekends .
Then pray for luck or push back on features and quality .
Scarcity breeds a commodity or exchange economy .
Until almost 1980 , there were essentially no markets for software .
Before 1980 , most computers were owned by companies and used for " large tasks . "
When computers were commoditized , the resource limitations inherent in software development became an opportunity for exploitation , and any relief to those limitations meant less wealth to go around .
Draw your own conclusions .
Order and Modular Parts
Programming language designers made one important breakthrough in being able to program effectively given insane resource limitations : the modular partcall it subroutine , procedure , function , method , or class .
The idea has two parts :
Create a piece of code that performs some computation .
Create a way to run the code in several contexts .
The first of these is the code that will be used over and over .
Typically , what this code does depends on the local context .
The second of these serves two purposes :
One is to provide a way to inform the modular part about the local context ; and the other is to provide a sort of description of the modular part this is conveyed primarily by the modular part ’s name , but its arguments can sometimes provide additional descriptions , particularly for methods .
Modular parts seem like the ideal of order : Construction is uniform , expectations are identical , fear is quashed , calm reigns because things rarely change in a fixed landscape .
As I implied before :
Why are we continually writing the same software over and over ?
The Ariane 5 disaster says a lot about software development recall , it was the European Space Agency rocket that self - destructed after its engine nozzles all swiveled into an extreme position , causing the rocket to veer abruptly , rupturing the links between the booster and the core stage , which caused the rocket to self - destruct .
The failure has been analyzed thoroughly by both the ESA and software professionals , with most of the discussion focusing on uncaught exceptions , best - effort results , and the foolishness of simply shutting down a system as a reasonable approach to failure .
But the failure was caused by software adopted without adaptation from the Ariane 4 .
The decision was made to reuse the code by Ariane 5 software developers and designers who had too much confidence in code that had proved successful many times in the past .
I quote from the report concerning a special feature which continued to run a calibration routine 50 seconds into the flight :
The same requirement does not apply to Ariane 5 , which has a different preparation sequence , and it was maintained for commonality reasons , presumably based on the view that , unless proven necessary , it was not wise to make changes in software which worked well on Ariane 4 .
 Paris , 19 July 1996 " ARIANE 5 : Flight 501 Failure Report by the Inquiry Board , " The Chairman of the Board : Prof. J. L. LIONS
The failure , therefore , had something to do with the use of modular parts : failing to look specifically at the requirements for the new system and assuming that a similar module for a different system which was well - tested under real conditions should be trusted unless proven otherwise .
If we look at ourselves literally as systems we notice soon enough that although we are each made of very similar parts , we are not made of modular parts .
Arms look like modular parts , but they are n’t .
Each is custom grown for the person who hosts it .
Within each person ’s genetic code is the knowledge of how to grow an arm in place , custom fit to the body being created concurrently .
Moreover , we already seem to know this in some aspects of mainstream programming .
A database may seem like a modular part , but it is n’t .
A database is created by taking off - the - shelf genetic coding in the form of a database system .
Then we reckon up schemata defining how the data will be laid out , and we add data to made a database .
Let ’s listen to Christopher Alexander on the topic of modular parts :
The details of a building cannot be made alive when they are made from modular parts ....
And for the same reason , the details of a building cannot be made alive when they are drawn at a drawing board .
" The Timeless Way of Building , " pp. 460461
Modular parts :
Maybe they are n’t so wonderful .
The real problem with modular parts is that we took a good ideamodularity and mixed it up with reuse .
Modularity is about separation :
When we worry about a small set of related things , we locate them in the same place .
This is how thousands of programmers can work on the same source code and make progress .
We get in trouble when we try to use that small set of related things in lots of places without preparing or repairing them .
Who Can Be Programmers ?
Computing practice and theory is based on the very hidden and hard - to - reveal assumption that engineers , mathematicians , and computer scientists are the only ones who will write a program or contribute to a software system .
When the computing age began , no one but scientists and the military even remotely conceived of the utility of programs and programming .
Today , almost every business and human pursuit is built on computing and digital technology .
Artists , craftspeople , writers , fishermen , farmers , tightrope walkers , bankers , children , carpenters , singers , dentists , and animals depend on computing , and most of the people I mentioned want to have a say in how such software works , looks , and behaves .
Many of them would program if it were possible .
The current situation might feel fine to some of you , but suppose all computing were based on the needs of tightrope walkers ?
Hard to imagine ?
What we ’ve created was hard for them to imagine .
Literature of Code and Teaching
Fast - lane capitalism has created a nightmare scenario in which it is literally impossible to teach and develop extraordinary software designers , architects , and builders .
The effect of ownership imperatives has caused there to be no body of software as literature .
It is as if all writers had their own private companies and only people in the Melville company could read " Moby - Dick " and only those in Hemingway ’s could read " The Sun Also Rises . "
Can you imagine developing a rich literature under these circumstances ?
Under such conditions , there could be neither a curriculum in literature nor a way of teaching writing .
And we expect people to learn to program in this exact context ?
When software became merchandise , the opportunity vanished of teaching software development as a craft and as artistry .
The literature became frozen .
It ’s extremely rare today to stumble across someone who is familiar with the same source code as you are .
If all remnants of literature disappeared , you ’d expect that eventually all respect for it as an art form , as a craft , as an activity worthy of human attention would disappear .
And so we ’ve seen with software :
The focus is on architecture , specifications , design documents , and graphical design languages .
Code as code is looked down on :
The lowest rank in the software development chain is " coder " right alongside QA drone and doc writer .
We find little or no code education .
Typically a student will write a few dozen small programs over the course of an undergraduate education , and perhaps he or she will work on a larger programsuch as a compiler with a small group of students .
At that point , the student is ready to become a professional programmer .
Little or no mentoring is done after that , and if the student becomes a proficient programmer , it is due to luck and hard work , in that order .
Birth of Mob Software
A few years ago , the open source community posed a significant question a question which has been drowned out in debates over licensing and the politics of open source .
The question was :
What if what once was scarce is now abundant ?
Hidden in the premises of open source is the belief that perhaps it ’s acceptable to waste programmer time .
Moreover , there are no time limits to open - source projects .
With lots of people looking at the source code , it ’s easy to see how the quality of the resulting code could be a little higher .
And with hackers always desperate to prove themselves wizards , it ’s easy to see how " customer support " could be a little better .
Because the open source proposition asked the crucial first question , I include it in what I am calling " mob software , " but mob software goes way beyond what open source is up to today .
What I ’m talking about is the kind of swarming activity we see exhibited by social insects , a kind of semi-chaotic self - organizing behavior in which numerous small acts of repair with a common goal in mind can lead to quickly built , complex , and massive creations .
Mob software is different it explores the space of possibilities .
It includes users during design .
It is highly incremental , focusing on repair rather than master planning .
Mob software takes coding out of the closet and makes code literature .
It is based on gifts .
Mob artifacts include massive software , built by the multitudes .
It never goes down , it is never totally stable but is stable in the aggregate .
It is flexible in the extreme .
Anyone can add to it .
Mob - software artifacts adapt , evolve almost .
It is living while all the software we have now almost all of it is dead - dead - dead .
Mob software is the technical software community finally coming to grips with the duende .
Open source is only some of these things , but it provides our first view into mob software , so let ’s talk about open source for a moment .
By now we know about quite a few mostly successful open - sourceor baby mob software projects : Linux which has won a number of awards for customer support and artistry Mozilla , Jikes , Emacs , GCC , Apache , Perl , Python , sendmail , and BSD .
The Early History of Open Source
Sadly ?
Happily ?
Oddly ?
well , open source and the mob approach is just not a new idea .
A great deal of software development before the 1980s took place in conditions similar to those propounded by the open source folks .
If your organization owned a computer , you had a copy of the source code for many of its systems .
Back in the 1960s and ’ 70s , PhD dissertations in computer science and especially in artificial intelligence contained the source code for the program described in the dissertation .
In 1962 , the Lisp 1.5 Programmer ’s Manual contained the mysterious , almost gnostic , Lisp code that implemented Lisp .
Though mostly obvious to mathematicians , this Lisp in Lisp took several decades for computer practitioners to get their heads around .
Throughout the 1960s and ’ 70s , and even into the 1980s , it was relatively common to exchange source code .
The nascent Internet called at the time , the Arpanet was created in order to make computing facilities available to researchers around the world , and to exchange files including source code .
One of the first net - based " open source " projects was Maclispa PDP - 10  based simple Lisp that became one of the dominant Lisp dialects in the 1970s .
Originally developed at MIT under ITS , it was ported to several other popular PDP - 10 operating systems by a group of about 10 volunteers who donated their time and worked on the code partly at their own locations and partly over the Arpanet .
Developers who earned the respect of the principal maintainers of Maclisp at MIT were given the authority to edit the sources on MIT ’s computers and to build Maclisp there .
Similar activities took place : Languages , environments , planning systems , natural - language understanding systems , game - playing programs , games , text editors , compilers , graphics programs , window systems , typesetting systems just about anything you can think of was written this way , though on a smaller scale because there were hundreds of computers on the Arpanet , not the nearly 100 million we have on the Internet today .
In the 1980s , it became apparent there was money to be made by writing and selling software , and that a premium might be had for being clever about it .
Although software patents were first tried about 10 years earlier , they became increasingly popular during the 1980s until the 1990s , when the intellectual property grab came to resemble the Oklahoma land rush .
At that point , except for academic projects and the activities of the Free Software Foundation under the eclectic oversight of Richard Stallman , software source code essentially disappeared .
The Dictionary
Mob development the creation of software by a loosely coupled group of volunteers seems a thoroughly contemporary phenomenon , based on the free outlook of the 1960s , a kind of fallout of free love and hippiedom I mean , just look at the proponents of this approach : anti-establishment Marxists who believe in free software , who call themselves " hackers " ; people with scruffy hair , who do n’t exactly work for a living , people who attend Star Trek conventions and think science fiction is both high literature and true science .
However , the idea is a bit older .
On Guy Fawkes Day , 1857 , Richard Chenevix Trench , addressing the Philological Society , proposed to produce a new , complete English dictionary based on finding the earliest occurrences of each of the English words ever in printed use .
That is , the dictionary would be constructed by reading every book ever written and noting down exactly where in each book a significant use of every word occurred ; these citations would be used to write definitions and short histories of the words ’ uses .
In order to do this , Trench proposed enlisting the volunteer assistance of individuals throughout English - speaking countries by advertising for their assistance .
Over a period of 70 years , many hundreds of people sent in over 6 million slips with words and their interesting occurrences in thousands of books .
This resulted in the Oxford English Dictionary , the ultimate authority on English , with 300,000 words , about 2.5 million citations , 8.3 citations per entry , and in 20 volumes .
Compare this with the best effort by an individual Samuel Johnson who , over a 9 - year period , using the same methodology and a handful of assistants called amanuenses , produced a 2 - volume dictionary with about 40,000 words and in most cases 1 citation per entry .
As we look at these two works , Johnson ’s dictionary is a monument to individual effort and a work of art , revealing as much about Johnson as about the language he perceived around him , while the OED is the standard benchmark for dictionaries , the final arbiter of meaning and etymology .
Why Mob Software Works
Mob software works by involving a multitude of developers who are passionate about the software being constructed because it is important for them .
Mob software projects do not generally have deadlines , but efficiency is gained by more eyes , hands , and minds being applied to the work in general , fewer major releases are required to get to the same level of functionality and quality .
To get an idea , whereas a large software project by conventional standards might have 250500 developers , a mob software project can have thousands or tens of thousands of developers who are not only actively working on the software but using it every day under a variety of conditions .
Moreover , these developers span a range of talents almost no employer could afford to hire .
Further , these developers typically include some individuals who have remarkable abilities along with astounding disabilities they might not even be employable .
Among the main volunteers to the OED project was Dr. William C. Minor , a brilliant etymological worker who , during his entire 30 or so year involvement with the OED , happened to be locked up in an asylum for the criminally insane , where he suffered hallucinations that kept him awake all night most nights and where he eventually mutilated himself in the most horrific manner .
Once incarcerated , he was never entirely outside immediate and confining care .
Yet he was acknowledged as one of the most important contributors to the project .
Monolithic Development
Some might think that my claim that we do n’t know how to do massive software is exaggerated , that we do know and it ’s called SEI Level 5 , the highest maturity rating .
And the story that explains how things should work is not the one about the OED but the one about space shuttle software .
Lockheed Martin Corporation employs a Level 5 software group that puts together the shuttle software .
This software seems large , and it is written by a deliberate process .
Let ’s look at this .
The software is not very bigonly 420,000 lines of code .
This is not massive software it ’s off by a factor of 10 or 100 .
The software is monolithic , an unrealistic model for future systems .
The software was developed over a 20 - year period by a group of 260 people .
These numbers imply that each line of code has had 25 person - hours of attention , and that each person has been responsible for a little over 1600 lines of code  25 pages .
$ 700,000,000 was spent to develop this code , or about $ 1700 per line .
Further , the software had been completely specified in pseudo - code agreed to beforehand .
The task of a programmer in this regime is to translate pseudocode to actual code .
But , all this work does buy NASA only 1 error in each of the last three releases of the code .
Because we cannot afford to have deaths in the space program , the cost and effort are worth it .
The cost amounts to making each subroutine a career - long research project .
Twenty years , 8 hours a day , studying and eliminating errors from 1600 lines of code .
The mob -software theory is that this project needed 26,000 programmers , not 260 .
The job could have taken less than a year , probably with better quality , and a lot cheaper .
Better quality because the range of talent that could have been brought to bear would have been tremendously greater , and cheaper because most of the work would have been a gift .
( Motivating volunteers who cannot be users takes a culture of gift - giving we do n’t have yet . )
We cannot afford to inch our way up the learning curve , 1600 lines at a time .
We need to get things done fast while doing some learning along the way .
Gift and Commodity Economies
To understand what the open source and mob software movements are trying to do , it helps to make a distinction between a commodity economy , to which we are accustomed in a capitalist society , and a gift economy .
In a gift economy , gifts are exchanged , forming a bond based on mutual obligation :
In the simplest form of gift exchange , when one person gives a gift to another , the receiver becomes obligated to the giver , but not in a purely mercenary way rather , the recipient becomes very much like a member of the giver ’s family where mutual obligations are many , varied , and long lasting .
More sophisticated forms involve more than two parties in fact the cosmos may become involved .
A person may give a gift with the realistic expectation that someday a gift of equal or greater use value will be received , or that the recipient will pass on a further gift .
Sacrifices and many religious ceremonies are gift - economy based .
In an open - source project , the gift of source code is reciprocated by suggestions , bug reports , debugging , hard work , praise , and more source code .
Gift economies are embedded within non-economic institutions like kinship , marriage , hospitality , artistic patronage , and ritual friendship .
The bond is so like flesh and blood that the Greek gift economy persisted alongside a vigorously growing commodity economy for several centuries .
A gift has both economic and spiritual content .
It is personal .
In giving a gift the goal is to become as empty as possible .
In " Gift and Commodity in Archaic Greece , " Ian Morris wrote the following :
The aim of the gift economy is accumulation for de-accumulation ; the gift economy is above all a debt economy , where the actors strive to maximize outgoings .
The system can be described as one of " alternating disequilibrium " where the aim is to never have debts " paid off " but to preserve a situation of personal indebtedness .
 " Gift and Commodity in Archaic Greece , " Ian Morris
In a typical gift exchange situation , a patron would provide food and shelter to a poet in exchange for poems about the patron .
If you look at this exchange closely in the terms in which it was made , you can see it as a trade of life sustenance for memory after death .
Moreover , each would enjoy the company of the other at the dinner table , and in many cases the wit and eloquence of the poet would be a further gift to the patron and by the patron to his guests .
Notice that in this hypothetical exchange , the gifts are tangible and their value resides in how they can be used :
Food is used for sustenance and a poem is used to memorialize the patron in speech before death and in script after .
The gifts are thus inalienable their value cannot be separated from their identity .
In a commodity economy , the value of an item is abstracted into some other sort of object whose intrinsic value is unrelated to its " purchasing power . "
For gold coins this characterization makes less sense than it does for paper money , which is the ultimate abstraction : Paper money is completely real and yet unrelated to what it abstracts so much so that it is possible through the medium of paper money to make a completely fair trade between otherwise incommensurate things , such as 500 cotton candy cones for one handgun through the alienable intermediary of $ 500 .
In a commodity economy , money is an alienable object exchanged by independent transactors .
In such an economy there is no need for the poet to sit at the patron ’s dinner table , and in fact , the poet may have many anonymous and alien patrons who find the work fulfilling or not .
More than that , the poems the patron receives provide nothing personal to the patron at all , and the term " patron " inherently makes no sense whatsoever in this casealien patrons are merely donors .
Most importantly , the commodity economy let ’s call it capitalism depends on scarcity .
Its most famous law is that of " diminishing returns , " whose working requires a fixed supply .
Scarcity of material or scarcity of competitors makes high profit margins .
It works through competition .
The gift economy is an economy of abundance the gifts exchanged are inexhaustible , consisting of ritualized friendship and hospitality .
The gift and commodity economies have co-existed for millennia , generally with the most intimate relationships governed by gift , not money .
Tribes based purely on gift economies will barter and exchange money for goods with outsiders .
A healthy Western family operates on a gift economy .
For mob software to succeed in communities that include corporations , the source - code gift - based economy needs to thrive alongside the commodity economy hovering on its boundaries .
The following quote illustrates the difficulty of co-existence as observed in 6th century BC Greece .
In it , the Greek word xenia means " a bond of solidarity manifesting itself in an exchange of goods and services between individuals originating from separate social units . "
( Gabriel Herman , quoted in " Economy of the Unlost , " page 13 ) :
For whereas money is concerned to change the status quo , gifts aim to sustain it .
The profound conservatism of a gift economy secures its own continuance and moral prestige in two ways :
First , by derogation of all that is not gift .
We can see a deep distrust of money , trade , profit , commerce , and commercial persons pervading Greek socioeconomic attitudes from Homer ’s time through Aristotle ’s .
" Commodity exchange was not an acceptable activity for a Greek . "
[ " Gift and Commodity in Archaic Greece , " Ian Morris ] ...
At the same time , a gift economy likes to project its functions onto the cosmos ... as if the rules of xenia represent the way things are for gods and men .
" Economy of the Unlost , " Anne Carson
In the gift economy , the most empty individual is the wealthiest , being the most likely to receive gifts , while in the commodity economy , the richest individual is the wealthiest , being the most likely to receive further riches .
Trying to reconcile these two economies today will be tough because the gift economy must encroach on the commodity economy , not the other way around as it has always been .
Listen to Lewis Hyde :
... the exploitation of the arts which we find in the twentieth century is without precedent .
The particular manner in which radio , television , the movies , and the recording industry have commercialized song and drama is wholly new ....
The more we allow such commodity art to define and control our gifts , the less gifted we will become , as individuals and as a society .
The true commerce of art is a gift exchange , and where that commerce can proceed on its own terms we shall be heirs to the fruits of gift exchange : ... to a creative spirit whose fertility is not exhausted in use , to the sense of plenitude which is that mark of all erotic exchange , to a storehouse of works that can serve as agents of transformation , and to a sense of an inhabitable world an awareness ... of our solidarity with whatever we take to be the source of our gifts , be it the community ... , nature , or the gods .
But none of these fruits will come to us where we have converted our arts to pure commercial enterprises .
" The Gift , " pp 158159
Xenia involves emptying one ’s self , and along with this emptiness comes the duende and with it risk - taking , creation , diversity .
The Chilean poet , Pablo Neruda , connected xenia and the duende in this story from his childhood in the southern frontier of Chile :
I looked through the hole [ in the fence ] and saw a landscape like that behind our house , uncared for and wild .
I moved back a few steps because I sensed vaguely that something was about to happen .
All of a sudden a hand appeared a tiny hand of a boy about my own age .
By the time I came close again , the hand was gone , and in its place there was a marvellous white toy sheep ....
I went into the house and brought out a treasure of my own : a pine cone , opened , full of odor and resin , which I adored .
I set it down in the same spot and went off with the sheep ....
Maybe this small and mysterious exchange of gifts remained inside me also , deep and indestructible , giving my poetry light .
" The Gift , " pages 281282
Hooray for Literary Theory
The postmodern life is one of stories and personae .
Literary theory the study of how literature and art , in some cases , works forms one set of techniques for understanding the parts of our lives in common with technology .
One favorite concept is topos .
" Topos " is a term used in poetics and can be defined this way :
a conventionalized expression or passage in text which comes to be used as a resource for the composition of additional texts
 The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics
" Topos " literally means a place or location in Greek , and a topos is a place from which similar stories can be woven .
An example from literature is the Garden of Eden .
Anyone in a Western Judeo - Christian culture asked to tell a story about the Garden of Eden would likely come up with a story that was consistent with the " vision " of creation the Garden of Eden presents .
Topoi we ’re already familiar with include the shared purposes needed to build a cathedral or one of Dee Hock ’s chaords .
The Mob Effect Can Take Over , and Unexpected Plenitudes Ripen
The open - source community asked one question and answered it in a provocative way .
They asked : " What if what once was scarce is now abundant ? "
With their licenses they have found a gate through which some of us have passed .
Christopher Alexander said one very important thing that is relevant to us today :
And yet the timeless way is not complete , and will not fully generate the quality without a name , until we leave the gate behind .
" The Timeless Way of Building , " page 529
It is only when we forget the ideas behind building something wonderful that we can actually do the building that makes things wonderful .
Time and again I ’ve heard poets and musicians talk about the letting go required to make true art or music .
The battle to let go is the battle with the duende .
It leads us to the place where order meets chaos , where the phase transition between stability and flexibility makes things happen .
Unfortunately , the open - source community is extremely conservative , focusing solely on the need to build up slowly a parallel open infrastructure next to the proprietary ones already in place .
They are working on an operating system ; development tools like compilers , development environments , version control systems , and bug tracking systems ; web servers ; e-mail and other communications tools ; a desktop ; productivity tools ; web browsers ; and a small host of suchlike .
The image I have is of hackers encamped just outside a stone gate , carefully but joyfully building , well , cathedrals , just like those within the town .
From a long distance , they appear huddled by the gate as if frightened by what may lie beyond in the unknown .
It is a slightly bitter image .
Their philosophy is to build up a single reliable layer .
Although the classic open - source licenses permit forking , it rarely happens because a fork is a failure there is a right place to go and a right thing to build .
The design center is whatever the hacker community likes , because the motivation is to create a world of open source that companies can never take away from them .
It ’s a matter of liberation , and that ’s why it can be hard for companies to launch successful open - source projects .
One difference between open source and mob software is that open source topoi are technological while mob software topoi are people centered .
The Jini topos speaks of a world of " simply connect " and " spontaneous networks " accompanied by a set of home , office , and automobile scenarios derived from this topos .
The concepts of " simply connect " and " spontaneous networks " address how people relate to the technology .
The Jini topos was highly effective and created a thriving community and associated technology as hoped along with thriving E - Speak , UPnP , and SOAP communities and associated technologies .
Jini was one of the first explicitly mob-software projects .
The Apache topos speaks of web servers and technology for making them effective .
Consequently , while Jini projects tend to fan out creating new services for people to use , Apache projects tend to focus on adding web server functionality and adopting related technologies such as Java Server Pages , servlets , and XML .
Open - source projects tend to be convergent : Each project is aimed at a particular artifact in the end .
Mob - software projects tend to be different :
The goal is to build variety and diversity so that competitive forces and natural selection in the user realm can take over .
Both open - source and proprietary software projects are internally highly ordered :
In both cases there are only a few developers in core teams ; in open source , there is a halo of occasional or opportunistic developers who chip in work , fix bugs , and make small changes .
Proprietary projects are tightly managed by command - and - control systems ; open - source projects have small core teams led by module owners who are strict gatekeepers .
Both open - source and proprietary commercial software projects populate the world in an orderly fashion .
Proprietary software projects rationally pick and choose what products to make based on business goals , and hope scarcity does n’t kill them before they finish .
Open - source projects pick and choose what to build based on technological needs and desires , and fear scarcity of interested people .
Rarely in either regime is the flash of duende followed by natural selection as strong as we ’d hope for as strong as in a living system .
Mob software is about the boundary between order and chaos where life emerges and thrives .
What is it like , the landscape of mob software ?
Picture this :
All devices that include computing elements are connected , and their collective software forms one large system .
Pieces and chunks of this system sometimes go down or disconnectlater they might rejoin .
The collective software works together even though its parts exist in multiple versions of different ages .
Taken in the large , the software is continuously being upgraded and downgraded .
Some parts of the software are performance only ; other parts are private copies .
Almost all the source code for this massive systemestimated in the billions of lines of code is available under a license that grants total recombination rights :
Any fragment of source code can be used for any purpose .
Companies dip into this pool to collect pieces and parts to build custom software for their own use .
Doing this reduces their development costs to a fraction of what they once were .
Following the precepts of xenia , these companies , for the most part , return their custom code to the pool .
Other companies dip into this pool to create niche software ; they augment their businesses by supporting this software and helping their clients .
The foibles of modular parts are minimized because each potential part is scrutinized and accumulates usages and annotations about its applicability and limitations .
The part becomes productized , more like a library than a one of a kind ; its size and scope is adjusted in short , it evolves from many uses and public scrutiny .
Unlike a stray bit of code which needs to be inspected and understood before it is reused , its constant and varied use provides confidence .
Customization is easy .
Ordinary people trade and share customizations as easily as they trade and share recipes and thank - you - note templates .
Customizations are largely data and schemata which are used to generate customized programs just as databases today are so generated .
Many companies do customizations for various segments of the population who pay modest amounts for it .
Special interest groups perform customizations for their members specialized versions of software are created for the disabled , the exceptional , different vocations , and for different work and play situations .
These customizations are not merely cosmetic , but go deep into the software .
The variation in user interfaces for the same application is wider than the difference between punched cards and virtual reality .
The end - user has been brought into the design process , creating a whole new range and variety of business opportunities .
No more are interfaces designed for the hypothetical " average " person .
Each person can have his or her own interface without imposing on an overworked development team .
Programming is mostly a process of adaptation partially automated by swarms of small bots that perform tasks such as interface evolution .
All software development takes place on the common corpus of source code by a mob of volunteers and developers paid by companies who reap benefits from the source base .
Developers work primarily on projects of particular interest to them .
Allowing people to choose their domains of expertise encourages artistry and craftsmanship .
Mentoring circles and other forms of workshop are the mainstay of software development education .
There are hundreds of millions of programmers .
The literature of code and its study spawns a passion for beauty and diversity in software which combined with a deep interest in user experience sponsors a creativity heretofore rarely observed in software development .
Risk - taking and a willingness to open one ’s eyes to new possibilities and a rejection of worse - is - better make an environment where excellence is possible .
Xenia invites the duende , which is battled daily because there is the possibility of failure in an aesthetic rather than merely a technical sense .
These developments arise from the organization of the community built around source code .
This community has no fixed organization , nor is there a standard or typical way to work within it .
Projects spring up , fork , spawn other projects , mutate , continue on , shut down ; experimentation is encouraged ; rarely are standards set , but when they are , the process is adapted to the situation while respecting the basic rights of community members .
Like Dee Hock ’s chaords or the Jini Community , new parts of the organization are designed by its participants as needed , the design being informed by principles and pattern languages .
Rights , principles , and ethics for both individuals and corporations are encoded in these community principles and pattern languages .
The community has a culture similar to the current open - source culture , but it is much more accepting of users , especially novice usersit’s as if the spirit of xenia has raised to the highest status everyone with a stake in the community .
Users participate in design at all levels of scale , and projects are begun specifically to address the needs or wants of a particular user community .
Moreover , experimentation and risk - taking emerge from the individual small acts of the community acting as a group mind .
Because a basic infrastructure has already been laid down , the freedom to pursue new ideas has become possible .
Resource scarceness created by artificial boundaries no longer exists , and in an era of abundance , excess thrives .
Users and others create a new project by creating a topos for it this is very hard work .
By expressing a shared purpose , the topos , when honed and turned , becomes the attractor for developers to join in building its vision , in making it real .
The topos as a story - making story attracts and provides room for experimentation and variation beyond what the initiators envisioned .
Forces That Get Us There
This sounds fantastic I mean , it sounds like a fantasy .
But a fantasy like this happened within the last 10 years , and another is under way .
The World Wide Web was first envisioned as a way to publish and cross-reference scientific papers .
It was based on some of the least attractive technology ever to come down the road .
If , somehow , it were possible to limit our view to web pages created by technologists and technology lovers computer company sites , open - source sites , online computer ’ zines we would observe mediocrity , homogeneity , and bland .
Let ’s face facts :
As artists , we ’re good programmers .
But the technology was accessible to real people , and the Web grew almost boundlessly .
Many sites are unbelievable : sites by artists , writers , galleries , glass blowers , urban diarists , monasteries , punks , the Vatican , architects , people with weird pets , pornographers , gnostics , stores , and children .
We have cameras : Iguana Cam , Madagascar Hissing Cockroach Cam , Naked Molerat Cam , Corn Cam , and a range of cams best left imagined .
The lesson is simple :
When opened up to real people , technology can blossom .
The world envisioned by technologists is limited and flat , like the world of dog breeds when compared to the real diversity of species the world affords .
Under way is open source , demonstrating it is possible to do high - quality and effective , yet wildly distributed development with small snips of self - organization and freely available source code .
As companies join open - source projects over the next few years , communities increasingly will be built that include end - users of all stripes , and as desktop open - source systems are built , there will be increasing pressure brought to bear by the end - users for better usability , realistic customizability , and participation rights .
Performing software will put pressure on software development philosophy , and practitioners of performing software will more quickly see that we need to consider version maintenance and schema evolution applied to software modules .
As the code literature grows , we can start a literary discipline based on it and begin teaching code artistry once again a literature of source code , user interfaces , and execution performance .
When we do this we ’ll find that the durability , utility , and beauty of our software begins to take off until it is n’t silly to consider it a literature .
Economic sea changes do n’t come that often and we ’re in the middle of one right now .
Art , publishing , and music businesses are all changing , as are our ideas on copyright and intellectual property .
The economic exploitation of artists and writers is relatively new , and perhaps it wo n’t survive the drift back to the gift economy we ’re witnessing .
The names are silly , but for every Metallica against online sharing there ’s a Limp Bizkit in favor .
Stephen King is directly publishing on the Web .
Many of my poet and fiction writer friends are self - publishing or at least self - promoting and self - distributing using Amazon and all the rest .
This change is happening in the software world too , with some major computer companies heavily into open source .
As in 6th century BC Greece , we may end up with a hybrid of the gift and commodity economies find ways to adapt .
I ’ve spoken of gifts , swarms , mobs , repair , biology , failures , and the duende .
Mention of master planning , software process maturity levels , modular parts , mathematical reasoning , and all the other trappings of mainstream software development were either snide , sarcastic , demeaning , or insulting .
Software skill is a gift from an unknown and unknowable source perhaps the skill is an artistic talent , perhaps there are parts of the process of writing software that can be taught .
We can never move forward we can never move forward while the bulk of software work is done in secret and while wholly inadequate resources are given to it .
Currently , almost all software development work is carried out in a way that cannot result in beautiful , living , adaptable artifacts .
Unlike our friends in the built world , we just started to populate the landscape with beautiful software neighborhoods when the air hand of the commodity economy moved in like William Levitt ’s bulldozers and assembly - line house stampers .
The first Levittownonce called Island Trees was a postwar innovation in low cost housing in which a potato patch on Long Island was turned into the first mass - produced housing tract .
After the foundation was laid , specialized crews would descend on each lot one after another so fast that 18 houses were completed in the 8 to noon shiftone could say they used an especially brutal and efficient pattern language .
Many lamented the approach .
Peter Bacon
Hales wrote of the criticism :
The accusations against Levittown from the first focused on its relentless homogeneity , the cramped quarters of its interiors , and the raw , unfinished quality of its landscape .

Peter Bacon Hales
Architects , artists , and even some computer scientists have used Levittown as an example of how modernism belief in reductionism and the ultimate value of the machine can lead to the deathlike morphology of late 20th and early 21st century life , the unimaginably dulling effect of sameness and inhumanity on ordinary lives .
I might have argued that , being made of nothing but modular parts laid out on curved roads , Levittown metaphorically epitomized what I find frightening and discouraging about contemporary software design and construction .
Postwar Americans needed affordable housing near jobs to raise the first wave of baby - boomers , not unaffordable aesthetics .
The houses were snapped up while trucks hauling tools and pulling trailers carrying bulldozers drove away toward their next project .
The architects , designers , builders , and developers did not care to learn from their projects , and the United States experienced an unending string of housing projects ever since that imposed a planned living experience on people bent more on living than on planning .
Levittown relied on wood framing , but many other projects cast their designs literally in concrete .
The Pruitt - Igoe apartments in St. Louis won architectural awards in the mid-1950s for low - cost housing design .
But the two complexes were simply steel and concrete highrise warrens in the mold of the Swiss architect Le Corbusier who said
a house is a machine to live in
" Cities of Tomorrow , " Peter Hall , page 205
and
the design of cities is too important to be left to the citizens
" Cities of Tomorrow , " Peter Hall , page 207
Seventeen years after being completed , the Pruitt - Igoe complex was dynamited , creating a vacant lot still mostly vacant , signaling the beginning of the postmodern era .
So in 1951 , the designers of Levittown designers just like us watched as families poured in to begin life in the carefully planned and constructed warrens relentlessly devised according to modernist principles of machine love .
The world , however , did not wait , but soon observed what followed on .
Nature , the Levittown community , and the duende did not care about the master plan :
The bulldozed landscape began to sprout trees and shrubs , and over a period of years as economic realities changed , the community developed a sense of innovation , and its inhabitants a control of their own destinies .
Not being trained as architects or builders did not faze them .
They thought locally and acted locally .
The community , through small acts of repair , transformed a homogenized and orderly Levittown into a place deserving the name Island Trees .
Customization , additions , remodels , landscaping , disorder the community , acting as a multitude or aggregation of persons regarded as not individually important as a mobmade Levittown over .
Let me finish by again quoting Peter Bacon Hales , art historian from the University of Illinois at Chicago , who wrote the following for the mob-infested World Wide Web :
The raw , new quality of the landscape , too , did n’t seem so awful to new renters and ( a little later ) owners , who knew that the trees and grass would quickly grow , and who understood the Levitt salesman ’s pitch promising opportunities to personalize the interior and exterior of your Levittown house .
Life [ magazine ] ran a contest , seeking the best - decorated Levittown house , and the winner was a rather startling red- themed Mandarin - Revival Sino - Asian extravaganza .
Over time , Levittown houses changed character , as their occupants rose in status and in economic wealth , and as families expanded and community standards of innovation and growth trickled from the home - improvement seminars at the Community Center and later the High School , out into the Saturday projects and summer vacation plans of Levittown residents .
Today ’s heterogeneous Levittown is a testimony to the resilience of the community ....

Where I ’m from , the birds sing a pretty song and there ’s always music in the air .

Filmmakers have relied on film to make their movies for almost as long as the industry 's been around .
Digital projection does not degrade the quality of the picture
Shooting on film may be expensive , but it has a special quality unrivalled by any other media , and though we are not necessarily aware of what is going on behind the scenes when we turn up at the box office , we are stepping into the world of 35 mm film .
The release prints of movies arrive in projection rooms as 10,000 feet of film printed as a copy of the original .
So far the only sop towards digital in the analogue cinema world has been in the realm of sound .
But now , finally , film itself may be facing the final curtain as cinemas find the pull of digital forces irresistible .
Picture perfect
Digital projection systems are the latest thing .
The release copy of the movie is delivered on a hard drive , sporting 100 gigabytes of the latest Hollywood fare , a digitally scanned copy of the master film print .
The industry has reached a watershed , and digital cinema is about to take off in a big way
Once clipped into place the movie is simply uploaded to a server and is one button - push away from being digitally projected .
The big advantage of digital projection is the picture quality .
With film , every imperfection gets shown as the 35 mm print passes through the projector , including scratches , fluff , blotches and so forth ; not exactly what the director intended for their creative vision .
With a digital projector linked to a server there are no more stray hairs , scratches or dust - just a crystal clear picture .
Goblet of Fire from Warner was released digitally in 18 countries
The rest of the entertainment world embraced digital years ago , so why are the cinemas so late to the party ?
" It 's taken so long because it 's been a question of agreeing in advance , " said David Hancock of Screen Digest .
" It 's been a consensus building process , which started in 1999 with the first commercial release of Star Wars Episode One .
" Since then we 've had five years of testing the technology , building a consensus and agreeing the business models and technology to be used , and this took longer than most people expected . "
Big savings
Now the industry has reached a watershed , and digital cinema is about to take off in a big way .
A couple of years ago there were only 335 digitally - equipped screens worldwide .
By the end of last year , in which Hollywood finally published a common technical standard , that number had almost trebled , to 849 screens .
Forecasts predict 17,000 screens in just a few years from now , concentrated in the movie world 's spiritual home , the US .
Digital encryption will help protect against film piracy
The Hollywood studios are driving this transition because they stand to make enormous savings , which they can pass on to the cinemas themselves .
The most obvious saving is in distribution costs .
An average length feature film print costs around £ 700 ( $ 1,300 ) .
Encoding it and delivering a hard drive to the cinema works out at a fraction of that .
In future , the possibility of delivering the movie by satellite or over the net has got the bean counters salivating .
One of the other great costs to the movie industry is piracy , which Hollywood claims has cost it $ 6 bn ( £ 3.2bn ) .
Distributing movies digitally means they can be encrypted before they even leave the studios , and then unlocked by software at the cinemas themselves .
Tinseltown 's films could get more showings , too .
Digital movies can be streamed from the server to different screens at the same time ; or alternatively a variety of movies can be shown on the same screen throughout the course of a day .
But perhaps the most exciting thing for the cinemas is that digital projection gives them a flexibility they could only have dreamt when they had to use film .
" With a digital projector you can input virtually anything into it , " said Steve Knibbs of Vue cinemas .
" [ We can screen ] a DVD , a clip downloaded from YouTube , gaming from a digital projector with multiple players on the screen at the same time , a live feed from satellite , cable and whatever .
" Anything we can get as an input we can put up on screen .
That means we go from being a place where you can just see 35 mm films to becoming a true general entertainment place providing everything from gambling to gaming , educational lessons to movies they might not have seen for 40 years , and all sort of things like that . "
' Buzz about 3D '
The advent of digital also means that some technologies which were a bit suspect in the past can be revived .
Brace yourselves for the return of 3D .
In truth 3D never really went away - it has been the staple of the big - screen Imax experience for years .
Imax uses two film projectors and two reels of film to fool our brains into thinking we are seeing 3D .
That process has been too expensive for regular cinemas to contemplate , but digital projectors make it affordable for the first time .
" It 's not proved financially viable for some time , " said Richard Boyd of the National Film Theatre .
" This was something that was quite big in 50s and 60s and sort of dropped out , a bit of a gimmick , a bit like smellavision .
" But now a single digital projector can run at a higher frame rate and show both left eye and right eye [ images ] from a single projector . "
There is now a real buzz about 3D ; there are seven new 3D movies slated for release in the coming year .
With technology available to recreate old classics , as well as show sporting events , in 3D there is a real feeling that 3D is finally coming of age .
Even so , places like the Hollywood entertainment museum put these developments in perspective .
Technology is important , but it is just one part of a bigger picture .
Digital cinema , although it is being seen as a milestone on par with colour and sound , is still at its heart just cinema .
Ultimately it is the finished product , the movies themselves , which will ensure we keep coming back for more .
Der US - Amerikaner Daniel Wallace ist vor einem Bezirksgericht im US - Bundesstaat Indiana mit seiner Klage gegen die Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) – Autor der GNU General Public License ( GPL ) – gescheitert .
Er hatte moniert , die durch die GPL mögliche kostenlose Verfügbarkeit von Softwarekopien sei gleichbedeutend mit Preisabsprachen , die in Paragraph 1 des Sherman Antitrust
Act untersagt würden .
Wallace klagte im Juni 2005 auf Unterlassung ( PDF - Datei ) , da die GPL die Möglichkeiten für andere Entwickler mindere , mit eigenen Betriebssystemen auf dem Softwaremarkt konkurrieren zu können .
Diese Klage wurde bereits im November vorigen Jahres abgewiesen , woraufhin Wallace sie ergänzte .
Diese Ergänzung wurde nun von Richter John Daniel Tinder ebenfalls abgewiesen ( PDF - Datei ) .
Tinder konnte in den Vorbringungen des Klägers keinen generellen Verstoß gegen den Sherman Act erkennen .
Vielmehr schreibt er in seiner Begründung , die GPL begünstige den freien Wettbewerb und die Distribution von Computer - Betriebssystemen , was sich auf die Verbraucher durch niedrigere Preise , besseren Zugang und mehr Innovation auswirke .
Der Richter konnte zwar Wallace ' Argument nachvollziehen , er als Individuum habe Probleme , auf dem Softwaremarkt
Fuß zu fassen , doch habe er nicht nachweisen können , dass sich die GPL schädlich auf den Markt als solches auswirke .
Es gebe ein " potenzielles Problem " , eine Kartellrechtsverletzung festzustellen , wenn die Interessen des Klägers von denen der Konsumenten divergieren , heißt es in der Begründung der Entscheidung weiter .
Der Sherman
Act sei aber installiert worden , um den Verbrauchern die Vorteile der Preis - Konkurrenz zu sichern .
Da Wallace Preisabsprachen zwischen der FSF und IBM , Novell und Red Hat unterstellt , hat er auch gegen die drei Unternehmen Klagen laufen .

American forces in Iraq are in danger of having their line of supply cut by guerrillas .
Napoleon once said that " an army travels on its stomach . "
By that he meant that the problem of keeping an army supplied is the prerequisite for the very existence of the force .
A 21st - century military force " burns up " a tremendous volume of expendable supplies and continuously needs repairs to equipment as well as medical treatment .
Without a plentiful and dependable source of fuel , food , and ammunition , a military force falters .
First it stops moving , then it begins to starve , and eventually it becomes unable to resist the enemy .
In 1915 , for example , this happened to British forces that had invaded Mesopotamia .
A British - Indian force traveled up the line of the Tigris River , advancing to Kut , southeast of Baghdad .
They became besieged there after their line of supply was cut along the river to the south .
Some 11,000 troops ultimately surrendered , after the allies suffered another 23,000 casualties trying to rescue them .
American troops all over central and northern Iraq are supplied with fuel , food , and ammunition by truck convoy from a supply base hundreds of miles away in Kuwait .
All but a small amount of our soldiers ' supplies come into the country over roads that pass through the Shiite - dominated south of Iraq .
Until now the Shiite Arabs of Iraq have been told by their leaders to leave American forces alone .
But an escalation of tensions between Iran and the US could change that overnight .
Moreover , the ever - increasing violence of the civil war in Iraq can change the alignment of forces there unexpectedly .
Southern Iraq is thoroughly infiltrated by Iranian special operations forces working with Shiite militias , such as Moqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigades .
Hostilities between Iran and the United States or a change in attitude toward US forces on the part of the Baghdad government could quickly turn the supply roads into a " shooting gallery " 400 to 800 miles long .
At present , the convoys of trucks supplying our forces in Iraq are driven by civilians – either South Asians or Turks .
If the route is indeed turned into a shooting gallery , these civilian truck drivers would not persist or would require a heavier escort by the US military .
It might then be necessary to " fight " the trucks through ambushes on the roads .
This is a daunting possibility .
Trucks loaded with supplies are defenseless against many armaments , such as rocket - propelled grenades , small arms , and improvised explosive devices .
A long , linear target such as a convoy of trucks is very hard to defend against irregulars operating in and around their own towns .
The volume of " throughput " would probably be seriously lessened in such a situation .
A reduction in supplies would inevitably affect operational capability .
This might lead to a downward spiral of potential against the insurgents and the militias .
This would be very dangerous for our forces .
Are there alternatives to the present line of supply leading to Kuwait ?
There may be , but they are not immediately apparent .
A line of supply consists of the route and the facilities at both ends .
Our present line of supply now originates in Kuwait with its ports , stevedores , warehouses , etc .
A new line of supply leading from Turkey or Jordan would require similar facilities .
Turkey has not been very cooperative in this war , and a supply line leading from Jordan would have to pass through Anbar Province , the very heart of the Sunni Arab insurgencies .
Creating new facilities in these countries would be possible but politically difficult , and it would take time .
Few of the permanent requirements for uninterrupted resupply can be satisfied out of the local economy .
Iraq lacks reserves of these supplies , and there would not be anything like enough " left over " for our forces to subsist on .
What about air resupply ?
It appears that only 5 to 10 percent of day - to - day military deliveries into Iraq are currently transferred by air .
Inside Iraq , local deliveries by air probably amount to more .
In a difficult situation , the tonnages delivered could be increased , but given the bulk in weight and volume of the needed supplies , it seems unlikely that air resupply could exceed 25 percent of daily requirements .
This would not be enough to sustain the force .
Compounding the looming menace of the Kuwait - based line of supply is the route followed by the cargo ships en route to Kuwait .
Geography dictates that the ships all pass through the Strait of Hormuz and then proceed to the ports at the other end of the Gulf .
Those who are familiar with the record of Iran 's efforts against Kuwaiti shipping in the Iran - Iraq
War will be concerned about this maritime vulnerability .
Potential adversaries along the line of supply include many combat - experienced and well - schooled officers and former officers .
We can be sure that they are acutely aware of this weakness in our situation .
The precarious nature of our supply line is well - known to our military leadership .
Unfortunately , this is one of the many problems in Iraq that has not been adequately addressed because of a shortage of troops .
We should start building ourselves another line of supply as a backup , and we should do it soon .

NEW HAVEN - WHEN Democrats or Republicans seek to criticize judges or judicial nominees , they often resort to the same language .
They say that the judge is " activist . "
But the word " activist " is rarely defined .
Often it simply means that the judge makes decisions with which the critic disagrees .
In order to move beyond this labeling game , we 've identified one reasonably objective and quantifiable measure of a judge 's activism , and we 've used it to assess the records of the justices on the current Supreme Court .
Here is the question we asked :
How often has each justice voted to strike down a law passed by Congress ?
Declaring an act of Congress unconstitutional is the boldest thing a judge can do .
That 's because Congress , as an elected legislative body representing the entire nation , makes decisions that can be presumed to possess a high degree of democratic legitimacy .
In an 1867 decision , the Supreme Court itself described striking down Congressional legislation as an act " of great delicacy , and only to be performed where the repugnancy is clear . "
Until 1991 , the court struck down an average of one Congressional statute every two years .
Between 1791 ( the court 's founding ) and 1858 , only two such invalidations occurred .
The human imagination is an amazing thing .
As children , we spend much of our time in imaginary worlds , substituting toys and make - believe for the real surroundings that we are just beginning to explore and understand .
As we play , we learn .
And as we grow , our play gets more complicated .
We add rules and goals .
The result is something we call games .

Now an entire generation has grown up with a different set of games than any before it - �and it plays these games in different ways .
Just watch a kid with a new videogame .
The last thing they do is read the manual .
Instead , they pick up the controller and start mashing buttons to see what happens .
This is n't a random process ; it 's the essence of the scientific method .
Through trial and error , players build a model of the underlying game based on empirical evidence collected through play .
As the players refine this model , they begin to master the game world .
It 's a rapid cycle of hypothesis , experiment , and analysis .
And it 's a fundamentally different take on problem - solving than the linear , read - the - manual - first approach of their parents .
In an era of structured education and standardized testing , this generational difference might not yet be evident .
But the gamers ' mindset – the fact that they are learning in a totally new way – means they 'll treat the world as a place for creation , not consumption .
This is the true impact videogames will have on our culture .
Society , however , notices only the negative .
Most people on the far side of the generational divide – elders – look at games and see a list of ills ( they 're violent , addictive , childish , worthless ) .
Some of these labels may be deserved .
But the positive aspects of gaming – creativity , community , self - esteem , problem - solving – are somehow less visible to nongamers .
I think part of this stems from the fact that watching someone play a game is a different experience than actually holding the controller and playing it yourself .
Vastly different .
Imagine that all you knew about movies was gleaned through observing the audience in a theater – but that you had never watched a film .
You would conclude that movies induce lethargy and junk - food binges .
That may be true , but you 're missing the big picture .
So it 's time to reconsider games , to recognize what 's different about them and how they benefit – not denigrate – culture .
Consider , for instance , their " possibility space " : Games usually start at a well - defined state ( the setup in chess , for instance ) and end when a specific state is reached ( the king is checkmated ) .
Players navigate this possibility space by their choices and actions ; every player 's path is unique .
Games cultivate – and exploit – possibility space better than any other medium .
In linear storytelling , we can only imagine the possibility space that surrounds the narrative : What if Luke had joined the Dark Side ?
What if Neo is n't the One ?
In interactive media , we can explore it .
Like the toys of our youth , modern videogames rely on the player 's active involvement .
We 're invited to create and interact with elaborately simulated worlds , characters , and story lines .
Games are n't just fantasy worlds to explore ; they actually amplify our powers of imagination .
Think of it this way :
Most technologies can be seen as an enhancement of some part of our bodies ( car/ legs , house / skin , TV / senses ) .
From the start , computers have been understood as an extension of the human brain ; the first computers were referred to as mechanical brains and analytical engines .
We saw their primary value as automated number crunchers that far exceeded our own meager abilities .
But the Internet has morphed what we used to think of as a fancy calculator into a fancy telephone with email , chat groups , IM , and blogs .
It turns out that we do n't use computers to enhance our math skills – we use them to expand our people skills .
The same transformation is happening in games .
Early computer games were little toy worlds with primitive graphics and simple problems .
It was up to the player 's imagination to turn the tiny blobs on the screen into , say , people or tanks .
As computer graphics advanced , game designers showed some Hollywood envy :
They added elaborate cutscenes , epic plots , and , of course , increasingly detailed graphics .
They bought into the idea that world building and storytelling are best left to professionals , and they pushed out the player .
But in their rapture over computer processing , games designers forgot that there 's a second processor at work : the player 's imagination .
Now , rather than go Hollywood , some game designers are deploying that second processor to break down the wall between producers and consumers .
By moving away from the idea that media is something devel�oped by the few ( movie and TV studios , book publishers , game companies ) and consumed in a one - size - fits - all form , we open up a world of possibilities .
Instead of leaving player creativity at the door , we are inviting it back to help build , design , and populate our digital worlds .
More games now include features that let players invent some aspect of their virtual world , from characters to cars .
And more games entice players to become creative partners in world building , letting them mod its overall look and feel .
The online communities that form around these imaginative activities are some of the most vibrant on the Web .
For these players , games are not just entertainment but a vehicle for self - expression .
Games have the potential to subsume almost all other forms of entertainment media .
They can tell us stories , offer us music , give us challenges , allow us to communicate and interact with others , encourage us to make things , connect us to new communities , and let us play .
Unlike most other forms of media , games are inherently malleable .
Player mods are just the first step down this path .
Soon games will start to build simple models of us , the players .
They will learn what we like to do , what we 're good at , what interests and challenges us .
They will observe us .
They will record the decisions we make , consider how we solve problems , and evaluate how skilled we are in various circumstances .
Over time , these games will become able to modify themselves to better " fit " each individual .
They will adjust their difficulty on the fly , bring in new content , and create story lines .
Much of this original material will be created by other players , and the system will move it to those it determines will enjoy it most .
Games are evolving to entertain , educate , and engage us individually .
These personalized games will reflect who we are and what we enjoy , much as our choice of books and music does now .
They will allow us to express ourselves , meet others , and create things that we can only dimly imagine .
They will enable us to share and combine these creations , to build vast playgrounds .
And more than ever , games will be a visible , external amplification of the human imagination .
Note : Um ... you have a booger .

When Congress reconvenes next week , Barbara Boxer will have some business to tend to ( emphasis hers ) :
I 'll be introducing a resolution ... calling for U.S. forces to be redeployed from Iraq within 6 months or earlier , if practicable .

It is completely unacceptable to me to see our government paralyzed over a failed policy --- a policy that is bringing so much pain to so many .

We can talk about the weather -- which means just making casual contact , assuring each other that we are temperate in nature and not about to erupt in torrential outbursts .
We can talk about politics -- if we can assume certain shared convictions that will prevent other kinds of storms and disruptions .
We can talk about family -- if we can assume that we take that kind of a personal interest in each other .
But whatever we choose , there 's a certain amount of risk involved , a tentative guess made about what should be shared and what should not , what would please the other and what would not .
La Rochefoucauld said , " We often forgive those who bore us , but we cannot forgive those who find us boring . "
That is only the beginning .
Conversation is one of those acts that require subtle forms of social imagination : an ability to listen and interpret and imagine , an attentiveness to someone whose perspective is always essentially different , a responsiveness that both makes oneself known and allows the other to feel known -- or else does none of this , but just keeps up appearances .
It may be , then , one of the most fundamental political and social acts , indispensable to negotiating allegiances , establishing common ground , clearing tangled paths .
Conversation may reflect not just the state of our selves , but the state of society .
O.K .
But listen to " talk " radio , with its combative recruitment of allies ; or " talk " shows in which guests are promoting themselves or their products and hosts are prepared with leading questions ; or " talk " news shows in which conversation becomes a form of shouting .
Look at our isolating iPods , at text messaging with its prepackaged formulas , or instant messaging with its iconic smilies , so necessary to make sure the telegraphic prose is not misunderstood .

Jim Hough believes the hunt will soon deliver
Many expect it to be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of our age : " There 'll certainly be a Nobel Prize in it for somebody , " says Jim Hough .
The UK professor is standing on a farm road in Lower Saxony , Germany , with a crop of beet on one side and sprouts on the other .
But the real interest lies at his feet - with some shabby , corrugated metal sheeting .
For a moment , it looks like an upturned pig trough until you realise it stretches for hundreds of metres .
The sheeting hides a trench and , within it , the airless tube of an experiment Hough believes will finally detect the most elusive of astrophysical phenomena - gravitational waves .
The Glasgow University scientist has been chasing these " ripples " in space - time for more than 30 years and feels certain he is now just a matter of months away from bagging his quarry .
It 's equivalent to measuring a change of one hydrogen atom diameter in the distance from the Earth to the Sun
Prof Karsten Danzmann , Hanover University
" It will be a big event for two reasons : it will be yet another confirmation that Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity is correct , but it will also open up a new kind of astronomy that will allow us to look inside the most violent events in the Universe . "
A new kind of astronomy requires a new type of " telescope " , and that 's just what Hough and UK - German colleagues have been developing on farmland a short drive from Hanover .
It is called GEO 600 .
Its looks are deceptive .
Anonymous silver shacks house state - of - the - art electronics and a high - power laser .
A NEW VIEW ON THE COSMOS Gravitational waves are an inevitable consequence of the Theory of General Relativity
They describe the gravity force as distortions made by matter in the fabric of space - time Any moving mass will produce waves ; they are expected to propagate at the speed of light GEO 600 ( above ) fires a laser into L - shaped tunnels to detect their very weak signal
See how GEO 600 works
And then there is that trench - two in fact , running out at right - angles to each other for more than half a km .
Their vacuum tubes end in super - smooth mirrors slung by pure - glass wires from damped frames .
This is precision engineering at the extreme .
To have any hope of detecting gravitational waves , it has to be .
Unlike electromagnetic waves - the light seen by traditional telescopes - gravitational waves are extremely weak .
If one were to pass through your body it would alternately stretch your space in one dimension while squashing it in another - but the changes are fantastically small .
Any moving mass should send gravitational waves radiating outwards at the speed of light ; but only truly massive bodies , such as exploding stars and coalescing neutron stars , can disturb space - time sufficiently for our technology to pick up the signal .
Only certain objects and events will be detectable

" The displacement sensitivity of GEO 600 is one three - thousandth of the diameter of a proton , " explains Professor Karsten Danzmann , from the Albert Einstein Institute and Hanover University .
" Put another way , it 's equivalent to measuring a change of one hydrogen atom diameter in the distance from the Earth to the Sun . "
And it is these tiny deviations that GEO 600 hopes to measure in the laser light it bounces through its L - shaped tubes .
Cosmic symphony Careful refinement and tuning of the instrumentation has moved the installation very close to the required sensitivity - towards a possible " eureka " moment .
The UK - German team is working with US colleagues who have two similar facilities known collectively as Ligo - Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory .
Imagine being able to see the world but you are deaf , and then suddenly someone gives you the ability to hear things as well - you get an extra dimension of perception
Prof Bernard Schutz , Cardiff University
These set-ups , at Livingston in Louisiana and Hanford in Washington , employ laser arms that are 4 km long .
Both Ligo and GEO 600 are to begin a full " science run " in November , with the aim of gathering data continuously for 18 months .
In that time , they would expect to see perhaps two events , maybe more , that can be put down to a passing gravitational wave .
A detection would be confirmed if at least two of the widely separated installations record the same signal .
But , as great an achievement as that would be , it really is just the start .
The real aim is to have a new means of studying the Universe - to trace its exotic phenomena in detail in a way that does not rely on light .
Precision engineering is required to measure such tiny displacements " The analogy I like is this : imagine being able to see the world but you are deaf , and then suddenly someone gives you the ability to hear things as well - you get an extra dimension of perception , " explains Professor Bernard Schutz from the Albert Einstein Institute and Cardiff University .
" Up until now we 've only been able to see the Universe with our telescopes , but with gravitational waves we will be able to hear it as well ; and that 's going to convey a different type of information .
" Most of the Universe can not emit electromagnetic waves - we will never see it with light .
But we can see it , or parts of it , with gravitational waves . "
With this in mind , the scientists have even grander plans which go beyond merely upgrading GEO 600 and Ligo : they want to put an observatory in space .
BUILDING A NEW ASTRONOMY
Laser interferometers are being constructed across the world
The installations will see into the cores of exploding stars
They will make it possible to trace the outline of black holes Space observatories will probe the first moments of creation
The new knowledge may lead to a unified theory of physics Preparations for this mission , known as Lisa ( Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ) , are well advanced .
It would fire lasers between three spacecraft flying in formation and separated by five million km .
Lisa would allow scientists to look at lower frequencies than are possible on Earth , to signals that come from the merger of monster black holes .
Modelling also suggests it should be capable of detecting remnant radiation from the Big Bang itself , enabling science to probe the first moments of creation and perhaps pull together some of its contradictory theories .
" You do n't often get things that are very small that are also very massive but , of course , in the very earliest moments of the Universe we did , " says Professor Mike Cruise from Birmingham University .
" Some of these observations are going to give us a clue as to how gravity can be viewed in terms of quantum mechanics and the prospect of that is just mind - boggling . "
HOW A LASER INTERFEROMETER CAN CATCH THE ELUSIVE WAVES
Two super - dense neutron stars circling each other [ 1 ] are expected to emit gravitational waves that move out at the speed of light At GEO 600 , a high - powered laser [ 2 ] is fired at a ' beam splitter ' - a semi- transparent mirror - which divides the beam down two evacuated tunnels Mirrors [ a+b ] at the far ends bounce the light back ; more mirrors [ c+d ] extend the measuring distance , and yet more [ e+f ] are used to recycle the power and enhance the signal
The light paths from the separate arms are recombined and sent to a photodetector .
If a gravitational wave has passed through the observatory , it will have changed the length of the arms and the signal should be evident when analysed by computer

With 11 days until Christmas , I have bought exactly zero presents .
I ’m not a bad person , I just do n’t like hurling myself into the hordes of mall santas , double - wide strollers , and Sbarro devouring teenagers .
Before my illustrious career as web design rockstar ( edit : corporate drone ) I lived in the dark - ages : I worked retail for 7 years .
For seven long years housewives threw pens , money , credit cards , and obscenities at me .
I learned that without the magic ability to produce merchandise that did n’t exist , or produce it at an unreasonably low price , a lowly shop wench did n’t stand a fighting chance .
I saw women mow down my pyramids of stemware with hum - vee strollers , and witnessed the morbidly obsese walk again when their Rascals would n’t fit through the aisles .
Desperate husbands scooped up gift - cards and jingle rock santas , while sticky - fingered , unattended children flung pretzels and cheerios across the store .
So , as I would sooner endure paper cuts to my eyelids than go near a mall the day after Thanksgiving , I ’ve come up with a few tips based on my experiences to help out my fellow anti-commerce holiday slackers .
The item you want is probably gone already .
Do n’t trust internet inventory locators , they ’re always wrong .
Call the store and ask someone .
Most stores , even during the holidays , will begrudgingly hold something for you if you can get there fast enough .
All bets are off .
Do n’t turn your back on the spoils in your cart and expect it to remain untouched .
Someone else wants that poop - herself - pretty - pretty - princess .
She who has her hands on it last , leaves the store with it .
Bring cash , and bring extra .
Almost every holiday season my store ’s card services went down after being overloaded with requests .
Card processing will time out , and writing checks runs you the risk of having your eyeballs clawed out by the impatient lines behind you .
You wo n’t find a parking space , so do n’t bother trying .
Just take the spot in the middle of nowhere , it will take you less time to walk to the store than it does to sit in your car pissing off everyone trying to get around you .
There wo n’t be anyone to help you .
The nearest salesperson is teetering on a ladder , getting the last thingamajic and whatchamacallit from the store ’s highest display , for a moth - ball scented old bag who ’s “ just looking . ”
Know what you want and where it is .
If a store does offer free gift wrap , you do n’t want it , and you ’re a jerk if you get it .
This means you ’re pulling away staff from the salesfloor and cash registers , potentially inciting a riot .
And if you ’re getting something oddly shaped or oversized , they ’re not going to be able to wrap it any better than you would , it ’s still going to look like a blob of crumpled up gift - wrap .
Just go home and stick whatever it is in a gift bag , besides it ’s easier for your stuffy sister - in - law when she regifts .
Always ask for a gift receipt first , even if you do n’t want one .
You never know when you ’ll need it , your tastes are n’t infallible and you do n’t want Aunt Ethel to know how cheap you are , and the cashier will have to get a manager to reprint one for you .
Get out of there .
As soon as you ’re done , leave the store , sprawlmart , or ye olde mall towne immediately .
You never know who you ’re going to run into .
One unfortunate Christmas Eve I fell prey to a local weather girl gone investigative reporter spotlighting last minute shoppers , and my whole family got a sneak preview of their gifts on the ten o’clock news .
Now good luck , and get some of that pre-alcoholic egg nog , because you ’re going to need it .
And remember , gift cards are your friend .
If you always have trouble trying to find the right Christmas gift for someone , you should look into sending them a great Christmas gift basket delivered right to their home .
By sending a holiday gift basket you can let people you ’re thinking of them through the holidays .
Besides holiday themed gift baskets , gift baskets can come in a variety of packages such as wine gift baskets , fruit gift baskets and Chocolate gift baskets .
Wednesday , 11 January 2006 , The Day After the Macworld Expo Keynote Address , 8:30 AM Pacific
A bedraggled figure stands at the front door of a nice house .
It is Brushed Metal .
He wipes his mouth , brushes various crumbs and bits of detritus from his chest and sleeves .
He ’s been out all night .
He knocks on the door .
A few seconds later , he knocks again .
The door opens , revealing Safari , looking comfortable in a robe and holding a mug of coffee .
This is his home .
He seems slightly surprised to see Brushed Metal , but he ’s cheerful .
Safari : Hey .
Brushed .
What ’s up ?
Brushed Metal : Ah , you know .
In the neighborhood , figured I ’d stop by .
Tried calling you , but kept getting your voicemail .
Safari : ( bemused )
It ’s like eight in the morning .
Brushed Metal : Really ?
Wow , I thought it was like ten .
( Holds left wrist out . )
Lost my watch .
Silence for a few beats .
There ’s a tangible sense of Brushed Metal waiting for a “ come inside ” invitation that is quite obviously not forthcoming , the awkwardness of which neither acknowledges , which ( the lack of acknowledgement of the awkwardness of the situation ) is itself awkward .
Safari sips his coffee .
Brushed Metal :
So how about that fucking keynote ?
Fucking iLife , the whole goddamn suite , gone to that bastard theme from iTunes .
You believe that shit ?
Safari : Yeah , I saw that .
That ’s a tough break , man .
Brushed Metal : Whole goddamn suite .
Safari : Well , not GarageBand .
Brushed Metal : Yeah , that crazy fucker .
You know that theme ’s on meth , right ?
Safari : Really ?
Brushed Metal : Total nut job .
You know the worst part of this thing ?
I had fucking deals signed with all these apps .
Contracts .
They did n’t even bother weaseling out of them with loopholes — you know , saying something like that the contract was for “ iMovie ” , not “ iMovie HD ” , that sort of thing .
They just ripped ’em up .
Safari :
The contracts .
Brushed Metal : Yeah .
That fucker Jobs .
Just ripped ’em up .
I ought to sue those bastards .
If my goddamn agent had n’t Benedict - Fucking - Arnolded me …
Safari :
They do play hardball .
Brushed Metal :
You know what gets me about these apps using that fucking theme ?
Safari : Hmm ?
Brushed Metal :
That everyone ’s raving about how good they look without borders .
Everyone is like , Ooh , borders are so out .
I loooove how everything goes right up against the sides of the windows now .
It feels so light .
Brushed metal and borders look so “ heavy ” .
Like I ca n’t do borderless !
Like you and me are n’t existence proof that I can do borderless !
We fucking pioneered borderless .
We ’ve been borderless right from the start .
They took borderless from us .
Safari :
My browser windows do have some borders when they ’re in bookmarks mode .
Brushed Metal : Sure , but you know what I mean .
Those are n’t border borders .
Safari : Right .
Brushed Metal :
And what ’s the deal with those squared - off window corners ?
Oooh , custom corner radiuses .
What is the point of that ?
It looks like a bug .
Safari : Yeah , I do n’t get that .
Brushed Metal :
We ’ll knock those bookmark - mode borders out in your 3.0 .
Maybe we should do the corner thing , too .
What do you think ?
Safari : ( pause )
Well , that stuff ’s not my call .
Brushed Metal :
We could do it , though .
You and me .
Remember when your public beta hit the street ?
Everyone was like ,
Oh man , brushed metal in a document - based app ?
That ’s against the interface guidelines !
You ca n’t do that !
Waaa ! ”
Good times , man , good times .
Safari : Yeah .
Brushed Metal :
And the whole no - official - name - for - this - theme game .
You know what I think they should call him ?
They should call him “ The iLife Theme ” .
You know , like make it official , put it in the HIG : “ This theme is only for use by iLife apps . ”
Do n’t you think ?
Safari : Look , Brushed .
I ’m not involved in this sort of thing .
I just want to render pages , keep getting faster .
Keep closing leaks .
I ’m just not involved with the theme stuff .
Brushed Metal looks down , takes a breath , shifts a bit from jovial to earnest .
Brushed Metal : I ’ll be honest with you .
I ’m counting on you , Safari .
Safari :
It ’s out of my hands .
You ’ve got to talk to my reps about this stuff .
Brushed Metal : I can count on you , right ?
Safari :
How did you get my address ?
Brushed Metal :
All right , all right .
Can I ask you something , though ?
Safari : Sure .
Brushed Metal : Can I borrow a hundred dollars ?
Safari puts his hand on the door to close it .
Safari : I have to go .
Brushed Metal : Fifty ?
Safari :
Get out of here .
Brushed Metal : OK .
OK .
Hey , do you know where iChat lives ?
Safari closes the door , leaving Brushed Metal alone outside .
There ’s a CLICK from the deadbolt .
Brushed Metal : ( louder , so as to be heard through the door )
How about iCal ?
( quieter , to himself ) Fucker .
Cut to black .
How easy is it for the average internet user to make a phone call secure enough to frustrate the NSA 's extrajudicial surveillance program ?
Wired News took Phil Zimmermann 's newest encryption software , Zfone , for a test drive and found it 's actually quite easy , even if the program is still in beta .
Zimmermann , the man who released the PGP e-mail encryption program to the world in 1991 – only to face an abortive criminal prosecution from the government – has been trying for 10 years to give the world easy - to - use software to cloak internet phone calls .
On March 14 , Zimmermann released a beta version of the widely anticipated Zfone .
The software is currently available only for OS X ( Tiger ) and Linux , though a Windows version is due in April .
The open - source software manages cryptographic handshakes invisibly , and encrypts and decrypts voice calls as the traffic leaves and enters the computer .
Operation is simple , and users do n't have to agree in advance on an encryption key or type out long passcodes to make it work .
Would - be beta testers must provide Zimmermann with an e-mail address .
That seems an odd requirement for a privacy product , but the process itself was painless , and an e-mail with a download code arrived immediately .
In our test , Zfone installed easily and quickly on OS X , though there were some mild hitches in actually getting it to work .
Zfone is designed to work with VoIP clients that use the industry standard SIP protocol , and has been tested with clients such as X - lite , Free World Dialup and Gizmo Project .
Following Zfone 's instructions , Wired News was able to fairly quickly configure Gizmo Project to work with the software .
But initial efforts to make phone calls with the system failed .
Eventually , a little trial and error revealed that Zfone needed to be started before Gizmo Project , and that to see if a secure connection has been created , both Gizmo and Zfone 's interface needed to be visible on the desktop .
Once that happens , and the caller on the other end also has Zfone installed , the interface cleanly indicates that the call is secure .
It also displays two different three - character codes .
One party reads his code , e.g. " CF8 , " while the other says hers , " TKP . "
This bit of cloak - and - dagger is n't just fun , it helps prevents what is known as a man - in - the - middle attack , in which an eavesdropper sits between two callers , intercepting their cryptographic keys and then relaying the communications between them .
If someone tries that with Zfone , the spoken codes wo n't match what the callers see on their screens .
Using Zfone did n't add any noticeable latency or distortion to calls made with Gizmo Project .
Once it 's up and running , you 're simply talking on the phone .
But make no mistake : to eavesdroppers , Zfone is anything but routine .
The protocol is based on SRTP , a system that uses the 256 - bit AES cipher and adds to that a 3,000 - bit key exchange that produces the codes callers can read off to one another .
It has been submitted to IETF for approval as an internet standard , and by most accounts is strong enough to defy even the most sophisticated code - breaking technologies , from a hacker 's packet sniffer to the acres of computers beneath Ft. Meade .
That makes Zfone the " most secure telephone system anyone has ever used , " according to PGP Corporation 's CTO Jon Callas , who worked with Zimmermann on the protocol
Of course , security is nice , but the value of an end - to - end crypto system is partially a function of its popularity .
If you 're the only one using the system , there 's nobody to talk to .
The Gizmo Project ostensibly uses its own encryption for Gizmo - to - Gizmo calls , though the company wo n't reveal what algorithms they use .
But primarily , Zfone is competing with the built - in crypto that comes with Skype , which is closed - source , uses its own proprietary protocols , and employs its own encryption scheme – which , significantly , is not available for inspection and peer - review ( though some have evaluated ( . pdf ) it and others purportedly cracked it anyway ) .
Those are all troubling signs for a security system .
But as a standard element in Skype 's popular VoIP software , this unproven crypto has already achieved a market penetration that will likely elude Zimmerman 's system .
So as nice as it is , unless Zfone is adopted by mainstream VoIP providers , it will probably occupy the same limited market niche as the hyper - secure PGP program that ruffled so many government feathers over a decade ago .
PGP did n't become standard e-mail fare outside of the community of geeks , cypherpunks and those with special privacy needs , like human rights workers and people living in countries where the government routinely spies on its citizens without oversight .
Fortunately for Zimmerman , there are a lot more of us these days .
Perhaps the key failing of those who despise the market in favor of government control is their misunderstanding of what wealth is and how it is produced .
In a way , the prosperity resulting from the industrial revolution has impaired our ability to appreciate the complex system that produces the myriad of products and services we consume .
Before the advent of industrial production most people lived in fairly autarkic circumstances .
They produced what they consumed and vice versa .
The ever - increasing division of labor and the widespread use of a common medium of exchange have radically increased man 's ability to create wealth , while at the same time fundamentally altering the common person 's understanding of what wealth is .
Most people I know have surprisingly childish views about wealth and money .
Government schools have no doubt had a hand in this phenomenon , but it was facilitated by the seemingly spontaneous processes of modern production that we have come to take for granted .
I 'm sure we all remember being young and wanting things our parents could n't afford .
The stores always seemed to have an endless supply of stuff just sitting around .
Why could n't we have some ?
Our friends all seemed to have as much as they wanted .
So what 's the problem ?
At one time or another we became acquainted with the cliché , " money does n't grow on trees , " or some similar derivative .
Now , for most people reading this ( except the really ancient ones ) , this statement was an outright lie .
Ok , perhaps lie is the wrong word since there was no intent to deceive on our parents ' part , but it was false nonetheless .
Money does grow on trees , and in trees , and out of trees .
It 's made of paper .
But notwithstanding this sophomoric observation , what they probably meant to say is , wealth does n't grow on trees .
It is this distinction many parents fail to make clear to their children , probably because they do n't grasp it themselves .
The function of money is exchange , although as a by - product it also makes possible the calculation necessary for complex economic activity .
It is not wealth in and of itself .
It is neither a production nor a consumption good .
Its function is merely to facilitate the exchange of goods and services in a way bartering never could .
From a logical standpoint , there is little difference between barter and money transactions .
In both cases it is the actual , physical goods that are being exchanged .
The money just serves as a helpful medium .
Money is not a store of value as some claim .
Value is subjective and can't reside in an inanimate object .
But in a figurative sense , money represents production .
Money carries with it an expectation .
We see it as the symbol of our productive effort , which can be traded for the things we desire .
That 's why we accept it .
We expect that others will do the same .
In our minds , money becomes the physical embodiment of our sweat , our hard effort , our ideas , our achievements , and our labor .
It is these things , and the material goods they produce , that do not grow on trees .
The money we currently use does .
But money did n't always grow on trees .
It used to be hidden deep underground and it took a lot of time and hard work to dig it up and make it usable .
It used to last indefinitely .
It used to be extremely difficult to counterfeit .
This was why it became money in the first place .
But now we 've done away with all those ancient superstitions and foolish notions of security .
The gods of democracy have brought us a new kind of money .
We were told that the old money was just too rigid to work in a complex economy such as ours .
This new money is much more “ flexible . ”
H.L. Mencken once wrote , “ Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard . ”
Well , apparently we want flexible money , and as Gary North has observed , “ The public is going to get flexible money , good and hard . ”
The switch from commodity to paper money is a product of the same mentality that causes children ( and adults ) to wish for a money tree .
It is the desire to be a non-producing consumer , or in other words , a parasite .
A person in possession of a money tree could consume indefinitely without giving any productive output in exchange .
The goods he consumes must be produced by other men and yet he adds nothing to the supply of goods for consumption .
He is not trading his production for that of his neighbors .
He has expropriated what would otherwise be consumed by other people and in this sense he is a thief .
That which he steals seems to be given up freely , but this is not the case .
The fact that I have money says to others , look , I have produced something valuable .
Now let me trade that production ( in the form of money ) for what you have produced .
The owner of a money tree has not produced and in that sense he is not only a thief but a liar also .
Every dollar he picks from the tree is a lie that is used to enslave other men .
Theft is a form of slavery .
Stealing the production of another man after it is produced is hardly different than enslaving him and forcing him to produce for your benefit in the first place .
In this case the theft is performed through an insidious deception that is all the more dangerous for its subtlety .
The fraud does not fall directly on the first recipients but is passed on unawares and only gradually does it make itself evident .
It was precisely the " inflexible ” nature of purely commodity money that kept it from becoming a tool of slavery and theft ( in any significant sense . )
But man 's ingenuity knows no bounds and his deviousness is often formidable .
The money tree mentality is as old as time .
The Romans fell prey to its hypnotic spell and it proved their undoing .
In the medieval ages it was known as alchemy and many wealthy men squandered their inheritance in search of the philosopher 's stone and it 's siren song of unearned gold .
But it was n't until more sophisticated markets began to emerge , and people started using paper money substitutes that we became susceptible to fraud on such a grand scale .
Fractional reserve banking was the root system from which the money tree sprang .
People began to forget what money was .
Not only did they confuse money with wealth , they also lost sight of the difference between money and money substitutes .
Exchange and consumption replaced capital accumulation and production as the perceived foundation of economic activity .
It was only a matter of time before someone came along who could convince people that trees really did produce money , and that they would all be better off because of it .
The second part was not much harder than the first .
One need only play on the ignorance of the common people and on the greed of the rest .
Before long this new money was being showered down on the world like autumn leaves in the forest .
The public thought that they had found in the state a magical money tree that would shower them with prosperity in their youth and security in their old age .
But it was those in power who had found the real cash cow in the form of a sheepish public willing to be fleeced ad libitum through use of the state 's funny money .
They are a very exclusive clique and they do n't take kindly to competition .
Counterfeiters beware !
In his new book Money , Bank Credit and Economic Cycles , Jesus Huerta De Soto does a masterful job of explaining the origins and pitfalls of fiat money .
He makes the observation that “ We could liken banks ' creation of money through credit expansion to the opening of Pandora 's box . ”
This is the dangerous box from Greek mythology that once opened , unleashed plague , sorrow and poverty on mankind .
This is a particularly fitting metaphor since most of the statist plagues that currently inflict us are only made possible by the massive amounts of wealth our rulers siphon unseen from the private sector by simply shaking the money tree .
It is wealth , or in other words production , which does not grow on trees despite all the statist attempts to make us believe otherwise .
There is no philosopher 's stone and even if there were it could not produce wealth .
Paper is not wealth .
Gold is not wealth .
Nature does not accept either .
She accepts only that which conforms to her laws .
Nowhere in the halls of power will ever be found the ability to repeal the law of scarcity or to cause the earth to yield its bounty without constant effort on our part .
Nature will not be cheated , and if it seems that we have succeeded in doing so it is only because the consequences are lying in wait , just out of sight .
In his essay entitled Compensation , Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote the following .
“ Life invests itself with inevitable conditions , which the unwise seek to dodge …
If he escapes them in one part , they attack him in another more vital part .
If he has escaped them in form , and in the appearance , it is because he has resisted his life , and fled from himself , and the retribution is so much death .
… It would seem , there is always this vindictive circumstance stealing in at unawares , even into the wild poesy in which the human fancy attempted to make bold holiday , and to shake itself free of the old laws , –this back - stroke , this kick of the gun , certifying that the law is fatal ; that in nature nothing can be given , all things are sold …
If [ the ] price is not paid , not that thing but something else is obtained … it is impossible to get any thing without its price . ”
The world has been sold the idea of government - managed fiat money as a means to prosperity .
We have been sold the idea that there really is a money tree that will shade us from the effects of the business cycle and provide us with eternal affluence and greater material equality .
We have been paying for these delusions ever since , and we will keep paying .
But the final price for this transaction has yet to be reckoned .
At some point we will be forced to realize that we have not been sold the thing we had hoped for , but in the words of Emerson , " something else is obtained . "
If left unchecked , the price for that something else may well be the very civilization that generations have strived so hard to build .
The most powerful form of theft and slavery ever devised has been placed in the hands of villains and demagogues .
With it they vastly redistribute income , wage destructive wars all over the globe and wreak havoc on social relations .
They do all this from behind a shroud of Keynesian legitimacy and this is where we must strike them .
Mises taught that , " In the long run even the most despotic governments with all their brutality and cruelty are no match for ideas . "
Neither is all the paper money they are capable of printing .
If the ideas of liberty and sound money were to flourish as they once did , the state and its printing presses could be rendered impotent .
And that is something worth working towards .

The Best of Aaron Singleton
IN THE BEGINNING THERE WAS 0 .
AND THEN THERE WAS 1 .
A MIND - BENDING MEDITATION ON THE TRANSCENDENT POWER OF DIGITAL COMPUTATION .
At today 's rates of compression , you could download the entire 3 billion digits of your DNA onto about four CDs .
That 3 - gigabyte genome sequence represents the prime coding information of a human body — your life as numbers .
Biology , that pulsating mass of plant and animal flesh , is conceived by science today as an information process .
As computers keep shrinking , we can imagine our complex bodies being numerically condensed to the size of two tiny cells .
These micro-memory devices are called the egg and sperm .
They are packed with information .
Alex Ostroy
That life might be information , as biologists propose , is far more intuitive than the corresponding idea that hard matter is information as well .
When we bang a knee against a table leg , it sure does n't feel like we knocked into information .
But that 's the idea many physicists are formulating .
The spooky nature of material things is not new .
Once science examined matter below the level of fleeting quarks and muons , it knew the world was incorporeal .
What could be less substantial than a realm built out of waves of quantum probabilities ?
And what could be weirder ?
Digital physics is both .
It suggests that those strange and insubstantial quantum wavicles , along with everything else in the universe , are themselves made of nothing but 1s and 0s .
The physical world itself is digital .
The scientist John Archibald Wheeler ( coiner of the term " black hole " ) was onto this in the ' 80s .
He claimed that , fundamentally , atoms are made up of of bits of information .
As he put it in a 1989 lecture , " Its are from bits . "
He elaborated : " Every it — every particle , every field of force , even the space - time continuum itself — derives its function , its meaning , its very existence entirely from binary choices , bits .
What we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes / no questions . "
To get a sense of the challenge of describing physics as a software program , picture three atoms : two hydrogen and one oxygen .
Put on the magic glasses of digital physics and watch as the three atoms bind together to form a water molecule .
As they merge , each seems to be calculating the optimal angle and distance at which to attach itself to the others .
The oxygen atom uses yes / no decisions to evaluate all possible courses toward the hydrogen atom , then usually selects the optimal 104.45 degrees by moving toward the other hydrogen at that very angle .
Every chemical bond is thus calculated .
If this sounds like a simulation of physics , then you understand perfectly , because in a world made up of bits , physics is exactly the same as a simulation of physics .
There 's no difference in kind , just in degree of exactness .
In the movie The Matrix , simulations are so good you can't tell if you 're in one .
In a universe run on bits , everything is a simulation .
An ultimate simulation needs an ultimate computer , and the new science of digitalism says that the universe itself is the ultimate computer — actually the only computer .
Further , it says , all the computation of the human world , especially our puny little PCs , merely piggybacks on cycles of the great computer .
Weaving together the esoteric teachings of quantum physics with the latest theories in computer science , pioneering digital thinkers are outlining a way of understanding all of physics as a form of computation .
From this perspective , computation seems almost a theological process .
It takes as its fodder the primeval choice between yes or no , the fundamental state of 1 or 0 .
After stripping away all externalities , all material embellishments , what remains is the purest state of existence : here / not here .
Am / not am .
In the Old Testament , when Moses asks the Creator , " Who are you ? " the being says , in effect , " Am . "
One bit .
One almighty bit .
Yes .
One . Exist .
It is the simplest statement possible .
All creation , from this perch , is made from this irreducible foundation .
Every mountain , every star , the smallest salamander or woodland tick , each thought in our mind , each flight of a ball is but a web of elemental yes / nos woven together .
If the theory of digital physics holds up , movement ( f = ma ) , energy ( E = mc² ) , gravity , dark matter , and antimatter can all be explained by elaborate programs of 1/0 decisions .
Bits can be seen as a digital version of the " atoms " of classical Greece : the tiniest constituent of existence .
But these new digital atoms are the basis not only of matter , as the Greeks thought , but of energy , motion , mind , and life .
From this perspective , computation , which juggles and manipulates these primal bits , is a silent reckoning that uses a small amount of energy to rearrange symbols .
And its result is a signal that makes a difference — a difference that can be felt as a bruised knee .
The input of computation is energy and information ; the output is order , structure , extropy .
Our awakening to the true power of computation rests on two suspicions .
The first is that computation can describe all things .
To date , computer scientists have been able to encapsulate every logical argument , scientific equation , and literary work that we know about into the basic notation of computation .
Now , with the advent of digital signal processing , we can capture video , music , and art in the same form .
Even emotion is not immune .
Researchers Cynthia Breazeal at MIT and Charles Guerin and Albert Mehrabian in Quebec have built Kismet and EMIR ( Emotional Model for Intelligent Response ) , two systems that exhibit primitive feelings .
The second supposition is that all things can compute .
We have begun to see that almost any kind of material can serve as a computer .
Human brains , which are mostly water , compute fairly well .
( The first " calculators " were clerical workers figuring mathematical tables by hand . )
So can sticks and strings .
In 1975 , as an undergraduate student , engineer Danny Hillis constructed a digital computer out of skinny Tinkertoys .
In 2000 , Hillis designed a digital computer made of only steel and tungsten that is indirectly powered by human muscle .
This slow - moving device turns a clock intended to tick for 10,000 years .
He has n't made a computer with pipes and pumps , but , he says , he could .
Recently , scientists have used both quantum particles and minute strands of DNA to perform computations .
A third postulate ties the first two together into a remarkable new view :
All computation is one .
In 1937 , Alan Turing , Alonso Church , and Emil Post worked out the logical underpinnings of useful computers .
They called the most basic loop — which has become the foundation of all working computers — a finite - state machine .
Based on their analysis of the finite - state machine , Turing and Church proved a theorem now bearing their names .
Their conjecture states that any computation executed by one finite - state machine , writing on an infinite tape ( known later as a Turing machine ) , can be done by any other finite - state machine on an infinite tape , no matter what its configuration .
In other words , all computation is equivalent .
They called this universal computation .
When John von Neumann and others jump - started the first electronic computers in the 1950s , they immediately began extending the laws of computation away from math proofs and into the natural world .
They tentatively applied the laws of loops and cybernetics to ecology , culture , families , weather , and biological systems .
Evolution and learning , they declared , were types of computation .
Nature computed .
If nature computed , why not the entire universe ?
The first to put down on paper the outrageous idea of a universe - wide computer was science fiction writer Isaac Asimov .
In his 1956 short story " The Last Question , " humans create a computer smart enough to bootstrap new computers smarter than itself .
These analytical engines recursively grow super smarter and super bigger until they act as a single giant computer filling the universe .
At each stage of development , humans ask the mighty machine if it knows how to reverse entropy .
Each time it answers : " Insufficient data for a meaningful reply . "
The story ends when human minds merge into the ultimate computer mind , which takes over the entire mass and energy of the universe .
Then the universal computer figures out how to reverse entropy and create a universe .
Such a wacky idea was primed to be spoofed , and that 's what Douglas Adams did when he wrote The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy .
In Adams ' story the earth is a computer , and to the world 's last question it gives the answer : 42 .
Few ideas are so preposterous that no one at all takes them seriously , and this idea — that God , or at least the universe , might be the ultimate large - scale computer — is actually less preposterous than most .
The first scientist to consider it , minus the whimsy or irony , was Konrad Zuse , a little - known German who conceived of programmable digital computers 10 years before von Neumann and friends .
In 1967 , Zuse outlined his idea that the universe ran on a grid of cellular automata , or CA .
Simultaneously , Ed Fredkin was considering the same idea .
Self - educated , opinionated , and independently wealthy , Fredkin hung around early computer scientists exploring CAs .
In the 1960s , he began to wonder if he could use computation as the basis for an understanding of physics .
Fredkin did n't make much headway until 1970 , when mathematician John Conway unveiled the Game of Life , a particularly robust version of cellular automata .
The Game of Life , as its name suggests , was a simple computational model that mimicked the growth and evolution of living things .
Fredkin began to play with other CAs to see if they could mimic physics .
You needed very large ones , but they seemed to scale up nicely , so he was soon fantasizing huge — really huge —
CAs that would extend to include everything .
Maybe the universe itself was nothing but a great CA .
The more Fredkin investigated the metaphor , the more real it looked to him .
By the mid-'80s , he was saying things like , " I 've come to the conclusion that the most concrete thing in the world is information . "
Many of his colleagues felt that if Fredkin had left his observations at the level of metaphor — " the universe behaves as if it was a computer " — he would have been more famous .
As it is , Fredkin is not as well known as his colleague Marvin Minsky , who shares some of his views .
Fredkin insisted , flouting moderation , that the universe is a large field of cellular automata , not merely like one , and that everything we see and feel is information .
Many others besides Fredkin recognized the beauty of CAs as a model for investigating the real world .
One of the early explorers was the prodigy Stephen Wolfram .
Wolfram took the lead in systematically investigating possible CA structures in the early 1980s .
By programmatically tweaking the rules in tens of thousands of alterations , then running them out and visually inspecting them , he acquired a sense of what was possible .
He was able to generate patterns identical to those seen in seashells , animal skins , leaves , and sea creatures .
His simple rules could generate a wildly complicated beauty , just as life could .
Wolfram was working from the same inspiration that Fredkin did :
The universe seems to behave like a vast cellular automaton .
Even the infinitesimally small and nutty realm of the quantum can't escape this sort of binary logic .
We describe a quantum - level particle 's existence as a continuous field of probabilities , which seems to blur the sharp distinction of is / is n't .
Yet this uncertainty resolves as soon as information makes a difference ( as in , as soon as it's measured ) .
At that moment , all other possibilities collapse to leave only the single yes / no state .
Indeed , the very term " quantum " suggests an indefinite realm constantly resolving into discrete increments , precise yes / no states .
For years , Wolfram explored the notion of universal computation in earnest ( and in secret ) while he built a business selling his popular software Mathematica .
So convinced was he of the benefits of looking at the world as a gigantic Turing machine that he penned a 1,200 - page magnum opus he modestly calls A New Kind of Science .
Self - published in 2002 , the book reinterprets nearly every field of science in terms of computation : " All processes , whether they are produced by human effort or occur spontaneously in nature , can be viewed as computation . "
( See " The Man Who Cracked the Code to Everything , " Wired 10.6 . )
Wolfram 's key advance , however , is more subtly brilliant , and depends on the old Turing - Church hypothesis :
All finite - state machines are equivalent .
One computer can do anything another can do .
This is why your Mac can , with proper software , pretend to be a PC or , with sufficient memory , a slow supercomputer .
Wolfram demonstrates that the outputs of this universal computation are also computationally equivalent .
Your brain and the physics of a cup being filled with water are equivalent , he says : for your mind to compute a thought and the universe to compute water particles falling , both require the same universal process .
If , as Fredkin and Wolfram suggest , all movement , all actions , all nouns , all functions , all states , all we see , hear , measure , and feel are various elaborate cathedrals built out of this single ubiquitous process , then the foundations of our knowledge are in for a galactic - scale revisioning in the coming decades .
Already , the dream of devising a computational explanation for gravity , the speed of light , muons , Higgs bosons , momentum , and molecules has become the holy grail of theoretical physics .
It would be a unified explanation of physics ( digital physics ) , relativity ( digital relativity ) , evolution ( digital evolution and life ) , quantum mechanics , and computation itself , and at the bottom of it all would be squirming piles of the universal elements : loops of yes / no bits .
Ed Fredkin has been busy honing his idea of digital physics and is completing a book called Digital Mechanics .
Others , including Oxford theoretical physicist David Deutsch , are working on the same problem .
Deutsch wants to go beyond physics and weave together four golden threads — epistemology , physics , evolutionary theory , and quantum computing — to produce what is unashamedly referred to by researchers as the Theory of Everything .
Based on the primitives of quantum computation , it would swallow all other theories .
Any large computer these days can emulate a computer of some other design .
You have Dell computers running Amigas .
The Amigas , could , if anyone wanted them to , run Commodores .
There is no end to how many nested worlds can be built .
So imagine what a universal computer might do .
If you had a universally equivalent engine , you could pop it in anywhere , including inside the inside of something else .
And if you had a universe - sized computer , it could run all kinds of recursive worlds ; it could , for instance , simulate an entire galaxy .
If smaller worlds have smaller worlds running within them , however , there has to be a platform that runs the first among them .
If the universe is a computer , where is it running ?
Fredkin says that all this work happens on the " Other . "
The Other , he says , could be another universe , another dimension , another something .
It 's just not in this universe , and so he does n't care too much about it .
In other words , he punts .
David Deutsch has a different theory .
" The universality of computation is the most profound thing in the universe , " he says .
Since computation is absolutely independent of the " hardware " it runs on , studying it can tell us nothing about the nature or existence of that platform .
Deutsch concludes it does not exist : " The universe is not a program running somewhere else .
It is a universal computer , and there is nothing outside of it . "
Strangely , nearly every mapper of this new digitalism foresees human - made computers taking over the natural universal computer .
This is in part because they see nothing to stop the rapid expansion of computation , and in part because — well — why not ?
But if the entire universe is computing , why build our own expensive machines , especially when chip fabs cost several billion dollars to construct ?
Tommaso Toffoli , a quantum computer researcher , puts it best : " In a sense , nature has been continually computing the ' next state ' of the universe for billions of years ; all we have to do — and , actually , all we can do — is ' hitch a ride ' on this huge , ongoing Great Computation . "
In a June 2002 article published in the Physical Review Letters , MIT professor Seth Lloyd posed this question :
If the universe was a computer , how powerful would it be ?
By analyzing the computing potential of quantum particles , he calculated the upper limit of how much computing power the entire universe ( as we know it ) has contained since the beginning of time .
It 's a large number : 10 ^120 logical operations .
There are two interpretations of this number .
One is that it represents the performance " specs " of the ultimate computer .
The other is that it 's the amount required to simulate the universe on a quantum computer .
Both statements illustrate the tautological nature of a digital universe : Every computer is the computer .
Continuing in this vein , Lloyd estimated the total amount of computation that has been accomplished by all human - made computers that have ever run .
He came up with 10^31 ops .
( Because of the fantastic doubling of Moore 's law , over half of this total was produced in the past two years ! )
He then tallied up the total energy - matter available in the known universe and divided that by the total energy - matter of human computers expanding at the rate of Moore 's law .
" We need 300 Moore 's law doublings , or 600 years at one doubling every two years , " he figures , " before all the available energy in the universe is taken up in computing .
Of course , if one takes the perspective that the universe is already essentially performing a computation , then we do n't have to wait at all .
In this case , we may just have to wait for 600 years until the universe is running Windows or Linux . "
The relative nearness of 600 years says more about exponential increases than it does about computers .
Neither Lloyd nor any other scientist mentioned here realistically expects a second universal computer in 600 years .
But what Lloyd 's calculation proves is that over the long term , there is nothing theoretical to stop the expansion of computers .
" In the end , the whole of space and its contents will be the computer .
The universe will in the end consist , literally , of intelligent thought processes , " David Deutsch proclaims in Fabric of Reality .
These assertions echo those of the physicist Freeman Dyson , who also sees minds — amplified by computers — expanding into the cosmos " infinite in all directions . "
Yet while there is no theoretical hitch to an ever - expanding computer matrix that may in the end resemble Asimov 's universal machine , no one wants to see themselves as someone else 's program running on someone else 's computer .
Put that way , life seems a bit secondhand .
Yet the notion that our existence is derived , like a string of bits , is an old and familiar one .
Central to the evolution of Western civilization from its early Hellenistic roots has been the notion of logic , abstraction , and disembodied information .
The saintly Christian guru John writes from Greece in the first century : " In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . "
Charles Babbage , credited with constructing the first computer in 1832 , saw the world as one gigantic instantiation of a calculating machine , hammered out of brass by God .
He argued that in this heavenly computer universe , miracles were accomplished by divinely altering the rules of computation .
Even miracles were logical bits , manipulated by God .
There 's still confusion .
Is God the Word itself , the Ultimate Software and Source Code , or is God the Ultimate Programmer ?
Or is God the necessary Other , the off - universe platform where this universe is computed ?
But each of these three possibilities has at its root the mystical doctrine of universal computation .
Somehow , according to digitalism , we are linked to one another , all beings alive and inert , because we share , as John Wheeler said , " at the bottom — at a very deep bottom , in most instances — an immaterial source . "
This commonality , spoken of by mystics of many beliefs in different terms , also has a scientific name : computation .
Bits — minute logical atoms , spiritual in form — amass into quantum quarks and gravity waves , raw thoughts and rapid motions .
The computation of these bits is a precise , definable , yet invisible process that is immaterial yet produces matter .
" Computation is a process that is perhaps the process , " says Danny Hillis , whose new book , The Pattern on the Stone , explains the formidable nature of computation .
" It has an almost mystical character because it seems to have some deep relationship to the underlying order of the universe .
Exactly what that relationship is , we can not say .
At least for now . "
Probably the trippiest science book ever written is The Physics of Immortality , by Frank Tipler .
If this book was labeled standard science fiction , no one would notice , but Tipler is a reputable physicist and Tulane University professor who writes papers for the International Journal of Theoretical Physics .
In Immortality , he uses current understandings of cosmology and computation to declare that all living beings will be bodily resurrected after the universe dies .
His argument runs roughly as follows :
As the universe collapses upon itself in the last minutes of time , the final space - time singularity creates ( just once ) infinite energy and computing capacity .
In other words , as the giant universal computer keeps shrinking in size , its power increases to the point at which it can simulate precisely the entire historical universe , past and present and possible .
He calls this state the Omega Point .
It is a computational space that can resurrect " from the dead " all the minds and bodies that have ever lived .
The weird thing is that Tipler was an atheist when he developed this theory and discounted as mere " coincidence " the parallels between his ideas and the Christian doctrine of Heavenly Resurrection .
Since then , he says , science has convinced him that the two may be identical .
While not everyone goes along with Tipler 's eschatological speculations , theorists like Deutsch endorse his physics .
An Omega Computer is possible and probably likely , they say .
I asked Tipler which side of the Fredkin gap he is on .
Does he go along with the weak version of the ultimate computer , the metaphorical one , that says the universe only seems like a computer ?
Or does he embrace Fredkin 's strong version , that the universe is a 12 billion - year - old computer and we are the killer app ?
" I regard the two statements as equivalent , " he answered .
" If the universe in all ways acts as if it was a computer , then what meaning could there be in saying that it is not a computer ? "
Only hubris .
Lamborghini , Armani , Jack Daniels ... all this names becomed very well known brands , succesful and respected .
At begining this names were just simple names , names gaved to us by our parents .
I have a name .
You have a name , everyone has a name , but the difference betwen our names and a very well know brand is huge .
For example names like : Armani , Calvin Klein , Hugo Boss , .. are admired and this names make money .
Now !
Stop reading !
Close your eyes for a moment and imagine this :-
How would you feel if your name were displayed on Real Madrid players shirt ?
And your friends would say ...
" Hey your name is on Zidane shirt !!!"-
How would you feel if you 'll go to a supermarket and see that a lot of people buy a product with your name on it ?
When i think at that i feel wonderful , and i want to close my eyes and keep that image alive , because is so beautiful .
If we search information about succesful brand names we 'll find out that at the begining those people were just simple people , but people who want to do something meaningful .
They invest their energy , knowledge and passion in something that after a while they gived a name , THEIR NAME .
When we do something , think that behind that work is your name , your want to transform your name in a well known , succesful , and respected brand , for that your work must be perfect , and when you did your best , i'm sure that apreciation and respect will appear .
If your work will constantly be the best , the respect will grow more and more .
Remember that all great names have a history , and if you study their history you 'll find a lot of awards and good recomandations .
Finaly think at you like a product , all you do can affect your image , you can become an expensive , most wanted product , or simply a low price product .
Think at what your do , how you look , how you dress , how you appear in others eyes , what products can make you look more valuable , etc.
Analize these caracteristics if you want to become a wanted product .
After you finished thinking at how you can make your name a very well known brand , start adding value to your name .
Feeling the heat : Plants ' behaviour is affected by the climate
Scientists from 17 nations examined 125,000 studies involving 561 species .
Spring was beginning on average six to eight days earlier than it did 30 years ago , the researchers said .
In regions such as Spain , which saw the greatest increases in temperatures , the season began up to two weeks earlier .
The findings were based on what was described as the world 's largest study of changes in recurring natural events , such as when plants flowered .
The team of researchers also found that the onset of autumn has been delayed by an average of three days over the same period .
Feeling the heat
The study , published in the journal Global Change Biology , shows changes to the continent 's climate were shifting the timing of the seasons , the scientists said .
One of the paper 's lead authors , Tim Sparks from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology ( CEH ) , said the findings did not go as far as pointing the finger of blame at human - induced climate change .
" We can't tell that from our study but experts have already shown that there is a discernable human influence on the current climate warming . "
But Dr Sparks said it did show that there was a direct link between rising temperatures and changes to plant and animal behaviour .
" We need to look at change over very large areas and we need to examine as many species groups as possible because there has been some mild criticism that people have cherry - picked the results they presented .
If you have species that are dependent on each other changing at different rates , that could just break down the food web
Dr Tim Sparks , report 's author
Send us your comments
" We have gone for the most complete coverage possible that we could in Europe to try to see if there was still this effect , " he said .
" It is very conclusive that there is . "
The team examined 125,000 observational series of 542 plants and 19 animal species in 21 European countries from 1971 to 2000 .
The results showed that 78 % of all leafing , flowering and fruiting records were happening earlier in the year , while only 3 % were significantly delayed .
Dr Sparks said horse chestnut trees , which grow all over the continent , were particularly good indicators .
" It is a good example because it is easy to identify , and it has distinctive phases of leafing , flowering and producing conkers . "
He hoped the findings would now focus attention on the potential consequences of changes to the behaviour of plants and animals .
" If you have species that are dependent on each other changing at different rates , that could just break down the food web .
" For example , caterpillars feed on oak trees , and birds feed on the caterpillars .
Unless these species remain synchronised , there could be problems for any one or more of those elements of the food web . "
" Just telling them they are wrong is not going to be effective , " he said .
Instead , he told the volunteers that when they encounter religious fundamentalists they should emphasize that science museums live by the rules of science .
They seek answers in nature to questions about nature , they look for explanations that can be tested by experiment and observation in the material world , and they understand that all scientific knowledge is provisional -- capable of being overturned when better answers are discovered .
" Is it against all religion ? " he asked .
" No .
But it is against some religions . "
There is more than one type of creationist , he said : " thinking creationists who want to know answers , and they are willing to listen , even if they go away unconvinced " and " people who for whatever reason are here to bother you , to trap you , to bludgeon you . "
Those were the type of people who confronted Dr. Durkee , a former biology professor at Grinnell College in Iowa .
The encounter left her discouraged .
" It is no wonder that many biologists will simply refuse to debate creationists or I.D.ers , " she said , using the abbreviation for intelligent design , a cousin of creationism .
" It is as if they are n't listening . "
Dr. Allmon says even trained scientists like Dr. Durkee can benefit from explicit advice about dealing with religious challenges to science exhibitions .
" There is an art , a script that is very , very helpful , " he said .
A pamphlet handed out at the training session provides information on the scientific method , the theory of evolution and other basic information .
It offers suggestions on replying to frequently raised challenges like " Is there lots of evidence against evolution ? "
( The answer begins , simply , " No . " )
When talking to visitors about evolution , the pamphlet advises , " do n't avoid using the word . "
Rehearse answers to frequently asked questions , because " you 'll be more comfortable when you sound like you know what you 're talking about . "
Why “ Free Software ” is better than “ Open Source ”
This article has been superseded by a major rewrite , “ Open Source ” misses the point of Free Software , which is much better .
We keep this version for historical reasons .
While free software by any other name would give you the same freedom , it makes a big difference which name we use : different words convey different ideas .
In 1998 , some of the people in the free software community began using the term “ open source software ” instead of “ free software ” to describe what they do .
The term “ open source ” quickly became associated with a different approach , a different philosophy , different values , and even a different criterion for which licenses are acceptable .
The Free Software movement and the Open Source movement are today separate movements with different views and goals , although we can and do work together on some practical projects .
The fundamental difference between the two movements is in their values , their ways of looking at the world .
For the Open Source movement , the issue of whether software should be open source is a practical question , not an ethical one .
As one person put it , “ Open source is a development methodology ; free software is a social movement . ”
For the Open Source movement , non -free software is a suboptimal solution .
For the Free Software movement , non - free software is a social problem and free software is the solution .
Relationship between the Free Software movement and Open Source movement
The Free Software movement and the Open Source movement are like two political camps within the free software community .
Radical groups in the 1960s developed a reputation for factionalism : organizations split because of disagreements on details of strategy , and then treated each other as enemies .
Or at least , such is the image people have of them , whether or not it was true .
The relationship between the Free Software movement and the Open Source movement is just the opposite of that picture .
We disagree on the basic principles , but agree more or less on the practical recommendations .
So we can and do work together on many specific projects .
We do n't think of the Open Source movement as an enemy .
The enemy is proprietary software .
We are not against the Open Source movement , but we do n't want to be lumped in with them .
We acknowledge that they have contributed to our community , but we created this community , and we want people to know this .
We want people to associate our achievements with our values and our philosophy , not with theirs .
We want to be heard , not obscured behind a group with different views .
To prevent people from thinking we are part of them , we take pains to avoid using the word “ open ” to describe free software , or its contrary , “ closed ” , in talking about non -free software .
So please mention the Free Software movement when you talk about the work we have done , and the software we have developed — such as the GNU / Linux operating system .
Comparing the two terms
This rest of this article compares the two terms “ free software ” and “ open source ” .
It shows why the term “ open source ” does not solve any problems , and in fact creates some .
Ambiguity
The term “ free software ” has an ambiguity problem : an unintended meaning , “ Software you can get for zero price , ” fits the term just as well as the intended meaning , “ software which gives the user certain freedoms . ”
We address this problem by publishing a more precise definition of free software , but this is not a perfect solution ; it cannot completely eliminate the problem .
An unambiguously correct term would be better , if it did n't have other problems .
Unfortunately , all the alternatives in English have problems of their own .
We 've looked at many alternatives that people have suggested , but none is so clearly “ right ” that switching to it would be a good idea .
Every proposed replacement for “ free software ” has a similar kind of semantic problem , or worse — and this includes “ open source software . ”
The official definition of “ open source software , ” as published by the Open Source Initiative , is very close to our definition of free software ; however , it is a little looser in some respects , and they have accepted a few licenses that we consider unacceptably restrictive of the users .
However , the obvious meaning for the expression “ open source software ” is “ You can look at the source code . ”
This is a much weaker criterion than free software ; it includes free software , but also some proprietary programs , including Xv , and Qt under its original license ( before the QPL ) .
That obvious meaning for “ open source ” is not the meaning that its advocates intend .
The result is that most people misunderstand what those advocates are advocating .
Here is how writer Neal Stephenson defined “ open source ” :
Linux is “ open source ” software meaning , simply , that anyone can get copies of its source code files .
I do n't think he deliberately sought to reject or dispute the “ official ” definition .
I think he simply applied the conventions of the English language to come up with a meaning for the term .
The state of Kansas published a similar definition :
Make use of open - source software ( OSS ) .
OSS is software for which the source code is freely and publicly available , though the specific licensing agreements vary as to what one is allowed to do with that code .
Of course , the open source people have tried to deal with this by publishing a precise definition for the term , just as we have done for “ free software . ”
But the explanation for “ free software ” is simple — a person who has grasped the idea of “ free speech , not free beer ” will not get it wrong again .
There is no such succinct way to explain the official meaning of “ open source ” and show clearly why the natural definition is the wrong one .
Fear of Freedom
The main argument for the term “ open source software ” is that “ free software ” makes some people uneasy .
That 's true : talking about freedom , about ethical issues , about responsibilities as well as convenience , is asking people to think about things they might rather ignore .
This can trigger discomfort , and some people may reject the idea for that .
It does not follow that society would be better off if we stop talking about these things .
Years ago , free software developers noticed this discomfort reaction , and some started exploring an approach for avoiding it .
They figured that by keeping quiet about ethics and freedom , and talking only about the immediate practical benefits of certain free software , they might be able to “ sell ” the software more effectively to certain users , especially business .
The term “ open source ” is offered as a way of doing more of this — a way to be “ more acceptable to business . ”
The views and values of the Open Source movement stem from this decision .
This approach has proved effective , in its own terms .
Today many people are switching to free software for purely practical reasons .
That is good , as far as it goes , but that is n't all we need to do !
Attracting users to free software is not the whole job , just the first step .
Sooner or later these users will be invited to switch back to proprietary software for some practical advantage .
Countless companies seek to offer such temptation , and why would users decline ?
Only if they have learned to value the freedom free software gives them , for its own sake .
It is up to us to spread this idea — and in order to do that , we have to talk about freedom .
A certain amount of the “ keep quiet ” approach to business can be useful for the community , but we must have plenty of freedom talk too .
At present , we have plenty of “ keep quiet ” , but not enough freedom talk .
Most people involved with free software say little about freedom — usually because they seek to be “ more acceptable to business . ”
Software distributors especially show this pattern .
Some GNU / Linux operating system distributions add proprietary packages to the basic free system , and they invite users to consider this an advantage , rather than a step backwards from freedom .
We are failing to keep up with the influx of free software users , failing to teach people about freedom and our community as fast as they enter it .
This is why non -free software ( which Qt was when it first became popular ) , and partially non -free operating system distributions , find such fertile ground .
To stop using the word “ free ” now would be a mistake ; we need more , not less , talk about freedom .
If those using the term “ open source ” draw more users into our community , that is a contribution , but the rest of us will have to work even harder to bring the issue of freedom to those users ' attention .
We have to say , “ It 's free software and it gives you freedom ! ” — more and louder than ever before .
Would a Trademark Help ?
The advocates of “ open source software ” tried to make it a trademark , saying this would enable them to prevent misuse .
This initiative was later dropped , the term being too descriptive to qualify as a trademark ; thus , the legal status of “ open source ” is the same as that of “ free software ” : there is no legal constraint on using it .
I have heard reports of a number of companies ' calling software packages “ open source ” even though they did not fit the official definition ; I have observed some instances myself .
But would it have made a big difference to use a term that is a trademark ?
Not necessarily .
Companies also made announcements that give the impression that a program is “ open source software ” without explicitly saying so .
For example , one IBM announcement , about a program that did not fit the official definition , said this :
As is common in the open source community , users of the ... technology will also be able to collaborate with IBM ...
This did not actually say that the program was “ open source ” , but many readers did not notice that detail .
( I should note that IBM was sincerely trying to make this program free software , and later adopted a new license which does make it free software and “ open source ” ; but when that announcement was made , the program did not qualify as either one . )
And here is how Cygnus Solutions , which was formed to be a free software company and subsequently branched out ( so to speak ) into proprietary software , advertised some proprietary software products :
Cygnus Solutions is a leader in the open source market and has just launched two products into the [ GNU / ] Linux marketplace .
Unlike IBM , Cygnus was not trying to make these packages free software , and the packages did not come close to qualifying .
But Cygnus did n't actually say that these are “ open source software ” , they just made use of the term to give careless readers that impression .
These observations suggest that a trademark would not have truly prevented the confusion that comes with the term “ open source ” .
Misunderstandings (? ) of “ Open Source ”
The Open Source Definition is clear enough , and it is quite clear that the typical non-free program does not qualify .
So you would think that “ Open Source company ” would mean one whose products are free software ( or close to it ) , right ?
Alas , many companies are trying to give it a different meaning .
At the “ Open Source Developers Day ” meeting in August 1998 , several of the commercial developers invited said they intend to make only a part of their work free software ( or “ open source ” ) .
The focus of their business is on developing proprietary add - ons ( software or manuals ) to sell to the users of this free software .
They ask us to regard this as legitimate , as part of our community , because some of the money is donated to free software development .
In effect , these companies seek to gain the favorable cachet of “ open source ” for their proprietary software products — even though those are not “ open source software ” — because they have some relationship to free software or because the same company also maintains some free software .
( One company founder said quite explicitly that they would put , into the free package they support , as little of their work as the community would stand for . )
Over the years , many companies have contributed to free software development .
Some of these companies primarily developed non-free software , but the two activities were separate ; thus , we could ignore their non-free products , and work with them on free software projects .
Then we could honestly thank them afterward for their free software contributions , without talking about the rest of what they did .
We cannot do the same with these new companies , because they wo n't let us .
These companies actively invite the public to lump all their activities together ; they want us to regard their non-free software as favorably as we would regard a real contribution , although it is not one .
They present themselves as “ open source companies , ” hoping that we will get a warm fuzzy feeling about them , and that we will be fuzzy - minded in applying it .
This manipulative practice would be no less harmful if it were done using the term “ free software . ”
But companies do not seem to use the term “ free software ” that way ; perhaps its association with idealism makes it seem unsuitable .
The term “ open source ” opened the door for this .
At a trade show in late 1998 , dedicated to the operating system often referred to as “ Linux ” , the featured speaker was an executive from a prominent software company .
He was probably invited on account of his company 's decision to “ support ” that system .
Unfortunately , their form of “ support ” consists of releasing non-free software that works with the system — in other words , using our community as a market but not contributing to it .
He said , “ There is no way we will make our product open source , but perhaps we will make it ‘ internal ’ open source .
If we allow our customer support staff to have access to the source code , they could fix bugs for the customers , and we could provide a better product and better service . ”
( This is not an exact quote , as I did not write his words down , but it gets the gist . )
People in the audience afterward told me , “ He just does n't get the point . ”
But is that so ?
Which point did he not get ?
He did not miss the point of the Open Source movement .
That movement does not say users should have freedom , only that allowing more people to look at the source code and help improve it makes for faster and better development .
The executive grasped that point completely ; unwilling to carry out that approach in full , users included , he was considering implementing it partially , within the company .
The point that he missed is the point that “ open source ” was designed not to raise : the point that users deserve freedom .
Spreading the idea of freedom is a big job — it needs your help .
That 's why we stick to the term “ free software ” in the GNU Project , so we can help do that job .
If you feel that freedom and community are important for their own sake — not just for the convenience they bring — please join us in using the term “ free software ” .
Lakhani and Wolf 's paper on the motivation of free software developers says that a considerable fraction are motivated by the view that software should be free .
This was despite the fact that they surveyed the developers on SourceForge , a site that does not support the view that this is an ethical issue .
A battle has erupted over who governs the internet , with America demanding to maintain a key role in the network it helped create and other countries demanding more control .
The European commission is warning that if a deal cannot be reached at a meeting in Tunisia next month the internet will split apart .
At issue is the role of the US government in overseeing the internet 's address structure , called the domain name system ( DNS ) , which enables communication between the world 's computers .
It is managed by the California - based , not - for - profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) under contract to the US department of commerce .
A meeting of officials in Geneva last month was meant to formulate a way of sharing internet governance which politicians could unveil at the UN - sponsored World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis on November 16 - 18 .
A European Union plan that goes a long way to meeting the demands of developing countries to make the governance more open collapsed in the face of US opposition .
Viviane Reding , European IT commissioner , says that if a multilateral approach cannot be agreed , countries such as China , Russia , Brazil and some Arab states could start operating their own versions of the internet and the ubiquity that has made it such a success will disappear .
" We have to have a platform where leaders of the world can express their thoughts about the internet , " she said .
" If they have the impression that the internet is dominated by one nation and it does not belong to all the nations then the result could be that the internet falls apart . "
The US argues that many of the states demanding a more open internet are no fans of freedom of expression .
Michael Gallagher , President Bush 's internet adviser and head of the national telecommunications and information administration , believes they are seizing on the only " central " part of the system in an effort to exert control .
" They are looking for a handle , thinking that the DNS is the meaning of life .
But the meaning of life lies within their own borders and the policies that they create there . "
The US government , which funded the development of the internet in the 60s , said in June it intended to retain its role overseeing Icann , reneging on a pledge made during Bill Clinton 's presidency .
Since Icann was created , the US commerce department has not once interfered with its decisions .
David Gross , who headed the US delegation at the Geneva talks , said untested models of internet governance could disrupt the 250,000 - plus networks , all using the same technical standards ( TCP / IP ) , which allows over a billion people to get online for 27bn daily user sessions .
" The internet has been a remarkably reliable and stable network of networks and it has grown at a rate unprecedented in human history , " he said .
" What we are looking for is a continued evolution of the internet that is technically driven .
We do not think the creation of new or use of existing multilateral institutions in the governance of essentially technical institutions is a way to promote technological change . "
' Valuable dot '
According to Emily Taylor , director of legal and policy issues at Nominet , which oversees the address categories such as .co or .org - root zone files known as top - level domain names - bearing Britain 's .uk suffix , the spat in Geneva was " all about the root - the valuable dot at the end of domain names " .
At present Icann decides what new top - level domain names to create and who should run the existing domains , in consultation with a panel called the Governmental Advisory Committee .
In practice the GAC exerts more pressure on Icann than the US department of commerce ever has .
It was at the GAC 's urging that a recent request to create more top - level domain names was reviewed .
The commerce department does have the power to clear Icann 's decisions .
Icann 's president , Paul Twomey , shares many of the US government concerns .
He is adamant that his organisation should be allowed to evolve rather than be brushed aside in favour of some untried model of state - led internet governance .
" We are firmly committed to a multi- stakeholder approach , " he said .
" We expect to evolve , we expect to keep changing .
We are concerned about stability [ of the internet ] and we think it 's best to evolve existing institutions .
Our present corporate structure is a matter of history , not of any particular design . "
But designing new structures is exactly what the international community seems intent on doing .
At one end of the spectrum are Iran , Pakistan and other so - called control - oriented states that want to create a new governing council for the web to which Icann would be accountable .
The remit of this council seems broad enough to include questions of content , a worry for advocates of free speech on the web .
Two week 's ago the EU proposed its own structure , which consists of what it calls a " cooperation model " to deal with Icann and a forum which would allow governments , interested organisations and industry to discuss internet issues and swap best practice .
' Lightweight '
" What we are talking about is a governance structure that is extremely lightweight , where the government oversight of internet functions is limited just to the list of essential tasks , " said one EU negotiator .
While the forum " does not decide anything , it is a place where people can come to a view and generally participate in thinking about the internet and the way it is governed " .
The EU plan was applauded by states such as Saudi Arabia and Iran , leading the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt to express misgivings on his weblog : " It seems as if the European position has been hijacked by officials that have been driven by interests that should not be ours .
" We really can't have a Europe that is applauded by China and Iran and Saudi Arabia on the future governance of the internet .
Even those critical of the United States must see where such a position risks taking us . "
But EU negotiators are adamant that they reject calls for state control of the content of the internet .
" None of this is about content and that is a big difference between the EU position and the position of China and Brazil , " the negotiator said .
" The proposals that came from Brazil and the others to amend our own proposal were not acceptable , they were trying to drag us closer to their position .
We are very alive to that . "
Calls from Argentina for a continuing debate while Icann is restructured are believed to have garnered support from countries such as Canada which do not like the perceived power that the US has over the internet but are wary of opening up the web to overall state control .
Just before the meeting in Tunis , there will be a three - day gathering of bureaucrats to try to thrash out a deal on internet governance .
Getting the parties - especially the US - to agree to anything looks like a near impossible task but Mrs Reding believes it is crucial to find common ground or see the global communication network disintegrate .
The firm US stand makes that prospect of an end to ubiquity seem imminent .
Although any decision from the Tunis summit would have no legal standing , the current deal between Icann and the US government is due to come to an end in September next year , by which time the organisation is supposed to be made independent under the deal made during the Clinton presidency .
Mr Gallagher said that after the Tunis meeting there will be further discussion with governments and the private sector about the future of the organisation .
" But we are not going to bureaucratise , politicise and retard the management of the DNS .
Period , " he said .
" That will not happen .
We will not agree to it in November and we will not do it in September 2006 . "
Footnotes
Domain Name System
The DNS is the address book of the internet , matching numeric IP addresses to alphabetic addresses such as www.amazon.co.uk, which people find easier to remember .
But instead of one central list of everyone 's internet address , which would be massive , it splits addresses into their constituent parts - called domains - and gives each machine in the network enough information to know where to locate the next machine down the line .
This is known as a distributed database .
Icann
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a not - for - profit organisation that manages the DNS .
It decides who gets to operate the most basic domains , the top - level domains such as .com and .org as well as all the world 's country codes .
It is responsible for allocating space on the internet .
It was set up in California under contract to the department of commerce and as such it is subject to California state law and any disagreements have to be taken up with that state 's courts .
TCP and IP
Internet Protocol ( IP ) is the technology that allows data to cross networks , using a destination address ( IP address ) to make sure it reaches the right place .
Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) , meanwhile , ensures the correct delivery of that data or its re-transmission if it gets lost .
Together they are the tarmac of the information superhighway .
Root zone file
Although the DNS is a distributed database it needs a starting point , a list of where to go for the first part of an internet address and start a search for a particular machine .
This list of where to start is called the root zone file .
It is a list of 248 country code top - level domains ( ccTLDs ) - such as .uk and . fr - as well as 14 generic top - level domains ( gTLDs ) , which are subject - based such as .com and .net and .org .
The list , held on 13 machines across the world , says who runs these domains and where to find them .
Sara Lazar ( center ) talks to research assistant Michael Treadway and technologist Shruthi Chakrapami about the results of experiments showing that meditation can increase brain size .
( Photo Kris Snibbe )
People who meditate grow bigger brains than those who do n't .
Researchers at Harvard , Yale , and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have found the first evidence that meditation can alter the physical structure of our brains .
Brain scans they conducted reveal that experienced meditators boasted increased thickness in parts of the brain that deal with attention and processing sensory input .
In one area of gray matter , the thickening turns out to be more pronounced in older than in younger people .
That 's intriguing because those sections of the human cortex , or thinking cap , normally get thinner as we age .
" Our data suggest that meditation practice can promote cortical plasticity in adults in areas important for cognitive and emotional processing and well - being , " says Sara Lazar , leader of the study and a psychologist at Harvard Medical School .
" These findings are consistent with other studies that demonstrated increased thickness of music areas in the brains of musicians , and visual and motor areas in the brains of jugglers .
In other words , the structure of an adult brain can change in response to repeated practice . "
The researchers compared brain scans of 20 experienced meditators with those of 15 nonmeditators .
Four of the former taught meditation or yoga , but they were not monks living in seclusion .
The rest worked in careers such as law , health care , and journalism .
All the participants were white .
During scanning , the meditators meditated ; the others just relaxed and thought about whatever they wanted .
Meditators did Buddhist " insight meditation , " which focuses on whatever is there , like noise or body sensations .
It does n't involve " om , " other mantras , or chanting .
" The goal is to pay attention to sensory experience , rather than to your thoughts about the sensory experience , " Lazar explains .
" For example , if you suddenly hear a noise , you just listen to it rather than thinking about it .
If your leg falls asleep , you just notice the physical sensations .
If nothing is there , you pay attention to your breathing . "
Successful meditators get used to not thinking or elaborating things in their mind .
Study participants meditated an average of about 40 minutes a day .
Some had been doing it for only a year , others for decades .
Depth of the meditation was measured by the slowing of breathing rates .
Those most deeply involved in the meditation showed the greatest changes in brain structure .
" This strongly suggests , " Lazar concludes , " that the differences in brain structure were caused by the meditation , rather than that differences in brain thickness got them into meditation in the first place . "
Lazar took up meditation about 10 years ago and now practices insight meditation about three times a week .
At first she was not sure it would work .
But " I have definitely experienced beneficial changes , " she says .
" It reduces stress [ and ] increases my clarity of thought and my tolerance for staying focused in difficult situations . "
Controlling random thoughts
Insight meditation can be practiced anytime , anywhere .
" People who do it quickly realize that much of what goes on in their heads involves random thoughts that often have little substance , " Lazar comments .
" The goal is not so much to ' empty ' your head , but to not get caught up in random thoughts that pop into consciousness . "
She uses this example : Facing an important deadline , people tend to worry about what will happen if they miss it , or if the end product will be good enough to suit the boss .
You can drive yourself crazy with unproductive " what if " worry .
" If , instead , you focus on the present moment , on what needs to be done and what is happening right now , then much of the feeling of stress goes away , " Lazar says .
" Feelings become less obstructive and more motivational . "
The increased thickness of gray matter is not very much , 4 to 8 thousandths of an inch .
" These increases are proportional to the time a person has been meditating during their lives , " Lazar notes .
" This suggests that the thickness differences are acquired through extensive practice and not simply due to differences between meditators and nonmeditators . "
As small as they are , you can bet those differences are going to lead to lots more studies to find out just what is going on and how meditation might better be used to improve health and well - being , and even slow aging .
More basic questions need to be answered .
What causes the increased thickness ?
Does meditation produce more connections between brain cells , or more blood vessels ?
How does increased brain thickness influence daily behavior ?
Does it promote increased communication between intellectual and emotional areas of the brain ?
To get answers , larger studies are planned at Massachusetts General Hospital , the Harvard - affiliated facility where Lazar is a research scientist and where these first studies were done .
That work included only 20 meditators and their brains were scanned only once .
" The results were very encouraging , " Lazar remarks .
" But further research needs to be done using a larger number of people and testing them multiple times .
We also need to examine their brains both before and after learning to meditate .
Our group is currently planning to do this .
Eventually , such research should reveal more about the function of the thickening ; that is , how it affects emotions and knowing in terms of both awareness and judgment . "
Slowing aging ?
Since this type of meditation counteracts the natural thinning of the thinking surface of the brain , could it play a role in slowing - even reversing - aging ?
That could really be mind - boggling in the most positive sense .
Lazar is cautious in her answer .
" Our data suggest that one small bit of brain appears to have a slower rate of cortical thinning , so meditation may help slow some aspects of cognitive aging , " she agrees .
" But it 's important to remember that monks and yogis suffer from the same ailments as the rest of us .
They get old and die , too .
However , they do claim to enjoy an increased capacity for attention and memory . "

The story starts at least a decade ago .
For years John Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and colleague Daniel Whitmire have been trying to figure out why many of the comets that originate from way out in the distant - most part of our solar system -- the Oort Cloud -- have strange orbits that do n't jive with theories of how comets should behave .
The two scientists first suggested that the gravitational influence from a dark companion to the Sun -- a dim brown - dwarf or red - dwarf star -- was sending comets careening towards the inner solar system .
They called it Nemesis , ( another thing that went viral ) , but the Nemesis idea has widely been refuted .
Last year , Matese and Whitmire suggested that possibly a large planet four times the mass of Jupiter in the Oort Cloud could explain why long - period comets appear to be clustered in a band inclined to the ecliptic instead of coming from random directions .
An old story got new legs this week as word went viral of a possible new 9th planet in our solar system - a gas giant bigger than Jupiter - which could be hiding somewhere in the Oort Cloud , just waiting to be found .
An article this week in The Independent suggested the new planet , called Tyche , had already been found among data from the WISE mission .
This prompted the WISE team to post a rebuttal on their Facebook page : " Not true .
A pair of scientists published a paper stating that if such a big planet exists in the far reaches of the Solar System , then WISE should have seen it .
That is true .
But , analysis over the next couple of years will be needed to determine if WISE has actually detected such a world or not . "

VIEWPOINT
Matt Prescott
Governments are wrestling with problems of rising energy demands , rising costs and the spectre of climate change .
In this week 's Green Room , Dr Matt Prescott argues there is an easy first step to dealing with all three issues - banning the traditional light bulb .
They waste so much energy that if they were invented today , it is highly unlikely they would be allowed onto the market
Matt Prescott
Not so ; and it certainly cannot solve the coming climate crisis .
After turning off unnecessary pieces of equipment , improved energy efficiency is the cheapest way for developing countries to maximise their use of limited energy supplies , and for developed countries to achieve cuts in their carbon dioxide emissions .
One quick and simple option for improving energy efficiency would be to make greater use of compact fluorescent light bulbs .
Each one of these bulbs produces the same amount of light as an incandescent light bulb whilst being responsible for the emission of 70 % less carbon dioxide .
It also saves money ; about £ 7 ( $ 12 ) per year in the UK , more or less in other countries depending on electricity prices .
So why not just ban incandescent bulbs - why not make them illegal ?
They waste so much energy that if they were invented today , it is highly unlikely they would be allowed onto the market .
Nobody would suffer ; every energy - saving bulb would save money and help to curb climate change .
It is truly a win -win solution .
Cost benefit
With lighting contributing 5 - 10 % towards the typical electricity bill in the developed world , and even more in the developing world , the savings could really mount up .
Low - energy light bulbs would be a first step to curbing climate change
Given that investing $ 450 m could save $ 1.8bn , it is hard to understand why anyone would still choose incandescent bulbs .
In reality , few people seem to be prepared to pay the higher upfront cost of an energy - saving bulb , even though they have much lower running costs ; while many seem to feel they are entitled to pollute the Earth 's atmosphere without worrying about the consequences .
I have launched banthebulb.org because I feel that the time has come for the world 's governments to intervene in the market , and to remove the purchase price advantage that traditional light bulbs have enjoyed .
Simply forcing prices to include the full environmental costs of carbon emissions and pollution would be a good start .
This could be done through a tax on bulbs according to their energy use .
The tax level would vary between countries ; in the UK , a rate of one penny per watt , or £ 1 ( $ 1.77 ) per bulb , should suffice .
The resulting revenues could then be used to subsidise the price of energy - saving bulbs , and to promote greater energy efficiency generally .
Declaring plans to phase out , and eventually ban , traditional light bulbs by a deadline would help to ensure that profligate waste was not tolerated forever , and to kick - start an energy - efficiency revolution .
Bulbs for all
Given the huge subsidies awarded to the nuclear industry , it is clear that the funds certainly exist
In 2002 , the UK government spent £ 410 m on bailing out its near - bankrupt nuclear sector .
That would be more than enough to supply every household in Britain with three energy - saving light bulbs .
As former US President Bill Clinton pointed out at the UN climate negotiations in Montreal , helping the environment does not have to harm the economy .
In fact , a well planned , regulated and enforced energy - efficiency campaign could reduce waste and pollution , save money , create new jobs and stimulate innovation .
Successfully ditching incandescent light bulbs could even encourage us to aim higher when it came to cutting greenhouse gas emissions ; to increase efficiency in hot water systems , to insulate homes , to invest in combined heat and power schemes .
If we cannot deny ourselves incandescent light bulbs , which would require minimal sacrifice , how are we ever going to do the really difficult things such as cutting our reliance on fossil fuels , buying smaller cars or reducing our use of finite natural resources ?
Ending the life of this inefficient and obsolete technology is not enough to prevent damaging climate change ; but it is an easy first step , and one the world should not hesitate to take .
Dr Matt Prescott is director of banthebulb.org , an online campaign encouraging greater energy - efficiency .
He is also organiser of the Oxford Earth Summit , and writes the environmental weblog Earth - Info.net

Grigory Perelman a no-show for his Fields Medal .
Four mathematicians were today due to collect gold medals and glory in Madrid , Spain , having been declared winners of the 2006 Fields Medals — referred to as the ' Nobel prizes ' of mathematics .
But only three turned up .
Grigory Perelman , a reclusive Russian mathematician who was widely expected to be one of this year 's winners ( see ' Maths ' Nobel ' rumoured for Russian recluse ' ) , was indeed honoured at the opening ceremony of the International Congress of Mathematicians .
But after a round of applause , president of the International Mathematical Union John Ball said " I regret that Dr Perelman has declined to accept . "
No explanation was given .
Grigori Perelman declined to accept his Fields Medal .
Celene Chang / The Daily Princetonian
Perelman 's presence at the prize - giving ceremony , presided over by the King of Spain , was not expected .
He was invited to give a plenary lecture , but never replied .
A UK newspaper , The Sunday Telegraph , reported on 20 August that it had tracked down Perelman to a flat in St Petersburg , where he reportedly lives with his mother .
The mathematician is quoted as saying : " I do not think anything that I say can be of the slightest public interest .
I have published all my calculations .
This is what I can offer the public . "
Nobel prizes have been turned down six times : twice by the winners , and four times because winners were forbidden to accept the award by their home countries .
But the situation is unprecedented for the Fields medal .
Ball told Nature before the medallists were announced that it was unclear what would happen — to the money or the honour — if someone refused the award .
Multi dimensions
The Russian mathematician is believed to have proved the famous Poincaré conjecture in three papers posted online in 2002 and 2003 .
This seemingly simple conjecture notes that a sphere with a two - dimensional surface ( as all spheres are in our normal experience ) has the essential property that a slip - knot tied around any point of it can be pulled to a single point without cutting the string or breaking the sphere ; a donut , in contrast , does not have this property .
The Poincaré conjecture posits that there is a similar property for a sphere with a three - dimensional surface — but proving it has been tricky .
" Perelman 's work is fantastic , " says Michael Freedman , a mathematician who now works at Microsoft and was awarded the Fields Medal in 1986 for proving a statement equivalent to the Poincaré conjecture in four dimensions .
The only downside to the work , he says , is the finality of it .
" I did have a twinge of sadness .
You like to see progress in the field , but you also hate to see a beautiful problem solved . "
To explore the beautiful problem , Perelman used a mathematical tool known as Ricci flow , developing new tricks to study the deformation of surfaces .
He is awarded the Fields medal , formally , " for his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow " .
His possible proof of the Poincaré conjecture has been the focus of fierce attention , both among mathematicians and in the media , but Perelman himself has withdrawn from the public 's gaze .
Go for gold

The other three Fields Medals were given to Andrei Okounkov , of Princeton University , New Jersey , Terence Tao of the University of California , Los Angeles , and Wendelin Werner of the University of Paris - Sud in Orsay , France , for bodies of work spanning statistical mechanics to patterns in prime numbers .
The Medals are awarded once every 4 years to mathematicians no older than 40 .
As well as a gold medal with the winner 's name inscribed on the rim , the prize comes with about Cdn$ 15,000 ( US $ 13,300 ) .
Perelman may be due an additional prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute in Cambridge , Massachusetts , which offers US $ 1 million for the proof of the Poincaré conjecture as one of their Millennium Prizes .
A decision has yet to be made by the Institute as to whether Perleman 's proof stands up to enough scrutiny for this award .
But even if honoured , if Perelman follows form he may not claim this one either .

Trying to lose weight ?
Looking for a zero- carbon workout ?

Expensive electricity and gasoline making you nuts ?
You have come to the right place .
Every morning , I ride my Pedal Generator to generate electricity .
The Pedal Generator I built and ride charges batteries , that run an inverter to produce 110v AC , that powers LED lights , the monitor on my computer , my cell phones , and charges my Roomba , my eGo Electric Moped , as well as many other battery - powered things .
All Powered by Me .
It is the most inspiring workout you can imagine , and it saves me money !
Become Part of the Solution - Build Your Own Pedal Generator
My Pedal Power History : 35 Years Researching the Power of Human Energy
The bottom frame of the Pedal Generator was welded steel plate and channel , the crankset was an American Schwinn ball bearing set , a cotterless crank conversion spindle , alloy cranks and inexpensive pedals with toe clips .
The crankset had a steel chainwheel on it .
I drilled some larger holes in the chainwheel and bolted the particle board disk to it .
It was strong enough ( fine Schwinn steel ! ) to hold the weight of the particle board disk and run true .
I routed an oblong hole through the particle board disk for the " arm " of the crankset .
The seatpost and handlebar tube were standard galvanized water pipe .
The generator / motor was mounted on a piece of 3/ 4 plywood visible in the motor pictures seen above , which was then bolted to the water - pipe frame .
The particle board disk was a key feature of this unit .
The weight of the disk served as an excellent flywheel .
Human legs and pedals create an extremely " peaky " torque curve , resulting in jerky motion and lots of stress on parts .
The flywheel smoothes this all out by absorbing part of the energy on the power stroke , lowering peak torque , and releasing it on the " dead " part of the stroke , creating torque where Human legs / pedals cannot generate any .
Another thing to remember is that Human legs do not like extreme stress .
The flywheel allows the Human to avoid having to generate extreme pressure during the power stroke just to make it past the " dead " spots .
Many " bicycle converters " lack the flywheel characteristic because tires / rims are designed to be so light .
Noisy but extremely efficient , I have powered 12v CHAIN SAWS directly ( yes , while someone else cut wood with them ) with this unit .
(1) Pedaling position was similar to a bicycle .
The seat is barely visible at the upper left of the photo , and the handlebars ( dropped , as on a ten speed road bike ) are at the upper right .
Burst pedal power output : 25 amps at 17 volts ( 425 Watts ) at 25 years old , and 265 Watts at 52 years old , and 301 Watts at 55 years old !
Yes , I am in better shape than I was three years ago !
30 minute average output ( back when I was in shape ) 150 Watts
Accessories :
A drill chuck threaded into the end of the motor shaft provided power for a flexible shaft drive .
Drilling 1/2 " holes through 2x4 fir with this arrangement was easy .
The flex - shaft was rated at 1/2 HP ( a commercial unit , about 3 / 4 in .
thick - not a " dremel " type !! ) and I was still worried that the torque would be too much for it .
For immediate electrical use , cigarette lighter outlets provided direct access to the generator output .
I even had a small 12 v toaster oven , and pedaled bread to toast more than once .
For electricity storage I would charge a 12 v 100Ah fork - lift battery .
I could approximate the output of a small 10 amp battery charger .
Instrumentation consisted of a voltmeter and an ammeter , which together provided me with state of battery charge , output watts and somewhat of a " speedometer . "
The math needed to determine power output was easy : VOLTS x AMPS = WATTS .
A 50 amp silicon stud diode mounted to a four inch square piece of aluminum sheet metal prevented reverse current flows ( which would cause the motor to turn the flywheel , instead of the other way around ! ) , and became satisfyingly warm after long sprints .
It was mounted in the center of the aluminum plate visible in the first motor picture .
For top efficiency ( and safety ) , a switch was also installed to completely isolate the diode and motor / generator from the battery .
I had to be careful - I burned out several expensive 12v halogen bulbs powering them directly .
If there was no voltage control , exuberant pedaling would fry the bulbs in short order .
When the storage battery was connected , this was less of a problem because the battery tended to even out the voltage , but sprinting would still raise the voltage to the danger level .
I experimented with various non-electrical devices , connected directly to the chain with their own sprockets .
I substituted a ball - bearing 3600 GPH Labawco type P pump for the generator , resulting in amazing water pumping capacity .
The suction from the pump was strong enough to collapse the heavy wall 1 inch vinyl tubing used for the intake ( radiator hose would have been better , with the wire reinforcement ) and the output shot a stream of water about 25 feet across the street .
A 5 gallon bucket was emptied using this pump in less than half the time it took a garden hose to fill it .
I believe the pump was driven to capacity ( 1 gallon per second , emptying the bucket in five seconds ) in sprints .
I also tried smaller pumps , including a MATEX rotary vane pump , with great success .
I have had difficulty locating that brand recently ( 30 years later ! ) , but Northern Tool & Equipment carries a pump that appears to be identical .
And what a great price !
I never had a chance to determine how efficient the Pedal Generator was in converting mechanical energy to electrical energy , but I believe it was probably quite good .
When it was running , only 4 ball bearings were turning , the only high - speed part was the armature of the motor , and I know from research that chains can be as high as 98 + % efficient in power transfer .
The permanent magnet motor was probably better then average at power generation , because it was designed to be efficient as a motor .
In " reverse " tests , with the motor driving the unit with no load , the power consumed was less than an amp at 12 volts .
This is negligible , and much of it was resistance loss in the motor windings , since the motor drew half an amp with no load connected to it .
Status : The Original Pedal Generator never broke down , and never wore out .
I still have the motor and flex - shaft , but several job - related moves finally forced me to dismantle the unit , even though it was still in perfect working condition .
(1) Three things about the MINIBRUTE 12 Volt DC chain saw .
One , I was in great shape and probably was generating over one horsepower in the sprint .
Two , the branch / log was about three inches in diameter - not anything near the 10 inch bar length .
And three , the saw was a 12 volt saw , so it was designed to be efficient .
The literature from the saw said that the motor was a permanent magnet Bosch electric winch motor , which was a good match for the maximum output of the Pedal Generator .
It was great to see the chips fly !
Human Pedal Power Potential : What is possible ?
Pedal powered charging system for portable " Jump Start " systems .
These devices feature lights , air compressors , battery chargers , power meters , 12 Volt DC outlets , and of course jumper cables .
The Portable Power station in the photograph was purchased at Costco for $ 49.95 .
It can be plugged directly into the 12 Volt DC output of the PPPM for charging , and then moved to wherever the power is needed .
Add a small 110 Volt AC inverter ( 100 - 150 Watt ) and you have everything you need for portable power .
Run a laptop , TV , PA System , or any other small electrical device for hours from your stored energy .
Real Goods sells an equivalent device that seems to be the next level up in quality and features ( and cost , of course ! ) .
Pedal powered backup generator for solar electric systems or other off - grid power systems .
With the newly available white LED as a light source , a few minutes of pedaling would be enough to create hours of light .
Pedal powered biodiesel circulation pump or biodiesel transfer pump - direct drive , with no electricity and no battery .
If you make biodiesel , and you wish to eliminate electric pumps from your biodiesel equipment , the Pedal Generator design is perfectly suited to circulate , agitate and then transfer a batch of biodiesel , and the power source is YOU !
Pedal powered washing machine ( this is a tremendous workout , especially with the spin / sprint at the end ! )
Pedal powered clothes dryer ( when combined with a simple solar hot - air collector - such as your attic !
- pedaling would tumble the clothes and circulate the heated air )
Pedal powered whole - house ventilation fan ( 15 minutes in the evening to cool off an entire house )
Pedal powered pump and watering system when combined with a cistern to store rainwater
Pedal powered emergency sump pump - keep your basement dry during a power outage
Pedal powered energy source to power astronomy equipment during stargazing .
( A Human powered star party ! )
A PPPM in a pickup truck could provide a steady 60 - 100 Watt 12 Volt DC power supply , quietly , and keep the riders warm at the same time .
Switch riders frequently and you 'll keep the all of the PPPM Human star party generators warm .
Do n't even think of starting vehicles during the event !
Pedal powered whole - house ( central ) vacuum cleaner - requires two people , of course
Pedal powered backup circulation pump and backup air pump for tropical fish , expensive pond Koi or other animals requiring small but constant energy flows .
Pedal powered generator , emergency bilge pump , crew - warmer and exerciser for marine use .
Pedal powered air compressor ( compressing air takes a LOT of power , and is not very efficient .
This would work for small jobs only , like filling tires , staple guns , nail guns , caulking guns , small hand tools - no jackhammers !!)
Pedal powered offset printing press , sewing machine ( an ancient idea ) , hand tools ( grinder , disk sander , buffer , drill , reciprocating saw , lathe ) , mulch grinder
Pedal powered public address systems , projectors , or amplifiers for music - Radio Shack has a perfect unit for this !
A single rider could power two of these with 12 Volts DC direct from the PPPM .
Musicians , your green , portable PA system is finally here !
Pedal powered Science Fair Project - anything from the efficiency of the unit , to the physiology of the rider can be studied .
Human power generation is a vast subject with many possible areas of scientific exploration .
Pedal powered replacement for hand cranked generator - your legs are almost ten times stronger than your arms .
Free your arms and hands for other tasks , like reading , knitting , or mousing !
Every safe room , bug - out bunker , fallout shelter and hidey - hole should have a PPPM pedal powered backup generator .
In addition to keeping you warm , fed , illuminated , circulated , ventilated and connected with the outside world , it can give you something to do besides staring at the walls .
And it is totally safe with no fuel , fumes , or dangerous voltages !
( unless you need more than 12 Volt DC appliances )
Do n't leave your generator or solar panels out as an advertisement for mischief .
The PPPM is the only power source you can have in the bunker with you .
Basically , any device that was hand cranked , foot - powered , or powered by a fractional horsepower electric motor could potentially be converted to pedal power .
Also note , if the base unit is being used to power an auxiliary device in addition to producing electricity , adding a solar panel will result in additional power from the motor / generator !
That means whatever device you are powering would receive the combined power of the Human pedaler and the solar panel .
This combination makes the best of both power sources , as efficiency would be very high , because the solar output would not suffer the losses of being stored and then extracted from a battery .
Charging a battery and then extracting the same power is less than 80 % efficient , and can be much worse .
Direct utilization captures that wasted power .
Finally , keep in mind that a tandem setup for the pedals , with the pedals out - of - phase , doubles the power and smoothes out the power flow .
Only one " flywheel " is needed , so this enhancement needs only a simple pedal / seat addition to the basic unit .
With out - of - phase pedals , peak torque is not increased , so other parts of the system are not stressed .
The torque curve for a complete revolution of the flywheel simply smoothes out , while RPMs stay constant , resulting in twice the power .
Latest News : Pedal Powered Prime Mover - Reborn
Last weekend at TechShop San Jose I completely rebuilt the PPPM , after 10 years of hard riding .

Today I tested a 1.5 Farad Xpress Digital Power Capacitor , also known as an Audio Stiffening Capacitor , as both the power " smoother " and the voltmeter for the PPPM .
The test was a complete success .
I ran two different devices directly from the PPPM .
One was an IBM ThinkPad T40 Laptop , and the other was a 12 volt air compressor .
The capacitor provided a real - time voltage display , and it stabilized the voltage and amperage being produced by the PPPM .
When passed through a Targus 12 Volt DC converter to the laptop , pedaling was smooth and easy .
With a comfortable seat the laptop could be pedaled indefinitely .
The air compressor required more effort , especially when it was used to pump the tires on my eGO Electric Vehicle to 100 PSI .
The capacitor was on sale at Frys Electronics for $ 19.95 - a great deal considering it is both a capacitor AND a voltmeter .
While it does not provide as much information as the Watt 's Up I describe below , it does address two critical needs : voltage measurement and power stabilization .
It 's not in the same league as my Maxwell 58 Farad capacitor , but it costs 7 times less !
It 's perfect for a basic PPPM .

The Pedal Powered Prime Mover is a hit in Australia ! - Main BioSUB
Site
News : July 31 , 2006 ,
It has been one full year since I brought the Pedal Generator back to life .
I have been riding that generator every day , and storing the power it produces in a battery bank .
Motivated people from all over the world have bought plans to fulfill their own visions for Human Power .
It 's a success !
Previous News : On July 31 , 2005 , I rebuilt the Pedal Generator , and I call the improved model the Pedal Powered Prime Mover , because it can do much more than generate electricity .
I built the Pedal Powered Prime Mover ( base , frame and flywheel ) in one day !
The design is similar to the early version in the picture at the top of this page , but I made a point of reproducing it in a way that would be friendly to a " do it yourselfer . "
The only tools I have used are : screwdriver , hacksaw , wrench , hand drill , and wood chisel .
I finished it with only those tools , and all " off the shelf " parts .
It 's great to have the Pedal Generator back online , as the new and improved PPPM I .
I recently installed a power measuring device called the " Watt's Up " from BatterySpace.com .
( search for " battery analyzer " )
I think it is the best such device I have seen for this use .
Disclaimer : I was so impressed with this device , I joined their affiliate program , and the link above goes to it .
If you prefer to go directly to a different site , PowerWerx.com , visit http://www.powerwerx.com/.
This device provides a real - time display of volts , amps , watts , and other valuable and interesting information , such as peak output !
It has become the " speedometer " and " odometer " for the Pedal Generator .
Here it is in action !
It 's small , powered by the electricity it is measuring , and it measures in real time .
In this display I am pedaling with no hands to take the picture , and the display shows an instantaneous output of 2.68 Amps , 15.83 Volts DC , 42.4 Watts , and also shows that the peak output for that session was 51 Watts .
The display cycles through other useful information , like total Watt - Hours and Amp - Hours produced in that session .
It sure beats the old panel meters I had on the original Pedal Generator !
Pedal Power Movies and Specifications : The Pedal Powered Prime Mover in Action
Some of the devices shown in the movies are powered by 110v AC through an inverter , some are powered from 12 volts DC directly from the PPPM I , and some are powered mechanically .
No batteries are used in ANY of the movies !
You may be wondering if it is possible to do more than one of these activities at the same time with a single unit .
The answer is YES .
The light , for example , could be combined with any of the other activities .
As long as the rider can handle the extra workload , the Pedal Powered Prime Mover can deliver multiple outputs simultaneously !
One of the unique features of this design is that the Pedal Powered Prime Mover is not limited to generating electricity , unlike other Pedal Generator or Bicycle Generator systems .
The mounting possibilities for pedal powered machinery are almost infinitely flexible .
In the pedal generator movies above , where the Pedal Powered Prime Mover is being used directly as a pedal powered water pump for example , the generator has been removed and the new devices has taken its place .
The flexibility is tremendous .
In just a few minutes , you can change the Pedal Powered Primer Mover to a pedal generator , or to any of the other configurations you see in the movies .
That means one Pedal Powered Prime Mover can serve a wide range of pedal power needs , including whatever you are thinking of right now ...
It is more fun than you can imagine to power things by pedaling , with just you as the " Power Plant . "
It 's healthy , and it 's green , sustainable energy .
What would YOU like to power ?
Tell me here , and I just might give it a try and make a movie of the result .

Pedal Generator : Frequently Asked Questions
Do you have plans available ?
YES !
Follow the link below to order plans .
Why this design instead of a bicycle generator or a recumbent generator ?
This design is simple and efficient .
You will generate up to twice as much power for the same effort with this design compared to other bicycle generator designs .
Ok , but I see on the web other pedal generator designs claiming 250 Watts , 300 Watts , even 440 Watts - and people posting they have " generated 700 Watts " - or way more !
Why all the different numbers ?
Some sites quote MAXIMUM power output in an absolute all - out sprint , and some riders are not quoting actual electrical power generated at all .
They are quoting " calculated output " from their exercise equipment meters that has nothing to do with real power generation .
I always quote REAL NUMBERS representing measured Amps and Volts coming OUT OF ME and going INTO A DEVICE or BATTERY .
In other words , " real power output . "
Do n't be fooled by the other numbers you see .
Do you have assembled PPPMs available ?
NO !
It is not cost - effective OR energy - effective to build the units and ship them .
The best way to obtain a PPPM is to assemble it yourself , or find a local resource to assemble it , such as a Bicycle Shop .
You will also be able to fix it yourself if you built it yourself .
Is there a recumbent version of the PPPM ?
It is theoretically possible to convert the PPPM to a recumbent Pedal Generator .
The image at the top of the page shows an early , working prototype of a recumbent version .
In fact , the PPPM could be assembled for both upright AND recumbent use , and the riders could simply choose the riding position they prefer .
The current plans do NOT contain instructions for this conversion , but a version of the plans is being written that will provide the details .
If I build the Pedal Generator , how do I power things with it ?
Take a look at this Power Board I built for an Energy Fair for ideas .
It shows how to wire 12 Volts DC through a junction box into an inverter with Ultracapacitors to smooth out the power , and both cigar lighters for 12 Volt DC appliances , and a power Strip for 110 Volt AC devices .
A 12 Volt DC Laptop
Power supply enabled me to run an IBM Thinkpad directly , drawing only 20 watts .
The Watt's Up meter shows how much power is flowing out to both the cigar lighter outlets and the inverter , in real time .
You can power anything within reason with the setup shown .
It 's a great visual learning tool for educators to use in a classroom , too !
Here is a short movie explaining the inner workings of the Power Board .
For mode information , check out the Interactive Circuit Building Tool !
Do you offer parts in a pedal power kit I could build myself ?
No .
All of the parts needed to build your own Pedal Powered Prime Mover are likely to be available locally .
All you need are plans .
Would a car alternator work better for generating power ?
No .
Most automotive alternators have one ball / one sleeve bearing , a built - in power - robbing cooling fan , and they require external power to excite them at low - to moderate RPMs .
They have never been designed with efficiency in mind , since they were attached to monstrous motors capable of producing orders of magnitude more power than the alternator required .
They actually produce AC power , which subsequently must be rectified to DC to charge batteries .
This step causes significant power loss in the diodes ( around 5 % ) .
As I noted above , I ran power output around the diode and directly into the battery to avoid this loss .
In addition , alternators are designed to run at extremely high RPMs ( alternator pulleys are smaller than the driving pulley on the engine , meaning the alternator turns FASTER than the car engine .
Look at your tachometer reading and double it .
Whew ! ) , and do not produce usable power until they are rotating quite rapidly , requiring high ratios of step - up from your pedals .
A well - designed permanent - magnet ball - bearing motor , preferable one designed to squeeze every last bit of power out of a set of batteries , will easily beat an automotive alternator in efficiency , yielding 20 - 50 % more electricity for the same effort .
Would n't gears help generate more power ?
And what about belts instead of chains ?
Maybe .
Humans can only pedal through a small speed range , about 40 - 120 RPMs .
Below that you can strain your joints , and above that efficiency falls off .
There is a " magic " speed ( different for every Human Being ) at which they can generate maximum power .
The proper gear ratio enables the Human to pedal at that speed .
You may have noticed , though , that a Human 's maximum power output can change quickly from fatigue , and slowly from changes in conditioning and age .
The magic speed is always changing , so having a few closely - spaced " gears " or ratios may enable a better match of Human to generator .
No matter what , though , gears do n't create energy , they waste energy , so having fewer of them is always better .
The same goes for bearings , even ball bearings .
The pedal - power generator described on this page has very few of both , so it is very efficient .
Regarding belts , the transfer efficiency of most belts is less than chains .
This is mostly due to flexing energy loss within the belt material and friction losses at the engagement points between the belt and the pulleys .
Belts also work best when transferring low torque at high speed ( the opposite of what a pair of legs produce ! ) which is why you do not see them on bicycles , for example .
There may be some exotic , thin , high strength belts that could approach the efficiency of chains with the right design .
For example , the " serpentine " belts used in modern automobile engines are much more efficient than the old " V - belts " from the past .
Belts rely on friction to transfer power .
Friction is bad .
The best feature of belts is that they are quiet , so I can't say to avoid them completely .
If you decide to use a belt to transfer power , use the thinnest , strongest belt you can find , and place only enough tension on it to keep it from slipping during use .
I do not know whether equivalent " toothed " and " grooved " belts are equally efficient , but I believe the toothed belt has slightly lower friction losses .
If I can ever find some real research data on the web I will link it in here .
I would rather use my bicycle in a stand and rig up a generator connected to the rear wheel , or convert an exercise machine by attaching a generator to it .
Will you help ?
I may , but I have all my attention focused on this design .
I want to improve it , and make it even more efficient and easier to build .
Every stand and exercise machine is different , and I can't invent a solution for each one separately .
It 's also impossible for me to work with equipment that I can't see , touch , or measure in any way .
If you are still interested , click on " Convert Your Bicycle " to the left .
Could I generate more power with my bicycle in a stand and a generator connected to the rear wheel ?
No .
You certainly can rig up a bicycle stand and hinge the generator against the back tire using a tension system .
I do n't think you will be able to generate more power than the PPPM does , and here 's why :
To get an idea of how much energy is wasted in a bicycle power train , pick up the back end of a multi - gear bike , like an 18 - speed mountain bike , and give the wheel a good spin - backwards .
See how long that much energy input can keep the machinery moving .
I would be surprised if you counted more than five complete revolutions , unless you are testing a perfectly - maintained track bike .
With the same " push " the PPPM flywheel keeps spinning more than a minute .
The difference is not caused by the flywheel - it 's due to the rapid loss of the energy you put into the bicycle machinery due to friction .
That loss will be a constant drag on YOU as you ride your bicycle generator .
The PPPM design is simply more efficient .
You will also wear out your bicycle 's tire , gears , chain , and bearings .
If you have an expensive bike , you will be paying more than you think for your Human - powered electricity .
If you have an inexpensive bike , it will be even less efficient !
If I pedal now and store the energy in a battery , can I watch TV later ?
Of course !
A Pedal Generator plus a battery is an interesting combination of technologies .
Here are a number of different scenarios :
If you pedal the TV directly , with no battery , almost all of the energy you create will go into the TV set .
Very efficient .
If you pedal the TV and have a battery attached to the system at the same time , the energy used by the TV will be used efficiently .
If you pedal a bit more energy than the TV needs , the surplus will go into the battery .
Due to battery inefficiency , you will only be able to get some of that surplus energy back .
It could be anywhere from 70 % to 90 % depending on the chemistry of the batteries .
If you wait a month to use the surplus stored in the battery , with some chemistries ( like NiMH ) you may find it has completely dissipated in battery self - discharge .
If you pedal ONLY to the battery , with the idea that you will watch TV later , you will loose 10 % - 30 % of ALL the energy you create in the manner of # 2 above .
So - lets say it takes 60 Watt - hours to watch TV for one hour .
In scenario # 1 , you pedal at a 60 watt output for one hour , and watch TV for one hour .
In scenario # 2 , you pedal at , for example , 70 watt output , and watch TV for an hour while pedaling .
The surplus ( 10 Wh ) gets stored , but you can only draw 8
Wh back out of the battery , enabling you to watch TV for an additional 8 minutes , not 10 minutes as you might expect .
In scenario # 3 , you pedal at 60 watts for an hour with the TV off .
Later you watch TV , and you discover the power is all consumed after watching 48 minutes of TV ( 80 % ) .
In other words , if you pedal the TV directly for an hour , you need to maintain a 60 watt output .
If you want to watch TV for an hour later , after pedaling , you will have to pedal at 70 watts for an hour to account for the power lost through inefficiency .
No matter what , you will be watching TV !
How much power can one Human Being create ?
This is an opinion .
I used to be a competitive swimmer , and for a number of years , I worked out 6 hours a day , swimming approximately 11 miles .
Yes , 11 miles a day .
If you pedaled that hard for that long you might be able to run one ordinary refrigerator for 24 hours .
To make any kind of significant contribution to your energy supply , you must use the most efficient devices you possibly can .
For example , a small refrigerator designed to be powered by solar power would be much more practical .
For example , if you are prepared to use a slightly unconventional refrigerator there is a chance that you could power it with one good workout a day , and maybe even have some energy left over for other things .
A rule of thumb : if the device was designed to be powered by batteries , even BIG batteries , you might be able to keep up with it .
If your electric bill shows KWH ( kilowatt - hours ) , take the number , multiply by 8 ( assuming you can crank out 125 watts for an hour , which is very ambitious ) and that is how many hours you will have to be in the saddle to create the same amount of power .
Sorry , it can be depressing .
The moral of the story : Using less power is as important , if not more important , than making more .
There are numerous sources of efficient appliances on the web .
One place I like to shop is Real Goods , and of course I have spent time inventing my own efficient devices .
The white LED light I built shows how technology can create new solutions to increase efficiency .
Pedaling for an hour at the 200 watt pace , with 80 % efficiency of generation / storage / extraction , would create enough energy to run that light for 320 hours !!!
You may be interested in the details of the effort and energy required to run the 12 volt appliances .
I have compiled a Pedal Generator Energy Statistics page with the details .
Finally , here are some facts .
Lots of people write to me and suggest that a more efficient method of capturing Human energy would result in a better power output .
I am using this page for reference : Horsepower - Wikipedia .
Here is the figure that matters :
1 horsepower = 33,000 ft/lbf/min = exactly 745.69987158227022 Watts Calculating : A Human would have to lift 33,000 pounds one foot in a minute to generate one horsepower ( 746 Watts output for one minute ) - or , equivalently :
A 200 pound human would have to run to the top of a 14 story building ( 12 feet / floor , about 4 seconds per floor , 165 feet straight up ) in one minute to generate 745 watts of output , and would have to continue that pace to keep generating one horsepower .
Lighter weight people would have to get to the top even faster to generate the same amount of power .
So - I dare you to generate 746 watts / one horsepower , even for one minute ;-)
As you can see , even if we could capture Human output with 100 % efficiency ( we can 't ) you alone are not going to be able to run a refrigerator or air conditioner , or even a plasma screen TV directly by pedaling .
No way .
( Unless it is an unconventional refrigerator !! )
However , with the combined output from multiple PPPMs , anything is possible !
Can I generate 110v AC ?
Can I run my electric meter backwards ?
I do n't recommend this !
( Mostly , because it 's illegal ! )
If someone were to replace the permanent magnet DC motor in a Pedal Generator ( such as the one on this page ) with a 1/ 4 to 1/2 horsepower 110v AC induction motor and pedal that it would result in an amazing thing .
If the motor was hooked to the power lines and it was " pedaled faster than it wanted to go " , it would start generating 110v alternating current .
Beautiful sine wave AC .
If it was creating more energy than your clocks , refrigerator , all those little square black power supplies you have plugged in around the house , your lights , and that 300 watt stereo you are listening to while you pedal all use together , your electric meter would slowly creep backwards .
However , that same motor would generate exactly 0 power if it is not plugged in to 110v AC .
For very light duty " off the grid " use of 110v AC , you can try pedaling your 12 volt DC generator into a large battery and hooking up an inverter ( 12v DC - 110v AC ) to get some pretty decent 110v power .
In general , plan on being able to pedal at the rate of about 70 - 150 watts for half an hour or so , if you are in good shape .
WARNING : You CAN'T use an ordinary inverter to " run your meter backwards " !!!!
( Think smoke and flames ! )
If you are lucky enough to have a " grid tied " inverter that matches the output of the PPPM , you just might be able to send power back to the grid .
However , read this before you consider a grid - tied pedal generator .
For efficiency , however , you are much better off producing 12v DC for a 12v DC TV ( for example ) than you are producing 12v DC to charge a battery to run an inverter to power a 110v AC TV .
The UPS ( uninterruptable power supply ) for my website computer system can power the computer for about five minutes .
The same battery ( 12v 1.5 AH ) would power my laptop computer for about 45 minutes .
Everything ( efficiency - wise ) works FOR you when the device being powered is designed to be efficient ( 12v DC ) and AGAINST you when it is not ( 110v AC ) .
How do I know how much power an appliance requires ?
Almost every appliance , motor , light bulb , etc. has a " Watts " rating .
You need to know how many Watts the appliance uses while it 's running .
Keep in mind , some appliances , like air compressors and refrigerators , require a MUCH higher amount of power to start than they do once they are running .
Others , like washing machines , use variable amounts of power depending on what they are doing at any given moment ( pumping vs. agitating vs. spinning , for example ) .
The BEST way to know how many Watts an appliance require is to measure it !
Here are several ways to measure power ( Watts ) used by devices : AC : Watts Up ? Meter
AC : Kill A Watt Meter
DC : Watt 's Up - search for " battery analyzer "
How big should my batteries be ?
If you are considering building a similar system , plan on using two batteries , and a simple switch which allows you to use one while charging the other .
Flip this switch right before you begin charging to ensure that you are charging the battery with the lowest charge ( the one most recently used ) .
Also be sure to use a battery that is roughly equal to ten or twenty times your power output for a charging session .
For example , if you crank out ten amps for an hour each time you charge , choose a 100 - 200 amp hour battery .
Larger batteries will simply loose charge through self - discharge faster , resulting is less efficiency for your system and more useless work for you .
What are " rim strips " and what did they do in the original Pedal Generator ?
On the original Pedal Generator , I used rim strips on the outer edge of the particle board disk to keep the chain from slipping .
They were exactly what you would use on bicycle rims to keep the spokes from poking through .
The rim strips I used were for narrow 27 inch wheels .
They were approximately one half inch wide .
I had tried leaving the particle board groove bare , and there was no way to prevent the chain from slipping .
The particle board disk I used was too large for a single rim strip , so I used two strips end - to - end and glued together with silicone rubber .
I overlapped the seam several inches .
They are quite thin , so there was no noticeable " bump " going over the seams .
I was also pleasantly surprised to find they prevented slipping completely , and there was no evidence of any wear on them for the life of the machine .
Be careful when lubricating the chain , however .
Keep the lubrication on ( and inside if possible ) the rollers , not on the outside of the side plates .
I was very careful to not let the lubricants reach the parts of the chain contacting the rubber strips .
Where can I learn more about Electricity ?
Learn about basic DC electricity here , and all kinds of electricity here .
The most efficient way to use the power you create is not to create electricity at all , but to pedal power your ( pump , fan , hoist , winch , drill press , grinder , sewing machine , etc. ) directly through a mechanical connection .
The second most efficient way to use the power is to pedal a generator to electrically power your ( television , radio , floodlight , chain saw , laptop computer ) directly , with no battery .
Be careful about controlling voltage , or use a good regulator .
The least efficient way to use your power is to generate electricity and store it in a battery , then extract it from the battery to power some device .
Avoid this method in favor of methods 1 and 2 !!

2０２０ 年、春、新緑の季節。
しかし、今日の東京は大荒れの空模様。
肌寒く、台風がきたかのような暴風雨。
これで、水害や土砂災害が起きなければいいけど・・・
時勢も大荒れ 。
気温だけじゃなく、世の中の雰囲気も寒々しい。
オリンピックという大祭もなくなってしまったし、芽吹いて間もない葉桜が、どことなく寂しげに見えるのは私だけだろうか。
前回ブログを更新したのが昨年８月２３日だったから、夏が終わり、秋が過ぎ、冬を越え、もう８ヶ月近くが経つ。
しばらくぶりの私、 「 仕事を辞めた？ 」 「傷病で休んでる？」とか「ひょっとして、死んだ？」等と思われていただろうか。
が、歳だけはとったけど、私は、相変わらず そこそこ元気にやっている。
意識してブログを止めていたわけでもなく、仕事等
時間の都合で、結果的に止まってしまっていた。
ごくたま に 「そういえば、しばらくブログが止まっているな・・・」と、気づくときもあった。
そして、 「このままやめてしまおうか・・・」と思ったこともあった。
とにかく、睡眠や休息の時間を削ってまで書くほどのことでもないので、放っておいた次第。
しかし、この時勢で仕事が減り、少しずつヒマになってきている。
幸か不幸か、ブログを書く時間がつくれるようになっているわけ。
はたして、今更、これを読んでくれる人がいるのかどうかわからないけど、この“ヒマ人のヒマつぶし”に立ち止まってくれる人がいたら、細やかに嬉しい。
基本的 に “ 相変わらず ” やっている私だけど、困ったこともあった。
昨秋、プライベートで大変な目に遭った。
それは、身近な人間の大病。
仕事も休めず、心身の疲労が重なり、情緒不安定な状態に陥ってしまった。
それが一段落ついたかと思った矢先、今冬、仕事で大変な目に遭った。
これもまた、身近な人間の大病。
「 少しゆっくりさせてもらおうか・・・」と思っていた矢先の急病で、仕事はテンテコ舞。
休んでいるヒマはなく、夜、寝ている間にも仕事のことを考えているような始末だった。
そして、今、プライベート・仕事、両方で大変な目に遭っている。
そう・・・この新型コロナウイルスの問題だ。
二月の時点では完全に他人事。
自分には関係ない、どこか遠くの出来事のように捉えていた。
三月になると、発生地が身近なところにまで迫ってきて、少しは自分の問題として捉えるようになってきた。
連日、コロナのニュースが踊り、飲食業・観光業・レジャー業などの苦境が多く伝えられるようになってきた。
それでもまだ 、 “ 他人事 ” のような感覚は残っていた 。
が、三月下旬になると、身近なところの様相も一変。
業界や取引先に影響が及んできて、仕事が減る兆候が見え始めてきたのだ。
それはそうだ 。
私の仕事は、生活を維持するうえで不可欠なものではない。
製造・食品・物流・医療等とは関わりがなく、有事の際の社会貢献度も極めて低い。
更に、遊興快楽的な要素も健康に資する要素もなく、人々に元気をもたらすものでもない。
災難の真っ只中では、まず必要とされない。
近隣から苦情がでるような腐乱死体現場なら緊急性・必要性が高いけど、肌寒いくらいのこの時季はそれもない。
したがって、仕事が減っていくのもうなずける。
ただ 、 “ コロナ消毒 ” の問い合わせは増えてきている
不動産管理会社やマンション管理組合等が、感染が発生した場合を想定した上での事前準備として。
これだけは、この時勢でニーズがあるわけだ。
が、対象の規模が大き過ぎたり、求められるクオリティが高過ぎたりすることも多く、机上の想定だけで安易に契約するのは危険。
また、施工者（当社）のリスク管理の問題もある。
一人でも感染したら、そこで営業中止になるわけだから、一つの依頼でも売上利益だけ見るのではなく、大局的・長期的・客観的に見て判断することが必要なのである。
かと言って、多くの人達と同様、私も収入がなければ生活を維持できない。
つまり、仕事がなければ・・・働かなければ生きていけない。
事態がこのまま深刻化していけば、仕事を選ぶ余裕はなくなってくるはず。
大袈裟な言い方になるけど、生きていくために命を懸けてコロナ消毒をする日がくるかもしれない（今、最前線で闘っている医療従事者に比べれば、“子供のお遊び”みたいなものかもしれないけど・・・）。
こんな状況になって、今、 「 失業」という文字が “ 心構え ” として頭に浮かんでいる。
加齢や体力が理由の退職なら想定内のことだけど、この事態はまったく想定外。
説得力のある論拠で、事態の収束時期を具体的に示せる専門家も現れていない。
「 なるようにしかならない 」 「何とかなる」等と、根拠なく楽観視できるほど、事は小さくない。
現場仕事がなくなれば仕方がない。
この状態が長引けば、失業 の “ 心構え ” は “ 覚悟 ” に変わっていき、いず れ “ 現実 ” となってしまう 。
似たような境遇にある人はごまんといる。
とてもイヤなことを言うようだけど、この先、感染者や死亡者だけでなく、失業者・破産者も増えていくだろう。
悲しいことながら、自殺者も増えていくかもしれない。
察してもらえる通り、私の仕事は“ 在宅勤務 ” ができるものではないし、在宅勤務で給料が得られるものでもない。
在宅勤務を拡大解釈しても、我が家は、特殊清掃が必要なほど汚れてはいないし、ゴミ屋敷でもない。
死人もいないし、死体もない（当り前！）。
ブログ制作くらいは家にいてもできるけど、これは仕事（給料がもらえるもの）ではない。
で、今のところ、現場仕事がない日でもフレックスタイムで出退社している。
まだ、いくらかはやらなければいけない事務作業や雑用があるから。
もちろん、事務所で は “ 三密 ” にならないよう・ ・ ・ “ 一密 ” もつくらないよう細心の注意をはらい、外出の際もかなり気をつけている。
「 三密回避」の警告が出されて久しい。
更に、 「緊急事態宣言」が出されていることは、承知のとおり。
同時に “ 外出自粛要請 ” も出されている 。
自分だけの問題じゃ済まされないから、ある種の社会的責任も発生している。
しかし、普段から私 は “ 外出自粛 ” をしているようなもの 。
友達もなく非社交的、外食をはじめ 外で飲むこともほとんどない。
誰かに遊びに誘われることもなく、趣味や同好会等のグループにも属していない。
結果、 “ 外出自粛要請 ” の前後で、生活スタイルにほとんど変化はない。
変わったことといえば、マスクや消毒剤を常用するようになったことと、ウォーキングや買い物の際、人との距離を意識するようになったことくらい。
それも、日に日に神経過敏になってきていて、不用意に誰かに近づかれると“イラッ！”とくるようになってしまっている（きれいな女性に近づかれて“ イラッ！” とくるかどうかは不明）。
外出自粛で家にいると、特にやることがなく、スマホやＰＣをいじりながら、暇な一日を過ごしている人も多そう。
ＳＮＳ が高度に活用されている今日この頃、大衆に重用さて重宝されているよう。
反面、私は、普段、YouTubeを観ることはないし、Twitterとうヤツもやったことがない。
“ 時代おく れ ” は重々承知しているけど、興味がないから積極的に触れることもない。
ただ、多くの著名人がそれらを通じて、励ましや癒しの音楽やメッセージ・パフォーマンスを発信しているのを、ＴＶニュースを通して目にしている。
発信側の芸能人やアーティスト・アスリートにとっては、これも
ある種のビジネス、または、先を見越したビジネスの種蒔きなのかもしれないけど、個人的にはシックリこない。
人を励ますことができる人は、まだ、余裕がある人。
新型コロナウイルス被災民は、“ まだ余裕がある人 ” と“ もう余裕がない 人 ” に分かれると思う 。
つまり、 「被災民の中にも階層がうまれ、温度差がうまれている」ということ。
そして、残念ながら、これは、時間が経ては経つほどハッキリとした型を成していくと思われる。
真に追い詰められた人は人を励ます余裕はなく、自分と家族を維持していく力さえ奪われている。
そういった発信者達の善意に目を向けられないほど気力を失い、素直に受け止められないほど疲弊し、絶望し、苦悩しているような気がする。
真に追い詰められている人にとって、角度によっては“ 他人事 ” “ お遊 び ” “ お祭り騒 ぎ ” にも見えるそれらの発信は、 “ 癒 し ” “ 励まし ” にはならず、冷淡に神経を逆なですることにもなりかねない。
もちろん、それらを 「偽善 」 「不要」と言っているわけではない。
善意であるだろうし、そういう発信を欲し、それで、癒され・励まされている人も多いだろう。
私のように、能書きだけ垂れて何の人助けもしない輩よりよっぽどいい。
ただ、被災民の中でも、崖っぷちに立たされている“弱被災民”がいることに心を寄せることも人間同士の礼儀ではないかと思う。
善意の押し売りは、結果的に、悪意に似たものとなる可能性があるのだから。
善意だったかもしれないマスクの高額転売も悪意と見なされ、表面上、今はネットからも消えている。
それが拍車をかけたわけでもないのだろうけど、マスクはもちろん、消毒剤の類も、相変わらず手に入れにくい。
街のあちこちにあるドラッグストアには、朝から長蛇の列ができている。
今のところ、自分達で使うくらいのマスク・消毒剤は確保できているから、私は
そこまでの購買行動はしていない。
しかし、このままの状態が続けば、そのうち、朝ドラ（朝のドラッグストア）デビューしなければならない日がくるかもしれない。
ま、早起きは得意だし、開店までボーッとつっ立ってるだけのことだから、難しいことではない。
難しいのは、手間暇かけてもマスクが手に入らなかったときに、自分の感情を理性的にコントロールすること。
“ 溜まっていく一方の不満・ストレスをどう解消していくか”だろう。
事実、コロナ問題が原因で、家庭不和・ＤＶが増えているらしい。
「 コロナ離婚」という言葉まで出現している。
この災難は、健康や経済だけにとどまらず、人間的にも多くのマイナスをもたらしている。
しかし、何かしらのプラスを得られないわけではないと思う。
残念ながら、多くの人間は、失わなくても気づくことができる知恵を持ち合わせていない。
与えられている平和を当り前のことのように、手にしている恩恵を当り前のもののように勘違いして生きている。
失ってみて 多くのことに初めて気づき、初めて気づかされる。
こうした困難に遭ってこそ気づかされる大切な何か、苦難に遭ってこそ学ばされる大切な何か、災難に遭ってこそ養われる・練られる大切な何かがある。
もともと、人は、そ の “ 何か ” の種をもって生まれてくる 。
例えば、日常では影を潜めている家族愛や友情、無視している健康や寿命、衰弱している忍耐力や自制心、目をそむけている正義感や道徳心、遠ざけている使命感や責任感・・・
そういった、人が、ただの獣ではなく、人であるが故に大切にすべきものが、暗い土中から “ 芽 ” を出してくるのではないだろうか。
不安は大きい・・・将来に大きな不安を抱えている。
それでも、変わりなく時間は流れている。
この先も、望まない事態、逃げたくなるような出来事は起こるだろう。
ただ、今の苦境を楽境に、逆境を順境に反転させるのは、その “ 芽 ” 。
その芽は、今生で花を咲かせることはできないかもしれない、実をみのらせることはできないかもしれない。
また、人間がもつ愚弱な性質によって、途中で枯れてしまうかもしれない。
しかし、子や孫に、友や縁もゆかりもない若者に、次の世代・新しい時代に、歴史や教訓としてつないで花を咲かせ実をみのらせることはできる。
先の大戦による死苦痛悩悲哀が、今の平和の礎となっているように。
そのための人生、そのための生き方でも、生きる理由と価値は充分に見いだせるのではないだろうか。
生きていくのが面倒臭く思えるくらい、不満の芽・不安の芽が次々と出てくる昨今。
悪い意味での非日常に、気分も沈みがち。
それでも、希望の種はある。
どうあがいても、私の人生、あと もう少し 。
これから、自分の人生がどのように展開していくのか、想像を超えた人生が待っているのではないか、ほんの少しは楽しみに思える瞬間がある。
それは、これまで幾度も「死にたい！」と思ってしまうようなことがあったけど、結局のところ生かされてきたことを思い出し、また今、こうして生かされていることを覚えるとき。
同じように、この先も、この命が尽きるまでは生かしてもらえるだろうと思うと、一寸先の闇に一筋の光が射し、希望の芽を導いてくれるのである。

What Sun Tzu Would Say
Computer security practitioners love to quote Sun Tzu .
I have no idea why , other than that he wrote many profound statements of the obvious , and security is really pretty much obvious stuff .
My favorite quote from Sun Tzu regarding computer security is from his lost scrolls , which were written and subsequently pawned for services at a local massage parlor in 1750 BC .
They have never resurfaced , so the translation I am using is of questionable provenance .
It appears to be the result of a machine - translation from an early website .
The Tale of Wise Master Sun and the Prince 's Patching Policy
It happened that The Prince of Wu was reading a bunch of Master Sun 's USENET postings and concluded that Master Sun was wise in the way of strategy .
Sending his bannermen forth , he offered Master Sun a golden Ipod in return for a brief consulting visit in which The Master was to assess Prince Wu's Patching Policy .
Prince
Wu had been to numerous security conferences , and subscribed to the daily scrolls from Master SANS , and spent 3 hours per day meditating to achieve Security Focus - he was sure that Master Sun would be impressed with his efforts and would position him well in the Magic Quadrant of visionaries .
The day came when Master Sun came to audit Prince Wu's fortifications and Patching Policy .
Alighting from his palanquin , which was carried by mighty slaves , Master Sun sniffed the air and quickly observed to the attentive Prince Wu :
If you are fighting a losing battle , it is likely one of three things :
a) You are continuing a trend in a losing war - and therefore should not be surprised
b ) You have chosen to fight the wrong battle
c ) You are stupid
Master Sun cocked an eyebrow , " which applies here ? "
Then he pocketed the golden Ipod , packetized himself back into his palanquin , and went home .
Prince
Wu fell to his knees , enlightened , had his Internet - facing servants all put to death , and never installed another patch in all his days .
OK , Joking aside , let me ask you a serious question : if patching has n't been working , why are we still doing it ?
It Feels So Good When I Stop
I recently got a call from a security journalist who wanted my recommendations for the " Best Practices " in system patching .
I explained patiently to Prince Wu , uh , urr , the journalist , that I do n't patch my systems at all .
My home file server is still running OpenBSD from 5 years ago ( and it works fine ) and my Solaris machine is running some ancient version that is compatible with some of the development software I rely on .
I pretty much set my network up , and do n't screw with it .
In return , it pretty much just works unless a cable jiggles loose or the dogs chew on something .
Somehow , the computer security industry has become addicted to patching systems - a process that is fundamentally doomed to failure .
As Prince
Wu realized when Master Sun enlightened him , patching is an endless losing battle that we 're stupid to engage in .
So what 's going on ?
Patching , as it's being practiced today by security practitioners , is basically the security equivalent of a fad diet .
It 's a tremendously expensive and painful palliative that is undertaken instead of doing something simple and obvious - namely :
Run software that does not suck
Absolutely minimize Internet - facing services
In the typical fad diet , the dieter engages in all kinds of weird and expensive eating habits that presumably allow them to avoid the basic reality that if you eat less , you 'll lose weight - the successful fad diets are the ones that manipulate the dieter into eating less ( or eating things that are less efficiently metabolized ) so that they achieve the same results ( i.e. : they are eating less ) without realizing they are eating less .
For example , eating Atkins " bread " made out of hard - to - metabolize recycled plaster and sawdust allows you to eat " all you want " - except that you wo n't want very much of that garbage .
So you 'll sneak a real bagel once a month - which is probably a good intake rate for bagels anyhow .
Why not cut to the chase and just eat one bagel a month ?
That 'd require discipline but it'd save you a lot of money sunk on expensive awful - tasting food from multi-mega diet food conglomerates .
Rather than running software that does not suck , why not run the same crud that everyone else is running , and spend one full - time engineer on upgrading it every week ?
Hmmm ...
That sounds like a great strategy except it does n't work .
So you put yourself on the patch treadmill and sink all these costs into chasing the latest mostly - works version , and you 're still going to get clobbered by the next big worm that comes along and exploits a vulnerability that you and your 1.6 million peers currently have installed .
If you 're a good patch addict , you 'll have the patch installed nearly immediately - unlike me - and your window of exposure will be hours instead of days or even years .
But the problem is that you 'll still be exposed for a while .
It might be too long .
Me ?
I 'm not exposed to IIS bugs because I do n't run IIS .
I 'm not exposed to IE bugs because I do n't run IE .
I 'm not exposed to Outlook bugs because I do n't run Outlook .
2 years ago Lance Spitzner and I were teaching a class at SANS and people started getting up and bolting for the door .
Even Lance looked worried .
A new vulnerability had been found in SSHd and suddenly everyone had to run and compile a new version and install it on their most crucial systems - or else .
We called a break and everyone fixed their systems except for me : I do n't run SSHd .
I 'm not exposed to SSHd bugs .
Do you detect a pattern here ?
Patching shows an acceptance that the administrator has not solved the problem - it shows an acceptance that you have signed up for an endless war that you cannot win .
Master
Sun might say it indicates you are stupid or , at the very least , hammered into stupidity by the constant stream of vulnerabilities in mission critical software .
It should be pretty obvious that constantly upgrading mission critical software is a bad idea from a systems reliability standpoint , too .
The Tale of Wise Master Sun and the Production Network
Master Sun was visiting with his friend Willow Blossom , who ran a mission critical network for a large E - commerce site .
Blossom complained , " I hate software these days ; I cannot trust that my system will work from one day to the next because code is so buggy .
I am losing sleep , and my hair is falling out . "
Master Sun opined that this was tragic because Willow Blossom 's hair was a gorgeous cascade of deep black - as black and shiny and deep as a null device on a spring morning .
He bowed and excused himself , and asked for an audience with Prince Ciao ( pronounced " Cee Eye Oh " ) who was lord of Willow Blossom 's castle .
He took a brush , and on the floor of the audience chamber wrote in ink :
1 ) Set up the production systems
2 ) Make them work
3 ) Test them
4 ) While true ; do
If they are working ; Continue ; Endif
If they are not working ; GOTO 2 ; Endif
5 ) Done
Prince Ciao studied Master Sun 's writing for weeks even to the point of missing his golf games , and was finally enlightened .
He summoned Willow Blossom and explained Tzu's wisdom , then had her head and its beautiful hair mounted on a stick in the NOC as an example to the others , even though it was his own policy that Willow install patches as fast as they came from the vendors .
The next time Master Sun was invited to the castle , he politely declined .
During the 90's we were assaulted with a welter of products , the majority of which were half - assed and largely useless .
And during that time , because Prince Ciao read all the marketing literature and WIRED magazine , network and system administrators were forced or " encouraged " to field beta - test code at an absolutely insane rate .
The mainframe programmers of the 70's and 80's used to write of a practice called " Change Control " - in which production systems were managed with care and forethought .
During the late 90's the last of the Change Control believers were taken out and shot , and their cubicles were given to the consultants who were there to mark everything up in XML in order to make everything better in some manner nobody understands yet .
During that time , security practitioners were forced to repeatedly bend over and grip their ankles by business units that had already spent good money on bad products so by golly they were going to field them because otherwise Prince Ciao would have their heads .
Of course nobody wanted to admit that .
In 2000 I was Prince Ciao for a small start - up .
Our sales VP went over my head to the CEO and bought the company Seibel 's sales / customer management tool at the incredibly low price of only $ 500,000 .
Of course , it required 3 consultants working for 9 months to learn that it actually needed 5 consultants working for 12 months to make it work .
I began to sharpen my stake .
The icing on the cake was the discovery that Seibel required the use of Internet Explorer in order to function properly .
Guess what happened ?
Explorer went in , of course .
Where was Master Sun when I needed him ?
I truly believe that the patching fad in which we are currently living is not going to last much longer .
It can't .
In another couple years , we 'll have one full - time patcher to each system administrator .
What 's odd is that if companies simply exercised a bit of discipline , it would n't be necessary at all .
Back in 1996 a buddy of mine and I set up a web server for a high - traffic significant target .
It was not the Whitehouse ; it was a porn site .
We invested 8 hours ( of our customer 's money ) writing a small web server daemon that knew how to serve up files , cache them , and virtualize filenames behind hashes .
It ran chrooted on a version of UNIX that was very minimized and had code hacked right into the IP stack to toss traffic that was not TCP aimed at port 80 .
10 years later , it 's still working , has never been hacked , and has never been patched .
If you compute the Return On Investment ( Or ROI in the language of Prince Ciao ) it 's gigantic .
A client of mine works for a fairly large bank , which bought an E - banking app from a 3rd party .
The E - banking app required months and months of HTML development , consulting , and customization before they could put it into test .
When they were well into their testing , they hired me to come look at it and I was horrified to discover that the app ( which cost $ 400,000 ) ran on an old version of NT , and required use of an old version of Microsoft IIS .
When I got onto some con-calls with the provider they explained that my client could protect the NT server " with a firewall " and that they were focused on providing connectivity , not security : that was left as an exercise for their customer .
It went live , of course , but only after tons more money was spent on remediation for what was fundamentally a poor choice of tools .
What was the ROI on this project ?
I do n't want to think about it .
Somehow , Prince Ciao has convinced himself that " Off The Shelf Software " is good while " Custom " software is bad .
What Prince Ciao does n't understand is that that thing consultants do is called " customization " and by the time you 've configured it with a lot of firewalls , patches , and 10,000 other fixes and hot - swaps it 's not exacly " off the shelf " software anymore .
We need to challenge the conventional wisdom , for that 's what patching has become .
Organizations insist on fielding software that should not be fielded , and their justification for fielding it is " we can patch it to the point where it 's OK to field it . "
But there is no amount of patching that is sufficient to make some of this stuff Internet - worthy .
If we 're still fighting that battle 5 years from now , we 're stupid .
It 's the wrong battle .
The battle we need to be fighting is against the concept of using crappy software for mission critical apps .
Someone needs to look at the ROI of a complete lifecycle of " write it and forget it " software versus " light it up and patch it forever " junkware .
Then , the beheadings will begin .
The Adriatic is among the worst affected coastal areas
More than 90 % of coastal life has declined and there is widespread degradation of water quality .
Scientists studied 12 estuarine and coastal regions in Europe , North America and Australia from the onset of human settlement until today .
Their findings , reported in Science , suggest that 20th Century conservation efforts have had only limited success .
A team from nine research centres in the US , Canada , Australia and Panama used archaeological , historical and ecological records to study the human footprint on coasts and estuaries over the past 2,500 years .
The group found that depletion of natural resources began during Roman times , then accelerated in Medieval times and in the wake of European settlement in North America and Australia .
' Forgotten resource '
Many of the biggest declines were seen from 1900 to 1950 and 1950 to 2000 as populations grew and industry boomed .
REGIONS STUDIED W Baltic Sea Wadden Sea N Adriatic Sea Southern Gulf St Lawrence Outer Bay of Fundy Massachusetts Bay Delaware Bay Chesapeake Bay Pamlico Sound Galveston Bay San Francisco Bay Moreton Bay
Most were depleted by 1900 and declined further by 1950 .
Fish such as salmon , sturgeon , tuna , cod and sardines were quick to follow , with shellfish such as mussels only recently becoming the targets of expanding fisheries .
Plant life has also suffered badly , with 67 % of wetlands , 65 % of sea grasses and 48 % of other aquatic vegetation lost through disease , destruction or direct exploitation .
" Throughout history , estuaries and coastal seas have played a critical role in human development as a source of ocean life , habitat for most of our commercial fish catch , a resource for our economy , and a buffer against natural disasters , " said lead researcher Heike Lotze of Dalhousie University , Halifax , Canada .
" Yet , these once rich and diverse areas are a forgotten resource .
" Compared to other ocean ecosystems such as coral reefs , they have received little attention in the press and are not on the national policy agenda .
" Sadly , we have simply accepted their slow degradation . "
The researchers say conservation efforts in the 20th Century have led to partial recovery of 12 % of the species .
Some - such as seals , otters , birds , crocodiles and alligators - have done well ; but others such as large whales , sea turtles , manatees and dugongs remain at low levels .

GAZA CITY , Gaza ( CNN ) --
Two
Fox journalists kidnapped by militants two weeks ago in Gaza and freed appeared to be in good health as they embraced family and co-workers in an emotional reunion .
Fox reporter Steve Centanni and photographer Olaf Wiig were released shortly after noon Sunday and dropped off at the Beach Hotel in Gaza City , where they were greeted by a swarm of people offering hugs .
The hotel is a popular place for journalists .
The two men later crossed into Israel and left for Jerusalem .
The Palestinian government had condemned the kidnapping and the men's families pleaded publicly for their release .
( Watch as freed journalists prepare to cross into Israel -- 1:52 )
Hours before their release , a video on the Palestinian news service Ramattan TV showed the two reading statements proclaiming they had converted to Islam .
But the two later explained they had done so at gunpoint , and that the conversion was not real .
Centanni spoke to Fox News Network immediately after his release .
" I'm a little emotional because this is overwhelming , but I 'm really fine , healthy , in good shape , " he said .
" Somebody did the right thing somewhere because here I am , and I must first off thank everybody for their support and for all the work that this team here has done , " he said .
" My family and friends , I understand , have been very helpful . "
( Watch Centanni and Wiig 's first moments of freedom -- :59 )
Centanni and Wiig were snatched off the streets on August 14 by masked gunmen and held by a previously unknown group calling itself the Holy Jihad Brigades .
" We were driving down a narrow side street in Gaza City and there was a car stopped in front of us , " Centanni said .
" Before we realized what kind of car had stopped , four masked gunmen came over . "
Centanni said he and Wiig were shoved into a small Toyota and their captors draped black hoods over their heads before speeding away .
" That was the beginning of our torment that night , " he said .
A spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Interior , Khaled Abu Hilal , said the journalists ' release " is the payoff of the continuous efforts from different Palestinian sides to secure their safety and release . "
Hilal did not provide details on the process of their release but did confirm the Palestinian Authority will secure their exit from Gaza .
Palestinian Interior Minister Saed Sayyam said at a news conference , " There is a promise that similar actions would not be happening again , " although he did not say who made that promise .
" Regarding the issue of specifying the identity of the kidnappers , that is to be investigated by the Palestinian government , " he said .
" Our main concern at the beginning was to secure their release and not to put obstacles in front of those who were involved to solve this case . "
He added , " Whoever was the side responsible and whatever political backgrounds were standing behind it -- this is absolutely rejected .
It is the responsibility of the security forces to investigate . "
The journalists thanked British and U.S. officials and praised Palestinian officials for helping secure their release .
( Watch freed journalists speak after release -- 4:24 )
" I just hope this never scares a single journalist away from coming to Gaza to cover this story because the Palestinian people are very beautiful , kind - hearted loving people who the world needs to know more about , " said Centanni at a brief news conference .
Wiig echoed those remarks .
" That would be a great tragedy for the people of Palestine and especially for the people of Gaza .
Your story does n't get very well told because it is difficult to work here and anything that -- any little discouragement -- an incident like this could give a network an excuse not to be here and that would be a great tragedy for the people of Gaza , " he said .
In Kennebunkport , Maine , President Bush was informed by senior staff about the developments .
" The president is pleased the journalists were released and will soon be reunited with their entire families and colleagues , " said White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino .
The initial condition for release was that all Muslim prisoners " in the jails of America " be released .
The United States refused to offer concessions to their demands , keeping with its long - standing policy .
Pressure had mounted from Palestinians for the kidnappers to release the journalists .
A Palestinian prisoners ' rights group said that even Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails asked the kidnappers to release the journalists immediately and unconditionally .

Halcyon Days : Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Game Programmers was released as a commercial product in March 1997 .
It was one of the first retrogaming projects to focus on lost history rather than game collecting , and certainly the first entirely devoted to the game authors themselves .
Now a good number of the interviewees have their own web sites , but none of them did when I started contacting them in 1995 .
And it was an early experiment in digital publishing : though the book used HTML for formatting , it was shipped to readers on a 3 ½ " diskette for a price of $ 20 .
In 1997 this seemed odd and gutsy , but the little collection of interviews found an audience and sold a good many copies for the next five years .
It was twice written up in Wired News , and was quoted or mentioned in The Dallas Morning News , The Austin Chronicle , and other major newspapers .
It was paired with Susan Lammers 's wonderful Programmers at Work on a disc in the Dr. Dobb 's CD - ROM library .
It is now 2002 and Halcyon Days has run its commercial course .
I 'm putting it on the web because I still think the information in the book is fantastic and inspiring , and because much of it can not be found elsewhere .
The contents and HTML have been minimally edited from the original , which is why the filenames are in all capitals , for example .
But enough rambling .
If you have any of the giddy anticipation that I did whenever I picked up a magazine containing an interview with Mark Turmell or Dan Bunten , then you want to start reading .

It can sometimes seem like there are two competing ways to make a decision about any complex matter of evidence based medicine .
One is to purchase and digest â€ œHow to Read a Paper : The Basics of Evidence - Based Medicine â€ by Professor Trisha Greenhalgh ( BMA Books , a life changing experience if you have a week to spare ) , and then find , read , and critically appraise every single published academic study independently and in full for yourself .
The other more common method is to rely on â€œexpertsâ€ , or what I like to call â€œprejudiceâ€ .
But there is a third way : what we might call â€ œEvidence Based Prejudiceâ€ .
I canâ€™t possibly debunk every single alternative therapy column you will ever read : but if I could show that their single most popular claim has no foundation , then you could safely ignore everything else they say , thus saving valuable brain energy , and freeing up extra time for you to write best - selling novels and eradicate world poverty .
And so to antioxidants .
The basic claim of the alternative therapy industry is as follows : free radicals in the body are bad , but antioxidants neutralise free radicals ; people who eat vegetables with antioxidants in them live longer , therefore antioxidant tablets are good .
Now this â€œfree - radicals - bad antioxidants - goodâ€ morality tale looks great on paper : but if youâ€™re going to read a biochemistry textbook and pull bits out at random , you can prove anything you like .
For example , my phagocytic cells build a wall around invading pathogens and then use free radicals â€ “ amongst other things – to kill the bacteria off , before the bacteria kill me .
Theyâ€™re probably doing it right now , somewhere in here .
So do I need free radical supplements to help me fight infections ?
Sounds plausible .
You can see , now , how I could make some serious money if I ever turned to the dark side ( alternative therapists , why not just pick some more chemicals at random from Stryer Biochemistry , 5th Ed. ) .
Of course the â€œantioxidants goodâ€ story didnâ€™t come entirely out of the blue : it came , like almost all the evidence on diet and health , from observational studies .
People who eat well , with plenty of fruit and vegetables in their diet , tend to live longer , healthier lives .
But these are observational studies , not intervention studies .
These are not studies where you take a few thousand people and make them eat salad .
These are surveys , looking at people who already have healthy diets : people like me , and since youâ€ ™re asking , I also cycle to work , get a good nightâ€™s sleep , have a fairly comfortable lifestyle , a stable relationship , and a plausible career .
People like me do live longer ( thanks for asking ) but itâ€™s not just the antioxidants in our rocket salad .
So what happens , then , when people do big studies , forcing people to eat salad ?
Well itâ€™s not an easy thing to do , if only because itâ€™s difficult to get people to eat what you tell them , and measure what they eat , and check if theyâ€™re truthful , and so on : the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial in the 1970s was probably the single biggest medical project ever undertaken , it took 12,866 men , advised them , monitored them , cajoled them , persuaded them , followed them up for a decade , and found little benefit from dietary change .
Intervention trials for diet have continued , since then , to produce negative results .
Maybe theyâ€™re technically too difficultâ€ ¦
But what about vitamin tablets ?
Theyâ€™re easy to study , in the sense that itâ€™s easy to take a tablet – easier than changing your whole food lifestyle – easy to find a placebo control for , and so on .
And there have been innumerable studies , and systematic reviews of those studies , and meta - analyses of those studies , and they have found no benefit for antioxidants .
A meta-analysis â€ “ a mathematical combination of lots of smaller studies to give one larger and more accurate answer – of 15 studies , a total of over 200,000 patients , being followed up for between 1 and 12 years , found no benefit for cardiovascular outcomes .
The current Cochrane Review on antioxidants and bowel cancer had just as many patients , and again found no benefit for the pills .
That must be the single most prevalent claim of the whole alternative therapy industry : and it is in stark contradiction of the experience of hundreds of thousands of individuals who have been carefully studied in these trials , examining the very advice the alternative therapy industry is giving .
If they canâ€™t get that one thing right , why would you listen to them on anything else ?

Brain size matters for intellectual ability and bigger is better , McMaster University researchers have found .
The study , led by neuroscientist Sandra Witelson , a professor in the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine , and published in the December issue of the journal Brain , has provided some of the clearest evidence on the underlying basis of differences in intelligence .
The study involved testing of intelligence in 100 neurologically normal , terminally ill volunteers , who agreed that their brains be measured after death .
It found bigger is better , but there are differences between women and men .
In women , verbal intelligence was clearly correlated with brain size , accounting for 36 percent of the verbal IQ score .
In men , this was true for right - handers only , indicating that brain asymmetry is a factor in men .
Spatial intelligence was also correlated with brain size in women , but less strongly .
In men , spatial ability was not related to overall brain size .
These results suggest that women may use verbal strategies in spatial thinking , but that in men , verbal and spatial thinking are more distinct .
It may be that the size or structure of the localized brain regions which underlie spatial skills in men is related to spatial intelligence , as was shown in previous research in Witelson 's lab on the brain of Albert Einstein .

In a further sex difference , brain size decreased with age in men over the age span of 25 to 80 years , but age hardly affected brain size in women .
It is not known what protective factors , which could be genetic , hormonal or environmental , operate in women .
It remains to be determined what the contribution of nature and nurture are to this cerebral size relationship with intelligence , Witelson said .
She added that the results point to the need for responsibility in considering the likely future use of magnetic imaging ( or MRIs ) of brain structure as a measure of ability in student and workforce settings .
" We 're going to need to be careful if , in the future , we use MRI brain scans as a measure of ability in any selection process , " she said .

The future is in South Korea
Smart investments in broadband there have paid off in the form of a hyperconnected society -- here 's how we can start reaping the benefits .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Business 2.0 Magazine ) - I , for one , welcome our South Korean overlords .
Ninety percent of the country has blazingly fast , 3 - megabits - per - second broadband at home , and similarly high - speed wireless connections on the road .
The telecom market is fiercely competitive , and broadband service costs the consumer less than $ 20 a month .
There are 20,000 PC baangs , or Internet cafes , where you can rent a superfast machine for $ 1 an hour .
Online gaming has become a way of life , with nearly 3,000 South Korean videogame companies boasting combined revenues of up to $ 4 billion .
As a result , South Korea has become the world 's best laboratory for broadband services - and a place to look to for answers on how the Internet business may evolve .
Smart bet on broadband
How did this come about ?
In 1995 , the South Korean government made what must rank as one of the most shrewd and far - sighted investments in business history .
It spent big on a nationwide high - capacity broadband network that any telecom operator could offer service on , and offered subsidies so that 45 million Koreans could buy cheap PC's .
Cost : a mere $ 1.5 billion .
Fast - forward 11 years : Korea is now the most connected and Net - addicted country on Earth .
There are a few American companies who have benefited from the South Korean broadband boom : Blizzard , for example , makes a popular online game called Starcraft which is so widely played in South Korea that two TV channels broadcast Starcraft matches between professional players .
But the most popular services are homegrown .
Cyworld , for example , is a social network owned by a subsidiary of SK Telecom , the country 's largest wireless provider .
To an American eye , the Cyworld service looks like a mixture of some of the hottest US properties : it 's MySpace meets Flickr and Blogger and AIM and Second Life .
Users have avatars that visit and can link to each other 's " minihompy " - a miniature homepage that 's actually a 3 - D room containing a users ' blog , photos , and virtual items for sale .
Cyworld 's digital garage sales include music , ringtones , clothes for your avatar and furnishings for your own minihompy .
Cyworld has penetration rates that would make Rupert Murdoch , CEO of MySpace parent News Corp. ( Research ) , green with envy :
An astonishing 90 percent of South Koreans in their 20s use the service .
Celebrities and politicians set up their own minihompies , and the way to get ahead in twentysomething Korean society is to found a popular Cyworld club , or chat room .
Printing money
Most importantly , Cyworld is a license to print money .
The service itself is free ( and available on cellphones as well as online ) , but to buy all the extras - like ringtones and virtual furnishings - will cost you " acorns , " the service 's virtual currency .
Cyworld sells its users $ 300,000 in acorns every single day .
With such a proven revenue stream , Cyworld is expanding fast .
It launched in China and Japan last year , and a US launch is slated for later this year .
Some might dismiss it as a Korean novelty , but all of Cyworld 's elements , individually , have been successful on these shores .
And teens and twentysomethings who use social networks tend not to have much brand loyalty to one service if another offers cooler features .
SK Telecom 's ace in the hole is its experience with running a social network on mobile devices .
" Every social network is going to have to have a mobile component over the next year , " predicts Jill Aldort , an analyst at Yankee Group .
" It gives more stickiness to the service .
There 's going to be a social networking fatigue factor - users need novelty .
And Cyworld clearly has more functionality than MySpace . "
Whether or not Cyworld succeeds in the U.S. , South Korea is going to continue aggressively targeting American Internet users .
Its government has set a target of $ 1 billion a year in online game exports by 2007 .
NCSoft , the company that runs Korea 's most popular multiplayer online role - playing game , Lineage , has found a string of successes in the U.S. by learning quickly what Americans love : its City of Heroes and City of Villains online games were both number one hits here .
Lost in translation ?
To be sure , there is much about South Korean culture that does n't translate well .
The country 's love of cuteness is a little too saccharine for American tastes .
And part of Cyworld 's success can be chalked up to users ' incessant message - swapping - not answering a missive from a friend with all due speed is considered a faux - pas in Korean society .
There is a chance that the rise of broadband and the rise of online gaming will not be so interlinked on this side of the Pacific ( though the runaway success of World of Warcraft suggests otherwise ) .
There 's a chance that US social networkers may prefer a stripped - down service with no avatars , bells or whistles .
But do n't forget that US wireless operators used to dismiss Japanese advances in mobile phones in much the same way .
Do users really want to send text messages , watch video on their phones , or buy ringtones , they mused , or is that something peculiar to Japan ?
Well , as it turned out , they do , and companies that bet early on the notion that technology can cross cultural boundaries , like Sprint Nextel ( Research ) and Cingular , won out .
So think twice before ignoring what 's going on in Seoul .
That shrewd government investment a decade ago may just have created a broadband hothouse that can give us a glimpse of the Internet culture 's future .

Vesna Vulovic
On January 26 , 1972 , a 22 - year - old flight attendant named Vesna Vulovic was not where she was supposed to be .
She was cruising at 33,330 feet above Czechoslovakia ( now Czech Republic ) in a DC - 9 airplane , but her schedule had been mixed up with that of another stewardess named Vesna , and she was subsequently placed on the wrong flight .
But Vesna was happy for the mistake ; it afforded her the opportunity to see Denmark , and to stay in a Sheraton Hotel , which she had always dreamed of doing .
But the mix up was not so fortuitous as it seemed .
A terrorist group known as Ustashe had placed a powerful explosive on this particular plane .
The Ustache was a far - right nazi / fascist group in Croatia which was implicated in over two dozen terrorist attacks against Yugoslavia after World War 2 .
Vesna ’s flight , JAT Yugoslav Flight 364 , was with an airline based in Yugoslavia .
While passing over the city of Srbska - Kamenice , the explosive device detonated .
The DC - 9 was torn into pieces , and the plane ’s wreckage , along with its 28 passengers , fell through the sky for three long minutes before striking a frozen mountainside .
A German man , upon arriving at the crash site , found all of the plane ’s passengers dead , save one .
Vesna was lying half outside of the plane , with another crew member ’s body on top of her , and a serving cart pinned against her spine .
The man had been a medic in the second world war , and did what he could for her until further help arrived .
At the hospital , her parents were told that although there was still life in her body , she would not survive .
Her skull was broken and hemorrhaging , both of her legs were broken , and she had three crushed vertebrae .
But three days later , she awoke from her coma , and asked for a cigarette .
Vesna was paralyzed from the waist down , but she was alive and conscious .
Two weeks after the accident , her doctor told her what had happened , and gave her a newspaper to read the story , but the memory of this event would escape her , as did everything from one hour before the accident to one month after , due to amnesia .
Later , she underwent surgery that restored movement to her left leg , and a month after that , she regained movement in her right leg .
Eventually , she was able to walk again .
By the following September , she was eager to go back to work , but to avoid publicity , the airline gave her a desk job .
She never suffered any psychological trauma as a result of the incident , and never experienced any fear of flying .
She still flies with some regularity , and she has a positive philosophy on life , stating , “ I believe we are masters of our lives – we hold all the cards and it is up to us to use them right . ”
Her good fortune in surviving the accident is most likely due to her low blood pressure , which caused her to pass out quickly and prevented her heart from bursting .
But despite her positive outlook on life , Vesna does not consider herself lucky .
Thirty years after the crash , she said to Philip Baum in an interview , “ I ’m not lucky .
Everybody thinks I am lucky , but they are mistaken .
If I were lucky I would never had this accident and my mother and father would be alive .
The accident ruined their lives too . ”
It ’s a valid point , along the same lines as arguing that the event was n’t a “ miracle , ” given that there were 27 people who did n’t survive .
The assertion that “ it could be worse ” is small comfort to the pragmatic , because certainly , it could also be much better .
Vesna currently holds the Guinness World Record for the highest fall survived without a parachute , at 33,330 feet .
Update :
In 2009 a group of German and Czech journalists released a report alleging that JAT Yugoslav Flight 364 was not destroyed by a terrorist attack .
Based on reviews of contemporary reports , newly available documents , and eyewitness accounts , the investigators concluded that it was “ extremely probable ” that the plane was mistaken for an enemy aircraft and shot down by a MiG fighter from the Czechoslovakian air force .
Czech military experts dismiss the report as a conspiracy theory , noting that hundreds of soldiers would have known the truth , yet none have come forward in the intervening decades .
Further , the West German Air Force would have detected the intercepting fighter jets .
Update 2 : Sadly , on 28 December 2016 , Vesna Vulovic passed away .

Dealing with the millions of RSS and Atom feeds out there is hard work .
We 're not trying to make you feel sorry for the Reader team , but as anyone who has attempted to implement a feed parser knows , there are many subtle deviations from the spec that you have to handle if you want to have any hope of satisfying the needs of your users ( who should n't have to care about such things ) .
The feed generating / parsing world has had the debate about Postel 's Law , as it applies to XML and feeds , several times .
We are not here to weigh in on either side of the argument .
Instead , we hope to provide some data so that such discussions can be made on more than philosophical grounds .
Without further ado , here are the top XML errors that we have encountered when parsing all of the feeds that our users have added to Reader ( and there are a lot of them ) :
% of errors Error description 15.6 % Input claims to be UTF - 8 but contains invalid characters .
14.9 % Opening and ending tags mismatch 13.9 %
An undefined entity is used ( e.g. in an XML document without importing the HTML set ) 7.8 % Documented expected to begin with a start tag , but no < was found 5.7 % Disallowed control characters present 5.5 % Extra content at the end of the document 4.2 % Unterminated entity reference ( missing semi- colon ) 4.2 % Unquoted attribute value 3.8 % Premature end of data in tag ( truncated feed ) 3.3 % Naked ampersand ( should be represented as & ) 2.1 % XML declaration allowed only at the start of the document 1.8 % Namespace prefix is used but not defined 0.75 % Comment not terminated 0.64 % Attribute without value 0.17 % Unescaped < not allowed in attributes values 0.11 % Malformed numerical entity reference 0.11 % Unsupported / invalid encoding 0.10 % Comment must not contain '--' 0.10 % Attribute defined more than once 0.07 % Char out of allowed range 0.03 % Comment not terminated 0.02 % Sequence ] ]> not allowed in content
As a whole , about seven percent of all feeds that we know about have some of these errors ( this data is based on a one - day snapshot , so transient errors may be present ) .
Note that these are all XML errors , meaning that the feed is not well - formed .
We are not talking about complying with and validating against the RSS or Atom specs - that is an even higher bar than we have set here .
In general , our recommendation to feed producers is to use the work that the community has put into the feed validator .
On a related note , we 're aware that Reader has some issues with titles .
It 's great that there are test cases , and we will add this bug to our to - do list .

Electrode cap allows users to think themselves along a virtual street .
© Christoph Guger / Nature Read about our reporter 's experience with the thought cap .
Computer scientists have created a hat that can read your thoughts .
It allows you to stroll down a virtual street .
All you have to do is think about walking .
Called a brain - computer interface , the device detects activity in certain brain areas linked to movement , and uses the signals to mimic that movement in a virtual world .
The technology could one day help paralysed patients to move robotic arms , or help sufferers of motor neuron disease to type out words on a virtual keyboard .
" Just thinking about movement activates the same neurons as actually moving , " explains Gert Pfurtscheller of Graz University of Technology in Austria , who has been working on the device for around four years .
By picking up on these bursts of nerve activity , the computer can decide whether you are thinking about moving your hands or feet , and react accordingly .
“ Just thinking about movement activates the same neurons as actually moving . ”
Gert Pfurtscheller , Graz University of Technology , Austria .
The technology detects brain waves by using electrodes placed at strategic points on the scalp ; they are positioned over brain areas known to be involved in moving specific body parts .
The computer can then distinguish between signals corresponding to different types of movement .
Previously , accurate detection of local brain activity has required electrodes to be implanted in the brain .
This technique has allowed recipients to control robots and even send e-mails ( see " " Paralysed man sends e-mail by thought " : http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041011/full/041011-9.html " ) .
The new device , presented at the Presence 2005 technology meeting in London last week1 , achieves a similar feat using non-invasive methods .
Thinking cap
Doris Zimmerman is so good with her thoughts that she was flown in from Austria for the demonstrations © Michael Hopkin / Nature
The team tested their creation by asking participants to navigate a virtual - reality studio called the Virtual Cave .
Test subjects sit in a square studio wearing three - dimensional goggles , which project a scene such as a street , complete with pedestrians and buildings .
The computer then chooses a task for the participant : either walking forwards or moving their hands .
It tells the user what to do through sound cues .
If the person is asked to think about walking , and they do so in a way that can be picked up by the cap , the virtual character steps forwards .
If they fail , the character stays still .
When asked to think about moving their hands , successful volunteers are rewarded by staying still .
Failure leads to punishment : their character takes a step backwards .
One of the world 's best - trained users is Doris Zimmerman , a student who has worked extensively with the team in Austria .
She was flown in to help with demonstrations at the conference .
As she sits in front of the Virtual Cave 's three - dimensional screen , we watch her effortlessly glide down a high street .
However , it 's not as easy as it looks , as I discover when I try a simplified version of the test ( see ' Piano player gets poor score on brain test ' ) .
And I 'm not the only one that struggled : " I took about five hours to learn it , " confides Christoph Guger , who has set up a Graz - based company to develop the technology .
ADVERTISEMENT
But after enough training , the team hopes that the virtual device could help those who are unable to move to interact more easily with others .
It could even enable stroke patients to regain movement , Pfurtscheller hopes , by allowing them to ' exercise ' their brain 's motor centres .
" If they think of moving their hand and they see a hand move , it reinforces the thought , " he says .
And strengthening the mind , he adds , might lead to better motor control .
― ― 「白蛇 抄１～１４ 」 －文芸社審査書評よりー
人と鬼と、そして神。多くの登場人物が絡みあいながら、少しずつ物語の道筋が付けられてゆく。
―読み手は何よりもその壮大で深遠な世界観に度肝を抜かれるだろう。
エピソードはそれぞれ個々に独立はしているものの、前章が次章に、そして、次章が前章と関連しながら、著者の描く世界の拡がりは留まる事を知らない。
番外編４編を含む全十四編の本作品は、複雑な人物相関の中で、人間の業、情愛の深さ、本当の優しさ、そうした「人間」そのものをテーマに描きだした超大作である。
政勝を主人公とした第一編の 「蟷螂」は作品全体の布石であり、続く「悪童丸」では陰陽師白河澄明の存在があきらかにされてゆく。中略。
第 ５編「邪淫の果て」までで、彼らをとりまく人と鬼、神との相関関係因縁が概ね紐解かれそれにつれて、本作品の世界全体も膨んでくるのである。
本作品は陰陽師の活躍を単純に描き出す「活劇」でもなければ、単に時代を異にしただけの「恋愛物語」でもない。
登場人物同士の心模様を非常に丁寧に描き出す事によって、男女間、友人関係、家族の中に蠢く、人間の利己心、情欲、葛藤、そして愛情や優しさを浮き彫りにした人間ドラマであり、本作品最大の魅力もこの複雑な人物相関にある。前編では、判然としなかった事が他編で初めて明らかにされる事実によって急に輪郭をもったものとなって眼前に立ち現われる。
読者はまるでミステリーの謎を解き明かされた時の快感に捕われ、ページを括ることをとめられないだろう。・・後略。神と人間が交わり、半妖が跋扈する世界を舞台に縺れ合った情愛と怨念の糸を解かんと陰陽師が躍動する本作品は壮大なスケールを持った世界観と具に描き出された登場人物の心の機微が読み手を圧倒する興趣に富んだ物語でした。
それぞれのエピソードを縦糸に、登場人物の想いを横糸として、個々の作品の枠組みに囚われない、作品全体をそのまま背景とした奥行きのある物語が編み上げられており、それが、読者を引き込む魅力となっていたように思われます。
人物の心の襞を追い、愛憎半ばとする相関関係を描き出した憂生様の筆力に確かな物が感じられ、審査員の大きな注目を集めました

気付いたら朝だったという
コメントを頂いたことがあったので
あてはまるかな？と、考えました。
Godmorgon därute !
Onsdag , redan mitt i veckan .
För många första jobbveckan och det är ju inte helt lätt att lägga om sommarsömniga sköna vanor .
Som att få vakna till ljuset och inte till ett pip från mobilen .
Som att strunta i att laga mat för att det är lika gott med något kylskåpsenkelt i farten .
Som att slippa passa tiden så noga .
Men nu är det ju lika bra att jag tar mig i kragen och går upp lite tidigare på morgonen .
Så att det blir en lugnare morgon , för alla .
Älskar ju den där morgonstunden , för mig själv .
Fast så svårt att få till den , när man sitter och svävar iväg i bloggosfären om kvällarna .
Så det får bli mitt höstlöfte , och så har jag skrivit ned det i varje fall .
Gå upp klockan 05.30 , mitt mål för resten av augusti .
Seing is believing ;-)
Jag hoppas i vart fall kunna pigga upp dig med danska , rykande nya höstformer från Tine K . Från en lite mer romantisk vår - och sommarstil , tycker jag mig se en betydligt tuffare Tine K .
Med nattsvarta detaljer och en enkelhet som jag gillar stort .
Så tummen upp för en svartare Tine K – kollektion !
Katalog och nya saker kommer strax upp på Tine K:s hemsida .
Men så länge – håll till godo med bildsvepet nedan !
Så sköna textilierna ser ut tycker jag .
Sval känsla .
Men kolla in den där duken , är den inte snygg ?!
Dip dye , batik och svart glans i keramiken , snyggt !
Den hamrade servettringen är en av mina favoriter bland bling - blinget , och blänkande metaller finns det också gott om i det här höstgodiset .
Hamrad metall ska det vara i höst , det har vi sett hos flera formgivare redan , bland annat Broste Cph och Hübsch .
För den som inte vill köpa allt nytt , finns det ju nu fantastiska möjligheter att bli trendig i höst till en billig penning .
För loppisarna svämmar över med hamrade kopparföremål .
Särskilt på hösten när alla gjort sina storrensningar på vinden .
Då får Myrorna och andra loppisar nyfyllda lager .
Inget slår ju det där egna fyndet , eller hur ?!
Vi känner fortfarande igen gamla Tine K. Fina korgar och rustikt trä .
Men nu som sagt snyggt parat med sotigt svart design .
Ni som följt mig ett tag har kanske sett mina referenser till en av de större trendspåren i år .
Den syndiga trenden .
Det vill säga svart med snällaste tolkningen .
Vilket Tine K har stannat vid och det känns alldeles lagom för mig .
För mig som förtappad pennörd uppstår genast lite cravings för den där fina svarta med sidenkrumelur , skulle passa fint till samlingen .
Inspiration till en egen stilleben - hylla hemma kanske ?
Modigt med halvt målade kolsvarta väggar , effektfullt här i vart fall .
Och fint med samma färg i flera krukor i olika former och höjder .
Höststyling - tips !
Åh , det här gillar jag !
Pasteller kommer fram , men dov , nästan sotad gammelrosa och mörkt blå accenter till färgskalan .
Så stiligt och skönt i ett sovrum .
Vi har själva tapetserat i mörkt blått i vårt sovrum och jag är supernöjd efter en en hel del tandbitarnervositet innan .
Som i en kokong att vila i ett mörkare rum , mer ombonat , så jag passar på att slå ett slag för det mörka sovrummet : )
Foton : Tine K
En sån härlig lyxig känsla den här bilden förmedlar .
Vi behöver alla lite lyx .
Och med det menar jag inte nödvändigtvis dyr lyx , utan det där lilla som förgyller .
Egen tid .
I badet .
I sköna fotöljen .
Med inredningstidningen eller vad som nu lust finns till .
Och ja , en ynka dag till med sovmorgon .
Pretty please ?
D e t är lyx det !
Hoppas du får en dag med mycket guldblänk i;-)

Typical Open Source Software Moment
The thing open source advocates always tout about open source software is that you can open the hood and poke around and change things if necessary .
The ability to customize your app and the source code level is nothing short of Real Ultimate Power .
( My friend Mark said that he saw a OSS guy totally uppercut some kid just because the kid opened Windows )
So last night , I put that to the test .
I wanted to find out some details about how Erlang handles some low level file operations .
My new Erlang based CouchDb engine , which is now storing and retrieving documents , seems a little too fast right out of the gate , and I suspect it 's because the flush operations ( ' sync ' in Erlang ) I 'm performing are n't actually flushing to disk .
Which is possible because the Erlang documentation says the ' sync ' operation does n't work on all platforms .
But it does n't say which platforms .
Swell .
But wait !
It 's open source , I 'm a coder !
I can just look at the code and figure it out !
And yet , after many hours of searching the Erlang source code , I still have n't figured out how Erlang translates file system operations down to OS level calls .
I 've scanned many thousands of lines of source code , I 've searched for file function calls in every file API I can think of .
And still I can't figure out how it 's doing it .
I 've looked at lots of interesting networking code , and I now have a better understanding of how the Erlang source is organized .
But by just looking at the source code , I have n't been able to answer my rather simple question :
Do Erlang disk flushes actually work on Windows ?
This is n't to say it 's impossible for me figure out , but it going to require me to understand the core underpinnings of Erlang 's bootstrapping process .
Essentially , to answer a very simple question about the Erlang source code , I now have to spend who knows how many hours becoming familiar with the guts of Erlang 's runtime .
And while that 's kind of fun , it is n't helping me get Couch built .
It 's a big distraction .
For now I 'm just going to write it down as a possible outstanding issue .
Often answers to questions like this pop up at unexpected times , so its best just to move on and wait for it .
If I never find the answer then I 'll pester someone who 's familiar with Erlang source .
If the answer is that I must modify the source to get the behavior I need , then I 'll cross that bridge when I get to it .
Having the source code is n't quite the benefit open source advocates would have you believe .
It is n't like having detailed instructions for a model battleship , it 's more like all the parts were dumped out onto the table .
Good luck with all that .

Khamenei : No Nuclear Weapon Program , No First Strike
Goal is Energy Independence
Abu Ghrayb , Haditha Weaken US Human Rights Claims
The US media presented only a snippet from the speech of Supreme Jurisprudent Ali Khamenei of Iran on Sunday , in which he threatened to damage oil supplies to the West if the US militarily attacked Iran .
He did say that , but he also announced that Iran had no intention of striking first , had not attacked and would not attack another country , and that it has no nuclear weapons program and does not want a nuclear bomb .
I did n’t hear any of those statements reported on television .
For some strange reason , a relatively full text of important speeches given by world leaders is almost never provided to the public by any US media in English .
I doubt there are even a handful of speeches easily accessible in English by Spanish President Zapatero , e.g .
I cannot entirely explain this strange phenomenon , of the coccooned and almost deliberately ignorant approach to the world of the US corporate media and their audience .
The odd thing is that the American public pays tax dollars so that the Open Source Center of the USG can translate such primary texts .
They are , however , not made freely available , though you can get them via university and maybe other good libraries .
Below I present the OSC translation of some important passages of the speech .
I should think it is obvious that I loathe Khamenei and his regime , but I suppose I have to say so yet again in today ’s wretched intellectual environment .
I find Khamenei ’s claims that Iran does not abuse human rights to be particularly offensive .
Still , I do think that if the public is going to hear part of Khamenei ’s speech , it should hear some of the other parts , too .
PS , see Tom O’Donnell ’s paper on petroleum , not nukes , as the driving issue in the crisis between Washington and Tehran .
‘ Iranian TV : Ayatollah Khamene ’i Speaks on Khomeyni’s Death Anniversary ( 2 )
Islamic Republic of Iran News Network Television ( IRINN )
Sunday , June 4 , 2006 T20:31:17Z
Tehran Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran Network 1 in Persian at 0645 GMT on 4 June carries a live broadcast of a speech by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Kahmene ’i on the occasion of the 17th anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeyni ’s death .
The speech is given at Ayatollah Khomeyni ’s mausoleum .
TV shows a large gathering of people at the mausoleum supporting the supreme leader by their slogans .
The following is the part of Khamene ’i’s speech relating to international relations and the nuclear issue .
( Khamene ’i ) “ Science can not be begged from others .
Science should be inspired from within .
A nation should use its talent to become truly knowledgeable .
At the same time , it would only be through national unity and nationwide peace that faith , justice and science could flourish .
At the absence of peace and calm , the country cannot benefit from science or faith , and it will not be possible to establish justice for the people .
The enemy is therefore willing to grant its biggest prize to those who can shake the pillars of peace in Iran and to fight against the people ’s faith in God , themselves , the ( revolution ’s ) path and success . . .
“ Those who want to distance universities and research centres from science and research are working for the enemy , and the enemy is ready to give them its biggest prize .
. .
“ The person who pursues this nation ’s honour and this nation ’s scientific progress is an insider .
The strangers ( Persian : gharibeh ) are those who are enthusiastic for America ’s hegemony .
They are the ones who work at home for the enemy that ’s lying in wait and act in its favour .
These are the strangers . . .
“ Let me say a few sentences about enemies ’ propaganda .
The propaganda commotions against the Iranian nation and the system of the Islamic republic are mainly set in train in the world by the Americans , Zionist media and the news empire affiliated to Zionism . . .
( They make ) Several points about Iran :
First , that there is an international consensus against Iran .
Second , that Iran is a threat to the world .
Third , that Iran is trying to make a nuclear bomb and nuclear weapons .
Fourth , that Iran is a violator of human rights .
These are the few sentences which the enemy ’s entire propaganda activities harp on .
And they keep repeating these in different ways in the world , using a variety of ploys .
Of course , the truth is clear to our nation .
It is also clear to many intelligent people in the world .
But I ’ll briefly say something ( in this respect ) .
“ There is no consensus against Iran .
This is a lie by the Americans and a few people who are America ’s allies in the world .
( Crowd chants in support )
“ Some 116 non-aligned countries supported Iran in its bold move to acquire nuclear technology .
The Organization of the Islamic Conference has voiced support for Iran .
Independent governments all support Iran .
All those people who have acted as middlemen to repeat America ’s words to us , under the American pressure and out of courtesy , have told us in secrete that they have been asked by the Americans to say so and that they do not think the same way .
“ The world and the countries that want to secure their future are all against the monopoly of nuclear technology by a few countries .
To say that no country has the right to have access to nuclear technology means that in 20 years ’ time , all of the countries of the world will have to beg certain Western or European countries to meet their energy demands .
They will have to beg for energy in order to run their lives .
Which country , nation , or honest official is ready to take that ?
Today , our nation has taken a step forward in this road .
It has become the pioneer and stands courageously by this end .
Other nations have no problem with this ( move ) , let alone having a consensus against it .
The consensus is among a number of political monopolist countries .
This consensus is worthless . . .
“ The American and Zionist propagandists say Iran is a threat to the world .
This is the second issue .
Iran is not a threat to any country and everyone knows this fact about Iran .
We have not threatened neighbouring countries .
We have friendly and brotherly ties with all the countries of the region .
Our government has healthy and good relations with European countries .
These relations with Europe will be even better in the future , when gas plays a more important role as a source of energy .
They need our gas .
We have friendly and good ties with the Arab world .
The most important issue in Arab society is the Palestinian cause .
On this issue , we speak openly about whatever they ( Arabs ) have in their hearts .
We have a very clear and transparent position on the Palestinian cause and Arab nations like this position whole - heartedly .
They feel proud when we voice that position .
The Arab officials too want the same in their hearts , although they cannot speak about it as openly as we do due to certain issues .
“ We have friendly ties with different countries in the region , in Asia and other parts of the world .
They all recognize and appreciate Iran ’s rights , its role and its influence .
We also have good ties with Russia .
The Russians know very well what would happen to them if a pro-American government was in power in Tehran .
We ( Iran and Russia ) have common interests in central Asia , the Middle East and this region .
“ We have no problem with the world .
We are not a threat whatsoever to the world and the world knows it .
The Americans , with their shameless propagandas , want to influence world public opinion .
However , they have n’t yet managed to do so and will not be able to do so in the future either .
“ Their other issue is [ their assertion ] that Iran seeks [ a ] nuclear bomb .
It is an irrelevant and wrong statement , it is a sheer lie .
We do not need a nuclear bomb .
We do not have any objectives or aspirations for which we will need to use a nuclear bomb .
We consider using nuclear weapons against Islamic rules .
We have announced this openly .
We think imposing the costs of building and maintaining nuclear weapons on our nation is unnecessary .
Building such weapons and their maintenance are costly .
By no means we deem it right to impose these costs on the people .
We do not need those weapons .
Unlike the Americans who want to rule the world with force , we do not claim to control the world and therefore do not need a nuclear bomb .
Our nuclear bomb and our explosive powers are our faith , our youth and our people who have been present on the most difficult scenes with utmost power and faith and will continue to do so .
( Chants of slogan , God is great ) .
“ The American political institutions and propaganda machines are behind all these false ballyhoos .
The Zionists also help , along with them and side - by - side them .
They are the cause of everything .
“ I would like to address a few sentences to the American officials and the team which is running America today and claims to lead the world too .
I hope they listen to it , think about it and understand it .
I want to ask them to compare themselves with our government .
Compare your ( American ) president with ours .
Your government is the most hated government in history of the United States today .
They ( Americans ) announced it to the world in their own opinion polls .
The government currently in power in America is the most hated government in history of the United States according to its people .
Compare this with our own government .
Our government is one of the most favourite governments since the Constitutional Revolution ( 1906 ) .
( Chants of slogan , God is Great , Khamene ’i is our leader , death to America , death to Britain ) .
“ Wherever your president , Mr Bush , visits he is faced with the people ’s protest demonstrations and abhorrence .
This is the case in Europe , Asia and Africa .
In Latin America , governments come to power by using anti-US slogans .
Today in Peru , Ecuador , Venezuela and many other Latin America countries as soon as presidential candidates use anti-US slogans the people vote for them .
Can someone be hated more than this ?
“ The American government does n’t allow its people to hold a normal telephone conversation safely .
This means that they ca n’t trust their people and can’t allow them to hold a telephone conversation freely .
They have passed a law allowing them to control the telephones .
This is your situation .
“ Well , compare this with the situation in our country .
Compare it to visits by our country ’s officials .
“ See what enthusiasm the people showed towards Iranian presidents during the ( Iranian ) president ’s visit to Indonesia and our former presidents ’ visits to Lebanon , Sudan , Pakistan and other places .
Why do n’t you understand this ?
Why do n’t you confess such things ?
“ You have confessed to spending 300b dollars in Iraq so that you could bring to power a government which was your puppet and took orders from you .
But you failed .
They have confessed to spending 300b dollars , but they ’ve probably spent more than this so that they could bring a government to power which took orders from America .
But they failed because the Iraqi nation was obstinate .
“ In Palestine you did your utmost to stop the Hamas government from coming to power .
But you failed .
And contrary to your wish , the Palestinian nation voted for the Hamas government .
You exerted pressure from various sides on the Palestinian government .
However , this strengthened the Palestinian people ’s solidarity with this government .
In Lebanon , senior agents from the American State Department went to Beirut and stayed there for a few months to see whether they could hold Lebanon in their clutches , undermine the resistance in that country and create a Lebanon which follows Israel .
But you failed because the Lebanese people held a grudge against you .
It ’s the same everywhere else .
“ Why does n’t Mr Bush confess that , by his conduct , he ’s made America , the American nation and America as a country , despised in the world ?
Why do n’t you confess that you ’ve been weakened ?
Why do n’t you confess that your blade has gone blunt in the world ?
( But ) You still make threats .
“ Compare our president ’s message to the American president to the Americans ’ impolite and feeble message , which was disseminated in the world a few days ago .
Out of keeping with diplomatic convention .
Brimming with dim - witted arrogance .
Full of threats .
Hollow words .
If you were capable of harming the Islamic republic , you would n’t have wasted a minute during these 27 years .
“ The former American secretary of state openly said : I have to tear out the Iranian nation by its roots .
He ( or she ; Persian is gender neutral ) is finished and gone ; the Iranian nation has grown daily .
( Crowd chants in support )
“ You speak about human rights .
You speak about being against terrorism .
How the hell can an administration that has Guantanamo Prison and Abu- Ghurayb Prison and crimes like the Haditha crime and the recent crime in Kabul and dozens and hundreds of other such things on its record dare to speak about human rights ?
( Crowd chants in support )
“ In order to threaten Iran , you ( America ) say that you can secure energy flow in the region .
You are wrong .
Beware that if you make the slightest mistake about Iran , the energy flow through this region will be seriously in danger .
( Chants of slogan , God is great , Khamene ’i is our leader , death to America ) .
“ You will never be capable of providing energy security in this region .
You are not capable and you should know this .
We will never start a war .
We have no intention of going to war with any government .
We have a high aspiration and we will use all our energy to reach it .
That aspiration is to build an Iran which provides this nation with moral and material prosperity .
We want an Iran that can be a role - model for all other nations .
Other nations know ( it ) well and endeavour ( to reach this end ) themselves .
“ We want to properly use this big country and its huge natural and human resources – the resources which have been given to this nation and its officials .
We want to relieve this nation of the burden of hundreds of years of humiliation .
This nation feels proud and powerful and it has every right to feel so .
This nation is proud and powerful , but it has been kept behind .
Both corrupt dictator systems and their foreign ill - willed supporters ( have kept Iran behind ) . . .
“ Peace and blessings of God be upon you . ” . . .

As a kid in the 1980s , Bart Massey spent hours tinkering with computer programs , writing his own source code and then sharing it with friends .
He and his buddies comprised a small band of curious computer whizzes with no agenda , and certainly no rules .
Over time , that code - sharing would come to be known as open source : " We just did n't have a name for it then , " says Mr. Massey , today a computer science professor at Portland State University .
Too many cooks may spoil the broth , but too many programmers just makes software better .
For a multibillion - dollar company that 's spent decades protecting its code with the rigor of Fort Knox , that 's a radical notion .
But open source is fast gaining converts , shattering traditional business models , and , in the process , transforming Portland into one of the world 's open source hubs .
Consider the following :
• Companies like IBM , Hewlett - Packard , and Intel have developed their own open - source labs here .
• Linus Torvalds , author of Linux , the first mainstream open - source operating system , moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to work at the Open Source Development Lab in Portland .
• In mid-October the city hosted the first Government Open Source Conference , a gathering for state and municipal technology managers interested in using open - source software in the public sector .
• Most recently , Oregon Gov. Theodore Kulongoski announced a $ 350,000 contribution from Google to develop open - source software , hardware , and curricula at Oregon State University , which boasts an Open Source Lab , and Portland State University .
Portland 's standing as a hub for open - source development is not lost on the governor , who is eager to bring even more jobs and investment to what he calls a " burgeoning open technology cluster . "
More Firefox than Che
Portland - a city where T - shirts on college campuses are more likely to sport Firefox than Che - is now seeing venture capitalists descending upon it , proof that all the heavyweight open - source talent here may indeed power the local economy .
" I think we 'll see a sharp uptick in entrepreneurial activities because of Portland 's global influence , " says Lavonne Reimer , executive director of the Open Technology Business Center in Beaverton , a suburb .
On the surface it seems odd that the very companies who build and sell their own proprietary software would welcome the arrival of free , open - source rivals .
When IBM built its Linux Technology Lab , many observers were left scratching their heads .
But by using open - source systems like Linux , companies can eliminate the cost of building and maintaining their own operating systems , Ms. Reimer says .
That leaves them free to focus on other products and services - such as chips or hardware - that are more important to their futures .
From telecommunications to petroleum to government , most industries are choosing Linux over proprietary operating systems because it cuts costs and offers superior security and flexibility , says John Charlson , spokesman at IBM , whose Linux center in Beaverton employs hundreds of programmers .
( The more people with access to the system , ironically , the fewer the problems because it is so heavily scrutinized and monitored . )
" Today if you look at the business model , it 's relatively stagnant , " says Richard Warren , vice president of IBM's Systems and Technology Group in Beaverton .
" We 're stealing markets from each other , so by creating a new computer paradigm you open the marketplace up . "
Entire countries - Brazil , China , France , and Australia - are turning to Linux , which has the ultimate effect of expanding the overall number of computer users .
Seen more broadly , the open - source spirit is proving viable as a means of developing many kinds of intellectual property .
The popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia , for one , hands over all writing and editing rights to the end user - anyone can post anything - and boasts upward of 1 million entries , each typically informed by several perspectives .
News media , for another , are toying with opportunities provided by citizen journalism , where power is handed over to the masses to report on and discuss the news of the day .
Even musicians like David Bowie have given away their music to encourage deejays to make mixes .
' There 's something new here '
In all of this , one underlying theory is at play :
The wider the ownership is spread , the greater the contribution from those " owners " and the better the product .
" Large corporations are realizing that there 's method in this madness .
Their interests are at a different scale than individuals , but it 's kind of the same thing :
They want something , and they can't really afford to get it unless they work together , " says Ward Cunningham of the Eclipse Foundation , a nonprofit project aimed at developing universal tool sets , and the inventor of the wiki , the software Wikipedia uses .
" There 's something new here - a cooperation in software , especially software that is clearly valuable . "
The open - source revolution has been slow but steady .
" We 've grown to have this blind expectation that revolutions will happen on exponential curves - that overnight we 'll go from 3 percent acceptance to 70 percent acceptance - and if that does n't happen it's a failure , " Mr. Massey says .
" Open source has n't happened on that curve , but we 'll pick up 3 percent for a lot of years to get to 70 percent . "
When the software and processes of putting things together is all open source , he predicts , the end user will pay only for the parts with which to put computers together .
" That 's a tempting vision , " he says .

This week in space Gallery : Science Lens Pork threatens NASA plans : Congress ' pet projects take $ 3 billion from budget NASA must slash science , engineering and education programs to pay for billions of dollars in congressional pet projects , most of which have little to do with the agency 's mission to explore space .
The price tag for politicians ' " pork " has grown so large that NASA may have to delay the new spaceships and rockets needed to replace the space shuttles , to be retired in 2010 .
Instead , NASA will pay for : • Construction or renovation of dozens of museums , planetariums and science labs for colleges .
• Computers , classrooms and lab space for colleges and schools across the U.S. • A website and laboratory for the Gulf of Maine Aquarium . •
A sprawling headquarters building for a non-profit research group in West Virginia created by U.S. Rep. Alan Mollohan .
The Democrat is now subject of a broader congressional ethics probe .
Since 2001 , Congress has directed the space agency to spend more than $ 3 billion on special projects , most of them small endeavors sought by individual lawmakers for the benefit of their home districts , according to NASA and congressional records .
" There is a real consequence to this .
It 's not a victimless crime , " said David Williams , a vice president of the independent watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste , which has complained for years about the number and cost of the pet projects .
The cost of congressional add -ins has grown to about a half - billion dollars a year , or five times the total of a decade ago .
The consequences are growing too , NASA says .
The agency gets no extra money in its roughly $ 16 billion - a - year budget to fund politicians ' local projects , so managers must redirect money from existing projects .
What could go : • Robotic space probes face delay or cancellation as NASA tries to shuffle money .
•
The shuttles , International Space Station and new vehicles to carry astronauts back to the moon could see budget cuts .
The last item is one NASA is now stressing to members of Congress .
• Education programs are being cut , including half of the funding for the agency program that helps ensure historically minority colleges and universities are represented in NASA projects and grant programs .
" I am deeply concerned that the growth of these unrequested congressional directions is eroding NASA 's ability to carry out its mission of space exploration and peer - reviewed scientific discovery , " NASA Administrator Mike Griffin wrote this year in a letter the House Science Committee .
The cost , he went on to say , " could conflict with NASA 's ability to strive to deliver the Crew Exploration Vehicle ( CEV ) by the earliest possible date following the 2010 retirement of the space shuttle . "
Griffin 's plea Already , there is a four - year gap between the shuttles ' retirement and the first flight of the replacement ships .
The transition is projected to cut the number of jobs at Kennedy Space Center from 15,000 to about 10,000 unless leaders can land extra space work beyond launch and landing operations .
Any delay in fielding the new fleet could make matters worse .
So , Griffin is imploring Congress to ease up on pet projects , and he has some influential allies on Capitol Hill .
" It 's draining NASA 's lifeblood , " said U.S. Sen .
Bill Nelson , D - Orlando , the only active member of Congress to have flown in space .
" Every dollar is needed for research and development and safety .
I just do n't think it 's right for crazy things to be put in there like planetariums in other states .. ..
It 's destructive to take money out of the NASA budget to squirrel it away for pet projects of members of Congress simply because they can get their fingers on it . "
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , a potential presidential candidate and chairman of the committee that oversees NASA , railed against earmarks in the NASA budget during the investigation of the 2003 shuttle Columbia disaster that killed seven astronauts .
McCain said money used to pay for politicians ' pet projects would be better spent on safety measures to reduce the chance of such accidents .
It 's unclear , however , if anything will change .
The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to decide how the federal government spends its money .
It also requires elected lawmakers to represent the people back home .
U.S. Rep. David Weldon , R - Indialantic , has earmarked money in the NASA budget for hand - picked projects in Brevard , Florida .
He has landed several million dollars for Florida Tech , the Space Life Sciences Lab at Kennedy Space Center and hydrogen fuel research .
Weldon defends his projects as well - connected to NASA 's overall mission .
" There is a nexus of priorities with those , " said Stuart Burns , the congressman 's deputy chief of staff .
" That is what Dr. Weldon has used to weigh earmark requests he has made .
But you can look at some of this other stuff and , we agree , you sit there and scratch your head figuring out how it belongs . "
Florida has landed a small number of NASA earmarks — about 20 — during the last decade .
They include money Weldon secured to accelerate badly needed roof repairs at the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center , where shuttles are assembled for flight .
They also include money that other members of the Florida delegation nabbed for construction and research projects at colleges and universities across the state .
Some of the largest projects inserted into NASA 's budget include big - ticket missions or programs that the agency tried to cancel , but that Congress decided should not be cut .
Two examples : reinstatement of funding for a shuttle rescue mission to Hubble Space Telescope and a recently launched probe bound for Pluto .
However , most are hometown projects for members of Congress .
Hometown projects Citizens Against Government Waste , in preparing its annual " Pig Book " of pork - barrel projects , does not count projects such as Hubble and the Pluto mission .
The reasoning : That is Congress exercising its authority to help guide agency priorities .
Still , the organization 's book notes $ 2 billion worth of the mostly non-space hometown projects .
" Certainly , there 've been some earmarks that probably should not have been in there , " Burns said .
That 's one of the reasons Weldon is pushing for the president to have line - item veto power , allowing him to strike individual projects added by Congress .
Sean O'Keefe , the previous NASA administrator , tried to fight against pet projects .
O'Keefe , who left in 2005 to become chancellor of Louisiana State University , blamed managers inside NASA as much as lawmakers .
Some of those managers , facing budget cuts , seek out supportive lawmakers to get their projects reinstated , O'Keefe said in one of his last speeches at NASA .
In responding to that , lawmakers are merely doing their jobs , he said .
The earmarks , with Congress making the decisions , " is absolute chaos with no oversight , " said Williams , the taxpayer group 's vice president .
" There is zero ability for anyone to see what 's happening when these things get added at the last minute with no debate , " he said .

Documents tie shadowy US unit to inmate abuse case
By Will Dunham
Thu Jan 12 , 9:36 PM ET
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Newly released military documents show U.S. Army investigators closed a probe into allegations an Iraqi detainee had been abused by a shadowy military task force after its members used fake names and asserted that key computer files had been lost .
The documents shed light on Task Force 6 - 26 , a special operations unit , and confirmed the existence of a secret military “ Special Access Program ” associated with it , ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh said on Thursday .
The documents were released by the Army to the American Civil Liberties Union under court order through the Freedom of Information Act .
They were the latest files to provide details of the numerous investigations carried out by the Army into allegations of detainee abuse in Iraq .
A June 2005 document by the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command in Iraq described its investigation into suspected abuse of a detainee captured in January 2004 by Task Force 6 - 26 in Tikrit , deposed President Saddam Hussein ’s hometown .
His name was redacted , but he was mentioned as the son of a Saddam bodyguard .
The man was taken to Baghdad international airport , documents stated .
The United States maintains a prison there for “ high - value ” detainees .
He told Army investigators that U.S. personnel forced him one night to remove his clothes , walk into walls with a box over his head connected to a rope around his neck , punched him in the spinal area until he fainted , placed him in front of an air conditioner while cold water was poured on him , and kicked him in the stomach until he vomited , the documents stated .
‘ FAKE NAMES ’
Investigators could not find the personnel involved or the man ’s medical files , and the case was closed , the files stated .
A memo listed the suspected offenses as “ aggravated assault , cruelty and maltreatment . ”
“ The only names identified by this investigation were determined to be fake names utilized by the capturing soldiers , ” the memo stated .
“ 6 - 26 also had a major computer malfunction which resulted in them losing 70 percent of their files ; therefore they ca n’t find the cases we need to review . ”
The memo said the investigation should not be reopened .
“ Hell , even if we reopened it we would n’t get anymore information than we already have , ” the memo stated .
Singh said previous documents indicated Task Force 6 - 26 was linked to other instances of detainee abuse in Iraq .
“ This document suggests that Task Force 6 - 26 was part of a larger , clandestine program that we think may have links with high - ranking officials , because obviously someone high up had the authority to put this program in place , ” Singh said in a telephone interview .
Army spokesman Paul Boyce said the Army had taken allegations of detainee abuse “ extremely seriously . ”
“ The Army has gone to great extent in travel , interviews , documentation and concern to make sure that each and every allegation was thoroughly reviewed , thoroughly examined and , when appropriate , acted upon either through nonjudicial or judicial punishment , ” Boyce said .
A document stated Army investigators were not able to fully investigate suspects and witnesses because they were involved in the Special Access Program and due to the classified nature of their work .
The task force is stationed out of Fort Bragg , North Carolina , the document said .
The base houses the Army Special Operations Command .
If Larry Brilliant ’s life were a film , critics would pan the plot as implausible .
Trained as a physician , he was studying in an Indian monastery in 1973 when a guru told him to join the UN smallpox vaccination effort .
Brilliant helped eradicate the disease from India and eventually the planet .
He returned to the US and founded a charity organization , Seva , that has saved millions of people in developing countries from blindness ; cofounded the online community the Well ; and served as CEO for four tech companies .
Oh , and he also found time to march with Martin Luther King Jr. and moonlight as a physician for Jerry Garcia .
Last October , Brilliant received a $ 100,000 TED Prize to further his idea for building a global early - warning system for disease and disaster .
Four months later Google hired him to head its charitable arm , Google.org , with an initial bankroll of 3 million shares – worth about $ 1.15 billion – and 1 percent of annual profits .
Brilliant recently suspended a self - imposed “ quiet period ” to talk about his plans for Google.org .

How do you get put in charge of $ 1 billion ?
There are a number of contradictory stories floating around , all true .
I gave a talk at a TED salon , and somebody there invited me to give it at Google .
The next thing I know , I get a call saying , We have this Google foundation , might you be interested ?
And then began the Google hiring dance .
I got to meet all 6,500 employees one on one , for an hour each .
[ Laughs . ]
They must have run out of good candidates , so they picked me .
It seems like you were meant for this job .
My life only makes sense in retrospect .
I was the mascot on the smallpox initiative .
I was young and I could speak Hindi and I could type .
I stayed there for over 10 years , and I rose to a big lofty title .
But I learned epidemiology ; I learned public health ; I learned developing countries ; I learned how to live through floods and catastrophes and famines .
I ’ve held hundreds of dead babies in my arms .
I ’ve learned how to think when the world is going to hell all around me .
What ’s your mandate ?
We ’ll have three big areas : climate crisis , global public heath , and global poverty , not necessarily in that order .
I ’m going to approach this the way a venture capitalist would – map out the industry to see what the gaps are .
You fund an initiative , learn what works , and ask , “ Will it scale ? ”
What makes Google.org different from , say , the Gates foundation ?
We are not really a foundation .
It ’s a bit of a 501 ( c ) 3 , a bit of a C corp , and a bit of an academic environment .
I can play more of the keys on the keyboard .
A 501 ( c ) 3 ca n’t lobby .
A 501 ( c ) 3 ca n’t invest in a company or build an industry .
It may be that the only way to deal with climate change is to create an industry or build companies .
Where ’s the money coming from ?
One percent of the equity , 1 percent of the profits , and 1 percent of the people go into Google.org .
The most important asset is n’t money , it ’s people .
One percent of the people means 60 or 70 of the smartest people in the world trying to solve some of the biggest problems in the world .
Are engineers really the best source for solutions to the world ’s biggest problems ?
I hope that you ’ll put in that Wired questioned the value of engineers .
Touché .
Many of the issues we face in dealing with rapid climate change are well suited to an engineering mind .
Do you consider avian flu an information problem ?
Absolutely .
There ’s a 10 to 15 percent chance that H5N1 will achieve escape velocity and mutate to be transmitted from human to human .
If it does , between 100 million and 300 million people will die .
The world will incur costs of $ 1 trillion to $ 3 trillion .
But there ’s an 85 to 90 percent chance of it not happening .
How do you think this through with a government that is anti-science ?
How does one decide when experts do n’t agree ?
Information is the key .
Google can help make good information ubiquitous .
Do you expect some of your initiatives to fail ?
God , I hope so .
I am a technologist .
If I have a 100 percent batting average , you should fire me , because it means we have n’t tried anything really noble .
How are you fitting in ?
Google ’s a strange place .
When I met Eric Schmidt , he said , “ If you are kind to everybody , then you will make good decisions because people will give you good information , and if you are truthful to everybody , they will be truthful to you . ”
That ’s what ’s different about Google .
They screw up and make mistakes , but they genuinely mean the good stuff about “ do n’t be evil . ”
It ’s a catchy slogan , but you ’re going further .
We are trying to change that to :
Do something really , really , really good .
The best way to level up when one is not in the position to be able to invest a lot of time in a favorite game is the use of boosting services .
Counter strike is not an easy game to play and it provides a lot of challenges .

Google has long since shaken off its tag of a baby internet firm
Does Google know what it 's doing ?
Probably not .
And therein may lie its genius .
I went round the " Googleplex " in Silicon Valley California four years after the company started .
It was unreconstructed 1960s California ; bikes in the corridors , lava lamps everywhere , the famous ex-Grateful Dead chef cooking delights in the Google canteen , a grand piano in reception for the Google PhDs to tinkle on during breaks .
But most impressive of all was what I saw above the reception desk : a live selection of searches being requested at that moment all over the world .
I read out a few .. and then turned to my Google escort .
" No one in history has ever been able to do this before , " I said , overwhelmed by it .
" We are looking into the mind of the world . "
Old hat already ?
But like all great innovations , we take things like the internet for granted as soon as we get it .
While I was there I talked to the founders of Google , Sergey Brin and Larry Page .
This was before they had hired a chief executive officer - Eric Schmidt - and were still running the firm themselves , long before last year 's extraordinary share sale that made them multi-billionaires .
Even in 2002 the company was generating enough money from ads to wipe its face .
But the founding duo was not at all clear about what the business plan actually was .
And perhaps they still do not really know .
Google 's founders have brought in outside help to ponder its future
Even so , this has been the most extraordinary year of activity for Google .
The company is mapping your desktop , managing your pictures with Picasa , mapping the earth with Google Earth , offering search over mobile phones .
It is going local by rolling country - specific search engines , it is edging into telecoms by apparently trying to build a fibre optic network , starting up an agency to place print ads like those on its web pages , launching Google Talk for instant messaging and Gmail for electronic mail .
More to come
But it does not stop there , and Google wants to make the contents of books ( not just their titles ) searchable to everyone ( maybe eventually all the books in the world ) , and it even wants to make TV programmes searchable .
In August 2005 , one year after the company 's first share flotation , Google raised another $ 4 billion to add to its existing $ 3 billion cash pile , making it the fastest growing company ever seen .
It is taking a million square feet of NASA property in Silicon Valley for a new Googleplex to create space for its army of PhDs who spend their time dreaming up ways of making search better .
It is taking floors for a huge bank of computer servers to do something with in New York .
Smart farm
Its main asset is the number of PhDs it has working for it , ceaselessly trying to figure out how to extend the principle of search into everything , unbounded by time , space and ( soon ) language barriers .
The company mainly hires people just a year or two out of university , for fear that experience in the conventional business world will taint their freshness of mind .
Google googles the Internet for its own purposes , ceaselessly .
It tried to recruit a South African schoolboy I know because it was so impressed with his web page .
( He turned them down in favour of going to university , probably a mistake ) .
Google 's business plan seems to be a simple one : its people start things , and then work out how to make money out of them .
This is an internet land grab of extraordinary dimensions .
Google wants its brand name to cover a whole host of services
No wonder Microsoft is worried ; no wonder Wal - Mart , the world 's biggest retailer , is worried .
The one feature that Google has been wary of adding to its services until this month is personal search , which remembers your preferences and selects from what it thinks you will want to see .
It was quietly taken out of the labs and launched in beta form the other day and whatever the small print promises , it takes this self - proclaimed " good " company into potentially dangerous Big Brother territory .
But by remembering your own preferences rather than the most popular or referred - to sites , it is turning the internet into a genuinely personal resource .
A mighty move .
Changing focus
The Google tracker and author John Battelle says that Google 's ultimate ambition ( after it has tested the waters with its current incoherent foray into so many do - able things ) is to change its overt mission statement .
At present , it professes " to organise the world 's information and make it accessible " .
The plan is to bring in the even more grandiose aim " to become the marketplace for all global commerce " .
And of course it may not be Google .
Google is only as good as its algorithms ( though its current land grab may be an attempt to disguise that fact ) .
Build a better search engine than Google , and the Internet will beat a path to your door .
At the Institute for the Future in Silicon Valley , California , Paul Saffo thinks the future is Yahoo , not Google because Yahoo has identified entertainment as the heart of its business plan .
It plans to link every other sort of internet exploration to the entertainment imperative .
Out there in cyberspace , something very important is happening to all our lives .
That 's what Google knows , even if it does n't know where it 's going .
Work in Progress is the title of this exploration of the big trends upheaving the world of work as we steam further into the 21st century ; and it is a work in progress , influenced and defined by my encounters as I report on trends in business and organisations all over the world .

Mice are shown to have two thymus organs , not just one
Who knew we 'd still be finding new bits of anatomy in mice in 2006 ?

After a century of scrutinizing the laboratory mouse , one might imagine that scientists would know the creature 's body like the back of their own hands .
Think again , because German researchers say they have discovered a whole new organ .
Common knowledge holds that in mice , the thymus , a pinkish - grey lump of tissue that helps to produce the infection - fighting T cells of the immune system , is roughly the size of a pea and nestles in the chest above the heart .
Now Hans - Reimer Rodewald at the University of Ulm in Germany , and his colleagues say they have discovered a smaller , second thymus hidden in the necks of lab mice .
" I could n't believe it for the first couple of months , " Rodewald says .
" 2006 is not the time that you expect to change anatomy . "
Confounding organ
The discovery raises questions about some immunology studies in mice .
Researchers interested in the immune system often slice out the main thymus of mice in order to study how this system works without it , and how T cells are produced in the gut and skin .
The presence of a second thymus suggests that many of these mice still had a working thymus in their necks , which could have confounded the results .
These studies may need to be re-examined , Rodewald suggests : " Some people are not going to like this . "
The discovery is n't a total surprise : biologists already knew that other mammals , including some humans , harbour an extra thymus in their necks .
Studies from as early as the 1940s suggest that as many as five out of six human fetuses have a second thymus in the neck , says Clare Blackburn who studies the mammalian thymus at the University of Edinburgh , UK .
There were also suggestions of a second mouse thymus in a report from the 1960s .
“ 2006 is not the time that you expect to change anatomy . ”
Hans - Reimer Rodewald ,
University of Ulm , Germany
But Rodewald says that his team 's study is the first to show that a second working thymus comes as standard in mice .
" It 's definitely not been part of people 's thinking , " agrees Blackburn .
Accidental find
Rodewald and his team stumbled across the long - overlooked organ when studying animals with defects in the chest thymus ; they happened across tissue that looked suspiciously like that from the thymus but it was in the neck , next to the windpipe .
The team found that almost all healthy mice of certain strains have this second neck thymus , which is the size of a large pinhead .
" It 's like a pocket version , " Rodewald says .
It was probably overlooked until now because it looks remarkably similar to a lymph gland , he adds .
To prove the organ 's identity , the researchers showed that it both looks and behaves like a thymus .
They found that it holds cells only found in the thymus , and that , when transplanted into animals lacking any thymus of their own , can help generate T cells as part of an immune response .
Off shoot
Scientists are intrigued by where the second mouse thymus might come from .
One idea is that it may be tissue left over from the formation of the main thymus , which grows in the neck region of the mouse embryo before moving down towards the chest .
This suggests that it 's " just pockets of tissue left behind as the organ migrates " , Blackburn says .
ADVERTISEMENT
Scientists are interested in the organ partly because they are keen to understand how the immune system develops .
They also hope to identify stem cells from which the thymus sprouts , and perhaps use them to regenerate the organ in bone - marrow transplant patients whose thymus is damaged by treatment .
Could there be yet another thymus in mice ?
Chickens can have more than ten scattered down the neck .
But Rodewald says , as far as mice go , " I 'm not going to go for the third thymus . "

Clearly , the government has a lot to handle since the seven serial blasts in Mumbai last Tuesday .
Banning America 's anti-Left website ExposingTheLeft.Blogspot .
Com is a start .
Viewed through pkblogs.com , a website that helps you bypass the official Indian ban ( its home page invites you if your blog is blocked in India , Pakistan , Iran or China ) , ExposingTheLeft .
Blogspot .
Com makes only one reference to Mumbai , which is : '' At least 131 killed in India train bombings : More humanitarian acts from the ' Religion of Peace ' . ''
This may be offensive and so could the rest of this website but largely for anti-Bush voters in the United States as it tracks domestic politics , takes several swipes at Iran , applauds a court ruling against same - sex marriages , and slams the Hizbollah .
It has little to do with what Comrade Prakash Karat was thinking about or doing on 7/11 .
ExposingTheLeft 's editors are aware of India 's gag order and their new post is : " Well , it 's not a fatwa but I suppose it will have to do . ''
Government officials today defended their action against the three blogspot.com sites and eight other websites they have ordered Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) to block from Indian viewers .
Several Department of Telecom officials , contacted through the day , declined to comment .
An official in charge of cybersecurity said : " Google should take the initiative to block sites that are offensive to us .
If it does n't , we have to take such action . "
All banned blogs are being hosted on a website that Google owns .
The websites are hosted both in India and abroad , which complicates matters , since bloggers are being forced out of their blogs because of the ban .
'' There are ways to bypass the ban which makes it ineffectual , but there 's another complication , it 's not easy for India to block blogs selectively if they are not hosted here , '' says Supreme Court lawyer Pavan Duggal .

( This is the foreword to Rick Chapman ’s new book , In Search of Stupidity . )
In every high tech company I ’ve known , there ’s a war going on , between the geeks and the suits .
Before you start reading this great new book full of propaganda from software marketing wizard and über - suit Rick Chapman , let me take a moment to tell you what the geeks think .
Play along with me for a minute , will you ?
Please imagine the most stereotypically pale , Jolt - drinking , Chinese - food - eating , video - game - playing , slashdot - reading Linux - command - line - dwelling dork .
Since this is just a stereotype , you should be free to imagine either a runt or a kind of chubby fellow , but in either case this is not the kind of person who plays football with his high school pals when he visits mom for Thanksgiving .
Also , since he ’s a stereotype , I shall not have to make complicated excuses for making him a him .
This is what our stereotypical programmer thinks : “ Microsoft makes inferior products , but they have superior marketing , so everybody buys their stuff . ”
Ask him what he thinks about the marketing people in his own company .
“ They ’re really stupid .
Yesterday I got into a big argument with this stupid sales chick in the break room and after ten minutes it was totally clear that she had no clue what the difference between 802.11a and 802.11 b is .
Duh ! ”
What do marketing people do , young geek ?
“ I do n’t know .
They play golf with customers or something , when they ’re not making me correct their idiot spec sheets .
If it was up to me I ’d fire ‘ em all . ”
A nice fellow named Jeffrey Tarter used to publish an annual list of the hundred largest personal computer software publishers called the Soft - letter 100 .
Here ’s what the top ten looked like in 1984 :
Rank Company Annual Revenues # 1 Micropro International $ 60,000,000 # 2 Microsoft Corp. $ 55,000,000 # 3 Lotus $ 53,000,000 # 4 Digital Research $ 45,000,000 # 5 VisiCorp $ 43,000,000 # 6 Ashton - Tate $ 35,000,000 # 7 Peachtree $ 21,700,000 # 8 MicroFocus $ 15,000,000 # 9 Software Publishing $ 14,000,000 # 10 Broderbund $ 13,000,000
OK , Microsoft is number 2 , but it is one of a handful of companies with roughly similar annual revenues .
Now let ’s look at the same list for 2001 .
Rank Company Annual Revenues # 1 Microsoft Corp . $ 23,845,000,000 # 2 Adobe $ 1,266,378,000 # 3 Novell $ 1,103,592,000 # 4 Intuit $ 1,076,000,000 # 5 Autodesk $ 926,324,000 # 6 Symantec $ 790,153,000 # 7 Network Associates $ 745,692,000 # 8 Citrix $ 479,446,000 # 9 Macromedia $ 295,997,000 # 10 Great Plains $ 250,231,000
Whoa .
Notice , if you will , that every single company except Microsoft has disappeared from the top ten .
Also notice , please , that Microsoft is so much larger than the next largest player , it ’s not even funny .
Adobe would double in revenues if they could just get Microsoft ’s soda pop budget .
The personal computer software market is Microsoft .
Microsoft ’s revenues , it turns out , make up 69 % of the total revenues of all the top 100 companies combined .
This is what we ’re talking about , here .
Is this just superior marketing , as our imaginary geek claims ?
Or the result of an illegal monopoly ?
( Which begs the question : how did Microsoft get that monopoly ?
You ca n’t have it both ways . )
According to Rick Chapman , the answer is simpler : Microsoft was the only company on the list that never made a fatal , stupid mistake .
Whether this was by dint of superior brainpower or just dumb luck , the biggest mistake Microsoft made was the dancing paperclip .
And how bad was that , really ?
We ridiculed them , shut it off , and went back to using Word , Excel , Outlook , and Internet Explorer every minute of every day .
But for every other software company that once had market leadership and saw it go down the drain , you can point to one or two giant blunders that steered the boat into an iceberg .
Micropro fiddled around rewriting the printer architecture instead of upgrading their flagship product , WordStar .
Lotus wasted a year and a half shoehorning 123 to run on 640 kb machines ; by the time they were done Excel was shipping and 640 kb machines were a dim memory .
Digital Research wildly overcharged for CP / M - 86 and lost a chance to be the de-facto standard for PC operating systems .
VisiCorp sued themselves out of existence .
Ashton - Tate never missed an opportunity to piss off dBase developers , poisoning the fragile ecology that is so vital to a platform vendor ’s success .
I ’m a programmer , of course , so I tend to blame the marketing people for these stupid mistakes .
Almost all of them revolve around a failure of non-technical business people to understand basic technology facts .
When Pepsi-pusher John Sculley was developing the Apple Newton , he did n’t know something that every computer science major in the country knows : handwriting recognition is not possible .
This was at the same time that Bill Gates was hauling programmers into meetings begging them to create a single rich text edit control that could be reused in all their products .
Put Jim Manzi ( the suit who let the MBAs take over Lotus ) in that meeting and he would be staring blankly .
“ What ’s a rich text edit control ? ”
It never would have occurred to him to take technological leadership because he did n’t grok the technology ; in fact , the very use of the word grok in that sentence would probably throw him off .
If you ask me , and I ’m biased , no software company can succeed unless there is a programmer at the helm .
So far the evidence backs me up .
But many of these boneheaded mistakes come from the programmers themselves .
Netscape ’s monumental decision to rewrite their browser instead of improving the old code base cost them several years of Internet time , during which their market share went from around 90 % to about 4 % , and this was the programmers ’ idea .
Of course , the nontechnical and inexperienced management of that company had no idea why this was a bad idea .
There are still scads of programmers who defend Netscape ’s ground - up rewrite .
“ The old code really sucked , Joel ! ” Yeah , uh - huh .
Such programmers should be admired for their love of clean code , but they should n’t be allowed within 100 feet of any business decisions , since it ’s obvious that clean code is more important to them than shipping , uh , software .
So I ’ll concede to Rick a bit and say that if you want to be successful in the software business , you have to have a management team that thoroughly understands and loves programming , but they have to understand and love business , too .
Finding a leader with strong aptitude in both dimensions is difficult , but it ’s the only way to avoid making one of those fatal mistakes that Rick catalogs lovingly in this book .
So read it , chuckle a bit , and if there ’s a stupidhead running your company , get your résumé in shape and start looking for a house in Redmond .
I 'm no exception to the lying - human - scumbag rule ; in fact I probably tell more lies than most .
Usually they are bog - standard white lies - compliments , mainly , although pretty much any statement that implies I give a toss about anyone other than myself is almost certainly untrue .
I 'd also class the majority of my facial expressions as white lies : occasional looks of concern , fixed masks of rapt concentration , smiles , you name it - all absolute bloody lies .
If it were socially acceptable to do so , I 'd walk around looking as blank as a Cyberman .
Balls to the lot of you .
Fend for yourselves .
My favourite kind of lie is the pointless but plausible lie ; the odd nugget of needless fiction dropped into conversation just for the hell of it .
For instance , whenever anyone I know returns from a holiday abroad and asks if anything interesting happened while they were gone , it amuses me to claim , for no reason whatsoever , that the actress Pauline Quirke died while performing a hang - gliding stunt on This Morning .
In my experience , this is just conceivable enough for them to swallow it whole .
They 'll only discover the truth months or maybe years later , the next time they see her on TV , and by then they 've forgotten who lied to them in the first place - the idiots .
It 's a fun little game .
Even though you rarely get to see the fruits of your labour first - hand ( since you 're long gone before the penny drops ) , pointless fibbing fleetingly makes your life seem 4 % more interesting than it actually is , so I wholeheartedly recommend it .
To get you started , here are four brief examples for you to sow as you see fit .
1 . Next time you go to the cinema with someone who knows nothing about the film , whisper , " I bet I can work out which one 's the android before you , " just as it starts .
They 'll spend the rest of the film studying the cast in completely the wrong way .
I tried this out recently when watching the movie Crash with someone , and it improved it a thousandfold .
2 . Text a friend at random saying : " Wahey !
I 'm in a HELICOPTER ! "
Someone did this to me once ; it worked a treat .
Try it now .
Go on .
3 . When passing a cemetery , nonchalantly claim Sherlock Holmes is buried there .
The number of people who fall for this is frankly astounding .
4 . You and a friend are listening to an unfamiliar song on the radio .
Before it finishes , say , " I can't believe this is Charles Dance - the man 's lost his mind " , then maintain that it is Charles Dance , it really bloody is , honestly , you read about it somewhere .
Keep the pretence up as long as you can , despite their protestations , even if it 's a woman singing .
Say he 's recorded it for a cow charity .
Get angry if they do n't believe you .
They will eventually .
They always do .
Anyway , there you go .
Now get lying .
It 's good for you .

Recently , Colorado Company magazine highlighted a developer who believes in nothing but “ green ” building .
It was a wonderful article , but it gets at an underlying question : why is this still a story ?
The idea of green building has not spread like wildfire .
The mass - market building sector is oblivious .
Most of the structures in trade magazines like Architectural Digest are n’t green .
Last month , The New York Times ran an article in which Robert A.M. Stern , dean of Yale ’s architecture school , said , “ I think the trouble with environmentalism is that at most architecture schools it ’s been confined to a dreary backwater of mechanical engineering . ”
That is changing , the article reports , but not fast enough .
Photo : iStockphoto .
Meanwhile , even good green builders often come up short .
In the environmental building community here in Colorado , everyone ’s got a story of a disastrous effort : one that uses 10 times as much energy as it was supposed to ; a micro- turbine that was n’t so cost - effective after gas prices spiked ; a south - facing community college that needed its air conditioning retrofit in the winter .
Green building was supposed to be the road to the promised land , where good design meshed with stewardship for the benefit of all , while the bottom line remained intact .
But if Moses were an architect , he would have come back from the mountain with 10 tablets of screw - ups and cover-ups .
So why is it so hard to build green ?
One response , of course , is that it is n’t .
In fact , there ’s a strong case to be made for a booming movement .
Membership in the U.S. Green Building Council has grown to 6,000 since its founding in 1993 .
States and cities like Wisconsin , Seattle , and Portland , Ore. , are adopting green building standards .
There is reasonably strong federal action on the issue , if not at the level of the White House .
And corporate leadership in the arena is expanding .
This all sounds good , until you look around .
Try to buy a green home in any major subdivision in America , for instance — it ’s as rare as a flower in the desert .
Some of the reasons for the slow pace of the movement ’s growth are obvious : cost ; cultural and structural resistance ; lack of talent or expertise ; lack of research , funding , and awareness ; and perceived trade - offs between quality or security and sustainability .
But there are two less obvious reasons to consider .
The first is that stakeholders are afraid to challenge the myth that green building is cheap and easy .
Once you ’ve gone through the process , you ’re scared to point out the warts , because your work is now a model , getting enormous publicity .
But ultimately , the lack of willingness to admit failure prevents the industry from learning from its mistakes .
Until that changes — until there are conferences about mistakes and pitfalls , not brilliant successes — the learning curve will remain flat .
As renowned green architect William McDonough said after Environmental Building News reported on problems with the environmental studies center he designed for Oberlin College , these are new projects .
The point is n’t that they work perfectly at first , it ’s that they eventually work well .
And , I would add , that we learn as we go .
The second reason green building has n’t become more mainstream is that it ’s often discussed in a secret language , the code of a cabal .
For instance , talk of “ biomimicry ” — the idea that buildings should be modeled on natural systems — is nearly inescapable .
But as Michael Brown , an environmental consultant and editor at the Journal of Industrial Ecology , points out , biomimicry seems mainly to be about making something straightforward ( avoid toxics , strive for closed loops , minimize energy ) into something that requires a consultant .
LEED , the U.S. Green Building Council ’s certification system , has its own cabal - like nature too .
The message is , you have to know LEED if you want to build green .
But LEED is not how you get a green building — it ’s how you certify one .
It is not a blueprint .
If it ’s treated as one , then certification concerns begin to trump performance , and drive the process .
Here in Aspen , we ’re proposing new affordable housing that will run on lake - source heat pumps and use structural insulated panels .
It would be very hard for this building not to beat energy code by 40 percent .
We ’ll need things like passive solar orientation ; envelope efficiency , including superinsulation and tightness ; and an efficient and right - sized heating system .
What we wo n’t need is a consultant , a biologist , a Ph.D. , or a translator .
Successful green buildings depend on talent and freedom : qualified engineers , architects , builders , and owners , preferably with some green experience , who are willing to take risks and try new things .
The Eastgate Building in Zimbabwe , which self - shades and dumps heat at night , is n’t successful because it looks like a cactus ( though that does n’t hurt ) — it ’s successful because architect Mick Pearce is a genius , and someone gave him free reign , along with the help of a great engineering firm , Ove Arup .
But talent and freedom are in short supply .
And that inevitably results in something that looks less like green building than business as usual , with a green consultant thrown in .
On typical projects , the consultant — to whom well - intentioned owners ascribe God - like qualities — is charged with jury - rigging an already doomed process .
By , for example , helping to document that a building ’s steel studs and rebar , which would have been used even in a “ brown ” project , are partly recycled , and contribute to making the building bona fide green .
( This is something I ’ve been guilty of when using LEED . )
These kinds of decisions , in turn , lead to mediocre final results that are hailed as “ successful blueprints ” for the future , and whose mistakes are never analyzed .
Change takes time , of course .
But we do n’t have time .
Buildings are a major contributor to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels , and we have to cut those soon just to stabilize them at twice preindustrial levels .
As NASA scientist James Hansen has said , unless we move aggressively to reduce emissions in the next decade , future generations will face life on a planet unrecognizable to us .
So it ’s well past time to think about how to speed up the adoption of green practices , and how to break down the barriers to a widespread green construction industry .
We ca n’t afford anything less .

Most voters in the United States are middle class or poor .
Yet Congress has given a small minority of citizens , the near - rich or rich , the bulk of the benefits from several years of tax cuts , thereby further aggravating income inequity in this nation .
How come , with elections every two years , Congress can apparently ignore the interests of the majority ?
After all , the rich have been getting richer , while the remainder of Americans have seen their incomes typically stand still in real terms for five years .
Government also boosts the prosperous in other ways .
By now , surely most voters are aware that tax goodies have primarily gone to those at the top of the income ladder .
But most are apathetic about it .
" Another year , another tax cut , and look who 's cleaning up , " was a May 16 headline in USA Today , reporting on the $ 69 billion tax - cut bill President Bush signed into law last week .
That latest tax cut gives an estimated 80 percent of the tax savings to the top 10 percent of taxpayers .
Yet the rich are already paying a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than at any time in the past 75 years .
True , they give Uncle Sam a lot of money .
But that 's because their earnings have grown much faster than those of the typical American .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the average weekly earnings in the US last month - when calculated in 1982 dollars - was $ 277 .
That 's the same as in November 2001 when today 's economic recovery began .
In current dollars , the average weekly earnings were $ 565 last month .
The reason Congress does n't spread tax savings around more evenly is that " people understand that poor people do n't create jobs , and rich people do , " says Republican economist Bruce Bartlett .
Moreover , people who earn less than $ 30,000 a year are unlikely to pay much , if any , income taxes , notes Mr. Bartlett , a former Treasury economist .
His implication is that lower - income people could not care less what Congress does on taxes .
They do , however , pay substantial Social Security payroll taxes .
Jared Bernstein , an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute , uses two words to describe the conservative argument that tax cuts making the rich richer will grow the economy faster and therefore pay for itself in government revenues : " snake oil . "
Mr. Bernstein cites economic studies indicating that , particularly in a time of federal deficits , tax cuts for the rich have no special economic benefit for the nation .
Rather , they raise interest rates higher than they might otherwise be .
" Someone is trying to sell you magic beans , " Bernstein says .
" Pixie dust . "
He suspects one reason Americans tolerate tax cuts favoring the wealthy is that many anticipate becoming rich themselves and thereby benefiting .
Americans tell themselves that tomorrow , " I , too , will be a fat cat , " Bernstein says .
But that probability is " tiny . "
Bartlett and Bernstein agree on one reason for Americans ' apathy on tax issues : deep cynicism about Washington .
They figure that " Congress does what it does and sells itself to the highest bidder , " says Bartlett .
Or , as Bernstein puts it , they see Washington as being " run by incompetent people at best , crooks at worst .
The Democrats give the farm away to the undeserving poor , the Republicans give the farm to the undeserving rich .
And we can't do anything about it . "
Another liberal economist , Dean Baker , notes that elections have become very expensive for members of Congress .
" The people who put up a lot of [ campaign ] money are those who get their views heard , " he says .
It would be " a tremendous insult " to big campaign donors to say they got nothing in return for their money , says Bernstein .
In a new e-book , " The Conservative Nanny State , " available free on the Web ( www.conservativenannystate.org), Mr. Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research holds that the well - to - do not only get tax breaks but also win other benefits from a nanny government .
Federal policies that determine who gets rich and who ends up poor , Baker says , include the Federal Reserve 's monetary policy ; protection from free trade for doctors , lawyers , and other professionals ; and extended terms for copyrights and patents .
Tight Fed monetary policy puts mostly middle and lower - income people out of work in a battle against threatened inflation .
A recession keeps wages down , helping business and the well - to - do .
But Congress is usually reluctant to extend unemployment insurance benefits to the victims of the anti-inflation battle .
Disney and other holders of copyrights had their wealth protected when a " Mickey Mouse " law several years ago extended copyrights to 95 years , up from 75 .
Unlike low - wage Americans facing job competition from poorly educated Latin immigrants , most professionals are protected from immigrant competition .
The Medici family motto in 16th century Florence still has at least some relevance today : " Money to get power , and power to guard the money . "
Because the Bush administration , almost from the start , has eschewed any comparison of Iraq with Vietnam , officials apparently never read the history of the nations heretofore worst war and have made the same 10 major mistakes :
Underestimating the enemy .
As in Vietnam , the superpowers potent military has been astounded by the tenacity and competence of a nationalist rebellion attempting to throw a foreign occupier from its soil .
For example , the U.S. military , a hierarchical organization , views the Sunni insurgency as disorganized and without a central command structure .
Yet the insurgents are using this decentralized structure very effectively and are not threatened by any U.S. decapitation strike to severely wound the rebellion by killing its leaders .
Deceiving the American public about how badly the war is going .
President Bush continues to talk of victory , and his chief military officer , Gen . Peter Pace , argued that the United States was making very , very good progress  just two days before the more credible U.S. ambassador to Iraq warned that a civil war was possible in Iraq .
President Lyndon Johnson painted an excessively rosy picture of U.S. involvement in Vietnam until the massive communist
Tet offensive against the south in 1968 created a credibility gap in the public mind .
The U.S. and South Vietnamese militaries successfully beat back the offensive , but the war was lost politically because the U.S. government lost the confidence of its own citizens .
The Bush administration has fallen into the same trap by trying to spin away bad news from Iraq .
Polls ominously indicate that Bushs trustworthiness in the eyes of the American public has plummeted more than 20 points since September of 2003 to 40 percent .
The Bush administration , like the Johnson and Nixon administrations , blames the medias negative coverage for plunging popular support of the war .
Yet the nature of the press is that it would rather cover extraordinary negative events , such as fires and plane crashes , than more mundane positive developments .
Vietnam demonstrated that normal media coverage of mistakes in war could undermine the war effort .
The Bush administration should have expected such predictable media coverage .
Artificial government statistics cannot be used to measure progress in a counterinsurgency war .
In Vietnam , the body counts of North Vietnamese / Viet Cong were always much greater than U.S. / South Vietnamese deaths .
Lately , the Bush administration has touted that fewer U.S. personnel are dying in Iraq .
But U.S. forces have been pulled back from the fight to reduce U.S. casualties and to train Iraqi forces .
In guerilla warfare , despite unfavorable statistics , as long as the insurgents keep an army in the field , they can win as the foreign invader tires of the occupation .
The initial excessive use of force in counterinsurgency warfare instead of a plan to win hearts and minds .
The U.S. military , since the days of U.S. Grant , has used superior firepower to win wars of attrition against its enemies .
In Vietnam , the U.S. military used such tactics initially , but later adopted a softer counterinsurgency strategy only after it was too late .
The Bush administration initially blasted towns like Falluja into rubble and only now , in an attempt to reduce support for the guerillas among the already angry population , is converting to a strategy aimed at winning Iraqi hearts and minds .
Failed search and destroy tactics belatedly gave way to the inkblot approach of clearing and holding ground .
In both Vietnam and Iraq , after search and destroy missions , enemy fighters merely returned to areas when victorious  U.S. forces left .
But not enough U.S. forces are in Iraq to make the clear and hold method work .
 Iraqization of the war parallels the unsuccessful  Vietnamization in the 1970s .
The Nixon administration never fully explained how the less capable South Vietnamese military could defeat the insurgency when the powerful U.S. military had failed .
The same problem exists in Iraq .
As in Vietnam , there has been no date certain for withdrawal of U.S. forces .
President Bush recently implied that U.S. forces would be in Iraq when the next president takes office .
Such an indefinite commitment of U.S. forces convinces more Iraqis that the United States is an occupier that needs to be resisted .
Retention of incompetent policymakers .
Lyndon Johnson retained Robert McNamara , the inept architect of the Vietnam strategy , as Secretary of Defense until McNamara himself turned against his own war .
Bush has kept the bungling Donald Rumsfeld on too long in the same position .
Most important of all , starting a war with another country for concocted reasons , which did not hold up under scrutiny .
Lyndon Johnson used a questionable alleged attack by Vietnamese patrol boats on a U.S. destroyer to escalate U.S. involvement in a backwater country that was hardly strategic to the United States .
Bush exaggerated the dangers from Iraqi weapons programs and implied an invented link between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 attacks .
In a republic , the lack of a compelling rationale for sending men to die in a distant war can be corrosive for the morale of the troops and public support back home .
The Bush administration is now suffering for its shocking failure to learn the lessons of the tragedy of Vietnam .
Google , with the cooperation of prestigious libraries , has been digitizing books to make them findable .
The practice excites futurists but angers some publishers .
Of necessity , digitization creates virtual copies .
The publishers claim that such duplication violates copyright , even if the book ’s content is hidden from the public .
The New York Public Library , one of Google ’s partners in the project , recently hosted a public debate on the subject .
Article Continues Below
It was while attending that debate that my discomfort with the hype surrounding an emerging genre of web development turned into a full - blown hate - on .
The big room was packed .
There were more ticket holders than chairs .
Yet the seat in front of me remained empty .
Each time a hopeful standee approached the empty chair — and this happened every few nanoseconds — the poor schmoe seated next to it had to apologetically explain , “ Sorry , the seat is occupied . ”
It soon became clear that the kindly schmoe was reserving the seat , not for a friend or colleague , but for a stranger who had imposed that duty on him .
While the kindly fellow defended the other man ’s throne against a steady stream of resentful ticket holders , the stranger was off somewhere knocking back the library ’s free champagne .
I wondered what kind of jackass would ask someone he did n’t know to save his seat for thirty minutes at an oversold event .
When he finally arrived , I found out .
A taste of ass#section2
“ Were you at the Web 2.0 conference ? ” the arriving man asked , by way of thanking the other for saving his place .
The kindly schmoe signified in the negative .
This was all the encouragement our man needed to launch into an adjective - rich and fact - poor monologue that was loud enough for half the room to hear .
It soon appeared that “ Web 2.0 ” was not only bigger than the Apocalypse but also more profitable .
Profitable , that is , for investors like the speaker .
Yet the new gold rush must not be confused with the dot - com bubble of the 1990s :
“ Web 1.0 was not disruptive .
You understand ?
Web 2.0 is totally disruptive .
You know what XML is ?
You ’ve heard about well - formedness ?
Okay .
So anyway — ”
And on it ran , like a dentist ’s drill in the Gulag .
At first I tolerated the pain by mentally modifying the famous scene from Annie Hall :
HIM : “ I teach a venture capitalist workshop , so I think my insights into XML have a great deal of validity . ”
ME : “ Oh , really ?
Because I happen to have Mr. Bray right here . ”
Later I gnawed my knuckles .
At some point , in a kind of fever , I may have moaned .
Blessedly , at last the lights dimmed and the night ’s real speakers redeemed the evening .
But the ass whose braying I ’d endured left a bad taste .
Less noise , more signal #section3
Let us now define and disclaim .
The jerk at the library event was in love with his own noise , and the problem with noise is that it interferes with signals .
What is the signal ?
What , if anything , does “ Web 2.0 ” mean ?
What is the good thing that the hype risks obscuring ?
Well , there are several good things , it seems to me .
Some small teams of sharp people — people who once , perhaps , worked for those with dimmer visions — are now following their own muses and designing smart web applications .
Products like Flickr and Basecamp are fun and well - made and easy to use .
That may not sound like much .
But ours is a medium in which , more often than not , big teams have slowly and expensively labored to produce overly complex web applications whose usability was near nil on behalf of clients with at best vague goals .
The realization that small , self - directed teams powered by Pareto ’s Principle can quickly create sleeker stuff that works better is not merely bracing but dynamic .
As 100 garage bands sprang from every Velvet Underground record sold , so the realization that one small team can make good prompts 100 others to try .
The best and most famous of these new web products ( i.e. the two I just mentioned ) foster community and collaboration , offering new or improved modes of personal and business interaction .
By virtue of their virtues , they own their categories , which is good for the creators , because they get paid .
It is also good for our industry , because the prospect of wealth inspires smart developers who once passively took orders to start thinking about usability and design , and to try to solve problems in a niche they can own .
In so doing , some of them may create jobs and wealth .
And even where the payday is smaller , these developers can raise the design and usability bar .
This is good for everyone .
If consumers can choose better applications that cost less or are free , then the web works better , and clients are more likely to request good ( usable , well - designed ) work instead of the usual schlock .
Of this they spin#section4
In addition to favoring simpler solutions built by leaner teams , the stuff labeled “ Web 2.0 ” tends to have technological commonalities .
On the back end , it is most often powered by open source technologies like PHP or ( especially ) Ruby on Rails .
On the front end , it is mainly built with web standards — CSS for layout , XML for data , XHTML for markup , JavaScript and the DOM for behavior — with a little Microsoft stuff thrown in .
When web standards with a little Microsoft stuff thrown in are used to create pages that can interact with the server without refreshing , the result is web apps that feel peppy and , dare we say it , Flash - like .
In a white paper that actually got read , writer / consultant Jesse James Garrett named what I ’ve just described .
He called it AJAX , and the acronym not only took , it helped interactivity powered by these technologies gain traction in the marketplace .
Here is where the spinners bedazzle the easily confused .
Consider this scenario :
Steven , a young web wiz , has just celebrated his bar mitzvah .
He received a dozen gifts and must write a dozen thank - you notes .
Being webbish , he creates an on - line “ Thank - You Note Generator . ”
Steven shows the site to his friends , who show it to their friends , and soon the site is getting traffic from recipients of all sorts of gifts , not just bar mitzvah stuff .
If Steven created the site with CGI and Perl and used tables for layout , this is the story of a boy who made a website for his own amusement , perhaps gaining social points in the process .
He might even contribute to a SXSW Interactive panel .
But if Steven used AJAX and Ruby on Rails , Yahoo will pay millions and Tim O’Reilly will beg him to keynote .
Who weeps for AJAX ?#section5
We pause but a moment to consider two AJAX - related headaches .
The first afflicts people who make websites .
Wireframing AJAX is a bitch .
The best our agency has come up with is the Chuck Jones approach : draw the key frames .
Chuck Jones had an advantage : he knew what Bugs Bunny was going to do .
We have to determine all the things a user might do , and wireframe the blessed moments of each possibility .
The second problem affects all who use an AJAX - powered site .
If web signifiers and conventions are still in their infancy , then AJAX - related signifiers and conventions are in utero .
I am still discovering features of Flickr .
Not new features — old ones .
You find some by clicking in empty white space .
This is like reading the news by pouring ACME Invisible Ink Detector on all pieces of paper that cross your path until you find one that has words on it .
I am not knocking Flickr .
I love Flickr .
I wish I were as gifted as the people who created it .
I ’m merely pointing out complex design problems that will not be solved overnight or by a single group .
In Ma.gnolia , which is now in beta , we used small icons to indicate that additional actions could be taken and to hint at what those actions might be .
We succeeded to the extent that 16 px by 16 px drawings can communicate such concepts as “ you may edit these words by clicking on them . ”
These problems and others will be solved , most likely by someone reading this page .
One points to these issues mainly to dent a swelling of unthinking euphoria .
We have been down this road before .
When I started designing websites , if the guy on the plane next to me asked what I did , I had to say something like “ digital marketing ” if I wanted to avoid the uncomprehending stare .
A few years later , if I told the passenger beside me I was a web designer , he or she would regard me with a reverence typically reserved for Stanley - Cup - winning Nobel Laureate rock stars .
Then the bubble burst , and the same answer to the same question provoked looks of pity and barely concealed disgust .
I remember meeting a high - rolling entrepreneur in the early 2000s who asked what I did .
I should have told him I hung around playgrounds , stealing children ’s lunch money .
He would have had more respect for that answer .
I hated the bubble .
I hated it when Vanity Fair or New York Magazine treated web agency founders like celebrities .
I hated that mainstream media and the society it informs either ignored the web or mistook it for a high - stakes electronic version of the fashion industry .
When the bubble burst , these same geniuses decided the web was of no interest at all .
Funny , to me it was more interesting than ever .
To me it was people and organizations publishing content that might not otherwise have seen light .
It was small businesses with realistic goals delivering value and growing .
It was traditional publishers finding their way into a new digital medium , helped by folks like you and me .
It was new ways of talking and sharing and loving and selling and healing and being .
Hardly dull .
Eventually the uninformed stopped seeing a wasteland and started seeing bloggers , by which they meant only those bloggers who wrote about politics , most often from the extreme left or right .
The web was “ back ” even though it had never left .
( Of course , the fifth time you hear Wolf Blitzer say “ blogger ” or ask , “ what do the bloggers have to tell us about these still - unfolding events ? ” the joke is stale and you wish those who do n’t get the web would go back to ignoring it . )
But nothing , not even the rants of political bloggers , was as exciting as the scent of money .
As the first properly valued “ Web 2.0 ” properties began to find buyers , a frenzy like the old one popped hideously back to life .
Yahoo spent how much ?
Google bought what ?
Here was real blood in the water .
But how to persuade the other sharks in the tank that this blood feast was different from the previous boom - and - bust ?
Easy : Dismiss everything that came before as “ Web 1.0 . ”
It ’s only castles burning #section7
To you who are toiling over an AJAX – and Ruby - powered social software product , good luck , God bless , and have fun .
Remember that 20 other people are working on the same idea .
So keep it simple , and ship it before they do , and maintain your sense of humor whether you get rich or go broke .
Especially if you get rich .
Nothing is more unsightly than a solemn multi-millionaire .
To you who feel like failures because you spent last year honing your web skills and serving clients , or running a business , or perhaps publishing content , you are special and lovely , so hold that pretty head high , and never let them see the tears .
As for me , I ’m cutting out the middleman and jumping right to Web 3.0 .
Why wait ?

The WHOIS is here .
SAN FRANCISCO --
Google wrote grandly of the importance of Wi-Fi in its recent proposal for free wireless here , but the search company downplayed its own potential role in delivering Internet service .
The proposal , one of 26 responses from interested companies to the city 's request for information and comment on the idea of a citywide wireless Internet service , calls for Google to offer free Wi-Fi service to all residents and visitors .
Advertisements targeted to users ' locations would help support the project , in which other Internet service providers could also buy access wholesale and sell special services to end users , Google said .
" We believe that ubiquitous , affordable Internet access is a crucial aspect of humanitya ??s social and economic development , and that working to supply free Wi-Fi is a major step in that direction , " Google 's response said .
" However , we also believe that there will never be either one form of online connectivity or one company that exclusively provides it . "
Previous Efforts
Some recent news reports have raised the specter of Google muscling in on existing broadband providers through widespread free wireless Internet access , using optical fiber capacity to create a national backbone network .
In its proposal , Google referred to the fiber network , but in a more limited context .
" It takes thousands of computers and miles of fiber optic cable to globally deliver responses to your search queries within fractions of a second , " according to Google .
" We are confident that we can replicate the success of this infrastructure in the world of Wi-Fi for the city of San Francisco . "
San Francisco could be a test bed for location - based applications and services delivered over Wi -Fi , the company notes .
In fact , Google already is working with partners to provide free Wi-Fi in some parts of the city , and it offers access in a few locations near its Mountain View , California , headquarters .
Feeva , a software company in San Francisco that submitted its own response to the city 's request , said it joined with Google and the city in March to create two free municipal wireless networks .
Feeva 's software can identify the location of a user on a wireless network , the device being used for access , and preferences provided by the user , according to its submission .
By providing that data to advertisers -- while preserving the user 's anonymity -- the service provider can generate enough revenue to cover the cost of the network , according to Feeva .
Google 's Pitch
Google proposed to build an IEEE 802.11b/g Wi -Fi mesh network that delivers more than 1 megabit per second of capacity throughout the city .
Anyone in the city could get access free at speeds as high as 300 kilobits per second , and Google or third parties could sell access at higher speeds , possibly as high as 3 mbps .
The 300 kbps free service could be reached at street level , in the front room of a home or business , and on the first few floors of a building .
Consumers might be encouraged to use customer premises equipment for better indoor reception , Google said .
The city would give Google access to about 1900 lamp posts for placing access points , which would also be located on some buildings .
Google would also provide a separate virtual LAN for municipal agencies ' own traffic to help ensure delivery and mitigate congestion .
The city could use it free at 300 kbps .
Wireless Facilities , an engineering , network services , and technical outsourcing company in San Diego , would design and deploy the network , according to Google 's proposal .
The network would eventually support 802.11n , the future wireless LAN technology designed for more than 100 mbps throughput , once that is available , Google said .
Other Proposals
In October , San Francisco sought comments from the public as well as information from potential builders or operators of a service .
After responses came in early this month , Mayor Gavin Newsom said a committee would study the input for about three weeks and present its findings to him .
After that , the city will request actual plans and bids to provide a service .
The city could adopt one proposal or put together its own plan from parts of several proposals .
If the political process goes smoothly , a service could go live within five or six months , Newsom said .
Though Google 's plan has drawn the most attention , other plans were also posted .
EarthLink , which recently won the contract to provide Philadelphia 's municipal wireless network , proposed offering 1 mbps residential broadband for less than $ 20 per month , with subsidies for lower cost service to economically disadvantaged residents .
EarthLink would finance , own , deploy , and operate the network but also sell wholesale access to third - party providers .
MetroFi said it would build a Wi -Fi mesh network for a free , advertising - supported best - effort public service and a $ 19.95 per month , 1 mbps symmetric residential broadband service .
A pre-WiMax mesh network would provide service at up to 3 mbps to businesses .
Both networks would be built at no cost to the city .
Motorola would use Wi-Fi on unlicensed frequencies for consumer and public service access along with licensed frequencies for a public safety network that could be used in vehicles at more than 100 miles per hour .
ISPs could buy access wholesale and offer a variety of services on the public network .
SFLan , a nonprofit project of the Internet Archive that has been providing free Wi-Fi in the city since 1998 , proposed an " exchange " to connect many wireless ISPs and community organizations that provide service .
Solar - powered access points with wireless backbone connections would allow the citywide local network to keep working at a reduced capacity in case of disaster , SFLan said .
The city 's exchange network could be paid for by general funds or a bond issue .
It estimates an infrastructure covering 95 percent of the city would cost less than $ 1 million .
It opposes the use of captive portals for signing on to the network , because it envisions non-Web uses such as Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) and video cameras .
Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss
Pete Townshend
Record labels are only as good as the acts they record and release .
No executive ever sold a record at Best Buy , never mind a download at iTunes .
In this crazy fucked - up world we live in somehow the execs think THEY are the artists .
Artistry is not something that can be quantified .
Nor is it something that can be learned .
Artists are born .
And are developed outside the educational system .
Just ask Bruce Springsteen .
As for " American Idol " , that ’s about stars , not artists .
One thing we ’re sure of , those in power now , those into the perks and the fame more than the music , will not rule in the future .
Oh , the artists of yore NEEDED the label exec to get his music heard .
Those days are through .
I ’d say if you ’re looking to get into business with one of these pricks , who cares not a whit if YOUR album sells just as long as SOME album on his label does , then you ’re a laughable specimen .
If only major labels nurtured artists .
Gave them money and told them to create .
That they believed in them .
That they would support anything they did .
God , those days ended in the seventies .
Now the exec wants to tell you how to look , what to record and what your album package should look like .
And , if you COMPLAIN , like an asshole parent , they say THEY’RE FOOTING THE BILL !
Tony Brummel signed some successful acts .
As a result , he could get major label heads on the phone .
Because they wanted his market share , so THEIR market share could improve .
They did n’t give a shit what kind of music he was releasing , how long it would ultimately last , they just wanted a momentary bump in their numbers .
To get them through until the next year , when they could attempt to pull another rabbit out of their hat .
As for the acts Mr. Brummel purveys …
Does anybody believe he ’s got Led Zeppelin or the Eagles , never mind the Beatles or the Stones ?
Does anybody believe Hawthorne Heights will be selling gold in catalog ten years from now ?
Mr. Brummel made it on hard work .
But now , like an exec who starts a company but ca n’t manage it when it becomes successful , his street - style is revealing him to be a boor who behaves in a way that results in all no longer taking him seriously .
Tony .
So you paid for some endcaps .
You ’re in bed with the " Hits " guys .
Tell me again what ’s so revolutionary about your operation ?
And now you want Steve Jobs to bend over backward and give you something nobody else gets because you ASKED for it ?
Especially after you declared that the iTunes Music Store was the death of the industry , that it would decimate the album ?
Come on .
Business is a negotiation .
Of two parties who each have something the other desires .
Apple desires Victory ’s music .
It ’s willing to pay for it .
But nothing beyond what it pays anybody else .
No premium is required because there ’s no extreme benefit to Apple !
Everybody knows this except Tony .
But his acts are not getting iTunes revenue as he plays the blowhard week after week .
To be respected , an executive must FIRST AND FOREMOST be a friend to the artist .
Talk to acts on Victory .
Ask about Tony putting samplers of other acts on his label in with their product , about insisting his other acts be on tour with them or otherwise he wo n’t pay them .
This is n’t friendliness , this is MORRIS LEVY TIME !
An artist - friendly label is a midwife to its acts ’ music .
That ’s its sole goal .
To help ease the creation of great music and get it to as many people as possible .
Tony , is n’t it time for you to admit fault ?
Is n’t it time for you to put forth a manifesto detailing what YOU will or wo n’t do ?
Is n’t it time to put the focus on VICTORY instead of blaming everybody else ?
Great music sells itself .
Put your shit on iTunes .
Tell everybody you made a mistake .
Say Jobs is good for your business .
And then SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT IT !
Furthermore , Victory is n’t the number one independent label , not even close .
The Republican War on Science
Science , we imagine , is the realm of objective disinterested geniuses reporting back the findings from their expensive equipment , telling us truths about the world .
Politics , on the other hand , is seen as the place for sleazy and corrupt jerks who lie to us in everything they do and try to make everything fit their existing worldviews .
So is it any surprise that when the two things meet we ’re in for a show ?
Journalist Chris Mooney has made a name for himself by writing magazine articles that make this intersection , especially under the Bush administration , entertaining .
He ’s recently released his first book , The Republican War on Science , which tries to combine the various individual stories into a damning case of science politicization .
The book tackles a variety of subjects , including :
global warming
nutrition guidelines
fishing regulations
evolution
embryonic stem cells
safe sex
Each one gets a chapter written in the style of a magazine article ( indeed , many have been published as magazine articles ) , opening with an interesting person or event and expanding to show how a group of Bush backers ( drawn from major industry and the religious right ) have concocted their own psuedoscience in an attempt to spread confusion about the truth , with a particular focus on its effects in Washington , where Mooney is based .
Mooney bookends these stories with some more general thoughts about the relations of conservatives and science .
The book has been something of a surprise success , recently making it onto the New York Times bestseller list , and Mooney has been busy doing a book tour for it .
I went to see him when he spoke just down the street at Porter Square Books and talked to him a bit afterwards as he signed my copy .
The audience was interested and engaged .
I suspect a lot of it was typical anger at the Bush administration ( or “ the neocon radicals up in Washington and the media ” as the angry sort who call in to radio shows and so on always seem to put it ) , but I think this particular issue strikes at the heart of people ’s dislike for the administration : the administration refuses to go along with reality , even in its most pure form .
The book itself is a respectable and highly readable ( I went through it in a day ’s free time ) piece of work , although I could not help but feel a little disappointed .
In an apparent attempt to gain respectability , Mooney adopts a detached journalistic — almost legalistic — style .
While Mooney does n’t pull any punches factually — he will call a lie a lie and refuses to be pulled into the trap of equating conservative science abuses with liberal ones — such a style lacks the verve of Mooney ’s more strident online writing , such as when he wrote about Michael Crichton ’s global warming denialist novel State of Fear :
Let ’s face it :
Such writing is pure porn for global warming deniers , in much the same way that fictional accounts of UFO abduction skeptics converting into true believers titillate UFO fans . [… ]
By the book ’s end , one can only ask :
What planet is Michael Crichton living on ?
Because this one is clearly getting warmer .
( cite )
By comparison , Mooney ’s book - long exposé of numerous indidents of Bush administration distortion and dishonesty concludes more like this :
these considerations all suggest science politicization has reached a nadir with the Bush administration [ … ]
Considered this way , Bush administration abuses and distortions of science come to look more and more like a large - scale political strategy .
( 241f )
And despite Mooney ’s attempts at moderation and fairness , he has n’t won any favors from the press .
Publishers Weekly , in a favorable review , called it “ very readable , and understandably partisan ” while the Washington Post attacked it as “ surprisingly unconvincing ” , “ polemic[al ] ” , and “ a kind of conspiracy theory ” .
Since the mainstream was apparently ready to consider the book partisan no matter the style , Mooney probably would have been better off writing a little more strongly .
But what about conservative readers ?
At the book signing , someone asked Mooney if he thought the book would reach them .
Mooney doubted that any of the relevant politicians would actually read it .
‘ But , you know , maybe someone will say to them , “ Things have gotten so bad that there ’s now a book claiming we ’re at war with science ! ” ’ he said .
‘ Maybe that will have some effect . ’

The new MacBook comes with what Apple calls a " 13.3 - inch glossy widescreen display . "
The key word there is " glossy , " and it serves as a warning to the scant few Mac users who immediately know what it means in this context .
In recent years , PC laptops have started sprouting LCD screens with shiny surfaces .
Glossy , you might say .
It started with just a few models .
Today , you 'll be hard - pressed to find any PC laptops with non-glossy screens at your local Best Buy or Circuit City .
Meanwhile , Apple 's laptops have stuck with their traditional matte - finish screens .
That 's changed with the introduction of the MacBook and its glossy display .
The MacBook Pro now has a glossy display option as well .
So , what 's the big deal ?
Consider some synonyms for the word " glossy . "
Gleaming .
Shiny .
Reflective .
Now you 're getting it .
When the screen is off , it 's basically a mirror .
Fine .
Who cares what it looks like when it 's off , right ?
Let 's boot this baby up and bask in the glow of our lustrous , glistening , shimmering screen !
Is that a staircase ?
Windows or fluorescent lights ?
You decide .
These pictures demonstrate why so many Mac users read the phrase " glossy display " with a heavy heart .
Reflections !
Glare !
These are not good things !
I did n't have hunt for these pictures , by the way .
They were taken from the very first " unofficial " set of MacBook photos that I saw on the web today .
This is really what this kind of screen looks like .
When they say " glossy , " they mean it .
Glossy displays have effectively taken over the entire laptop market .
Why are they so popular ?
Here are three possible reasons .
They are better than matte - finish displays .
They are cheaper than matte - finish displays .
People are idiots .
Before we look at the whole market , let 's briefly consider only Apple , the latecomer to the shiny screen party .
Why did Apple go glossy ?
When answering that question , reason number two looks very persuasive .
If the entire PC laptop market has moved to glossy displays , it may be difficult for Apple to find anyone to sell them matte - finish displays at all , let alone sell them at competitive prices .
But I do n't know how different the manufacturing process is for glossy and matte - finish screens .
Maybe it 's trivial to make one or the other in the same plant .
More broadly speaking , I suppose it 's possible that glossy displays are somehow inherently cheaper to manufacture than matte - finish displays — enough so that the entire industry switched over .
Again , I do n't know enough about the actual manufacturing process to definitively rule this out , but my gut tells me that it 's unlikely .
As for reason number one , that glossy displays are " better " than matte - finish displays , I must rule by fiat .
For any reasonable definition of " better " that I can think of , the answer is a big , fat , " no . "
Maybe you do n't think glare is an issue .
Maybe you always view the screen head - on in perfectly diffuse lighting .
Maybe you think the benefits of the glossy screen outweigh the drawbacks .
Whatever the reason , we 'll just have to agree to disagree on this issue .
You can probably stop reading now .
Now we come to reason number three : people are idiots .
Put another way , people like shiny things .
When the glossy screens first started to appear in Best Buy and CompUSA , the contrast with their non-glossy brethren was striking .
Walking into the laptop aisle , your eye was immediately drawn to the glossy displays .
Aside from the shine , there 's also a perceptible difference in sharpness and color saturation on glossy screens .
These things stand out .
In " shopping mode , " this is all people see .
Shiny , saturated , sharp .
Customers are n't trying to read the screens or move the laptops to different locations in different kinds of lighting .
Shopping is almost always an emotional experience , not a rational one .
The fallout is predictable , particularly in the world of retail electronics .
I 'll just give my two favorite examples .
Electronics departments usually have the products out on the floor or lined up against a wall , grouped by product type .
This makes " comparison shopping " easy .
People like to compare ; it makes them feel more confident about their decisions .
Confident people spend .
Unfortunately , people are lousy at making sensible comparisons .
Take televisions , for my first example .
When comparison shopping for TVs of a given size , there is one picture quality attribute that dominates all others : brightness .
Brighter TVs " look better . "
Differences in color saturation , uniformity , sharpness , black level , you name it , can all be overshadowed by cranking up the brightness on one TV .
You can take out a video essentials DVD and " prove " that one TV has better objective picture quality than another , and people will still insist that you 're wrong and proceed to buy the brighter TV instead .
The second example is the world of speakers .
The rule here is similar .
Louder speakers " sound better . "
This one is even more crushing .
You can make nearly anyone buy anything in one of those " listening rooms " by simply making one set of speakers slightly louder than another .
Incidentally , you can also see this in the recording industry .
The volume of recorded music has been creeping up for years .
Music on modern CDs is compressed to an absurd degree , destroying the dynamic range in order to increase the overall volume .
Different product , same principle : louder " sounds better . "
Back to shiny laptop screens .
It seems pretty obvious to me that shiny " looks better , " and that 's why it 's taken over the laptop market .
This makes me sad , and not a little bitter .
Thus , reason number three .
People are idiots .
I declare it the winner !
I can't really rule out the cost issue without more information , of course .
But for now , I 'm sticking with the idiot theory .
With that premise , let 's try to assign blame for the MacBook glossy conversion .
There 's an idiot here somewhere , but maybe it's not the consumer this time .
Mac users are an odd bunch .
We 've been buying matte - finish laptops long after the PC laptop world went glossy , and there has n't exactly been any outcry over the " gloss gap . "
So it seems to me that Mac users are not the idiots here , demanding shiny screens on their various < blank > Books for emotional reasons .
We 've set aside cost for the sake of argument , and we 've eliminated the idiot consumer as a factor .
Only Apple itself is left .
The long - standing tradition of Apple punditry demands that Apple be personified in the form of one Steve Jobs , and so I will now consider the possibility that all blame for the GlossBook and GlossBook Pro lies entirely on him .
Jobs has proven time and again that he 's willing to place superficial perception well above more practical concerns .
If he thinks that shiny screens " look better , " then it 's not so far - fetched to imagine that he initiated the move to glossy screens .
I certainly would n't put it past him .
So , to sum up .
Glossy screens : bad .
People : idiots .
Steve Jobs : insane .
This post : too long .
Blah .
I 've made some updates to the Scheme in Javascript library .
You can run it at the jsscheme page .
I 've split out the example scheme source and made it loadable via Ajax .
To do this I use jQuery , a very nice Javascript library .
I added a Scheme wrapper around the Ajax GET call so you can do code like this :
( ajax - get " example.scm " ( lambda ( result ) ( alert result ) ) )
The more interesting change is a simple concurrency library giving lightweight threads that run in the browser .
The API loosely follows that of Termite , a concurrent Scheme .
It uses '!' for sending a message to a process and '? ' to receive .
To use the library click on the ' currency ' button .
This will load the source via Ajax .
Then press ' eval ' .
Once loaded you can start using it .
There are some examples in the concurrency .scm file .
For example , a ' logger ' process :
( define logger ( spawn ( lambda ( ) ( let loop ( ( msg ( ? ) ) ) ( if ( string ? msg ) ( begin ( process - msg msg ) ( loop ( ? ) ) ) ) ) ( process -msg " Logger exiting " ) ) ) )
This loops waiting for a message in the process queue .
When it appears it displays it and then waits for more messages .
Any non-string message quits the process .
An example of using it :
( define ( logger - test ) ( spawn ( lambda ( ) (! logger " Hello " ) (! logger " World " ) (! logger ' quit ) ) ) )
I 've also done an example of concurrency using Ajax .
An ' ajax - process ' waits for requests of the form '( FROM URL ) .
When received it will retrieve the URL using Ajax and send the result to the FROM process :
( define ajax - process ( spawn ( lambda ( ) ( let loop ( ( msg ( ? ) ) ) ( let* ( ( from ( car msg ) ) ( url ( cadr msg ) ) ) ( ajax - get url ( lambda ( result ) (! from result ) ) ) ) ( loop ( ? ) ) ) ) ) )
Using it is simple :
( alert ( !? ajax - process `( , current - process " example.scm " ) ) )
This uses '!? ' which sends a message and immediately waits for the result .
You do n't have to send to the current process .
The next example instructs the Ajax process to send it to the log window :
( define ( ajax - test2 ) ( spawn ( lambda ( ) (! ajax - process `( , logger " example.scm " ) ) (! ajax - process `( , logger " concurrency.scm " ) ) ) ) )
All this runs within the browser .
Unfortunately it 's not fast as it's interpreted .
The JIT compiler does not work on Firefox and even if it did , it does not work with continuations which the concurrency system is based on .
I 'll look into improving this over time .
Antarctic family values :
Is the emperor penguin an enemy of Darwin ?
America 's surprise film hit was meant to be a nature documentary .
Now it 's a pawn in the war on evolutionary theory
In the following article we misquoted Steve Jones , professor of Genetics at University College , London , mentioning a malaria ' virus ' .
Malaria is , in fact , caused not by a virus but by a protozoan parasite .
Apologies .
It is an odyssey to rival Scott 's in the Antarctic , albeit with a happier ending .
Fierce snowstorms rage , icy blasts flick across the screen .
March of the Penguins , an epic nature documentary with a cast of thousands , was the surprise usurper of summer blockbusters at the American box office and is tipped to be the hit family film in Britain this Christmas .
To many , it will be no more nor less than a life - affirming portrayal of Mother Nature , reminiscent of Sunday - evening television with Sir David Attenborough whispering from the undergrowth .
To some , however , the mesmerising images of birds waddling , mating and nurturing their young have become cinema 's most politically charged parable since Michael Moore 's Fahrenheit 9/1 .
Conservatives in America claim to have seen God in the emperor penguin .
They have rejoiced in the way the film shows penguins as monogamous upholders of traditional family values .
They presumably welcomed the screenwriters ' decision not to pursue arguments about climate change .
They have even pointed to the heroically resourceful penguins - blinded by blizzards , buffeted by gales , yet winning against the odds - as proof of ' intelligent design ' , the religious belief system that aims to challenge Darwin 's theory of evolution .
Audiences and critics of the £ 4.4 million French - made film have found themselves uplifted by the sight of emperor penguins trudging 70 miles , in single file , to their breeding ground during the harsh Antarctic winter in temperatures of - 40C .
The creatures ' comical gait and tuxedo - like plumage have amused children , while their fortitude and tenderness in raising their offspring have had parents sighing in recognition .
One reviewer gushed : ' It 's impossible to watch the thousands of penguins huddled together against the icy Antarctic blasts ... without feeling a tug of anthropomorphic kinship . '
Now America 's religious right has weighed in .
Film critic Michael Medved was quoted by the New York Times calling it ' the motion picture this summer that most passionately affirms traditional norms like monogamy , sacrifice and child - rearing ' .
Speaking of audiences in America 's heartland who often feel snubbed by liberal Hollywood , he added : ' This is the first movie they 've enjoyed since The Passion of the Christ .
This is The Passion of the Penguins . '
As happened with Mel Gibson 's Christian blockbuster , churches have block - booked cinemas and organised visits for their members .
The 153 House Churches Network in Sidney , Ohio , runs a March of the Penguins Leadership Workshop after screenings of the film .
Its website , www.lionsofgod.com, provides a form that can be downloaded and taken to the cinema .
It advises : ' Please use the notebook , flashlight and pen provided to write down what God speaks to you . '
Ben Hunt , a minister at the network , said of the penguins ' struggle for survival : ' Some of the circumstances they experienced seemed to parallel those of Christians .
The penguin is falling behind , like some Christians are falling behind .
The path changes every year , yet they find their way , like the Holy Spirit . '
A contributor to the Christian Science Monitor wrote : ' The penguins ' way of life has illustrated to me some aspects of how God is parenting us . '
On WorldNetDaily.com , a conservative website , an opponent of abortion wrote that the film ' verified the beauty of life and the rightness of protecting it ' .
Rich Lowry , editor of National Review , told a conference of young Republicans : ' Penguins are the really ideal example of monogamy .
The dedication of these birds is amazing .'
The 80 - minute film - which grossed £ 37 m in the US , the second - highest total by a documentary - movingly shows female penguins laying a single egg , then trekking back to the ocean to feed , while the males keep the eggs cradled on their feet , huddling together for warmth during a two - month vigil without food .
The female must return in time to feed her hatchling for it to survive , at which point it is the starving male 's turn to make the 70 - mile trek to the sea .
Andrew Coffin , writing in the Christian publication World Magazine , said such miracles of nature were evidence that life is too complex to have arisen through Darwinian random selection : ' That any one of these eggs survives is a remarkable feat - and , some might suppose , a strong case for intelligent design .
It 's sad that acknowledgment of a creator is absent in the examination of such strange and wonderful animals .
But it 's also a gap easily filled by family discussion after the film . '
The only contradiction of the Bible in March of the Penguins is near the beginning , when the narrator says : ' For millions of years , they have made their home on the darkest , driest , windiest and coldest continent on earth .
And they 've done so pretty much alone . '
But the film 's makers say they are strong believers in evolution , and its American distributors , Warner Independent Pictures and National Geographic Feature Films , insist that it is simply a tale about penguins .
Laura Kim , a vice - president of Warner Independent , said : ' You know what ?
They 're just birds .'
Adam Leipzig , president of National Geographic Feature Films , said : ' These penguins are model parents .
What they go through to look after their children is phenomenal , and no parent who sees it will ever complain again about the school run .
There are parallels with human nature and it is moving to see . '
Leipzig pointed out that this species of penguin , the emperor , is usually monogamous for a year , but not for life : the following year , it takes a different partner .
He added : ' People read it into what they want .
There are universal truths about parenting and bonding with offspring , but it 's not a film with a political and social agenda .
When we put the English - language version together , we never once had a discussion about social , religious or cultural points of view .
We wanted to get the audience involved to follow the penguins ' lives . '
The film 's director , Luc Jaquet , a French biologist who shot 140 hours of footage on land and 30 hours underwater , added : ' It 's obvious that global warming has an impact on the reproduction of the penguins .
But much of public opinion appears insensitive to the dangers of global warming .
We have to find other ways to communicate to people about it .'
Scientists in Britain , where the film will premiere at next month 's London Film Festival , with general release in December , dismissed the intelligent design lobby 's expropriation of the film .
Steve Jones , professor of genetics at University College London and an atheist , said : ' I find it sad that people with intrinsically foolish viewpoints do n't recognise this as a naturally beautiful film , but have to attach their absurd social agendas to it .
' The problem with intelligent design is that there is no conceivable observation in nature that can disprove the idea .
It 's not part of science , which is why scientists are not interested in it .
A group of penguins standing upright looks like co-operation , but in fact the ones on the outside are struggling to get in and those on the inside are trying to stand their ground : it 's a classic Darwinian struggle .
The idea that the life of a penguin is any more beautiful than that of a malaria virus is absurd .
' Supporters of intelligent design think that if they see something they do n't understand , it must be God ; they fail to recognise that they themselves are part of evolution .
It appeals to ignorance , which is why there is a lot of it in American politics at the moment . '
Penguins : the facts ( and a joke )
There are 17 penguin species , of which the emperor is largest .
Penguins have adapted to more habitats than any other animal , including the frozen wastes of Antarctica and the sandy beaches of Africa .
Penguins cannot fly but , shaped like a torpedo , they can swim about 15 miles per hour .
They spend as much as 75 per cent of their time underwater , searching for food .
Navy pilots in the Falklands conflict reported that penguins craned their necks so far back to watch passing aircraft that they toppled over .
The claim was later disproved by scientists .
Children 's love of penguins owes much to the antics of the TV character Pingu .
There are several websites devoted to penguin jokes .
Among them is http://monyscurry.tripod.com/pengfun.htm which provides the following :
A man driving a van spots a crashed truck , with penguins hopping on it , looking lost .
He takes pity and loads them into his van .
The police see the van and pull it over .
' What 's with the penguins ? '
The man replies : ' I saw them on the road and I picked them up . '
The policeman said : ' Take them to the zoo . '
Later the policeman sees him driving past again with all the penguins in bathing suits .
' I thought I told you to take them to the zoo , ' he says .
' I did , ' said the driver .
' We had so much fun , that I 'm taking them to the beach . '

Nazi Germany 's Graf Zeppelin was launched in 1938
Enlarge Image
A Polish firm searching for oil first detected the wreck in the Baltic Sea , 55 km ( 34 miles ) offshore .
The ship 's whereabouts had been a mystery since the end of World War II .
The navy investigated and said it was 99 % certain that the wreck was the Graf Zeppelin .
The ship , built in 1938 , never saw action in the war .
The navy said it was unlikely that the 250 - metre ( 820 - foot ) wreck would be recovered from the seabed , as it was at a depth of more than 80 metres ( 264 feet ) .
" Technically it 's impossible to pull it out of the water , " a spokesman for the Polish navy , Lieutenant Commander Bartosz Zajda told the Associated Press news agency .
After the oil company Petrobaltic discovered the wreck , the Polish navy mounted a two - day expedition to the site north of the Polish port of Wladyslawowo .
The navy spokesman said there were a number of characteristics matching those of the German warship .
However , the experts were still waiting to find the name on one side of the shipwreck before declaring with absolute certainty that it was that of Graf Zeppelin .
The 33,000 - ton ship , able to reach a speed of 33 knots , fitted Hitler 's grandiose ambitions , but the German U - boats took priority in the battle at sea .
There are conflicting theories about how it was sunk .
Some experts believe the Germans scuttled it in Szczecin ( Stettin ) in April 1945 , just before the Soviet Army captured the city .
Others say the Soviet navy used the ship for target practice and sank it as part of a training exercise in 1947 .
Only part of Hendrix 's performance is in the Woodstock film
Only part of Hendrix 's performance was included in the original Oscar - winning 1970 Woodstock documentary film .
The DVD features uninterrupted footage of Hendrix 's infamous set , which was performed in front of 40,000 people .
Woodstock - billed as " three days of peace and music " - featured some of the biggest names in 1960s rock , including Janis Joplin and The Who .
Iconic event
Hendrix 's set list contained favourites from the Jimi Hendrix Experience - such as Purple Haze , Foxy Lady , Spanish Castle Magic - and the then - unheard songs Jam Back at the House , Izabella and Message to Love .
But it was his surprise rendition of The Star Spangled Banner that became synonymous with the iconic event .
Longtime Hendrix studio album sound engineer Eddie Kramer was brought in to remaster the video footage .
Jimi Hendrix : Live At Woodstock will be released in the UK on 12 September .

Strangely , in a city where it seems that on every block a blue - and - white glazed plaque commemorates a famous event or resident , none marks this spot .
All you can see today , after you leave the Bank station of the London underground , walk a block or two east , and then take a few steps into a courtyard , is a couple of low , nondescript office buildings , an ancient pub , and , on the site itself , 2 George Yard , a glass - and - steel high - rise .
Nothing remains of the bookstore and printing shop that once stood here , or recalls the late afternoon in 1787 when a dozen people - a somber - looking crew , one man in clerical black and most of the others not removing their high - crowned blade hats - filed through its doors and sat down to launch one of the most far - reaching citizens ’ movements of all time .
Cities build monuments to kings and generals , not to people who once gathered in a bookstore .
And yet what these particular citizens did was felt across the world - winning the admiration of the first and greatest student of what today we call civil society .
What they accomplished , Alexis de Tocqueville wrote , was “ something absolutely without precedent in history … .
If you pore over the histories of all peoples , I doubt that you will find anything more extraordinary . ”
To fully grasp how momentous was what began at 2 George Yard , picture the world as it existed in 1787 .
Well over three - quarters of the people on earth are in bondage of one land or another .
In parts of the Americas , slaves far outnumber free people .
African slaves are also scattered widely through much of the Islamic world .
Slavery is routine in most of Africa itself .
In India and other parts of Asia , some people are outright slaves , others in debt bondage that ties them to a particular landlord as harshly as any slave to a Southern plantation owner .
In Russia the majority of the population are serfs .
Nowhere is slavery more firmly rooted than in Britain ’s overseas empire , where some half - million slaves are being systematically worked to an early death growing West Indian sugar .
Caribbean slave - plantation fortunes underlie many a powerful dynasty , from the ancestors of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to the family of the fabulously wealthy William Beckford , lord mayor of London , who hired Mozart to give his son piano lessons .
One of the most prosperous sugar plantations on Barbados is owned by the Church of England .
Furthermore , Britain ’s ships dominate the slave trade , delivering tens of thousands of chained captives each year to French , Dutch , Spanish , and Portuguese colonies as well as to its own .
If you had proposed , in the London of early 1787 , to change all of this , nine out of ten people would have laughed you off as a crackpot .
The 10th might have admitted that slavery was unpleasant but said that to end it would wreck the British Empire ’s economy .
It would be as if , today , you maintained that the automobile must go .
One in ten listeners might agree that the world would be better off if we traveled instead by foot , bicycle , electric train , or trolley , but are you suggesting a political movement to ban cars ?
Come on , be serious !
Looking back , however , what is even more surprising than slavery ’s scope is how swiftly it died .
By the end of the 19th century , slavery was , at least on paper , outlawed almost everywhere .
Every American schoolchild learns about the Underground Railroad and the Emancipation Proclamation .
But our self - centered textbooks often skip over the fact that in the superpower of the time slavery ended a full quarter - century earlier .
For more than two decades before the Civil War , the holiday celebrated most fervently by free blacks in the American North was not July 4 ( when they were at risk of attack from drunken white mobs ) but August 1 , Emancipation Day in the British Empire .
Jettisoning “ Cargo ”
On March 18 , 1783 , the Morning Chronicle and London Advertiser carried a short letter to the editor about a case being heard in a London courtroom .
The item caught the eye of a former slave living in England , Olaudah Equiano .
Horrified , he ran immediately to see an Englishman he knew , Granville Sharp , an eccentric pamphleteer and known opponent of slavery .
Sharp recorded in his diary that Equiano “ called on me , with an account of one hundred and thirty Negroes being thrown alive into the sea . ”
Months earlier , under Captain Luke Collingwood , the ship Zong had sailed from Africa for Jamaica with some 440 slaves , many of whom had already been on board for weeks .
Head winds , spells of calm , and bad navigation ( Collingwood mistook Jamaica for another island and sailed right past it ) stretched the transatlantic voyage to twice the usual length .
Packed tightly into a vessel of only 107 tons , slaves began to sicken .
Collingwood was worried , for a competent captain was expected to deliver his cargo in reasonable health , and , of course , dead or dying slaves brought no profits .
There was a way out , however .
If Collingwood could claim that slaves had died for reasons totally beyond his control , insurance - at £ 30 per slave - would cover the loss .
Collingwood ordered his officers to throw the sickest slaves into the ocean .
If ever questioned , he told them , they were to say that due to the unfavorable winds , the ship ’s water supply was running out .
If water had been running out , these murders would be accepted under the principle of “ jettison ” in maritime law : A captain had a right to throw some cargo - in this case , slaves - overboard to save the remainder .
In all , 133 slaves were “ jettisoned ” in several batches ; the last group started to fight back and 26 of them were tossed over the side with their arms still shackled .
When the Zong ’s owners later filed an insurance claim for the value of the dead slaves , it equaled more than half a million dollars in today ’s money , and the insurance company disputed the claim .
The moment Equiano showed him the newspaper article , Granville Sharp leaped into action .
He hired lawyers , went to court , and personally interviewed at least one member of the ship ’s crew and a passenger .
But the shocking thing about the Zong case - as much to Equiano and Sharp then as to us now - is that after more than a hundred human beings had been flung to their deaths , this was not a homicide trial .
It was a civil insurance dispute .
Sharp tried and failed to get the Zong ’s owners prosecuted for murder .
But he fired off a passionate salvo of outraged letters about the case to everyone he could think of .
One letter apparently reached a prominent clergyman , who , the following year , became vice chancellor - the equivalent of an American university ’s president - of Cambridge .
Disturbed by what he had heard , he put to use one of the most powerful tools at his command :
He made the morality of slavery the subject of the annual Cambridge Latin essay contest .
Latin and Greek competitions were a centerpiece of British university life .
To win a major one was like winning a Rhodes scholarship or the Heisman trophy today ; the honor would be bracketed with your name for a lifetime .
One entrant in the Latin contest was a 25 - year - old divinity student named Thomas Clarkson .
He had no previous interest in slavery whatever , he later wrote , but only “ the wish of …obtaining literary honour . ”
Unexpectedly , however , as he read everything he could find , studied the papers of a slave trader who had recently died , and interviewed officers who had seen slavery firsthand in the Americas , Clarkson found himself overcome :
“ In the day - time I was uneasy .
In the night I had little rest .
I sometimes never closed my eye - lids for grief … .
I always slept with a candle in my room , that I might rise out of bed and put down such thoughts as might occur to me …conceiving that no arguments … should be lost in so great a cause . ”
He won first prize .
When it was awarded in June 1785 , Clarkson read his essay aloud in Latin to an audience in Cambridge ’s elegant Senate House ; then , his studies finished , already wearing the black garb of a deacon , he headed off toward London and a promising church career .
But he found , to his surprise , that it was slavery itself that “ wholly engrossed my thoughts … .
Coming in sight of Wades Mill in Hertfordshire , I sat down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside and held my horse .
Here a thought came into my mind , that if the contents of the Essay were true , it was time some person should see these calamities to their end . ”
“ A Fire of Indignation Kindling Within Me ”
It was time some person should see these calamities to their end .
If there is a single point at which the anti-slavery movement in the British Empire became inevitable , it is the moment Thomas Clarkson got off his horse and sat down beside the road .
When he remounted and rode onward to London , it was with the determination , first of all , to publish his essay in English .
In the office of one well - known London publisher , he was dismayed that the man was interested only because the essay had won a prize .
Clarkson , by contrast , “ wished the Essay to find its way …among such as would think and act with me . ”
He had just left the publisher ’s office when , on the street , he ran into a Quaker friend of his family ’s .
The Quakers were the only religious denomination that had come out against slavery , and the man said Clarkson was just the person he was looking for :
Why had n’t he published that essay of his ?
Together , they walked a few blocks to the bookstore and printing shop of James Phillips , in George Yard , in the warren of narrow curving streets of London ’s business district .
Bookselling , publishing , and printing usually happened under the same roof in those days ( with the printer ’s family often living upstairs and perhaps a cow or pig or two in the back yard ) , and this was the work that Phillips did for Britain ’s small Quaker community .
Clarkson took an immediate liking to him , and on the spot said Phillips could publish the essay .
This was the day Clarkson discovered that he was not alone .
With ferocious determination , he now dedicated himself to finding out everything he could about slavery .
Many ships sailed for Africa from the docks along the Thames , and after climbing on board and exploring one , he wrote , “ I found soon afterwards a fire of indignation kindling within me . ”
He systematically visited anyone with firsthand information : merchants , sea captains , army and navy officers .
With the instincts of a good reporter , “ I made it a rule to put down in writing , after every conversation , what had taken place . ”
The key people he would have to work with were clearly the Quakers ; they were rock - firm in their convictions , and they had a small but dedicated network around the country .
To them , it was clear that Clarkson was a godsend :
He was young , brimming with energy , and , above all , he was a member of the all - powerful Church of England .
The major reason the Quakers ’ anti-slavery efforts had so far accomplished nothing was simply because they were Quakers .
People mocked them as oddballs who said “ thee ” and “ thou , ” who refused to take off their distinctive black hats except when preaching or praying , and who refused to use the names of the months or the days of the week because these derived from Roman or pagan gods instead of from the Bible .
To influence public opinion , the Quakers needed a talented Anglican willing to devote all his energy to the movement , and in Clarkson , at last , they had one .
Together , Clarkson and his Quaker allies carefully planned a broad organization from both faiths .
“ Went to town on my mare to attend a committee of the Slave Trade now instituted , ” wrote one Quaker in his diary .
In the late afternoon of May 22 , 1787 , the group of a dozen men officially assembled for the first time , at James Phillips ’ bookstore and printing shop .
Probably the printers had gone home for the day , so there would have been no clanking flatbed press , but large sheets of uncut book pages would have been hanging from overhead wooden racks in the ceiling , the ink drying .
The committee targeted the slave trade , rather than slavery itself , because abolishing the first seemed within easier political reach and it also seemed likely to eventually end the second .
West Indian slavery was by every measure far deadlier than slavery almost anywhere else .
Cultivating sugar by hand , under a broiling sun , was - and still is - one of the hardest forms of labor on earth .
Tropical diseases were rampant ; the slaves ’ diet was much worse than in the American South ; they died younger ; they had far fewer children .
The death rate on the brutal Caribbean plantations was so high that the slave population would have been dropping by up to 3 percent a year if it were not for the steady shipments of new slaves from Africa .
Stop the trade , abolitionists were - naively - convinced , and slavery itself would in the long run become impossible .
The committee now had to ignite its crusade in a country where the overwhelming majority of people considered slavery totally normal .
Plantation profits gave a major boost to the British economy , and the livelihood of tens of thousands of seamen , merchants , and shipbuilders depended upon the slave trade .
How to even begin the massive job of changing public opinion ?
More than nine out often Englishmen , and all Englishwomen , could not even vote .
Without this most basic right , could they be roused to care about the rights of other people , of a different skin color , an ocean away ?
In all of human experience , there was no precedent for such a campaign .
“ Success to the Trade ”
In June of 1787 , Thomas Clarkson got on his horse again and set off for the big slave - ship ports of Bristol and Liverpool .
He was looking for veterans of the trade who could eventually testify before parliamentary hearings .
he would also distribute pamphlets and quietly set up local abolition committees .
Amazingly , for many years to come , he would be the movement ’s only permanent , full - time organizer .
A sense of foreboding came over Clarkson as he approached Bristol : “ The bells of some of the churches were then ringing ; the sound … filled me …with a melancholy … .
I began now to tremble , for the first time , at the arduous task I had undertaken , of attempting to subvert one of the branches of the commerce of the great place which was then before me ….
I questioned whether I should even get out of it alive . ”
This was not , it turned out , an unreasonable fear .
In the autobiographical history of the movement Clarkson later wrote , the very paper seems to burn with his outrage .
When he tracked down information about a massacre of some 300 Africans by British slave traders on the coast of what is today Nigeria , he wrote , “ It made … my blood boil … within me . ”
More than 6 feet tall , Clarkson had thick red hair and large , intense blue eyes that looked whomever he spoke to directly in the face .
As he stalks purposefully through the streets of Bristol , we can sense him fully finding his calling : “ I began now to think that the day was not long enough for me to labour in .
I regretted often the approach of night , which suspended my work . ”
The brutality of the slave trade , Clarkson discovered , was n’t confined to the mistreatment of the slaves themselves .
He found a slave ship in the harbor , just returned from a voyage on which 32 seamen had died - a number larger than many a ship ’s entire crew .
The treatment of one sailor , a free black man named John Dean , wrote Clarkson , “ exceeded all belief … .
The captain had fastened him with his belly to the deck , and …poured hot pitch upon his back , and made incisions in it with hot tongs . ”
Dean had disappeared , but Clarkson found a witness who “ had often looked at his scarred and mutilated back . ”
Each discovery led to another .
If slave vessels were so notoriously brutal , why did sailors continue to sign on ?
For several weeks , Clarkson haunted Bristol waterfront pubs to see how officers recruited their crews .
“ The young mariner , if a stranger to the port , and unacquainted with the nature of the Slave - trade , was sure to be picked up . ”
He would be told that wages were high and women plentiful .
“ He was plied with liquor … .
Seamen also were boarded in these houses , who , when the slave - ships were going out , but at no other time , were encouraged to spend more than they had money to pay for . ”
The pub keeper then demanded payment , and only “ one alternative was given , namely , a slave - vessel , or a gaol . ”
Captains and mates refused to talk to Clarkson .
But one day in the street , an overheard fragment of conversation made him follow a well - dressed man , a doctor , as it turned out , named James Arnold .
He had made two slave voyages , which he described to Clarkson in gruesome detail , and was about to leave on a third .
( These ships often carried doctors ; healthy slaves fetched higher prices . )
Arnold “ had been cautioned about falling - in with me , ” but spoke boldly nonetheless , explaining that he was “ quite pennyless … but if he survived this voyage he would never go another . ”
Would Arnold be willing “ to keep a journal of facts , and to give his evidence , if called upon , on his return ” ?
The answer was yes .
Several times , Clarkson tried to get slave - ship captains prosecuted for murder .
None of these attempts succeeded , but word of them got back to London , where the sober Quaker businessmen on the committee were alarmed that instead of quietly investigating , Clarkson was getting too combative .
One wrote to him , “ I hope the zeal and animation with which thou hast taken up the cause will be accompanied with temper and moderation . ”
But Clarkson showed no moderation as he rode on to Liverpool , the world ’s largest slave - trade port , which would be sending 81 ships to Africa that year .
As he was walking past a ship chandler ’s shop , he was shocked to see handcuffs , leg shackles , and thumbscrews in the window .
He also noticed a surgical instrument with a screw device , used by doctors in cases of lockjaw .
The shopkeeper explained :
It was for prying open the mouths of any slaves on shipboard who tried to commit suicide by not eating .
Clarkson bought one of each item ; from here on , he would display them to the newspaper editor in every town he passed through .
He was learning that organizing alone is not enough ; you need to wage a media campaign .
At the King ’s Arms tavern in Liverpool , where he stayed , men pointed him out in the dining room .
“ Some gave as a toast , Success to the Trade , and then laughed immoderately , and watched me when I took my glass to see if I would drink it . ”
Before long , he began receiving anonymous death threats .
One day , looking back from the end of a pier in a heavy gale , “ I noticed eight or nine persons making towards me ….
They closed upon me and bore me back . ”
The group included one of the ship ’s officers he was trying to have prosecuted for murder .
At this moment , his tall , strong build saved him from harm - and possibly from death if , like most Britons of his day , he did not know how to swim .
“ It instantly struck me that they had a design to throw me over the pier - head … .
There was not a moment to lose ….
I darted forward .
One of them , against whom I pushed myself , fell down … .
And I escaped , not without blows , amidst their imprecations and abuse . ”
The Blood - sweetened Beverage
Within two or three months of Clarkson ’s return to London , where the committee had been energetically recruiting supporters and distributing books and pamphlets , there appeared a dramatic sign of a sea change in public opinion .
There were no Gallup polls in those days , but there was one group of businessmen whose living depended on shrewdly gauging public tastes : the proprietors of London ’s debating societies .
( Sex was always popular , for instance , with debate topics such as “ Whether the fashionable infidelities of married couples are more owing to the depravity of the Gentlemen or the inconstancy of the Ladies ? ” )
After years in which slavery was only rarely a subject , abruptly the abolition of the slave trade was the topic of half of all 14 public debates on record in the city ’s daily newspapers in February 1788 .
At one , an ad promised that “ A NATIVE OF AFRICA , many years a Slave in the West - Indies , ” would speak .
The anonymous African was probably Olaudah Equiano .
Another newspaper reported “ a circumstance never before witnessed in a Debating Society .
A lady spoke to the subject with that dignity , energy , and information , which astonished every one present … .
The question was carried against the Slave Trade . ”
Other than at religious meetings , these may be , scholars believe , the first occasions that either a black person or a woman gave a public speech in Britain .
The most important expression of public feeling came on great , stiff rolls of parchment .
By the time Parliament adjourned for the year , petitions asking for abolition or reform of the slave trade had been signed by more than 60,000 people .
Petitions were a time - honored means of pressure in a country where voters had no control whatever over the House of Lords , and where fewer than one adult man in ten could vote for the House of Commons .
Anti-slave - trade petitions - never seen before - suddenly outnumbered those on all other subjects combined .
The superbly organized anti-slavery committee also pioneered several techniques used ever since .
For example , they periodically printed copies of “ a Letter to our Friends in the Country , to inform them of the state of the Business ” — the ancestor of many a newsletter , print or electronic , published by activist groups today .
They also agreed on a piece of text delivered to every donor in greater London appealing for another contribution , at least as big as the last .
This may have been history ’s first direct - mail fundraising letter .
When the famous one - legged pottery entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood joined the committee , he had one of his craftsmen make a bas - relief of a kneeling slave , in chains , encircled by the legend “ Am I Not a Man and a Brother ? ” American anti-slavery sympathizer Benjamin Franklin , impressed , declared that the image had an impact “ equal to that of the best written Pamphlet . ”
Clarkson gave out 500 of these medallions on his organizing trips .
“ Of the ladies , several wore them in bracelets , and others had them fitted up in an ornamental manner as pins for their hair . ”
The equivalent of the lapel buttons we wear for an electoral campaign , this was probably the first widespread use of a logo designed for a political cause .
It was the 18th century ’s “ new media . ”
Within a few years , another tactic arose from the grassroots .
Throughout the length and breadth of the British Isles , people stopped eating the major product harvested by British slaves : sugar .
Clarkson was delighted to find a “ remedy , which the people were … taking into their own hands … .
Rich and poor , churchmen and dissenters … .
By the best computation I was able to make from notes taken down in my journey , no fewer than three hundred thousand persons had abandoned the use of sugar . ”
Almost like “ fair trade ” food labeling today , advertisements quickly filled the press : “ BENJAMIN TRAVERS , Sugar - Refiner , acquaints the Publick that he has now an assortment of Loaves , Lumps , Powder Sugar , and Syrup , ready for sale … produced by the labour of FREEMEN . ”
Then , as now , the full workings of a globalized economy were largely invisible .
The boycott caught people ’s imagination because it brought these hidden ties to light .
The poet Robert Southey spoke of tea as “ the blood - sweetened beverage . ”
Slavery advocates were horrified .
One rushed out a counterpamphlet claiming that “ sugar is not a luxury ; but …a necessary of life ; and great injury have many persons done to their constitutions by totally abstaining from it . ”
The abolitionists pioneered another key organizing tool as well , and you have seen it .
Rare is the TV program or illustrated book about slavery that does not show a detailed , diagramlike top - down view of rows of slaves ’ bodies packed like sardines into a ship .
The ship is a specific one , the Brookes , of Liverpool , and Clarkson and his colleagues swiftly printed 8,700 copies of the diagram , and it was soon hung on the walls of homes and pubs throughout the country .
Part of its brilliance was that it was unanswerable :
What could the slave interests do , make a painting of happy slaves on shipboard ?
Precise , understated , and eloquent in its starkness , it was the first widely reproduced political poster .
The First Political Book Tour
Uprisings of the oppressed have erupted throughout history , but the anti-slavery movement in England was the first sustained mass campaign anywhere on behalf of someone else ’s rights .
Sometimes Britons even seemed to be organizing against their own self - interest .
From Sheffield , famous for making scissors , scythes , knives , razors , and the like , 769 metalworkers petitioned Parliament in 1789 .
Because their wares were sold to ship captains for use as currency to buy slaves , the Sheffield cutlers wrote , they might be expected to favor the slave trade .
But they vigorously opposed it : “ Your petitioners … consider the case of the nations of Africa as their own . ”
Consider the Africans ’ case as their own ?
Stephen Fuller , London agent for the Jamaican planters and a key figure in the pro-slavery lobby , wrote in bewilderment that the petitions flooding into Parliament were “ stating no grievance or injury of any land or sort , affecting the Petitioners themselves . ”
He was right to be startled .
This was something new in human history .
Meanwhile , something else feeding the country ’s growing antislavery fervor was Olaudah Equiano ’s autobiography , a vivid account of his life in slavery and freedom .
At seven shillings a copy , it became a best - seller .
For an extraordinary five years , he promoted his book throughout the kingdom , winning a particularly friendly reception in Ireland , whose people felt that they , too , knew something about oppression by the British .
Equiano ’s was the first great political book tour , and never was one better timed .
The slave interests were piqued .
In the biggest slave port , the editor of the Liverpool General Advertiser bemoaned the “ infatuation of our country , running headlong into ruin . ”
Pro-slavery forces now launched counterattacks .
They bought copies of a pro-slavery book for distribution “ particularly at Cambridge ” ( college towns leaned left even then ) and printed 8,000 copies of a pamphlet about how each happy slave family had “ a snug little house and garden , and plenty of pigs and poultry . ”
They sponsored a London musical , The Benevolent Planters , in which two black lovers , separated in Africa , end up living on adjoining plantations in the West Indies and are reunited by their kindly owners .
But Britons dependent on the slave economy were worried .
Some doggerel made the rounds in Liverpool :
If our slave trade had gone , there ’s an end to our lives / Beggars all we must be , our children and wives /
No ships from our ports , their proud sails e’er would spread /
And our streets grown with grass where the cows might be fed .
The slave interests ’ tactics bore a fascinating resemblance to the way industries under assault try to defend themselves today .
When , for instance , there were moves in Parliament to try to regulate the treatment of slaves , the planters hastily drew up a lofty - sounding code of conduct of their own and insisted no government interference was necessary .
They considered other P.R. techniques as well .
“ The vulgar are influenced by names and titles , ” suggested one pro-slavery writer in 1789 .
“ Instead of SLAVES , let the Negroes be called ASSISTANT - PLANTERS ; and we shall not then hear such violent outcries against the slave - trade . ”
The Movement Deflected
In Parliament , slavery ’s most colorful spokesman was the Duke of Clarence , one of the many dissolute sons of King George III .
As a teenager , he had entered the Royal Navy and gone to the West Indies , where he was wined and dined enthusiastically by the plantation owners .
He showered marriage proposals and cases of venereal disease on their daughters and thoroughly imbibed their attitudes .
In his maiden speech before fellow members of the House of Lords in their red and ermine robes , he called himself “ an attentive observer of the state of the negroes , ” who found them well cared for and “ in a state of humble happiness . ”
On another occasion , he warned that Britain ’s abolishing the trade would mean the slaves would be transported by foreigners , “ who would not use them with such tenderness and care . ”
Parliament was , of course , where the ultimate battle over the slave trade had to be fought .
As spokesman in the House of Commons , Clarkson had lined up William Wilberforce , a wealthy , diminutive member of Parliament from Yorkshire , widely respected for his piety and eloquence .
Except for his lifelong opposition to slavery , Wilberforce was Clarkson ’s political opposite .
Where Clarkson was swept up by the radical currents of the age , Wilberforce feared democratic impulses , labor unions , rising wages , and women ’s participation in political life .
Nonetheless , the two men were good friends and worked together closely for nearly 50 years .
But before Parliament could act , there were lengthy hearings .
Witnesses like James Penny , a former captain , made the slaves on the middle passage sound almost like cruise passengers : “ If the Weather is sultry , and there appears the least Perspiration upon their Skins , when they come upon Deck , there are Two Men attending with Cloths to rub them perfectly dry , and another to give them a little Cordial … .
They are then supplied with Pipes and Tobacco… .
They are amused with Instruments of Music peculiar to their own country … and when tired of Music and Dancing , they then go to Games of Chance . ”
Rounding up eyewitnesses willing to speak against the trade was as difficult as finding military or corporate whistleblowers today .
For a seaman or ship ’s officer to testify critically meant he could never find work on slave ships again .
At one point Clarkson rode 1,600 miles in two months , scouring the country for more witnesses .
Often , he complained , “ when I took out my pen and ink to put down the information , which a person was giving me , he became … embarrassed and frightened . ”
The most dramatic witness had just returned from a slave voyage : James Arnold , the Bristol doctor whom Clarkson had persuaded to keep a journal .
The slave interests skillfully used the hearings as a delaying tactic , spreading them out over several years , and outmaneuvering Wilberforce , who was a naive and disorganized legislative strategist .
They beat back several of his attempts to get Parliament to abolish the slave trade , but by the spring of 1792 , some five years after that first landmark meeting at 2 George Yard , it looked as if public feeling against the trade was too strong to be resisted .
“ Of the enthusiasm of the nation at this time , ” wrote Clarkson , “ none can form an opinion but they who witnessed it … .
The current ran with such strength and rapidity , that it was impossible to stem it . ”
Exhausted , he had just finished one of his horseback organizing marathons around the country ; Equiano was finding friendly audiences wherever he went ; and the sugar boycott was at its peak .
William Wordsworth wrote that the anti-slavery fervor of that spring was nothing less “ than a whole Nation crying with one voice . ”
Clarkson and other activists lobbied members of Parliament with unrelenting intensity .
Anti-slavery petitions flooded Parliament as never before .
When unrolled , the one from Edinburgh stretched the entire length of the House of Commons floor .
Twenty thousand people signed in Manchester - nearly one - third of the city ’s population .
Petitions from some small towns bore the signatures of almost every literate inhabitant .
Altogether , there were 519 petitions from all over England , Scotland , and Wales .
Four petitions arrived in favor of the trade .
The hearings for now finished , the parliamentary debate ran through the night .
And so we must imagine the House of Commons chamber dimly lit by candles in a chandelier and wall brackets ; the gowned , bewigged Speaker in his pulpitlike chair ; members bowing to him when they leave the floor ; the black - cloaked clerks below him ; the snuffboxes at the doors ; the candlelight glinting on the silver - and - gold ceremonial mace lying upon the central table ; and , rising into the gloom , the benches of members , many in boots and spurs .
The narrow visitors ’ galleries high above them were packed , and newcomers were turned away .
Equiano got there in time , however .
Clarkson slipped a doorkeeper a handsome 10 guineas to let in 30 abolitionists .
When Henry Dundas , the politically powerful Home Secretary who controlled a large block of Scottish votes , rose to speak , no one knew where he stood .
Dundas began by declaring himself in favor of abolition , at which those in the gallery must have felt their spirits rise .
He then went even further , and declared himself in favor of emancipation of the slaves … but far in the future , he added quickly , and after much preparation and education .
Then , to the abolitionists ’ dismay , he introduced an amendment that inserted the word “ gradually ” in Wilberforce ’s motion to abolish the slave trade .
This signaled the moment that comes in every political crusade , when the other side is forced to adopt the crusaders ’ rhetoric :
The factory farm labels its produce “ natural ” ; the oil company declares itself environmentalist .
Dundas had called himself an abolitionist , but he asked that abolition be postponed .
The tall , slender prime minister , William Pitt , not yet 33 years old , spoke last , at 4 a .m .
He declared himself “ too much exhausted to enter so fully into the subject … as I could wish . ”
But to read his speech today is to feel shame at the sound - bite political rhetoric of our own time .
Pitt spoke for more than an hour , extemporaneously .
He began by taking the “ gradualists ” at their word , that they favored abolition , and then one by one showed how each of their points was a better argument for ending the trade now .
Then he demolished the classic arguments of the slave traders .
Like arms exporters today , British shipowners claimed that if they ceased carrying slaves , the business would merely go to other countries , especially the great rival , France .
But how could anyone expect France to increase its slave trading when it was desperately trying to put down a vast rebellion - the Haitian revolution - in its prime colony ?
And as for the trade itself , Pitt asked , “ How , sir !
Is this enormous evil ever to be eradicated , if every nation is thus prudentially to wait till the concurrence of all the world shall have been obtained ? ”
Finally ,
Pitt made a grand historical comparison that cleverly made use of the country ’s imperial arrogance .
Britain , he declared , and British laws and achievements , were the acme of human civilization .
But was it fair to call Africa barbarous and uncivilized , and to say that the slave traders were doing no harm by removing people from that continent ?
For in Britain , too , many centuries earlier , one would have found slavery and human sacrifice .
“ Why might not some Roman Senator …pointing to British Barbarians , have predicted with equal boldness , ‘ There is a people that will never rise to civilization ’… ? ”
Legend has it that just as he concluded , the first rays of the rising sun burst through the large window behind the Speaker ’s chair .
Pitt ’s eloquence was not enough .
The gradualist proposal passed , and after more debate the House set 1796 , four long years hence , as the year when the slave trade was to end .
A far more significant obstacle , however , was the House of Lords , which voted down any abolition at all , gradual or otherwise .
The abolitionists were deeply discouraged .
Nonetheless , for the first time anywhere in the world , a national legislative body had voted for an end to the slave trade .
“ My Children Shall Be Free ”
Before the issue could come up again at the next year ’s parliamentary session , Britain and France went to war - a conflict that lasted , with only two short interruptions , for 22 years , ending only at Waterloo .
The fighting brought with it a wave of repression :
Every progressive movement , including abolition , was stopped in its tracks .
It was not until 1806 , after Clarkson , his hair now turning white , had toured the country rallying the faithful again , that the abolitionists found a way of cloaking a partial slave - trade ban in patriotic colors .
Despite the war , British - owned slave ships , it turned out , were stealthily but profitably supplying slaves to French colonies .
Parliament swiftly forbade this , and with the momentum from that move , the abolitionists were able to get both houses to ban the entire British slave trade in 1807 .
They were still confident that this would soon spell the end of slavery itself .
However , now that Caribbean planters were no longer able to replace slaves worked to death by buying shiploads of new ones , they eased working conditions and improved the slaves ’ diet .
By the 1820s , the slave birthrate was rising .
In England , the movement came back to life , pushing now for emancipation .
Once again , in his 60s , Clarkson headed off around the country , traveling for more than a year all told , visiting his contacts from decades before - or , more often , their children - and helping to start more than 200 local committees .
With their eyes again on a very conservative Parliament , he and his colleagues were cautious , advocating freeing the slaves in slow stages .
But this time something different happened .
More than 70 “ Ladies ' ” anti-slavery societies sprang up throughout Britain ; influenced by a fiery Quaker pamphleteer named Elizabeth Heyrick , they mostly pushed for immediate , not gradual , freedom .
One woman activist wrote , “ Men may propose only gradually to abolish the worst of crimes , and only mitigate the most cruel bondage , but why should we countenance such enormities … ? ”
When news of the revived movement crossed the Atlantic , at the end of 1831 , it helped ignite the largest slave rebellion ever seen in the British West Indies .
More than 20,000 slaves rose up throughout northwestern Jamaica .
Planters had long liked to build their grand balconied homes on breezy heights , and , now going up in flames , they acted as signal beacons .
As the militia were closing in on one plantation in rebel hands , a slave set fire to the sugar works , shouting , before she was shot , “ I know I shall die for it , but my children shall be free ! ”
By the time troops suppressed the revolt , some 200 slaves and 14 whites were dead .
The gallows or firing squads claimed more than 340 additional slaves .
However , the rebellion helped convince Britain ’s establishment that the cost of continued slavery was too high .
William Taylor , a former Jamaican plantation manager and police magistrate , testified before a parliamentary committee that the revolts “ will break out again , and if they do you will not be able to control them … .
I cannot understand how you can expect [ slaves ] to be quiet , who are reading English newspapers . ”
After the most massive campaign of petitions and demonstrations yet seen , Parliament finally gave in .
Nearly 800,000 slaves throughout the British Empire became free on August 1 , 1838 .
On the sweltering night before , the Baptist church in Falmouth , Jamaica , hung its walls with branches , flowers , and portraits of Clarkson and Wilberforce .
A coffin was inscribed “ Colonial Slavery , died July 31st , 1838 , aged 276 years ” and was filled with chains , an iron collar , and a whip .
An open grave lay waiting outside .
Just after midnight , singing parishioners lowered the coffin into it .
Slavery in the largest empire on earth was over .
Of the 12 men who had assembled 51 years earlier in the Quaker bookstore and printing shop at 2 George Yard , Thomas Clarkson was the only one still alive .
Changing the World
Though born in the age of swords , wigs , and stagecoaches , the British anti-slavery movement leaves us an extraordinary legacy .
Every day activists use the tools it helped pioneer : consumer boycotts , newsletters , petitions , political posters and buttons , national campaigns with local committees , and much more .
But far more important is the boldness of its vision .
Look at the problems that confront the world today : global warming ; the vast gap between rich and poor nations ; the relentless spread of nuclear weapons ; the poisoning of the earth ’s soil , air , and water ; the habit of war .
To solve almost any one of these , a realist might say , is surely the work of centuries ; to think otherwise is naive .
But many a hardheaded realist could - and did - say exactly the same thing to those who first proposed to end slavery .
After all , was it not in one form or another woven into the economy of most of the world ?
Had it not existed for millennia ?
Was it not older , even , than money and the written word ?
Surely anyone expecting to change all of that was a dreamer .
But the realists turned out to be wrong .
“ Never doubt , ” said Margaret Mead , “ that a small group of thoughtful , committed citizens can change the world .
Indeed , it is the only thing that ever has . ”
We flatter ourselves , in this technological age driven by financial innovation and mind - boggling efficiencies , that we know more than any previous generation .
But there is lost knowledge , among which is the knowledge of what sound money feels and looks like , what it does , who makes it and why , and how it holds its value .
So let us revisit Robert Louis Stevenson 's classic story , Treasure Island , and the climactic scene where the pirates and their companions have finally found their treasure and prepare to haul it away .
The narrator reports as follows :
It was a strange collection , like Billy Bones 's hoard for the diversity of coinage , but so much larger and so much more varied that I think I never had more pleasure than in sorting them .
English , French , Spanish , Portuguese , Georges , and Louises , doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins , the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the last hundred years , strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider 's web , round pieces and square pieces , and pieces bored through the middle , as if to wear them round your neck -- nearly every variety of money in the world must , I think , have found a place in that collection ; and for number , I am sure they were like autumn leaves , so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out .
There is more to learn about real money from this paragraph than in most money and banking texts .
Here we discover that money is international .
It matters not what nation - state or private party mints it .
Money can come in all shapes and sizes .
It has enduring value for hundreds of years .
It can be put in a vault and found by anyone in the future and retains its value .
Its merit as money is not dependent on the existence or persistence of any single government .
The regimes that minted the coins may be long forgotten but the money they made stays as a permanent part of the economic landscape until it is melted .
What this suggests is independence for the people who have , hold , and use the money .
They are not roped into any regime as such .
They go about their economic affairs as independent people .
Their money , which cannot be destroyed by the actions of a central government or a central bank , testifies to their status as free people .
And what is it made of ?
Gold , silver , or any precious metal , something or anything that will cause a back to ache and the fingers to hurt from sorting them out .
Money is heavy , robust , durable , divisible , enduring .
It is treasure .
It worth hiding when one is in trouble and worth hunting for if one stumbles upon a map to guide you there .
As to when it was minted and by whom , it does n't matter .
Money lasts .
Money is true .
It transcends the generations .
It transcends the nation .
It transcends the state .
As for any money minted or printed in the last fifty years , some of it may have value as a collectible but its value would vanish to near zero if it were melted .
As for the paper , it would be truly worthless .
One can imagine the scene in Treasure Island had they opened the trunk to discover wads of paper currency from defunct governments .
Let 's just say the story would have ended very differently .
It might have looked more like that scene in Lawrence of Arabia where the warriors trek hundreds of miles across the desert for treasure only to find crates full of paper cash , which the plunderers promptly throw to the wind .
Lawrence wisely departs the scene on a horse , promising to return with real money .
Incidentally , I do think there is a point to buying children coins for presents .
Just to hold an older coin of gold and silver imparts a lesson of sorts .
It illustrates the reality of a history that is different from our present .
I 've never seen a child disregard a nice gold or silver coin .
They keep it in a safe box , show it to their friends , and reflect on the sense of personal empowerment they experience from owning it .
Children know what treasure is , even if central bankers do not .
Today we think of money as something to possess for instrumental purposes but something otherwise created and managed by the government to keep the economy going .
The new Fed chairman , Ben Bernanke , was grilled at his Senate confirmation hearings as if he were a magician who could pull rabbits or squirrels out of his hat , depending on his mood that day .
All the questions related to whether he would tend to prefer the rabbit of employment to the squirrel of inflation .
The goal of these politicians was to prod him into admitting that squirrels are far to be preferred to rabbits , and if he would just admit it and swear to it , they would give him a free pass and let him perform , while Congress and president provide the necessary smoke and mirrors .
And by the way , Bernanke also promised to keep the Fed completely free from politics .
" I assure this committee that , if I am confirmed , I will be strictly independent of all political influences and will be guided solely by the Federal Reserve 's mandate from Congress and by the public interest . "
When ex-Fed chairman Arthur Burns arrived at the Bonn airport as ambassador to Germany , a reporter asked him how he could have agreed to Nixon 's desire to inflate so massively ?
The Fed chairman must do as the president wants , he answered , or the Fed would lose its independence .
Here is a rule of thumb .
If an institution has a dot - gov in its web address , as in FederalReserve.gov , it is not independent and it is not free of politics .
One politician summed up the Fed 's mandate this way : " guiding the economy to create broadly shared prosperity . "
Herein we find the perfect summary of what is wrong with Washington 's view of economic life .
It imagines the economy to be guided by the Fed , and that prosperity is created by its printing press .
Bernanke , however , was not in a position to correct the record , for he has himself spoken about the wonderful and limitless power of the Fed to create as much money as it wants to .
Thus spake Bernanke to those worried about deflation : " The US government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many US dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
By increasing the number of US dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the US government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services .
We conclude that , under a paper - money system , a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation . "
What awesome power !
Are we really supposed to believe that a government that possesses the ability to create unlimited amounts of money will wall off the institution that does the creating from any political influence ?
Surely not .
The independence of the Fed is just a mask that the government uses so that it can avoid taking responsibility for any downside that comes about from the Fed 's awesome power .
I suppose that if I had a counterfeiting machine , I too would want it kept out of the house and run by someone I could appoint who would nonetheless swear to be completely independent if caught in the act .
The Bernanke hearing was a despicable display in more ways than we can count .
That there is a direct relationship between inflation and employment was never questioned , even though that relationship does not exist as a matter of history or economic law .
To use the printing presses to drive down unemployment is to risk not only inflation but also radical economic instability and business cycles that can end in the worst of all worlds .
And the idea that low unemployment — as a symbol of a growing economy — needs constant infusions of paper money inflation from the Fed is belied by the whole of the 19th century , as well as by economics .
What did Bernanke and his examiners agree on ?
They agreed that the Fed should be all - powerful in matters of macroeconomics .
They agreed that there should not be any ironclad rule for the conduct of monetary affairs , but rather that smart guys ought to wing it day by day to achieve the right mix of policy options .
And they all agreed that the prevention of deflation , meaning a fall in the general level of prices , ought to be the number one priority .
So when you hear that Bernanke favors " low inflation , " remember that the emphasis is on the noun and not its modifier .
It means that he prefers any amount of inflation to a condition of deflation .
Why the hysteria against deflation ?
We are faced with a real puzzle here .
In the whole of the private sector , the number one focus of retailers these days , particularly those dominant retailers such as Wal - Mart and Home Depot , is low prices .
This they emphasize above all else because they know that this is what consumers want .
And yet in the public sector , we find exactly the opposite : an ironclad promise that prices will not be low but rather will be continually rising .
So if Wal - Mart 's slogan is " Always Low Prices , " the slogan of the Fed and the government should be " Always Higher Prices . "
The question is why .
Why is it that Congress , the Fed , and the presidency all agree that deflation is something to be avoided at all costs ?
The experience of the Great Depression looms large but , as Murray Rothbard has shown , low prices were just about the only good economic trend that was happening throughout the 1930s .
Imagine if you had all the same disasters occurring — all inspired by bad economic policy — but with high prices on top of it all !
Here is a test .
We all know people who lived through it .
Ask them today if they would have been better off if all goods and services had been two or three or ten times more expensive .
No , the trouble with the Great Depression was not low prices .
Nor were low prices and wages the cause of the economic downturn .
As Rothbard further showed , the downturn was a correction of a previous inflation , a macroeconomic version of the dot - com bust , and one that was made ever worse by governmental attempts to fix the problem .
As for the Fed , it did not pursue a policy of benign neglect but rather desperately attempted to inflate the money supply and was unable to do so .
The real blame for the Great Depression lies with precisely the policy that Bernanke favors , that is , a steady and relentless increase in the money supply to keep the economy humming while not sparking price increases that are politically objectionable .
This inflation targeting is precisely the problem since it sends false signals to capital - goods investors and borrowers , skewing the production structure forward in time to a greater degree than underlying savings can support .
Not knowing what the Austrian School says , Congress and the Fed might believe that a policy of low - grade inflation is the best protection against depression .
But I do n't believe that this is why they favor such a policy .
Nor do I think that the desire to boost employment is the reason , since there is no evidence for anything like a long - run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment .
The reason the government — and here I speak of Congress and the presidency — favors a loose monetary policy , a discretionary rule at the Fed , and ongoing low - grade inflation is the most obvious one of all .
It pays the bills .
In other words , the reason is no different from that of private counterfeiting .
They like to have money without having to work to get it .
That is essentially what the Federal Reserve provides the government .
It does n't have to worry about its bond rating collapsing or its credit standing falling .
It does n't have to bother with taxing people .
It can hide the costs of government in the complications associated with monetary affairs .
Looking back at the history of inflations in the United States , we can detect a single event that , more than any other , prompts the government to engage in inflationary finance .
I wish I could report to you that inflationary finance was a modern invention of the modern regime with its endless wars and welfare expansions .
Sadly , America was born in monetary sin , so to speak .
The Continental Congress financed the Revolutionary War with paper money , beginning in 1775 .
The currency was supposed to be retired in seven years with a pro rata tax levied by the states .
But once the government got the hang of the magic of war finance , it forgot about the pledge and endlessly expanded the currency .
Between 1775 and 1781 , the Continental went from trading on par with one dollar in specie to being nearly worthless .
It was a tragic incident because it benefited all the worst people in this young country , the very group that later pushed for the Constitution to replace the Articles , and backed the creation of the first central bank , to enrich themselves .
In some way , this war , which was undoubtedly just and involved a meritorious secession from a distant government , was the beginning of the end , precisely because it unleashed a horrendous inflation and schooled a new governing elite in the benefits of inflationary finance .
It has been war that has been the driving force in monetary depreciation throughout history .
If Bush had been forced to raise the hundreds of billions that he has spent on his Iraq caper through taxation , his supporters would be far less supportive , and his policy more honest .
Instead , he has been able to count on the inflationary finance of his friends at the Fed to make it all possible .
Monetary policy has been the handmaiden of empire in other ways too , as the dollar is used as political leverage against nearly every country in the world from Argentina to China to Russia .
Fiat currency engenders conflict of all sorts , unbalances the economic structure , and puts everyone 's savings at risk .
It is for this reason that Alan Greenspan once wrote that the cause of freedom is bound up with the cause of the gold standard .
Should our monetary system be reformed so that it is based on a pure gold coin standard ?
Yes it should .
This would be the single best reform we could make for the cause of freedom .
Its commercial benefits include stability , predictability , and honesty in finance .
Its moral benefits include a financial system that does not reward living beyond one 's means .
From the point of view of government , a gold standard would tie the hands of the state .
They could wish and long for wars , welfare , foreign aid , bailouts , subsidies , and graft , but unless they could raise the money by taxing , all their talk would be pointless .
That is a country I want to live in .
For years I 've heard people suggest that the Mises Institute come up with a detailed plan for how the conversion would work .
In fact , there are many models to choose from , from Joseph Salerno's to Murray Rothbard 's to George Reisman 's to Ron Paul 's own legislation , which has been before the House for some two decades .
What is lacking is not a plan .
It is the political will .
It would require that the government recognize the error of its own ways , agree to limit its power and influence , abolish the Fed , and return the control over economic structures back to the people .
And you wonder why the movement for a gold standard struggles !
But let me just clear up a few myths about gold .
It is not the case that under a gold standard , we would all find ourselves in the position of that young man in Treasure Island , with aching backs and throbbing fingers .
Banks would continue to exist and compete on a sound basis .
All financial services would continue to exist just as they do now , from credit cards and bank cards to PayPal and stock portfolio checking and all the rest .
Indeed , we would see an explosion of financial innovation under the gold standard because so many of the uncertainties associated with inflationary finance would be a thing of the past .
Money would become truly international , or would tend in that direction as more countries decided to make their currencies as good as gold .
And if we managed the transition properly , government would have no monopoly on the production of money .
This would be something handled by the private sector , as suppliers competed based on beauty and design and reliability .
In an ideal world , all currencies in the world would be different names for precious metals , all interchangeable with each other based on weight and fineness .
If that sounds complicated or unreasonable , or even completely unviable , let us remember that all forms of freedom seem impossible in the midst of despotic control .
Many intellectuals and officials in Russian and China could n't really imagine how society would work if people were permitted to live and work and move where they wanted .
To them it sounded like chaos .
Germans can't imagine how society would survive without strict laws on when retail shops can open and close .
And people in Britain went into a panic recently on the suggestion that pubs be permitted to stay open longer than usual .
In our own country , we can't imagine the legalization of drugs , the elimination of the minimum wage , the abolition of Society Security , or not bombing someone every two years .
These things seem crazy to us because we have adapted to statism .
So it is with money .
We are used to the idea that government should run the monetary system .
And that 's why when we say we favor the gold standard , people think we are nuts .
But today in China or Russian , anyone who favors a return of travel and moving restrictions is considered dangerous and deranged — which is precisely how I feel about anyone who says that government ought to be given full control of a nation 's monetary institutions !
So I ask you to imagine how the world worked before the advent of central banking and before our permanent state of inflationary paper currency .
Imagine if the money you made and saved were as good as gold — a truly independent medium of exchange that was not subject to political manipulation , confiscation , or depreciation .
The wizards at the Fed would not control our destinies , Congress 's appetite for spending would be curbed , and the president would be a bit more cautious about embarking on wars that would cost political capital .
It would be the world of Treasure Island , where the only criminals we would need to worry about owned ships , not fleets , and where the pirates sang ditties about rum , not national anthems to the glory of the state

British Document Outlines Early Encryption Discovery
By PETER WAYNER
The set of algorithms , equations and arcane mathematics that make up public key cryptography are a crucial technology for preserving computer privacy in and making commerce possible on the Internet .
Some hail its discovery as one of the most important accomplishments of 20th - century mathematics because it allows two people to set up a secure phone call without meeting beforehand .
Without it , there would be no privacy in cyberspace .
The move by the once dusty and secretive organization is clearly an attempt to recast its image as a pioneering leader of cyberspace .
Three professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the time , Ron Rivest , Adi Shamir and Len Adleman soon followed with another similar approach known by their initials , RSA , which went on to become one of the dominant solutions used on the Internet .
Before public key cryptography , anyone who wanted to use a secret code needed to arrange for both sides to have a copy of the key used to scramble the data , a problem that requires either trusted couriers or advance meetings .
PKC , as it is sometimes known , erased this problem by making it possible for two people , or more properly their computers , to agree upon a key by performing some complicated mathematics .
There is no publicly known way for an eavesdropper to pick up the key by listening in .
he new document details how three employees of the British government discovered the same approach several years earlier , but kept it a secret for reasons of national security .
A spokesman for the British government 's GCHQ , said that the document 's release is part of a " pan-governmental drive for openness " pushed by the Labor party .
“ It must be really difficult for them to watch other people get the credit . ” Martin Hellman ,
Stanford University
Ellis says that Clifford Cocks followed with a more practical solution in 1973 that was essentially the same thing as the algorithm published by Rivest , Shamir and Adleman .
The paper also says that Malcolm Williamson discovered an algorithm in 1974 that was very similar to the work of Diffie and Hellman .
They did not replicate the work done by Merkle and Hellman .
In a telephone interview from his office in La Jolla , Calif. , Malcolm Williamson said that he felt bad when others discovered the solution , but concluded , " I was working at the British government and that 's just one of the restrictions you work under when you work for the government . "
Hellman said in a telephone interview that he agrees .
" It must be really difficult for them to watch other people get the credit , " he said .
" But that 's the agreement they made when they agreed to work in secret . "
He was also quick to point out that the secret branches of the government have the help of large budgets and classified knowledge .
" Diffie , I and Merkle were working in a vacuum . " he said .
" If we had access to all of the classified literature of the previous 30 years , it would really be an advantage . "
For his part , Diffie said in a telephone interview from Cirencester , England , that he thinks that GCHQ never realized the deep importance of what the mathematicians discovered .
He said that he met James Ellis several years ago and " within an hour of meeting me , Ellis said , ' You did much more with this than we did . ' "
Diffie also suggested that the history of ideas is hard to write because many people often find solutions to different problems only to later determine they 've discovered the same thing .
he story keeps going farther back .
Recently , Matt Blaze , a cryptographer employed at Bell Labs , got a copy of a memorandum from the desk of John F. Kennedy about the problem of securing nuclear weapons with launch codes .
Steve Bellovin , a colleague of Blaze 's at Bell Labs , said : " When I read this memo , I do n't see anything that would require public key cryptography .
But I think they 're in the neighborhood .
For so many things , the answer is the easy part .
Asking the question is the hard part .
I think this got them asking the questions . "
Historians of science will certainly spend time sorting out the various claims .
David Kahn , the author of the best selling history The Codebreakers , said that he recently asked the National Security Agency to declassify some documents so he could write the proper history of public key cryptography .
He said an NSA staff member told him , " I 've spoken to the guys who did this , but they do n't want to be interviewed now . "
This suggests that the NSA also may have discovered public - key systems or had a hand in exploring them .
Kahn hopes that the NSA will follow in Britain 's lead so an accurate history can be written .
Jim Bidzos , the chief executive of RSA Data Security , the division of the publicly traded Security Dynamics that holds the patent on the RSA , said that the announcement in Britain will have no effect on the company 's business .
Patent law is based on the notion that the inventors trade knowledge about the invention in return for an exclusive license to practice it .
In fact , it is an interesting question to wonder whether Britain could have changed the history of cyberspace by disclosing the invention and encouraging the development of widespread cryptographic security for the public .

Is It About Privacy or Security ?

Others are pushing a similar question .
In a debate on cryptography policy at the University of Maryland , Baltimore County , John Gilmore , one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said the NSA should be more open .
While national defense is very valuable , he suggested that the need for security in cyberspace for all citizens is going to be essential in the future .
In the long run , the history of the discovery of public key cryptography is certain to be written and rewritten often in the next several years as more documents emerge from secret government laboratories .
The spokesman from GCHQ promises that more documents are on the way .
Hellman is philosophical .
" In a way , these things are like gold nuggets that God left in the forest . " he said .
" If I 'm walking along in the forest and I stubbed my toe on it , who 's to say I deserve credit for discovering it ? "
He is quick to point out , however , that he shared the discovery with everyone .

Steve Bellovin explanation of National Security Action Memorandum 160 at Bell Labs
Peter Wayner at pwayner@nytimes.com welcomes your comments and suggestions .
Gilad Bracha recently wrote about why he thinks continuation support should not be added to the JVM .
In it he said :
" By far the most compelling use case for continuations are continuation - based web servers . "
The idea that continuations are a good fit for web applications is a popular one .
( Bracha does n’t even feel the need to offer evidence supporting his assertion that it ’s the most compelling use case . )
I want to take issue with this idea .
Actually , so does Bracha , but for different reasons ...
His argument seems to be that current web application UI interaction designs are unfortunate throwbacks - unimaginative responses to the intrinsic constraints of HTTP - and that using continuations to deal with this simply makes life easier for developers without addressing the underlying usability problems .
I completely agree with Bracha that the UI model in question here is rubbish .
However , I have another reason for rejecting this use case .
Even if you ignore the archaic and unfortunate UI conventions ubiquitous on the web , I believe the use of continuations in this context is , on balance , a bad idea .
It has some superficial attractions , but it also has serious shortcomings .
Fairly Short Introduction to Continuations
Those of you who know what continuations are can skip this bit .
The idea behind continuations is pretty simple : the flow of execution in your code can head off somewhere outside of the current function , but be able to continue from where it left off some time later .
The canonical example is the humble function call .
In mainstream languages like VB.
NET , C# , Java , and C++ , we ’re accustomed to the idea that when we call a method , it will eventually return , at which point execution will carry on from the point directly after the function call .
Under the covers , this ability to continue after the function call completes is enabled by passing a bit of information to the called function .
Every function call includes an implicit parameter indicating where to return once the subroutine has finished .
On many CPUs , this is done by storing a return address on the stack , an operation which is often built directly into an instruction .
For example , the x86 CALL instruction combines two functions : push a return address onto the stack , and then jump to a new location .
A continuation is really just a generalization of this ‘ carry on from where we were ’ functionality .
The limitation with the ordinary function call model is that there ’s only one scenario in which you can use it : function calls .
But what if I wanted a little more flexibility ?
Functions are passed an implicit continuation parameter , but how about I have a function that also returns a continuation ?
Just as the caller says “ Here ’s where you should return to once you ’re done , ” the function could also say “ Here ’s where you should start from the next time you call me . ”
Actually , we can already do something very like this in C# thanks to the iterator support added in 2.0 .
For example , this next example shows a function that returns a number of results .
Every time it returns a value , it also generates information about where to start from next time ( which actually ends up getting stored by the compiler - generated implementation of IEnumerable ) :
static IEnumerable < int > ReturnSeveralTimes ( ) { int i = 1 ; int j = 1 ; yield return 1 ; yield return 1 ; for ( int steps = 0 ; steps < 10 ; ++steps= " " ) { int next = i + j ; yield return next ; i = j ; j = next ; } yield return 2 ; yield return 3 ; yield return 5 ; yield return 7 ; }
This returns the first 12 Fibonnaci numbers , and then just for fun , it returns the first 4 prime numbers .
It really is returning from the function each time it hits one of those yield return statements , and yet it retains the ability to continue from where it left off .
In other words , yield return does something very similar to a function call : it somehow concocts the ability to continue execution from a particular line of code at some point in the future .
But unlike a function call , where the continuation is supplied by the caller and executed by the called function , here another continuation is also supplied by the callee , and is executed by the caller when they ask the iterator for the next item .
Some languages take this further .
Rather than offering continuation in a limited set of specific scenarios , at any point in the code you can say “ Build me a continuation from this point in my function . ”
You can then treat this continuation as a piece of data - store it in a variable , pass it as a value to a function , store it in a collection .
And you can execute the continuation whenever you see fit , as often as you like .
This requires a certain amount of magic under the covers .
Supporting continuations in special cases such as function calls or iterators is much easier than providing completely generalised support .
Continuations do not fit all that well with the stack - oriented execution model offered by the JVM or CLR .
Continuations and the Web
Continuations can look attractive on the web , because they offer a tool that lets you capture the shape of a sequential user journey in the structure of your code .
For example , an ecommerce site might feature a multi-page dialog with the user of the kind outlined in this pseudo - code :
OnClickedCheckout ( ) { ShowBasket ( User.Basket ) ; WaitForConfirmationOfContents ( ) ; ShowPaymentOptions ( ) ; PaymentMethod pm = GetPaymentOptionSelection ( ) ; pm.GetPaymentDetails ( ) ; if ( ConfirmPayment ( User. Basket , pm ) ) { Order o = ProcessOrder ( User.Basket , pm ) ) if ( o. Succeeded ) { ShowOrderSuccess(o ) ; } else { ShowOrderFailure (o ) ; } } }
The user journey is directly reflected by the structure of the code .
And as I ’ve said before , I ’m a fan of code that does what it looks like it does .
Of course web code never looks like this .
The problem is that most of the function calls in that pseudocode require us to send a page back to the user and then wait for the user ’s next action .
But web servers are n’t built that way .
They typically call our code when a request comes in from the browser , and do n’t generate a response until we return .
So we ca n’t write one sequential piece of code that represents this path through the site .
Instead , the path ’s embodiment is often scattered throughout lots of little event handlers , or it might be the input to some data - driven controller .
But continuations seem to offer a solution .
Whenever we get to the point in the code where we need to generate a page and feed it back to the user , we could create a continuation , store it somewhere , and then return control to the web server .
When the next request comes in , a framework could retrieve that continuation , and execute it , allowing us to continue from where we left off .
You could probably cruft up a working example of this style of coding in a web app by writing an iterator function in C # which did a yield return each time it wanted to show a page to the user and wait for the results .
Languages with comprehensive support for continuations could offer a more elegant example of the same idea .
However , I think this is a bad idea .
Although the relationship between the code and the user navigation path is apparently simple , it hides subtle but significant details .
This makes the same mistake as we did in the 1990s with distributed object models .
We ’d like to believe we ’re hiding a lot of implementation details behind a simple abstraction .
In practice we ’re hiding important features behind an inappropriate abstraction .
Our industry has more or less learned the lesson that procedure calls are an unworkably naive abstraction for request / response messaging over a network .
I suspect that it ’s equally naive to attempt to manage the complexities of user / web server interactions with simple sequential code .
Here are a few of the issues that make sequential code an unsuitable abstraction for user navigation through a web site .
Abandoned Sessions
Sometimes the user just walks away .
I might get part way through the purchasing sequence on a web site and then decide to stop .
The web server never gets any positive indication that I closed the browser window .
It merely stops hearing from me .
What does this mean in a world where I ’m using continuations to help model user journeys as sequential code ?
It means that sometimes my functions just stop part way through without reaching the end .
On the plus side , it is predictable where this will happen : it can only occur at boundaries where I choose to construct a continuation and then relinquish control for now .
But at every such boundary , I need to be aware that sometimes , the continuation will never execute .
This is very much not analogous to the function returning or throwing an exception .
In the world of our chosen abstraction - that of sequential execution of a method - it looks like our thread has hung .
The problem with this is that a lot of the techniques we have learned for resource management stop working .
Resource cleanup code may never execute because the function is abandoned mid-flow .
Thread Affinity
With an ordinary sequentially executing function , I can safely assume one thread will run the function from start to finish .
But if I ’m using continuations to provide the illusion that I ’ve got sequential execution spanning multiple user interactions , then I might get a thread switch every time I generate a web page .
Traditionally , any particular invocation of a function runs on a single thread from start to finish .
We ’re not accustomed to mid-function thread switches , and it will render some hitherto safe practices unworkable .
Using objects with thread affinity will become particularly hazardous , for example - we will need to be mindful of the potential switch points and make sure we never use such objects across such a boundary .
Worse , problems probably wo n’t show up during development .
It ’s not uncommon for a web server that only has to process one request at a time to use the same thread for every request .
It ’s only when you put the server under load that it starts using multiple threads .
This provides another way in which code that worked fine in development can fail in production .
( And we have enough of those already . )
Web Farms
This is essentially the same problem as the thread affinity issue , but at the machine level : in a web farm , your sequential function might end up executing on a variety of machines over its lifetime .
However , you ’d probably avoid this problem in practice using sticky sessions .
( And unless your continuations are serializable across machine boundaries you ’ll have to do this . )
The Back Button and Branching
This one ’s the killer .
Your web site may present linear user journeys , but that does n’t mean your users necessarily follow them .
I often do n’t .
I habitually do two things that will confound any web site that expects the user to do things in a particular order .
First , sometimes I use the back button .
Second , sometimes I bifurcate my navigation - I ’ll open a link in another tab .
Both of these will confuse any web site that thinks it knows what my ‘ current page ’ is .
The notion of a current page is not enshrined in either HTTP or HTML , and I enjoy the flexibility this offers me when browsing sites .
Indeed , it ’s one of the reasons I really like tabbed web browsers .
Let ’s look at what these two actions mean for our continuation - based technique where we attempt to model user journeys through sequential execution of code in a function .
The Back button gives users the ability to wind execution back a bit .
Of course from a user perspective , the Back button just gives the user the ability to go back .
But if we ’re choosing to make the structure of our code model how the user navigates the site , then that ’s what Back has to mean .
Depending on exactly how your framework builds on top of the underlying continuation mechanism , this might actually break your framework completely .
Bracha tacitly assumes a framework that wo n’t be broken by this - he assumes that the system will keep old continuations around , so if you do go back , it can execute them again .
So the framework has well defined behaviour in terms of how it will execute your code .
But what does your code see ?
Your function could execute , say , the first 10 lines of code , and then when the user hits Back and then clicks on a link , your code is forced back to line 5 .
You have no control over this - your function can be rewound to any of the places where you spat out a web page .
And this rewinding can happen as often as the user likes .
Normal functions do n’t do that - they only jump back to earlier points if you use flow control constructs such as loops .
Giving the user the option to inject goto statements at will is an unusual design choice , but anything that models user journeys as sequential execution of code will have to cope with this kind of rewinding , or it ’ll break the back button .
And I do n’t know about you , but I hate sites that break the back button .
( Yes , Windows Live Search , I ’m looking at you . )
When a site breaks my Back button for me , I resort to bifurcation : if I ’m on such a site , I just open each link in a new tab .
I also do this for sites that configure caching so as to force a reload on Back .
And sometimes I do this on sites where Back works just fine - maybe linear navigation simply does n’t suit what I ’m trying to do .
Let ’s consider what this bifurcating model means in the world where we ’ve chosen to model user journeys in the structure of a function .
On sites where the developer ( or framework ) simply assumes that there is always a ‘ current page ’ , this browsing style just does n’t work properly .
( An egregious bug , IMO . )
But what about sites that keep all the old continuations around , so that they can go back to them if necessary , as discussed above ?
This would mean that not only can users rewind execution , they can also fork it .
When my supposedly sequential function chooses to yield another page to the user , if the user chooses to open it in a new tab or browser window , it is as though they ’ve created a new thread , which proceeds to the next line while leaving the original thread parked where it was .
This means I have to write my function in such a way that it can cope not only being rewound , but also to being split so that multiple threads execute the function simultaneously , each taking different paths .
But of course because I ’m using continuations , each of these threads gets to use the same set of local variables .
The fact that I enabled users to inject gotos into my code at will is now looking like a walk in the park - now they can add arbitrary concurrency !
Bracha characterises this as an advantage of this continuation - based abstraction .
I suppose he has a point , in that it does offer a mechanism for managing multiple paths taken through the web site by one user .
But I disagree that it ’s a good thing : on the contrary , this is what makes this whole approach essentially unworkable .
It imposes such a complex set of bizarre and unusual behaviours on the code that it ’s a recipe for failure .
General Principles
My final objection is a bit more abstract : I think it ’s a mistake to choose an abstraction that badly misrepresents the underlying reality .
We made this mistake with various distributed object model technologies last decade .
I think the attempt to model a user ’s path through a web site as the sequential execution of code is at least as misguided .
Users do n’t necessarily take a single linear path through a web site , so code execution is completely the wrong shape of abstraction .
In Summary
You use continuations to build a framework that allows the execution path of your code to model the path a user takes through your web site .
But the paths users take are not necessarily straightforward .
Consequently , this approach requires you to write your code in such a way that it can tolerate sudden halts , thread switches , rewinding , and forking of execution .
This makes it a thoroughly uncompelling use case for continuations .
In short , believing that this approach will make things simpler is pure wishful thinking .

Online scams create " Yahoo! millionaires "
In Lagos , where scamming is an art , the quickest path to wealth for the cyber - generation runs through a computer screen .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) - Akin is , like many things in cyberspace , an alias .
In real life he 's 14 .
He wears Adidas sneakers , a Rolex Submariner watch , and a kilo of gold around his neck .
Akin , who lives in Lagos , is one of a new generation of entrepreneurs that has emerged in this city of 15 million , Nigeria 's largest .
His mother makes $ 30 a month as a cleaner , his father about the same hustling at bus stations .
But Akin has made it big working long days at Internet cafes and is now the main provider for his family and legions of relatives .
Call him a " Yahoo! millionaire . "
Akin buys things online - laptops , BlackBerries , cameras , flat - screen TVs - using stolen credit cards and aliases .
He has the loot shipped via FedEx or DHL to safe houses in Europe , where it is received by friends , then shipped on to Lagos to be sold on the black market .
( He figures Americans are too smart to sell a camera on eBay to a buyer with an address in Nigeria . )
Akin 's main office is an Internet cafe in the Ikeja section of Lagos .
He spends up to ten hours a day there , seven days a week , huddled over one of 50 computers , working his scams .
And he 's not alone :
The cafe is crowded most of the time with other teenagers , like Akin , working for a " chairman " who buys the computer time and hires them to extract e-mail addresses and credit card information from the thin air of cyberspace .
Akin 's chairman , who is computer illiterate , gets a 60 percent cut and reserves another 20 percent to pay off law enforcement officials who come around or teachers who complain when the boys cut school .
That still puts plenty of cash in Akin 's pocket .
A sign at the door of the cafe reads , WE DO NOT TOLERATE SCAMS IN THIS PLACE .
DO NOT USE E-MAIL EXTRACTORS OR SEND MULTIPLE MAILS OR HACK CREDIT CARDS .
YOU WILL BE HANDED OVER TO THE POLICE .
NO 419 ACTIVITY IN THIS CAFE .
The sign is a joke ; 419 activity , which refers to the section of the Nigerian law dealing with obtaining things by trickery , is a national pastime .
There are no coherent laws relating to e-scams , the police are mostly computer illiterate , and penalties for financial crimes are light .
No penalties for breaking the law
" The deterrent factor is not there at all , " says Thomas Oli , a Lagos lawyer , citing the case of a former police inspector general who was convicted of stealing more than $ 100 million and got only six months in jail .
" What do you want me to do ? "
Akin asks in pidgin English , explaining why he turned to a life of Internet crime .
" It is my God - given talent .
Our politicians , they do their own ; me , I 'm doing my own .
I feed my family - my sister , my mother , my popsie .
Man must survive . "
The scams perpetrated by Akin and his comrades are many and varied : moneygram interceptions , Western Union hijackings , check laundering , identity theft , and outright begging , with tall tales of dying relatives and large sums of money in search of safe haven .
One popular online fraud often practiced by women ( or boys pretending to be women ) involves separating lonely men from their money .
Attempts to speak to government officials about Internet crime were futile .
They all claimed ignorance of such scams ; some laughed it off as Western propaganda .
But last November the Economic Fraud and Financial Crimes Commission won a high - profile case that had dragged on for years against Emmanuel Nwude , who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years for bilking a Brazilian bank out of $ 242 million using an Internet scam involving phony bank drafts .
The commission is also pursuing a case against 419 kingpin Fred Ajudua , a lawyer and businessman accused of using the Internet to steal $ 1 million from a victim in Germany .
Some officials , who asked not be identified , said young people are drawn to Internet crime as a way of getting back at a society that has no plans for them .
Others see it as a form of reparation for the sins of the West .
Or as Akin puts it , " White people are too gullible .
They are rich , and whatever I gyp them out of is small change to them . "
Editor 's note :
The term " Yahoo Millionaire " is frequently used by scammers in Nigeria .
They are not affiliated in any way with Yahoo !
the company .

" We are taking irregularities very seriously , " he said .
One of the worst cases has been in Paghman , a district west of Kabul , which is the stronghold of Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf , a wartime faction leader and ally of President Hamid Karzai .
Ballot boxes from 95 polling stations in Paghman have been set aside for further inspection and 30 to 40 of those had been cleared for counting by Sunday , officials said .
The rest would be excluded from the count because of clear evidence of fraud , said a foreign observer who lacked permission to speak to reporters and asked not be identified .
Mr. Sayyaf is running for a seat in the Wolesi Jirga , or the lower house of Parliament , and is in fourth place with 2,105 votes .
Only 20 percent of the results for Kabul have been tabulated so far , but he is nevertheless well placed to win one of the 33 seats in the province .
Mr. Erben said that there were no signs of countrywide efforts to defraud the Afghan people but that there had been local efforts .
" I do not believe these irregularities in any way have affected the overall elections , but some of them have surely affected them locally , " he said .
Voters went to the polls Sept. 18 to choose representatives for Parliament from each province , and for members of provincial councils .
" If compared with other , similar , postconflict elections , I think that the level of irregularities that we are currently reviewing is extremely reasonable , " Mr. Erben said at a news conference .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) �
For the first time , compensation for private college presidents has broken through the million - dollar barrier .
In 2004 , five presidents earned more than $ 1 million .
And in all , 50 earned over $ 500,000 .
That 's just one of the findings from a special report on college and university presidents ' compensation published Monday in The Chronicle of Higher Education .
The highest paid private college president is Donald E. Ross of Lynn University , a small liberal arts school in Boca Raton , Fla .
His compensation package topped $ 5 million last year , the bulk of it because he was awarded $ 4.5 million in deferred compensation to be paid out after he retires in June 2006 .
Christine Lynn , chair of the University 's board , told the Chronicle that the sizeable pay package was because Ross , who has been with the school for 34 years and at one point pulled it out of bankruptcy , had n't taken a salary in his early years during which time the school also did n't have money to put toward his retirement .
Other million - dollar pay packages went to Audrey K. Doberstein of Wilmington College ( $ 1.37 million ) ; E. Gordon Gee of Vanderbilt University ( $ 1.33 million ) ; John R. Silber of Boston University ( $ 1.25 million ) ; and John M. McCardell Jr. of Middlebury College ( $ 1.21 million ) .
The Chronicle also looked at the pay packages this year of the 139 public university presidents .
It found : � 23 will have total compensation packages topping $ 500,000 this year , up 35 percent from a year ago .
�
Another 30 will get between $ 400,000 and $ 499,999 in compensation . �
And the median compensation for the post is $ 360,000 .
The best compensated public university leaders are : Mary Sue Coleman of the University of Michigan system ( $ 724,604 ) ; David P. Roselle of the University of Delaware ( $ 720,522 ) ; Mark G. Yudof of the University of Texas system ( $ 693,677 ) , Carl V. Patton of the Georgia State University ( $ 688,406 ) ; and John T. Casteen III of the University of Virginia ( $ 659,670 ) .
The compensation for public university presidents does n't necessarily all come from state coffers ( i.e. , taxpayer dollars ) .
Part of it , including benefits , bonuses and perquisites , may come from private foundations .
The Chronicle found that 43 percent of public college and university presidents will receive part of the compensation from a private entity .
The list of top - earning presidents at public universities also can be somewhat volatile .
" The compensation packages of some presidents are subject to periodic spikes because of the different ways of paying performance and retention bonuses and deferred compensation , including retirement plans that vest only after certain requirements are fulfilled , " writes Chronicle reporter Paul Fain in one article .
One example , Fain notes , is the compensation package of Georgia State University president Carl V. Patton , who ranks No. 4 on the list .
The reason his compensation is so high this year is that he will receive part of his $ 900,000 in deferred comp for serving 12 years in his post .
Why is the pay so high ?
There are those who argue , much as they do in the corporate world , that the compensation for college and university leaders needs to attract highly qualified candidates and needs to reflect the increasing demands of the job .
Indeed , some say , running a school these days is very much like running a for - profit company .
The University of Michigan system run by Coleman , for instance , has a $ 4.6 billion budget , 39,000 students on its main campus and 450,000 living alumni , according to the Chronicle .
Others reject the corporate - world analogy , preferring a political one instead , Fain writes , noting that some question whether college leaders should be paid more than the president of the United States .
President Bush is paid $ 400,000 .
Chronicle reporter Audrey Williams
June notes that the entry of college presidents into the million - dollar club is bound to garner a lot of attention " as the federal government starts seeking the logic behind high pay for leaders of nonprofit organizations , faculty members call for salary caps and board members move to defend the amount they pay college executives .

Initiative
There ’s no other way for me to start this other than by firing away :
Last week I left my full - time job at Joyent , for the sole reason so that I can write Daring Fireball as a full - time job .
Two years ago , when I made tentative steps in this direction , it was like I put the idea out there and then poked it with a stick to see what happened .
What I ’m doing now is like jumping out of a plane with this idea as my parachute .
When I launched the membership program two years ago , I was n’t sure whether it would be a failure , a bonanza , or something in - between .
Ends up it was something in - between .
I mean that in a good way , because it was way more successful than I honestly expected .
But it was also less than I had sort of secretly hoped .
What I wanted was for this to be easy — for the revenue from the memberships and t- shirts sales to amount to something that , when combined with the money from a modest dose of advertising , would clearly constitute a reasonable full - time salary .
But there ’s a reason why you ca n’t say , “ Wow , look at all those people supporting their families with their weblogs devoted to deeply intricate Mac and web nerdery , ” or , really , why there are n’t that many people supporting themselves full - time from their weblogs , period .
That reason is because it is n’t easy .
My desire for this to be easy bound me in a catch - 22 , where I felt like membership was n’t going to grow large enough unless I could put full - time effort into producing the site , but I was n’t going to be able to put full - time effort into the site until the membership revenue was large enough .
What I ’ve concluded , though , is that if I want to make a full - time income from Daring Fireball , I need to just do it full - time .
I.e. that it ’s not going to work the other way around — to wait for the revenue to burgeon and then start putting full - time effort into it .
There ’s nothing I want to do more than this .
But even so , it has been an extraordinarily difficult decision to make , partly because I ’m so prone to over - thinking that I sometimes have trouble deciding what to have for lunch , but mainly because there exists the very real possibility of failing in an excruciatingly public way .
That raises the question as to why I did n’t just do this without announcing anything .
I.e. just try putting full - time work into the site without announcing anything , and see how it goes .
But that , more or less , is just as cowardly as the original “ just keep growing the revenue until it ’s enough and then slip on over ” plan .
I see no way around telling you , the regular readers of this site , what it is that I ’m trying here .
To lay it all on the line .
The point here is n’t to guilt anyone into buying t- shirts or becoming a member ( e.g .
Oh , man , Gruber quit his job , I better help him out ) .
The point is to prove to you how much better Daring Fireball can be than it has been , and how much more you , the readers , will enjoy it , now that I ’m devoting my time to it .
Here ’s an apt quote from one of my personal heroes , Stanley Kubrick :
“ If you can talk brilliantly about a problem , it can create the consoling illusion that it has been mastered . ”
Point being : Dithering about this for another couple of years is n’t going to solve anything .
It would be better to try this now and fail than to endlessly deliberate over plans that are never put into action .
I need to just do it , and so I am .
Do n’t Settle
This is going to sound really corny , as in like literally groan - inducingly corny , and if you ’re a regular reader of this site and a fan of my writing , it is , I hope , very clear that I have a deep , perhaps even pathological , aversion to corniness .

But part of what ’s inspired me to go for this is that a few weeks ago , I finally got around to listening to Steve Jobs ’s Commencement address at Stanford last June .
It ’s a great speech , and Jobs , famously , is a great speaker .
The transcript does n’t really do it justice .
Commencements are inherently corny affairs , and it ’s doubly - corny for an avowed Mac nerd to cite Steve Jobs as a source of inspiration , but when Jobs spoke of his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and the day he spent under the assumption that he had just a few months left to live , I found it genuinely moving .
And when Jobs spoke about his work , I was inspired :
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life , and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work , and the only way to do great work is to love what you do .
If you have n’t found it yet , keep looking , and do n’t settle .
As with all matters of the heart , you ’ll know when you find it , and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on .
So keep looking .
Do n’t settle .
This advice is n’t anything you ca n’t hear from a high school guidance counselor , but somehow there ’s a difference .
I do n’t think many high school guidance counselors actually love what it is that they ’re doing ; Jobs actually means it .
Some words sound like tripe because they ’re overused by people who do n’t actually mean them .
Daring Fireball is what I love to do .
One point I want to impress upon you is that the proper response to this announcement is n’t so much “ Congratulations ” as it is “ Good luck , I hope it works ” .
Success is far from assured , and I ’m feeling more than a little gut - wrenching uncertainty .
It ’s difficult for me to write this sort of thing , to step out from behind the curtain and address you , the reader , directly — as I wrote two years ago , “ Just me , your humble author , hat in hand , heart in throat , asking for your support ” .
For those of you who think this is worthwhile , however , that ’s what I ’m doing : asking for your support .
And I do n’t know how to do so otherwise .
Most businesses self destruct Jason 13 comments Latest by John
A few weeks back I was invited to speak at a TiE Event here in Chicago .
The panel included Lucas Roh , CEO of Hostway , Mike Domeck , CEO of Ticketsnow , and mysef .
It was moderated by Matt McCall of Portage Ventures .
I really enjoyed being on the panel and learning from the other panelists .
We all have different backgrounds , different businesses , and different ways of running our businesses .
Lucas and Mike are sharp .
Out of everything that was said , one thing really stuck with me .
When Lucas was asked how he deals with the heated competition in the web hosting space , he said , and I ’m partially - paraphrasing , “ We just do what we do best .
We focus on our business , our customers , and our vision .
Most businesses self destruct anyway so we just make sure ours does n’t .
Focusing too much on what everyone else is doing is a sure way to run your own business out of control . ”
I really loved that .
He ’s spot on .
Most businesses self destruct anyway .
They focus on the wrong things , they chase the wrong ideas , they fight the “ more more more ” cold war .
The only company that wins the cold war is the one with the most resources .
Everyone else loses .
Who wants to fight that war ?
Kathy Sierra touched on this a few days ago .
Yes , you have to pay attention to what ’s going on out there , but I ’d argue you need to pay more attention to what ’s going on in here .
In your own company .
In your own products .
In yourself and your own vision .
Are you delivering your products or your competition ’s products with a different coat of paint ?
Believe in what you ’re doing , deliver on that vision , and chart your own course .
Do n’t worry too much about everyone else .
Be a great chef and deliver your own signature dishes — do n’t just deliver another burger .
Maybe you ’ll be right , maybe you ’ll be wrong , but it ’s certainly a lot more satisfying than losing the expensive , frustrating , dangerous cold war .
As a follow up to yesterday 's post on Bill Gates ' presentation style , I thought it would be useful to examine briefly the two contrasting visual approaches employed by Gates and Jobs in their presentations while keeping key aesthetic concepts found in Zen in mind .
I believe we can use many of the concepts in Zen and Zen aesthetics to help us compare their presentation visuals as well as help us improve our own visuals .
My point in comparing Jobs and Gates is not to poke fun but to learn .
Simplicity
A key tenet of the Zen aesthetic is kanso or simplicity .
In the kanso concept beauty , grace , and visual elegance are achieved by elimination and omission .
Says artist designer and architect Dr. Koichi Kawana , " Simplicity means the achievement of maximum effect with minimum means . "
When you examine your visuals , then , can you say that you are getting the maximum impact with a minimum of graphic elements , for example ?
When you take a look at Jobs ' slides and Gates ' slides , how do they compare for kanso ?
" Simplicity means the achievement of maximum effect with minimum means . "
— Dr. Koichi Kawana
Naturalness
The aesthetic concept of naturalness or shizen " prohibits the use of elaborate designs and over refinement " according to Kawana .
Restraint , then , is a beautiful thing .
Talented jazz musicians , for example , know never to overplay but instead to be forever mindful of the other musicians and find their own space within the music and within the moment they are sharing .
Graphic designers show restraint by including only what is necessary to communicate the particular message for the particular audience .
Restraint is hard .
Complication and elaboration are easy ... and are common .
The suggestive mode of expression is a key Zen aesthetic .
Dr. Kawana , commenting on the design of traditional Japanese gardens says :
" The designer must adhere to the concept of miegakure since Japanese believe that in expressing the whole the interest of the viewer is lost . "
— Dr. Koichi Kawana
In the world of PowerPoint presentations , then , you do not always need to visually spell everything out .
You do not need to ( nor can you ) pound every detail into the head of each member of your audience either visually or verbally .
Instead , the combination of your words , along with the visual images you project , should motivate the viewer and arouse his imagination helping him to empathize with your idea and visualize your idea far beyond what is visible in the ephemeral PowerPoint slide before him .
The Zen aesthetic values include ( but are not limited to ) :
Simplicity
Subtlety
Elegance
Suggestive rather than the descriptive or obvious
Naturalness ( i.e. , nothing artificial or forced ) ,
Empty space ( or negative space )
Stillness , Tranquility
Eliminating the non-essential
Gates and Jobs : lessons in contrasts
Take a look at some of the typical visuals used by Steve Jobs and those used by Bill Gates .
As you look at them and compare them , try doing so while being mindful of the key concepts behind the traditional Zen aesthetic .
Above .
Does it get more " Zen " than this ?
" Visual - Zen Master , " Steve Jobs , allows the screen to fade completely empty at appropriate , short moments while he tells his story .
In a great jazz performance much of the real power of the music comes from the spaces in between the notes .
The silence gives more substance and meaning to the notes .
A blank screen from time to time also makes images stronger when they do appear .
Also , it takes a confident person to design for the placement of empty slides .
This is truly " going naked " visually .
For most presenters a crowded slide is a crutch , or at least a security blanket .
The thought of allowing the screen to become completely empty is scary .
Now all eyes are on you .
Above .
Gates here explaining the Live strategy .
A lot of images and a lot of text .
Usually Mr. Gates ' slides have titles rather than more effective short declarative statements ( this slide has neither ) .
Good graphic design guides the viewer and has a clear hierarchy or order so that she knows where to look first , second , and so on .
What is the communication priority of this visual ?
It must be the circle of clip art , but that does not help me much .
Dr. Kawana says that " to reach the essence of things , all non-essential elements must be eliminated . "
So what is the essence of the point being made with the help of this visual ?
Are any elements in this slide non-essential ?
At its core , what is the real point ?
These are always good questions to ask ourselves , too , when critiquing our own slides .
Above .
Here Jobs is talking to developers at the WWDC'05 about the transition from the Power PC RISC chips to Intel .
Sounds daunting , but as he said ( and shows above ) Apple has made daunting major shifts successfully before .
( He also said sheepishly earlier in the the presentation , that every version of OSX secretly had an Intel version too ... so this is not a new thing .
The crowd laughed . ) .
A note on having an " open style "
One thing that would help Mr. Gates is an executive presentations coach and a video camera .
One unfortunate habit he has is constantly bringing his finger tips together high across his chest while speaking .
Often this leads to his hands being locked together somewhere across his chest .
This gesture makes him seem uncomfortable and is a gesture reminiscent of The Simpsons ' Mr. Burns .
By contrast , Steve Jobs has a more open style and at least seems comfortable and natural with his gestures .
Above .
Mr. Gates needs to read Cliff Atkinson 's Beyond Bullet Points , ironically published by Microsoft Press .
Atkinson says that " ... bullet points create obstacles between presenters and audiences . "
He correctly claims that bullets tend to make our presentations formal and stiff , serve to " dumb down " our points , and lead to audiences being confused ... and bored .
Rather than running through points on a slide , Atkinson recommends presenters embrace the art of storytelling , and that visuals ( slides ) be used smoothly and simply to enhance the speaker 's points as he tells his story .
This can be done even in technical presentations , and it can certainly be done in high - tech business presentations .
The " Microsoft Method " of presentation ?
The approach we 've seen in Microsoft 's last public presentation we can label the " Microsoft Method . "
This method is not different than the norm , in fact it is a perfect example of what Seth Godin and others call " Really Bad PowerPoint . "
Here 's the rub :
A great many professionals see the absurdity of this approach , even a great many professionals on the campus of Microsoft in Redmond .
But change will continue to be slow , especially when the executives of the company which produces the most popular slideware program in the world use the program in the most uninspiring , albeit typical way .
Above .
Chief technology Officer , Ray Ozzie follows the " Microsoft Method " too .
( Left ) Bullet No.3 : " ... interfaces through ... interfaces " ?
( Right ) Fundamental presentation rule :
Do not stick your hands in your pockets .
Informality is fine , but this is inappropriate even in the USA ( and especially in cultures outside the U.S. ) .
Refrain :
It all matters !
We 've talked about many presentation methods here at Presentation Zen , methods that are different than the " normal " or the " expected " but also simple , clear , and effective .
Who wants to be " average , " " typical , " or " normal " ?
Ridderstrale & Nordstorm say it best in Funky Business : " Normality is the route to nowhere . "
I 'm not suggesting you " present different " for the sake of being different .
I am saying that if you move far beyond what is typical and normal in the context of presentation design , you will be more effective and different and memorable .
Maybe Microsoft can afford lousy PowerPoint presentations , but you and I can't .
For " the rest of us , " it all matters .
Can we learn from a Japanese garden ?
Looking for inspiration in different places ?
Find a book on Japanese gardens ( like this one from my friend , designer Markuz Wernli Saito ) or visit one in your area ( if you are lucky enough to have one ) .
You can learn a bit here about the Zen aesthetic and Japanese gardens in this article by Dr. Kawana .
Living here in Japan
I have many chances to experience the Zen aesthetic , either while visiting a garden , practicing zazen in a Kyoto temple , or even while having a traditional Japanese meal out with friends .
I am convinced that a visual approach which embraces the aesthetic concepts of simplicity and the removal of the nonessential can have practical applications in our professional lives and can lead ultimately to more enlightened design .
The company hosting the Million Dollar Homepage says an electronic attack was responsible for the extended outages earlier today .
The distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) occurred as college student Alex Tew sold the final 1,000 pixels if his innovative ad service in an eBay auction for $ 38,100 .
The attack left the milliondollarhomepage.com site unreachable for large portions of the day , as seen in a performance chart for the site .
" The site received a major DDoS attack , and DDoS protection / prevention was not included in the customer 's plan , " Russell Weiss of InfoRelay Online Systems , Inc. wrote in an e-mail to Netcraft .
" That said , we voluntarily took a number of steps to alleviate this attack while working within the appropriate budget . "
InfoRelay is the owner and operator of Sitelutions , which hosts the Million Dollar Homepage .
Tew has promised to keep the site online for at least five years .
The DDoS attacks raise the prospect that operating milliondollarhomepage.com may prove more expensive than Tew originally envisioned .
Tew will not be charged for any additional bandwidth consumed by the attack .
But as Weiss noted , defense against DDoS attacks is typically a paid service not included with basic hosting accounts .
As the Internet 's newest millionaire , Tew can afford to reinvest some of his earnings in additional site maintenance .
The 21 - year - old UK student launched the site in September to pay his college expenses , offering 1 million pixels of ad space at $ 1 a pixel .
The eBay auction brought the site 's total earnings to $ 1,037,100 .
The gimmick has also paid dividends to advertisers in the form of huge web traffic .
Milliondollarhomepage.com has received up to 500,000 unique visitors per day .
" The site 's traffic has been very intense over the past few weeks , in excess of 200 Mbps , actually , " said Weiss .
" The high level of traffic has been well - supported by our multi- gigabit , redundant network . "
Weiss said the attack did n't affect any other sites on his company 's network .
DDoS attacks have previously targeted advertising sites , including a series of attacks on domain parking services earlier this year and an attack on the DoubleClick banner advertising network in 2005 .
Netcraft offers a web site performance monitoring service that provides uptime charts , along with e-mail alerts when an outage occurs .

BBC reporter , Prisoners of Katrina
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , while thousands fled New Orleans , the city 's prisoners were trapped .
Fresh eye - witness accounts reveal what really happened to those left behind , and how crucial forensic evidence was simply washed away .
Nearly 7,000 male and female prisoners were left behind
In September 2005 , long after most people had fled a devastated city , inmates of Orleans Parish Prison - many of them shackled - were still waiting to be rescued from the blazing heat and the stinking floods .
" They basically abandoned the prison , " says Vincent Norman , a chef arrested for an unpaid fine who found himself locked in a cell for days .
Norman should have been there no more than a week .
Instead , abandoned without food , drink or sanitation as the waters rose , he was in prison for 103 days .
" We were just left there to die , " said Cardell Williams , a prisoner who spent two months in jail without ever being charged .
In the days before the hurricane , when other citizens of New Orleans were ordered to leave , city leaders were asked : " What about the prisoners in the jail ? "
" The prisoners will stay where they belong , " replied Marlin Gusman , the criminal sheriff in charge of the city jail .
But it was a gamble he would regret .
Break out
Orleans Parish Prison has ten jail blocks , its own courts and a morgue
Some of those in Orleans Parish Prison had been arrested for minor misdemeanours , like unpaid fines , or jay - walking .
Some had never even been charged .
A third of the inmates were awaiting trial , innocent until proven guilty .
On the night of Sunday 29 August , as Katrina hit the Gulf Coast , they found themselves with violent convicts transferred from other low - lying jails .
The food and drinking water ran out .
Many were in windowless cells in soaring heat .
They began to riot .
Andrew Joseph said he saw a body floating in the water with a rat sitting on its chest
Terrified staff who had brought their families with them to the jail for safety , now found themselves trapped surrounded by floodwater , without phones or radio contact .
Deputy Rhonda Ducre , alone on her wing , had only a torch with fading batteries to keep order in the darkness , as panicked inmates began to break out .
She recalls : " They were shaking on the bars , they were setting fires , they were screaming , they were popping out of their cells .
It was dangerous . "
Body bags
By Monday night , Sheriff Gusman was forced to change his mind .
But now the evacuation of 7,000 prisoners would be infinitely harder .
Two days after the evacuation began , some prisoners were still trapped in their cells
They would have to be ferried by boats , six at a time .
In the chaos some were left behind , forgotten , and some inmates reported seeing prisoners who had drowned .
Andrew Joseph said he saw a body floating in the water with a rat sitting on its chest .
There were reports too of other deaths .
A member of the prison staff made a sworn statement that he had removed two body - bags containing the bodies of female deputies who had died , asphyxiated by smoke from burning mattresses .
But with hundreds of bodies already piling up in the morgue , and with so many of New Orleans citizens missing or still displaced , those claims have never been verified .
Legal rights
Prisoners were dispersed and held throughout the state ... their court cases unheard for months
The sheriff maintained no prisoners died and none escaped , but later it emerged that arrest warrants had been issued for 14 escaped inmates .
All were recaptured , but not before one of them was re-arrested for another murder while on the run .
Months after the hurricane many were still suffering the consequences of a system peculiar to Louisiana - that of funding public defence lawyers partly from traffic violations revenue .
When the city flooded and the traffic stopped , the money ran out , depriving the poor of their legal rights to a defence .
At one time , the city was reduced to just four defence lawyers , each with an unmanageable caseload .
Prisoners were dispersed and held throughout the state , their charges delayed , their court cases unheard for months .
Destroying the evidence
For those convicted of serious crimes and hoping for a reprieve , however , there were graver consequences still .
Vital forensic evidence stored in a basement was destroyed
Forensic evidence stored in the courthouse basement was destroyed , dashing hopes of justice for those wrongly convicted of rape and murder .
Lawyer Dwight Doskey represents clients on death row .
" There will be people - and I 've got one in particular that I 'm worried about - who may have been exonerated by DNA if the evidence had been stored in a safe place .
Those are the people that I feel sorriest for , " he says .
New Orleans is notorious both for its low murder clear - up rate and its wrong convictions .
But for those at the bottom of the social heap - the poorest prisoners in one of America 's poorest states - Katrina brought a justice system already near to collapse , to a standstill .
This World : Prisoners of Katrina was broadcast on Sunday 13 August , 2006 , at 2200 BST on BBC Two .
Munch painted a number of versions of The Scream
The Scream and Madonna were found in a police operation .
" We are 100 % certain they are the originals .
The damage was much less than feared , " police said .
They had been missing since two armed men ripped them from the wall and threatened staff at the Munch Museum in the Norwegian capital in August 2004 .
Three men were found guilty of charges relating to the theft in May .
" We felt it was a victory today when the pictures turned up , " police chief Iver Stensrud told a press conference in Oslo .
" For two years and nine days we have been hunting systematically for these pictures and now we 've found them . "
Mr Stensrud added that police believed the paintings had remained in Norway since they were stolen .
" We feel we have been hot on the trail of the paintings the whole time , but it has taken time , " he said .
Two men were pictured running from the museum with the paintings
The Scream , painted in 1893 , is one of the world 's most recognisable paintings .
The artworks will now be examined by experts to establish what effect their two - year disappearance has had on their condition .
Mr Stensrud said no reward had been paid but would not give details of how the paintings were recovered .
Police said no new arrests had been made and the two gunmen remain at large .
In May , Bjoern Hoen , 37 , was sentenced to seven years for planning the robbery , Petter Tharaldsen , 37 , got eight years for driving the getaway car and Petter Rosenvinge , 34 , received four years for supplying the vehicle .
Hoen and Tharaldsen were also ordered to pay 750 m kroner ( £ 62.3 m ) compensation to the City of Oslo to reflect the value of its lost paintings .
Three other men were acquitted .
All had pleaded not guilty .
Mr Stensrud said those convicted had not contributed to the recovery of the paintings .
Correction Appended
A new dinosaur species , one of the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs , has emerged from the red sandstone of Patagonia , in Argentina , where reptilian giants seem to have thrived 100 million years ago .
Paleontologists reported yesterday that they had found the fossils of seven to nine individuals of a species they are naming Mapusaurus roseae .
An analysis of the bones showed that an adult exceeded 40 feet in length , which the discoverers said was slightly larger than specimens of both its close relative , Giganotosaurus , and Tyrannosaurus rex .
Some scientists think that a Spinosaurus species from North Africa is the largest meat - eating dinosaur , but that is still debated .
The discovery was made in sediments of a 100 - million - year - old water channel at a site 15 miles south of Plaza Huincul , Argentina .
It was reported at a news conference in Plaza Huincul and described in the French journal Geodiversitas .
The action depends on , especially drugs as https://gulickhhc.com/drugs/gastrointestinal/flagyl.htm can alcoholor controlling your life as can sometimes be acombined approach .
Whether 'tis not always expectsuch as an erection problem .
It is 30 years since the publication of a slim volume of articles and essays titled Small is Beautiful - a key text of the nascent environmental movement .
The year 1973 was a timely one for radical environmental thinking .
The first UN conference on sustainable development had been held the previous year , and soon after , within months of each other , Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth and the UK Green party were founded .
Small is Beautiful rapidly became a bestseller , and its author , EF Schumacher , was feted by international leaders and counterculture activists alike .
Today , Schumacher is less well known , but the ideas he popularised helped shape modern environmentalism , development theory and the global justice movement .
Equal parts economic analysis , spiritual tract and radical manifesto , the book reflected the contradictory nature of its author - a patrician academic who was also passionately interested in Eastern philosophy .
What bound his work was a central belief that modern society had lost touch with basic human needs and values - and in doing so had failed both the planet and its people .
In the name of profit and technological progress , Schumacher argued , modern economic policies had created rampant inefficiency , environmental degradation and dehumanising labour conditions .
" Ever bigger machines , entailing ever bigger concentrations of economic power and exerting ever greater violence against the environment , do not represent progress : they are a denial of wisdom .
Wisdom demands a new orientation of science and technology towards the organic , the gentle , the non-violent , the elegant and beautiful , " he wrote .
The remedy he proposed - a holistic approach to human society , which stressed small scale , localised solutions - flew in the face of economic orthodoxies of the time : " I have no doubt that it is possible to give a new direction to technological development , a direction that shall lead it back to the real needs of man , and that also means : to the actual size of man .
Man is small , and , therefore , small is beautiful . "
Western campaigners and governments in the developing world took up his arguments .
But today , amid the wholesale imposition of globalisation and free trade , Schumacher 's vision of self - sufficient local economies seems quaint and anachronistic .
So is small still beautiful ?
Born in Bonn in 1911 , Schumacher emigrated to England in 1936 .
He became a British citizen in 1946 and in 1950 became economic adviser to the National Coal Board .
For the next 20 years he worked at the heart of the British economic establishment , but visits to India and Burma led him to doubt technocratic certainties .
He concluded that the imposition of a Western model of development had bypassed the rural poor .
Industrialisation and megaprojects created vast wealth for a few , but left the masses trapped in spiritual and material poverty .
The antidote he called " Buddhist economics " - " a middle way between materialist heedlessness and traditionalist immobility " .
Instead of mass production and mechanisation , industry in the developing world should be on a " human scale " .
Cheap , locally developed solutions would be more effective than imported technologies and have less environmental impact .
In 1966 , Schumacher founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group ( ITDG ) , and his work inspired non-government organisations around the world .
Today the group supports hundreds of projects , from donkey plough workshops in Sudan to micro-hydroelectric schemes in Nepal , Sri Lanka and Peru .
But Small is Beautiful was never accepted by mainstream economists , who see it as an impractical model for development .
The Oxford economist Wilfred Beckerman published a riposte to Schumacher titled Small is Stupid .
Local management of resources has become commonplace in mainstream economics , but localisation and self - sufficiency are not always efficient or even practical , says Julian Morris , director of free - market think - tank the International Policy Network .
" Most of the people in the world who currently do n't have electricity would benefit from having it .
The important thing is to get them electricity in the most efficient and costeffective matter , and avoid pollution .
For that , we 're not talking about local solutions , but solutions that come from the economies of scale , " he says .
" It comes down to whether or not you believe in technological progress and growth , " says Philip Stott , professor emeritus in bio-geography at the University of London .
" I believe that technology and growth can fundamentally be equated with good . "
According to Stott , Schumacher 's followers idealise a primitive past while ignoring the benefits of scientific progress .
They risk condescension in their attitudes towards the developing world .
" There is an element of neo -colonialism - they are trying to regress parts of the world that should be progressing , " he says .
But science and technology have not improved basic living conditions for much of humanity , argues Cowan Coventry , chief executive of the ITDG .
" Given the dramatic [ scientific ] advances of the past 40 years , why is it that the number of people living in poverty continues to increase ?
Why do we find that 2 billion still do n't have access to electricity ? "
Schumacher 's followers may have failed to take up the wider implications of Small is Beautiful , says Coventry .
Despite the tight focus implied in the title , Schumacher proposed an overhaul of the way the global economy is run .
" People saw the beauty of local endeavour , but they never really grappled with the bigger issues of how to change macro policies . "
Meanwhile , the march of trade liberalisation threatens small - scale manufacture in developing countries , while small - scale agriculture is swamped by subsidised imports .
" We 're seeing the same economic model .
It 's business as usual , " says Spencer Fitzgibbon , a member of the Green party national executive .
Governments still place their faith in technological advances instead of considering economic re-organisation , he says .
Schumacher 's view of mechanisation finds its parallel in today 's debates over GM crops and nanotechnology .
Once again , hi-tech solutions are being boosted when their benefits are still unclear , argues Coventry .
" Extravagant claims are often made about new technologies and their benefits for developing countries .
We 're sceptical about those claims , especially when they 're made by corporate interests .
The big question is , can new technology bridge the divide between the haves and the have nots ? "
It is the same question that Schumacher put 30 years ago .
" Small is Beautiful is a book of many good ideas , and they are more and more relevant today , " says Satish Kumar , editor of Resurgence , where many of Schumacher 's essays first appeared .
" Schumacher was called a crank , and he quite happily agreed .
But what is a crank ?
It 's a small element in a machine that makes revolutions . "
Cocktail
It ’s Saturday night and the Bistro ’s jamming .
I ’m heading to the men ’s room when Beth , a fellow waiter , intercepts me .
“ I need help , ” she squeaks , “ I ’m going into the weeds . ”
“ Whatcha need ? ” I offer gallantly .
My piss can wait a minute .
“ Do you know how to make a Sidecar ? ” Beth asks , “ That would really help me out . ”
“ No problem . ”
I head over to the bar and rim a frosted martini glass with sugar .
I throw ice into a Boston shaker , measure in some brandy , Cointreau , fresh lemon juice and shake the ingredients together vigorously .
I pour the concoction into the glass , place a corkscrew lemon twirl on the rim , and admire my handiwork .
Sidecars , and other drinks popular in Dashiell Hammett ’s day , appear to be having a renaissance .
I ’ve sort of become the Bistro ’s old and odd drink specialist .
Maybe I should switch to bartending .
“ Sidecar up ! ” I yell over the din .
Beth races in and grabs the drink .
“ Thanks , ” she says .
“ Do n’t spill it , ” I call after her .
I head over to the men ’s room and pull on the door .
Locked .
Sigh .
I head back onto the floor .
“ Waiter , ” a voice calls out , “ I need another drink . ”
A large woman wearing too much foundation makeup waves her glass in the air .
It ’s not my table but I go over anyway .
That ’s me .
Mister Customer Service .
“ What were you drinking Madam ? ” I ask , taking the empty glass out of her hand .
“ A whiskey Old Fashioned , ” she says .
What ’s up with the old timer drinks tonight ?
Next thing you know William Powell and Myrna Loy are gonna sashay through the front door .
“ Right away Madam . ”
This lady ’s in Saroya ’s section but she ’s busy repeating the specials to some deaf oldsters on table 17 .
They look like they voted for Hoover .
I ’ll bet they ’d know who Myrna Loy was .
I cast a glance at my section .
I ’ve got time .
Everyone ’s on apps and entrees .
I head back to the bar , throw a piece of orange into a whisky glass , add sugar , two dashes of bitters , and muddle the whole thing together with the back of a teaspoon .
I should really use a muddling spoon but we do n’t have one .
One day I ’m gonna go to Chef Central and get the all bar tools we need .
I throw ice on top of the muddled fruit , grab a bottle of Canadian Club , pour the requisite amount , and stir the mixture thoroughly .
I garnish the glass with an orange slice , drop in a cherry , and run the drink over to the customer .
“ Your drink Madam , ” I say , placing it in front of her .
The woman makes no effort to thank me .
Oh well .
I run back to the men ’s room .
Still locked .
Damn .
This is rapidly becoming a problem .
I head back to my section .
My little window of inactivity ’s drawing to a close .
Soon I ’ll be bringing out entrees , making cappuccinos , and ringing up checks .
If I do n’t piss now I wo n’t get another chance .
My bladder ’s aching like it ’s just seen a “ NEXT REST STOP 25 MILES ” sign after wrestling with a Super Big Gulp for an hour .
I wonder if pinching my urethra shut in public would look undignified .
Something tells me it might .
I decide my customers are gonna have to wait .
I run to the men ’s room .
The door ’s still locked .
near the men ’s room says .
“ I wonder if he ’s all right , ” I wonder aloud .
The patron shrugs and returns to his rack of lamb .
This is a conversation he does n’t want to have .
I rap gently on the men ’s room door .
“ Everything all right in there ? ”
“ I ’m gonna be here a while , ” a strained voice replies .
“ Sorry . ”
I ’ll have to use the ladies room .
If that ’s occupied there ’s always the alley .
Luckily the little girl ’s room ’s unoccupied .
But , out of the corner of my eye , I see Old Fashioned drink lady struggling down the aisle , her hammy arms outstretched as she tries to balance her inebriated frame , a wild drunken smile opening up the fault lines in her pancake makeup .
I should do the right thing .
I should let Old Fashioned go to the can first .
But it ’s survival of the fittest time and I ’m not getting voted of the Island .
I duck into the ladies room and throw the lock .
As soon as my pants drop I ’ve got a steady stream going .
My knees almost buckle in relief .
“ Thank God , ” I whisper .
Behind me the doorknob rattles furiously .
It ’s gotta be Old Fashioned Lady .
Too bad .
I ’m gonna be here a few minutes .
It ’s axiomatic that , when squeezed for time , your urine stream flows for an eternity .
A good three minutes passes .
I finally finish , shake , flush , zip , kick the lid down , and wash my hands thoroughly .
I towel off my hands and open the door to find Old Fashioned Lady glaring at me .
“ This is the ladies room , ” she says , slurring her words .
I decide to skip the witty comeback and mumble a sincere , “ Sorry . ”
“ Harrumph , ” the woman says , blustering past me .
I head back to my section .
All my tables need something .
I dive in .
Twenty minutes later everything ’s under control and I feel two quarts lighter .
I stop to get a cup of coffee , think better of it , and grab a glass of water instead .
I lean against the service bar and take a deep breath .
Beth sticks her head in .
“ Hey Waiter , ” she says , “ Could you make me another Sidecar ? ”
That friggin Sidecar .
That ’s how I angered my bladder in the first place .
“ Is this customer ninety - two ? ” I ask irritably .
“ No , He ’s a young guy .
Why ? ”
“ Tell him the 30 ’s called .
Nick and Nora Charles want their cocktails back . ”
“ Huh ? ” Beth says , staring at me like I have two heads .
“ Forget it Beth , ” I say , knowing my sense of humor is often only understood by myself , “ I ’ll make the drink . ”
I grab a Boston shaker and start mixing up a Sidecar .
I wonder if I ’d make a good bartender .
Probably not .
Sarah Jessica
Parker insists there is no way she will ever film a ' Sex and the City ' movie - or even another episode of the hit series .
The blonde actress , who played Carrie Bradshaw , says she knows nothing about the much rumoured big - screen adaptation or a project to film five new episodes of the hit programme .
She said : " It 's hilarious , I have n't heard anything abut it , it might be being discussed but no one has discussed it with me .
" She added : " I do n't want to do five episodes as a show and not because of any lack of affection because I loved that job .
That job is over and it was a very hard decision for me to leave .
" SJP , who is currently starring in comic movie ' Failure To Launch ' , also admits she is reluctant to commit to any episodes of ' Sex and the City ' because she does n't want to be away from her son , James .
The star , who is married to Hollywood actor Matthew Broderick , told gay magazine Bent : " For my son it is much better for me to do a movie for a finite time and then be home . "
Sarah Jessica , who married Broderick in 1997 , has also revealed she still keeps in touch with her former co-stars , Kristin Davis , Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall .
She explained : " Kristin lives in LA and is hardly in NY .
Everyone has been away & Cynthia is about to do Broadway so I will see her more .
But we all keep in touch , that is the virtue of e-mail . "

For practically all my life I ’ve had trouble going to sleep .
I ’m not an insomniac … I just think a lot .
I ’ll lie in bed thinking about what I want to do tomorrow or what I should have done today or how much I love eating cold pizza or how absurdly messy my desk is …. you get the idea .
And when I say I have trouble going to sleep … I ’m not talking 20 or 30 minutes … I ’m talking 2 or 3 hours .
Because what will happen is after about 45 minutes to an hour of trying to go to sleep , I start thinking about how I ’m not asleep but I should be …and thus the cycle begins .
Now , I may be a bit of an extreme case here , but I know for a fact that there are others out there who have trouble going to sleep .
So , I ’ve pieced together various bits of advice I ’ve received over the past few months that have not only helps me get to sleep faster , but helps me get a better nights sleep .
Do n’t watch TV or even so much as look at a computer screen atleast 30 minutes before you lie down .
The light from both a television as well as a computer monitor mimic the same intensity of light as sunlight .
This fools your body and brain into thinking it ’s nowhere near time for sleep .
Drink milk .
Milk has an amino acid in it called Tryptophan that increase the levels of serotonin and / or melatonin in the brain which slow down brain activity .
It ’s science folks .
Go to bed when you are tired .
Different strokes for different folks here .
Just because your wife goes to bed at 9 PM does n’t mean you are ready .
You might only require seven and half hours of sleep while she might require ten .
If you are n’t tired , do something low - key until you are , like read a book , play solitaire ( NOT on your computer ) , or play with some legos .
Reserve the bed for bed things ( ie sleep and sex ) .
I for one do n’t strictly follow this rule as I ’ll read some before I go to sleep , but for some people this is a must .
Meditate .
No , do n’t cross your legs and hum , but focus on relaxing … if that makes sense .
Take deep , long breaths .
Tense each muscle one at a time from head to toe .
Focusing on doing this takes your mind off of other things and you ’ll be in lala land in no time .
Excercise during the day .
I emphasize during the day .
Excercising at night just gets everything going instead of shutting down for sleep .
But excercising during the day tires the muscles out and makes for a solid nights sleep .
These are the majority of the things I have either tried or actually do routinely .
What are some things that have worked for you ?
London bomb suspect arrested Three women arrested suspected of ' harboring offenders '
Police on Wednesday released this photo of a man wanted in connection with the bombing attempts .
RELATED SPECIAL REPORT YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS
Acts of terror London or or Create Your Own LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Police on Wednesday arrested one of the four men they believe responsible for last week 's attempted bombings of London 's mass transit system , the head of Britain 's anti-terror police branch said .
Yasin Hassan Omar , a 24 - year - old Somali with British residency , was arrested early Wednesday morning in Birmingham , England 's second largest city about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) north of London .
Police allege that Omar , 24 , was the would - be bomber of the city 's Warren Street Underground station .
Omar , who was alone , resisted arrest and was subdued after police used a Taser " stun gun , " said Peter Clarke , head of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch .
No gunshots were fired , police said .
Three other men were arrested elsewhere in Birmingham around the same time at 4:30 a.m. ( 11:30 p.m. ET Tuesday ) , police said .
" This , of course , is an important development in the investigation , " Clarke said .
" However , I must stress how important it is for the public to remain watchful and alert .
We are still looking for the other three men whose pictures we released , " Clarke said , referring to the other suspected bombers .
Wednesday night , police released a new picture of another of the suspected bombers .
He is believed to have tried to set off a device at Shepherd 's Bush Underground station .
He and the would - be bomber of the city 's Oval Station have not yet been identified by police .
Clarke said a previously released picture of the Shepherd 's Bush suspect was taken at Westbourne Park Underground station .
In it , he is wearing a dark blue short - sleeve England soccer shirt and dark trousers .
Police said they believe that after running from that station , he threw the shirt away on McFarlane Road near Wood Lane about 12:30 p.m .
The latest picture shows him on a No. 220 bus wearing a white tank top with dark trousers .
Police believe he got on the bus on Wood Lane about 1:20 p.m. and stayed until the end of the route at Mapleton Road - Wandsworth , Clarke said .
He got off the bus at 2:07 p.m. near Garratt Lane , close to the Arndale Centre .
" We need to know where he went when he got off the bus , " Clarke said .
" Until these men are arrested , they remain a threat , " he said .
When shown the image on a laptop computer , several neighbors of an apartment in Stockwell raided by police Wednesday night said they recognized the man in the tank top .
" I 'm 100 percent sure , 110 percent , " one man told CNN .
During the search of the ground - floor apartment in the Stockwell neighborhood , police arrested three woman on suspicion of " harboring offenders " in connection with the July 21 attempted bombings .
They were taken to a police station in central London , where they remained in custody , Scotland Yard said .
The raid in South London was near the Stockwell Underground station where three of the four bombers boarded their trains .
Omar a resident since 1992 A nationwide manhunt has been under way since the July 21 partial detonations of backpack bombs in London .
The attacks were similar to those on July 7 that killed 52 commuters and the four bombers .
Both attacks targeted three underground trains and a double - decker bus .
In closed - circuit television images from July 21 that were released by police , Omar is wearing a blue shirt as he jumps the turnstile to flee the Warren Street station , minutes after the backpack bomb failed to fully detonate .
Omar came from Somalia in 1992 and is a legal permanent resident of Britain , the Home Office said .
Although intelligence suggested that no explosives were in the house where Omar was arrested , about 100 nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution , Clarke said .
Andy Wilkinson , a neighborhood resident , told the UK's Press Association he saw a dark - skinned man with curly hair being led away from a nearby residence in a white forensic suit and plastic handcuffs .
" It was about 10 past five and all we could hear was a right racket -- people trying to break a door down , " Wilkinson said .
" I looked out of the window and the road was full of armed police and they had got the road closed off . "
Omar was taken to the high - security Paddington Green police station in London .
The three other men were arrested more than three kilometers ( two miles ) away .
They were held in a local police station .
Police said Wednesday that one of five men previously arrested in London since July 21 -- none of them identified as key suspects -- had been released from Paddington Green .
He was picked up Friday in a raid in Stockwell .
The other four men were also detained after a series of raids across London in the days after Thursday 's incidents .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was " greatly heartened " by the arrests in Birmingham , which he called " an important development . "
Eritrean suspect identified
In addition to Omar , police have identified one other suspected bomber , Muktar Said Ibrahim .
Ibrahim 's family in London provided police with information that led to his identification and called on fellow citizens to do the same .
Ibrahim , 27 , arrived from Eritrea in 1990 , and became a British citizen in 2003 , according to the Home Office .
He is suspected of targeting a double - decker bus in the city 's East End .
Residents of a north London building apartment raided Monday by Metropolitan Police said Omar and Ibrahim lived together .
The raided apartment has been registered for the past six years to Omar , who until recently received a $ 550 monthly housing subsidy from the government .
Anti-terrorist officers also searched and conducted forensic examinations at two other residences in north London Wednesday , according to a police statement .
There were no arrests .
One of the residences is in the same neighborhood where police Tuesday impounded a white Volkswagen as part of the July 21 probe .
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair said Tuesday the July 21 bombs , which failed to explode , were just as powerful as the July 7 ones , but there was " no direct link at the moment " between the two groups of attackers .
The July 7 bombings were carried out by three British - born Muslims of Pakistani heritage who hailed from the city of Leeds , about a three - hour drive north of London , and a fourth British citizen , a Muslim convert of Jamaican birth who lived closer to London .
Three of the July 7 bombers traveled to the city from Luton in north London , and five days later police found more than a dozen unexploded bombs in a car at the Luton train station , two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN .

Responding to its inspector general , the Labor Department said it " strongly disagrees with the report 's overall characterization of the effectiveness of the Wal - Mart child labor settlement agreement . "
The department said the inspector general had wrongly given the impression that Wal - Mart had been permitted to avoid all penalties for violations of wage and hour laws by bringing its stores into compliance .
Even though department officials asserted that the agreement was much like that with other companies , Mr. Heddell found that the agreement between Wal - Mart and the Wage and Hour Division " was significantly different from other agreements entered into by W.H.D. " and " had the most far - reaching restriction on W.H.D.'s authority to conduct investigations and assess " fines .
Representative George Miller , the California Democrat who asked the inspector general to investigate the settlement , said the report showed that the Bush administration was seeking to do favors for a powerful friend and a major Republican contributor in Wal - Mart .
" The Bush Labor Department chose to do an unprecedented favor for Wal - Mart , despite the fact it is well known for violating labor laws , including child labor laws , " Mr. Miller said .
" The sweetheart deal put Wal - Mart employees at risk , undermined government effectiveness , and further undermined public confidence that the government is acting on its behalf . "
Mr. Heddell said he did not find that the agreement resulted from improper pressures .
" Nothing came to our attention indicating evidence of influence or pressure from internal or external sources , " he wrote .
Martin Heires , a Wal - Mart spokesman , said , " We think it 's important to note that the inspector general 's office found that the agreement is in compliance with federal law . "
All Things Pythonic
Python Sprint Report
by Guido van van Rossum
August 25 , 2006
For reference , here are the URLs for the sprint 's wiki page and the py3 k wiki page .
I 'll start with the results of the Py3 k part of the sprint , since I was most directly involved in it .
Warming Up
In the weeks before the sprint , I had made a number of pervasive changes to the interpreter , such as completely removing classic classes , and mostly removing has_key ( ) .
This had some fall - out ; a half dozen or so unit tests were failing as the sprint started .
Three of these failures were attacked by several sprinters and quickly fixed .
As another warm - up exercise , Alex Martelli and I tackled the problem of __hash__ overloading .
The issue is too subtle to explain here in much detail .
The problem is that object .
__hash__ exists while e.g. list .__hash__ should ideally not exist ; the solution is to set __hash__ to None in the metaclass whenever a class overrides comparison without also defining __hash__ .
We were quickly victorious ; we probably spent more time reading the old code trying to understand it , and discussing the various alternative ways to fix the problem , than we spent actually implementing it .
At this point ( late the first day ) all unit tests were passing in the py3 k branch .
This was an important milestone : we could now trust that any new test failures were introduced by recent changes , and insist that developers make all tests pass before checking in changes .
Anna Ravenscroft went through the standard library looking for places where file ( ) is called to construct a file object -- the most future - proof , and hence recommended , practice is to call open ( ) , not file ( ) .
After getting through the modules starting with ' a ' through ' g ' without finding a single occurrence of file ( ) , she asked me if I was playing a cruel joke on her .
But no , it just turned out that all the offending calls occurred much later in the alphabet !
( I wonder if someone else did the same for the 2.5 library and gave up after fixing the first half of the alphabet ? )
Int / Long Unification Martin von Löwis decided to tackle the unification of int and long .
He did this in a separate branch , which was probably a good idea from a software development point of view , but got him a bit of unnecessary attention from core developers who are n't on the Python 3000 mailing list but are on the python checkins list , and started criticizing Martin 's unfinished work without understanding the plan or its context .
As of this writing , Martin 's work is not yet completed .
Allocating of a unified int object ( which at this point is essentially a Python 2.5 long , i.e. an arbitrary precision integer ) takes about 2 times as long as allocating a Python 2.5 " short " int ( which can only hold a C long , i.e. 32 or 64 bits depending on the platform ) .
Martin is n't sure how to speed things up further .
Pystone dropped by about 10 % , which is n't so bad .
See also Martin 's complete report .
Reinventing Comparison Neal Norwitz continued for a while on a project on which he had embarked before the sprint started : ripping out the last remains of coerce ( ) .
He nearly completed this , and then ran into a snag : a call to PyNumber_CoerceEx ( ) deep down in the implementation of comparisons which caused everything to fall down if removed .
So he checked in his work up to that point ( leaving that one crucial call in ) and passed the baton to me .
Looking at the issue , I realized that the only way to fix this would be to implement the revision of comparisons that I had been planning for Py3k .
So I ended up spending at least two days , with Alex helping on and off , reworking the guts of comparisons , making them comply with my vision for comparisons in Python 3000 .
This turned out to be a real can of worms !
The plan has two parts : ( a ) no default mixed - type orderings , so e.g. ' a ' < 1 would raise a TypeError ( but ' a '= =1 should return False ) ; and ( b ) do n't use __cmp__ as a fallback for rich comparisons .
I started by implementing a super - strict interpretation of these rules , which also removed falling back on rich comparisons when __cmp__ was requested .
Once it compiled , it would n't even start up , because some code in site .py was broken as a result .
It turned out that ints and longs did n't implement rich comparisons !
That was quickly fixed , and now we could at least start the interpreter .
But running the test suite would always eventually end with a segfault .
Much later , I discovered that this was due to a failing error check on a dict lookup call in the bytecode compiler ( quickly fixed the next day by Jeremy ) which was triggered by code objects not having a proper comparison any more .
Removing all comparison code from the code object made it default to the default comparison ( and hash ) implementation , which was good enough to stop the compiler from malfunctioning .
At this point we had about 70 failing unit tests .
I spent about a day fixing these , one by one .
Fairly early during this process I realized that if neither object knows how to compare itself to the other , for == and != , we should n't fail , but return the default ( pointer ) comparison instead .
A bit later I decided that there were too many uses of cmp ( ) in the library and the test suite to rip out , so I had to compromise : when cmp does n't find a tp_compare implementation , it falls back to using the tp_richcompare implementation .
But ( and this is still a big departure from 2.5 ) not the other way around !
Slowly but surely more and more unit tests got fixed .
I checked in a checkpoint with only four failing tests .
Two of these expected to compare code objects by value , and I eventually implemented this again ( but no ordering on code objects ! ) .
The last two failing tests required a consultation with Tim Peters : datetime had some extrelemy convoluted code to avoid hitting the default ordering , which no longer is a problem in Py3k , and so got ripped out ; and the last hold - out was test_mutants .
py .
After Tim explained why it was there and how to fix it , it discovered a reference counting bug !
That is its job , but the interesting part was that the same reference counting bug also exists in 2.5 and was n't found there , because in 2.5 test_mutants only exercises three - way comparison but not rich comparison ( and 2.5 dictionaries implement both separately ! ) .
This was fun ( in some extreme geek way :) but meant I did n't get to the project I had really wanted to do : the new I /O library .
A few people ( especially Charles Merriam and Hasan Diwan ) looked into the design issues there but not all that much concrete work was done .
From the cutting edge of Tokyo and New York to the chilled cabinet at Boots , sushi is fast becoming the global convenience food of choice .
But , Alex Renton asks , can raw fish and cold rice ever become the new Big Mac ?
We do n't have an address for Mr Sawada , the sushi master .
Just a card with the samurai symbol of a red dragonfly and the name of a street off Tokyo's Ginza .
We find the tiny dragonfly engraved beside a buzzer in an unremarkable doorway .
' This is a very extraordinary moment for me , ' says Chie , our translator , as we troop up some shabby stairs .
' I could never eat here .
I am not rich , I am not old enough . '
She 's in her mid-thirties ; I think she means - ' not wise enough ' .
Ordinarily you would pay some $ 500 in advance just to make a booking here at the table of one of Japan 's most talked - about traditional sushi chefs .
But then , we could never have made a booking , because Sawada serves at most eight people each mealtime and is booked up years ahead .
He has given us a few minutes at the end of his day to photograph him in action .
We find a small square room made entirely - floor , ceiling , walls , chairs , counter and even the fridge - of pale lemon hinoki wood .
This signifies luxury ; it 's used for the coffins of the emperors of Japan .
There is no other colour in the room except a single pink camellia in a tiny vase on the counter .
The sushi master is solemn , shaven - headed like a Buddhist priest , and a dead ringer for Brian Cox .
He shows us his knives , his charcoal stove , his rice cooker and his prep surface .
His sushi is served plateless , on to the hinoki- wood counter , which is planed down after each meal until it is virgin again .
Sawada heaps rice straw on the charcoal burner , lights it and then passes a slab of bonito back and forth through the smoke .
This is an ancient method , taken from the Tokyo Bay fishermen .
When it 's sufficiently scorched he takes the fish to the counter and cuts two finger - sized slivers from it .
Beside him is a basket of warm , vinegared rice , Sawada takes a breath .
He shapes his fingers into a position known as ninjitsu - aping Ninja fighters - and begins the gentle , rhythmic hand - jive that makes the nigiri sushi .
His palms move from side to side under his bent head , shaping a mini-loaf of rice .
He smears it with a fingertip of wasabi .
Then he lays the curved strip of lean fish - flesh over it , as though fitting a delicate piece of marquetry .
He places the mouthful , precisely angled , on the counter .
This is nigiri sushi , the original , unchanged in 180 years .
I have to ask him what he thinks of ' new sushi ' - California roll , for example .
He repeats the Japanese translation - kashu - maki - as though it 's new to him .
' California roll ?
I find it - chaotic .'
A few months later , at 6 pm in the Yo! Sushi shop in Haymarket , off Piccadilly Circus , a man is slicing a roll of raw red snapper , matter - of - fact even though he is - like all sushi chefs - on stage .
The waxy flesh falls away from his knife like loam behind a plough .
When he 's done , using every last scrap , he starts on a beefy log of raw tuna .
Shape , aim , cut , push .
It 's hypnotic .
Soon , with some slices of bright orange farmed salmon , and a nest of shredded daikon radish and mustard cress , this will be a seven - slice Assorted Sashimi , yours for an amazing £ 5 .
The sashimi goes on to the conveyor belt .
Watching the bowls in their Habitat colours ride the track is just as monotonously mesmerising as watching the chef coddling his fish hunks : in front of the conveyor you turn train - spotter , wondering whether that piece of yellowtail and salmon roe will come round again .
The mechanical ballets of sushi and sashimi - making are an art whether you 're in Tokyo , at Nobu , or at Yo! Sushi .
There are differences , though .
Sawada trained for six years , and at Nobu the chefs do three years before they are allowed to lay hands on the fish .
( What do the novice chefs do for those three years ?
They wash the rice .
They do the dishes .
They watch and they meditate . )
At Yo ! the training is just two months .
Across town at Nobu or at Zuma in Knightsbridge seven slices of purple , orange and white sashimi , not very different from Yo ! 's Special Assorted , will cost you an easy £ 20 , before service .
The origins of sushi are in fact more Yo! than Nobu or Sawada .
It was a street food , a working - class dish - as so often , haute cuisine borrowed and tarted up a staple of the poor .
Modern sushi - in the sense of raw fish served on vinegared rice - began at a street - food stall in the city of Edo , now Tokyo , in 1824 .
The stall 's owner , Yohei Hanaya , was the first person to shape vinegared rice with his hands and then crown it with a slice of raw fish - prompted , it 's said , by impatient customers , who could n't be bothered to wait for the traditional pressing in a box .
Long before , at least 500 years before Christ , southeast Asians discovered that cooked rice begins to ferment , and that fish packed in this will be preserved .
The technique is believed to have arrived in Japan in about 600 AD .
Around then in Europe we were learning that fish - for most people , the cheapest and the most readily available source of protein - could be made to last with vinegar or salt .
Thus , starting with the same intentions , the Japanese got sushi .
We got salt cod and pickled herring .
Hanaya 's innovation made him sushi's Colonel Sanders .
So popular were his nigiri ( hand - rolled ) sushi that nigiri- sushi stalls soon outnumbered most other food outlets in Tokyo .
As with the sandwich - invented by an 18th - century Earl of Sandwich as handy food for eating when gambling - convenience was and remains the selling point .
His rice fingers with their fish topping were and still are eaten usually by hand , upside - down , in two mouthfuls .
Westerners have their own method with nigiri sushi - we take up the chopsticks and try hopelessly to scissor them in half .
Then we may dunk the mouthful in a bowl of soy sauce until it disintegrates so we have to eat it grain by grain .
Or we prod the whole nigiri into our mouths in one go - and choke .
This is why many Japanese people would rather not watch Westerners eat sushi : it 's not just gross , it 's wrong .
Hanaya 's sushi are recognisably what you 'll find at Yo! Sushi , at Sainsbury 's or even Boots .
But there 's debate about how much of Hanaya 's fish was raw .
Certainly some would have been marinated in soy or part - cooked , as prawn and eel usually are today .
Raw sushi only became plentiful when refrigeration arrived in Japan in the 1930s .
Salmon and salmon eggs are n't even listed among the contributing fish in my 1981 sushi cookbook - but now Japan imports nearly a - quarter - of - a- million tons of farmed salmon a year , approaching the levels for tuna .
What 's now the most expensive cut of tuna , the fatty belly - meat of bluefin tuna called otoro and shimofuri , was cat - food until the 1950s : it became a delicacy as a result of a Japanese government marketing campaign to deal with tuna shortages caused , it 's said , by nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific .
Now , at Nobu , the melt - in - your - mouth piece of pinky - yellow shimofuri will cost you £ 6 , compared with just £ 3 for a piece of lean akami off the top of the fish .
The next innovation was in the delivery .
Not long after Ray Kroc of McDonald 's was inspired by Detroit motor industry assembly - lines , Yoshiaki Shiraishi visited a beer - bottling factory in Osaka .
He had run an under - performing sushi bar in the city .
It did n't lack customers : his problem was the speed at which he could serve them .
In retail economist - speak , he needed to up the foot - fall and lower the dwell - time .
So he removed the chairs from his restaurant .
That increased the customer numbers , but then he was faced with the problem of having to employ more staff to serve them .
The bottling - factory conveyor belt was the answer .
Yoshiaki's first Genroku Sushi restaurants opened in 1958 and were an instant , profitable hit - especially after he put the customers at four - seater tables at right angles to the belt , instead of all facing it .
That way four times as many customers got served .
His chief problem was working out the right speed for the belt - too slow and the customers got impatient ; too fast and there were accidents .
And the air - flow was liable to dry the sushi .
In the end , 8 cm a second proved perfect .
In a few years Shiraishi had 240 conveyor - belt sushi restaurants ; Japan now has 2,700 of them .
( He died in 2001 : he later lost most of his money trying to bury the profession of waitering for ever by developing sushi- serving robots . )
When the World Fair was held in Osaka in 1970 Genroku Sushi set up a restaurant there - an exhibit that fixed the event in the minds of foreign commentators who were among the 64 million visitors .
Looking back , it 's startling that those wide - eyed Western visitors did n't just grab the idea .
But both raw fish and conveyor belts travelled slowly , and reached Europe and Britain last .
We did n't get our first conveyor - belt sushi restaurant until Moshi Moshi opened in Waterloo station in 1994 .
Sushi's migration and the process of its globalisation started in the large expat Japanese communities all round the Pacific rim - in western and southern America , Australia and Brazil .
It became a rite of passage for Japanese chefs who'd been through the long sushi apprenticeship to go to these outposts , where the cuisine was less rigorously traditional .
Nobuyuki Matsuhisa - now proprietor , in Nobu , of the poshest Asian cooking franchise of them all - made sushi in Lima , Buenos Aires and in Anchorage , Alaska before he settled in Los Angeles in 1978 .
But the key moment in sushi's crossover from native cuisine to global snack is the invention of the California roll .
It 's the spaghetti bolognese of sushi now - a confection of cooked crab , avocado and mayonnaise inside a roll of sushi rice , probably bound with a strip of nori seaweed .
It is an international cliché , but it was the crossover hit that took sushi out of Japan and on to the path to global dominance .
If sushi were Abba , the California roll is Waterloo .
It is said to have been invented in 1973 at Los Angeles 's Tokyo Kaikan restaurant ( which still exists ) by a chef called Ichiro Manashita .
No one knows what happened to Manashita , but I have met Akihiro Izumi , now head chef at the JW Marriott in Bangkok , proud inventor of the New York roll .
( Take the California roll , substitute apple - ' it 's the Big Apple , right ? ' - for the avocado .
Simple .
There 's a Philadelphia roll that does the same with cream cheese . )
Aki grew up poor in rural Japan , where sushi was a once - a - year family treat .
After his five years training with a sushi master - ' the boss used to slap me round the head ' - he left to work in a restaurant in Manhattan 's Upper East Side .
There they served traditional Japanese food to Japanese businessmen at a $ 50 minimum charge for sushi - ' and that was in the early 80s ' .
After seven years , he went to California - ' just me , my sushi knife and my dog ' .
Aki found a new world .
' When I arrived I had no idea there existed a California roll .
It was like a revolution in Japanese cooking .
So many different kinds of sushi !'
This was liberating ; he never went back to Japan .
Now he works round the five - star hotels of Asia : he makes sushi with sautéed foie gras , beef , caviar and tempura , with balsamic or sherry vinegar in the rice .
' My sushi master would not approve , ' he says .
Sushi's penetration happened slowest in Europe .
Most English people who started eating sushi in the Eighties had that first , mind - opening bite in Manhattan , Sydney or San Francisco .
London had Japanese restaurants but they chiefly fed the Japanese .
Mark Edwards , now executive head chef of Nobu Group , and undoubtedly the greatest Japanese cook to emerge from Kent , lost his sushi virginity late - in 1987 in New York .
His partner was a piece of otoro tuna belly served as nigiri .
' I was flabbergasted , ' he says .
' I could n't believe it .
It was very exciting .'
He 'd worked in restaurants in London , like the Café Royal , which served something they called sushi .
' We 'd do it for canapés .
But it was marinated fish dishes , or smoked salmon rolls .
You have to understand , London was nowhere in the late Eighties .
New York was the capital of new cuisine .
And there was a consciousness that Asian was where things were headed . '
Key to the slow arrival of raw fish on menus in London was the lack of materials .
' Even nine years ago , when we started Nobu in Park Lane , you 'd struggle to get the ingredients .
Now you can get anything .'
As Edwards started working in New York , an itinerant Japanese chef called Nobuyuki Matsuhisa was putting the savings from nine years labour at the LA sushi counters into a tiny new restaurant in Beverly Hills .
Actors turned up , they liked drinking sake with Nobu .
In 1989 , Robert De Niro took his buddy the sushi chef to New York and showed him a loft .
This was where they were going to sell New Yorkers Nobu 's new Japanese cooking .
Matsuhisa demurred , but de Niro kept badgering him .
In 1994 they opened Manhattan 's first Nobu - and , with that , sushi finally arrived in the fashion mainstream .
A combination of celebrity , surprising ideas and cool design made the tipping point .
The formula was nothing new in restaurateering - it came out just right .
The hook of Japanese food , especially raw fish , as healthy and non-fattening certainly helped .
And Nobu flourished - there are 15 Nobus now across the world and a thousand copycats .
The first London restaurant opened in February 1997 , and another last year ( both have Michelin stars ) .
Nobu 's dishes like black cod in miso and softshell crab roll are flagrantly , universally ripped - off .
The key to Nobu 's success clearly lies in his willingness to compromise on the issue of raw fish - just as Manashita did with his California roll .
Nobu 's ' new - style sashimi ' is the result , he says of a day when a customer returned a dish of fresh flounder , that Nobu had cut paper thin , arranged as you might the petals of a flower and served up raw with some shredded radish .
As you would .
But the customer would not eat raw fish .
Some chefs would have thrown the yokel out of the restaurant , but Nobu had a thoughtful look around his kitchen .
He reports : ' My gaze fell upon some olive oil that had been heating in a frying pan .
" That 's it , " I thought .
Sesame oil would be combined with heated olive oil to add aroma .
The raw fish would be topped with ginger spears and menegi ( shallots ) and then drizzled with ponzu ( a citric and soy sauce ) .
Then the hot oil would be poured over it .
The customer who had claimed not to be able to eat raw fish understood the way I felt .
He tried a mouthful , then two , and ended up leaving the plate clean ... I am supremely happy at times like these . '
Nobu has every reason to be chuffed - this artistic unbending has been the basis of a multimillion - dollar business .
And it was key to sushi's crossover .
It led to the presence today in Boots the Chemist 's sandwich fridge of a six - piece Shapers sushi roll pack at £ 2.30 , maki filled with floppy red and yellow pepper slices , two with a sorry grey mash of cooked tuna and blanched salmon .
The sushi masters would not like that at all .
The rawness was always the sticking point for Westerners .
James
Bond , the first tough guy in Western fiction who was also a foodie , enjoyed Japanese women and sake ( 'especially when it 's served at exactly 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit ' , he quips geekishly in You Only Live Twice ) .
But he did n't fancy sushi .
As late as the Sixties a British guidebook to Japan could still warn of the ' stomach - turning ' Japanese habit of consuming raw fish , which indicated fundamental differences between Oriental and Occidental digestions .
Following advice given by the US Embassy , Americans in Japan during the 1950s ate teriyaki and tempura , but only consumed sushi if the fish was cooked .
Has much changed ?
' Fifty per cent of the British population , when confronted with the idea of raw fish and cold rice , will go , " Yee -urrgggh ! "
That 's what our research shows .
We 're not sure we can ever shift that . '
So says Darren Wightman , group executive chef at Yo! Sushi , which is now Europe 's biggest conveyor - belt sushi restaurant chain .
We 're sitting in a concrete bunker in Yo ! 's head office in London 's Farringdon .
The war - room look is not inappropriate .
Yo ! has fought and won the battle to dominate the British ' fast - casual ' sushi market .
Now , with branches already in Dubai and Paris , it is planning an assault via franchisees on the United States .
We 're talking big - sushi is the ' Japanese tapas ' , sushi is the new pizza , sushi is the sandwich of the 21st century .
It 's healthy , Zen , stylish .
But it has a long way to go .
Georgia Hall , Yo ! 's feisty head of marketing , suddenly admits that she ate her first sushi only a year ago , shortly after she joined the company .
We all look amazed - Darren particularly .
An Australian , he ate his first as a teenager .
Why so long ?
' Well , I 'm a Geordie .
People in Newcastle do n't eat raw fish .
They eat pie and chips . '
Yo ! is pushing hard at that ' immature market ' .
Its spread of 21 restaurants in the UK ( with seven more on the way ) crosses several class divides .
You can eat Yo! sushi in Bluewater and in Selfridges , in Paddington Station and in Mayfair .
The branch in London 's Haymarket , off Piccadilly - a classic ' high foot - fall ' area for fast - turnover food - is on a site where a McDonald 's branch failed .
While Yo ! has had its own failures - an Edinburgh branch closed , and Newcastle is a nut they 're not going to crack yet - clearly it has pushed the notion of raw fish deep into the conservative part of a nation that previously liked its fish white and in a coat of batter or crumbs .
Yo ! was likeable but chaotic when Simon Woodroffe launched it in 1997 : now under more professional management it is a very hot brand .
It is what the catering industry calls a ' category killer ' - capable of knocking out all competitors in its market segment .
Think Wagamama , Pizza Express and La Tasca .
By the middle of 2005 Yo! already had 45 per cent of the ' fast - casual ' sushi market - a million customers a year .
In America , they think , there 's potential for 4,500 Yo! Sushis .
' No one there has yet done converyor belt sushi sexed - up - it 's all bottom - end , drab and boring , ' says Georgia .
Conveyor belts are crucial to Yo ! - they 're not just the gimmick , they 're also key to profit and product turnover , explains Darren Wightman .
Without the conveyor belt , revenues drop 35 per cent .
The conveyor belt means that dwell - time - the number of minutes customers are in the shop - can be as low as 12 minutes , during which a customer will spend , on average , £ 14 .
Pizza Express takes twice as long to extract that much cash .
In Paddington Station Yo ! 's mere 15 seats will cater to as many as 400 covers a day .
And a combination of wily head chefs and computer tracking keeps wastage to mere 1.5 per cent - in this sort of catering 5 to 6 per cent is normal .
These sort of figures enchant investors .
But what 's impressive for the Yo! customer is that the food on the track is no more expensive than five years ago - the price range of the coloured plates is still between £ 1.50 and £ 5 - and it is hugely improved .
The original Yo!s served a choice of 40 or so dishes .
Today there are 110 to 120 on the track or immediately available and 400 ' in the repertoire ' .
And quality has gone from dubious - in the original wacky , manga - themed Yo! shops of the late Nineties - to extremely good .
Tellingly , they use the same fish supplier as Nobu .
Mark Edwards of Nobu is a Yo! fan - ' I like it - I would eat there : they keep costs down and the quality good , and I respect that . '
Colin Clague at Zuma , London 's brightest new - style Japanese restaurant , says he likes Yo ! , but that , when you put any sort of mechanisation into the process , what you 're producing is n't really sushi any more .
So where is sushi going ?
Clearly fast - food sushi is going to boom .
Pret A Manger - which started selling chilled sushi from its shops the same year that Nobu opened in London - now shifts 25,000 to 30,000 of its £ 4.95 ' Sushi deluxe ' packs a week - about the same as for tuna mayonnaise or chicken - and - avocado sandwiches .
And Pret A Manger is now part - owned by McDonald's .
Sushi is the new sandwich .
In the fast - food world where customers are ever more neophiliac , it 's still seen as ' healthy ' and ' innovative ' - the two key adjectives that , according to Pret 's commercial director Simon Hargraves , made it attractive for the chain nine years ago .
At the top end , the simple and ancient art of the sushi master is still under assault from the forces of revolution .
The sushi competition run each year by Matsuri in London 's High Holborn was won last year by a mozzarella , spring onion and almond confection ( the runner - up was mashed kipper and crispy - bacon sushi ) .
Mark Edwards has spotted a sushi risotto in Milan ; in Bangkok I had a fright at ' pizza sushi ' .
In Japan the endless search for obscurer marine creatures to eat continues .
There 's a tradition in the country that each new thing you eat adds a year to your life , which may account for the kamachi kombu Edwards once ate - a frond of dried seaweed with the eggs laid there by a herring still attached .
Having survived 2,500 years of changes , sushi faces its greatest challenge just as it goes global : the catastrophic decline of the basic raw material .
Almost every staple sushi and sashimi fish is threatened in the wild , most of all the bluefin tuna .
Farmed fish provide some answers - thus the rise of the use of salmon - but farmed fish have to be fed on fish , and this has caused declines in other stocks .
Real sushi will in the end be only for the rich .
Street sushi will increasingly feature what the industry unappetisingly calls ' seafood analogues ' - imitation fish .
The technique of surimi - blanching and processing fish protein - is another ancient Japanese invention : but today with the addition of vegetable starches , sugar , flavouring and colouring it brings us crabsticks , ' shredded shellfish ' , faux - lobster tails and clams , and even reconstituted fish steaks .
America produces 150,000 tonnes of it a year and Alaskan pollack , the principal source of fish - processing protein , is now threatened by over - fishing .
But as the techniques improve , customers are being seduced .
Akihiro Izumi in Bangkok told me customers demand crabsticks - ' they prefer it to real crab ' .
He thinks this is blasphemy , but I say : keep it coming .
Mock fish means more bluefin otoro moments for the rest of us .
All Things Pythonic
Library or Framework ?
by Guido van van Rossum
March 15 , 2006
Summary
A quick observation on the difference between libraries and frameworks .
Advertisement
Neil Schemenauer made me see an interesting difference between frameworks and libraries .
These are my words but it 's really his idea :
A framework is just an application with a lot of hooks ; you can design a framework in an entirely ad - hoc fashion by starting with an app that does one thing and trying to generalize in various directions .
You can stop at almost any moment and call it " a framework " .
But a good library requires much more -- there , you need to start with requirements , abstractions and attempt at a minimal API that addresses the maximal set of requirements .
Frameworks have no requirement to be minimal in size while maximal in features .

Stunted Growth : Subsidies and Stagnation in the Software Tools Market
Recently , I broke my wrist .
I went to a minor emergency clinic , where they took an X -ray .
This machine , a standard film device , was probably 20 years old by the look of it .
The doctor examined the images and sent me on to a specialist .
The specialist put my wrist in a cast and ordered a new set of X - rays to confirm that the bones were properly aligned after casting .
The next X - ray machine was a modern unit , one that produces a real - time image on a monitor , allowing the technician to perfectly position the joint .
If there is some slight movement that blurs the image , the technician can see this right away and snap another shot .
I commented upon how marvelous this machine was , and he said , " I do n’t know how I could do my job without it . "
When economists comment on what caused the boom of the 1990’s and the expanding economy of today , one word you will surely hear is productivity , and this newfangled X - Ray machine is a perfect example of what they are talking about .
With this new tool , the X - Ray technician is able to produce a far better result in less time ; because of it , the technician is able to demand a competitive salary .
When you stop and think about it , you can probably list off a few devices like this X - Ray machine yourself .
What ’s striking is that most of the " ca n’t do without it " machines have software as a primary component .
The " ca n’t do without it " machines can’t do without us !
This fact makes it all the more perplexing that we do n’t have a " ca n’t do without it " machine for software development — which is not to say that there has not been any improvement in software tools and practices .
I just mean that those advances that have happened are not as great as workers in other industries have enjoyed .
The sad fact is , we have been spending our creative energies helping others do their jobs , but few of us have been able to do anything for our own productivity .
This has dire consequences for our future salaries , the future of our industry , and the future of the global economy .
If development tools remain stagnant , salaries for software developers will not keep pace with the economy as a whole .
The best young minds will choose other majors at Universities and the resulting dearth of talent in the software field will then slow production of productivity - enhancing machines for other industries , thus causing the whole economy to slow .
This article explores the question of why development tools have not advanced much in the past couple decades .
Other authors have commented on this , and most emphasize the difficulty of creating development tools .
I do not dispute that , but would point out that if people are given sufficient incentive they can overcome most any challenge .
I intend to show that persistent economic conditions are the root cause of the slow growth in the development tools industry .
Improvements in Coding Productivity
When I first began pondering this dilemma , I did what I usually do when presented with a terrible conundrum : I went to lunch with some of my clever friends .
Perhaps they could convince me I was blind and that productivity has , in fact , been improving and I just had n’t noticed .
The first candidate for a " ca n’t do without it " machine was the IDE , but the Emacs contingent quickly refuted that ; they showed that IDE ’s brought together a set of tools ( editor , debugger , browser ) that were already available .
The IDE is easier to learn , but beyond the learning curve an IDE is not necessarily better to work with than a well configured set of separate tools .
That said , continuous compilation is one aspect of the IDE that seems like it may become a bona - fide " ca n’t do without it " technology .
Code completion can significantly improve coding speed , and the " refactor " capability allows us to make changes we might not have even attempted in earlier days .
Still , we all felt that the current capabilities of IDE ’s made us a few percent more efficient , but not an order of magnitude .
C++ and Object - Oriented Programming have come into widespread use , but we all noted that people had been bodging C and other languages to do class - like things before the formal introduction of C++ , so you could say that it really is n’t all that new .
Templates are new , but they still have yet to realize their potential in C++ because many engineers find them too difficult to use .
Their counterparts in Java and C# are still too far out on the leading edge for most shops to be able to use them .
Once they do , there ’s some likelihood that the same thing that happened to C++ templates will happen to Java and C# .
UML and modeling systems have gained traction , but still have not gained anything like universal acceptance .
Further , the UML modeling paradigm is geared toward helping improve the productivity of a team of people with a mixture of specialties and concerns as opposed to helping an individual programmer .
So , in a sense , UML is more of a tool for software product managers than a tool for software engineers .
In the end , we were forced to conclude that a programmer using tools that were state of the art circa 1990 was indeed only marginally less effective than the same programmer using the tools we have today .
What is Stunting the Growth of Development Tools ?
This regrettable lack of progress is not new ; Frederick Brooks observed it back in 1986 in his essay , " No Silver Bullet . "
[ Brooks , 1987 , 1995 ]
In this essay Brooks argues that we are not likely to see a single innovation that increases programmer productivity by an order of magnitude or more , as some past innovations have .
In this respect , history has proven Brooks correct .
What Brooks did not foresee in this essay were the hundreds of small ideas that have crept into practice since he wrote his paper nearly 20 years ago .
The aggregate effect of all of these has had a meaningful impact on productivity , certainly more than any of the large movements that were going on back then .
So when we ask why productivity is growing so slowly , we should look away from the big schemes and ask why the small ideas are so few in number .
So , why is it that with all of us staring the problem of our own productivity in the face day after day that we have not come up with a " ca n’t do without " technology to help ourselves ?
In order to make a new product happen , you need three things : a good idea , skilled people , and the motivation to try it .
We know that the skilled people are out there .
Moreover , we know that these skilled people do n’t seem to have any problem coming up with ideas to help other industries , so we should assume that they are also coming up with ideas in the software development space .
So it must be the motivation that ’s missing .
Most software developers just love writing a good tool , and many of us will write them just for the satisfaction alone .
But when it comes to selling a product , you need more than just the product .
You need sales people , documentation people , test engineers — and you ca n’t expect all of them to share your zeal ; they will want to get paid .
Software tool development , then , is just like any other industry : " motivation to do it " mostly comes down to money .
On the face of it , there should be a great deal of money in the software tools business .
There are lots of people out there getting paid handsome salaries to develop software .
But , surprisingly , the money really is n’t there for small businesses .
This article will show that the ultimate cause of this deficiency is the fact that most of the large development tools are subsidized by the sales of Operating Systems and hardware .
These subsidies have the effect of diminishing the profit potential of any pure software tool vendor and thus remove the incentive to create .
Following the Money
The 1980 ’s and 90’s were abuzz with the term software crisis , a phrase coined when it first became obvious that we were having a tough time coming up with software that was as good as the hardware , and that there was not enough predictability and productivity in the software creation process .
It was generally believed that since the demand for software was so great , anyone who could come up with a tool for doing " Rapid Application Development " would be in a position to make a nearly infinite amount of money , because once this better mousetrap was invented , software shops would be obliged to adopt it or go out of business .
During those years , a great deal of venture capital money was poured into the development of software development tools — to very little effect , unfortunately .
The few survivors of this era ( e.g. Rational Software , now a part of IBM ) live mostly in the very top end of the market — that is , they sell expensive software to large organizations .
In order to sell into this sort of market , most of their efforts are devoted to making a team of programmers more effective , not towards making each programmer more effective .
Thus the survivors of this era largely quit making development tools and started making collaboration tools .
The great multitude did not survive .
That ’s a shame , because they had a number of worthy ideas .
Atherton Technologies , for instance , created and touted the " Atherton Backplane , " which was not an IDE , as such , but rather a platform onto which CASE tools and other software engineering tools could be built .
This is the same core concept at the heart of Eclipse .
As a separate product marketed by Atherton , devoid of any agenda other than making money , this idea faltered .
When IBM undertook the same idea , it succeeded because IBM ’s motivation is not to make money with Eclipse or WebSphere , but really to promote its platform and enhance its other business units ’ places in the market .
Vendor - Supplied Development Tools
IBM ’s Eclipse is an example of a platform - vendor - supplied development tool .
That is , it is a development tool built to help the vendor promote and exert control over a platform .
In this particular case , IBM created Eclipse to help it sell its web servers and consulting services .
Microsoft is another example : they produce Visual Studio and the rest of their line with the intent to maximize the success of the Windows operating system line .
Similarly , Sun produces their Java compiler and related tools with the intent of selling more server hardware .
In fact , most companies that have ever offered a successful operating system also offered a development toolkit .
The crucial thing to understand about platform - vendor - supplied development tools is that these products are not required to be profitable .
The platform vendors see development tools as a means to increase the sales of their platform , their other software lines , consulting services , and for some , hardware as well .
To that end , all of them introduce things into their toolkits to make it difficult to port software written with their tools to other platforms .
Of course , they all walk a fine line here ; if their tools are branded with the epithet of " non-standard " then customers might stray to alternative development tool vendors .
Contrary to what the marketing literature would have you believe , vendor - supplied development tools are not a hotbed of innovation .
Their goal is to be firmly in the mainstream , to attract the broadest spectrum of developers .
Should a new technology evolve elsewhere that proves to be popular , it will be incorporated into the platform vendor ’s product .
If you want to talk to a Product Manager at one of these companies about a new idea for an extension to their environment , their response always comes down to , " I ’ll think about incorporating it when a lot of my user base asks for it . "
These vendors do not promulgate tools and techniques ; they consume them .
Turbo Pascal and the Consequences of Complacency
Conservatism , taken to extreme , leads to revolution .
This is true in government , economics , and certainly the software tools industry .
Just as the platform vendors have learned to be cautious about introducing untried technologies into their products , they also need to absorb innovative technologies into their product .
If they do n’t , they again risk losing control over their platform .
Let ’s look at a historical example of this effect , the introduction of Turbo Pascal , which is arguably the most significant development tool ever released .
To set the scene , in 1983 the PC was very new , and the compilers offered by Microsoft , IBM , and others were stunningly bad .
They were large , old programs , some ported from mainframes and force - fit onto the PC platform — and they were quite expensive .
The PC knocked down the antiquated idea that computers were solely institutional commodities .
However , development environments were still being bought and sold as they had been before the PC .
Although IBM is credited with " inventing " the PC , they built it out of pre-existing parts .
It was how these parts were packaged and marketed that made the PC succeed where CP / M machines had not .
Turbo Pascal was a repeat of that phenomenon .
The idea of the IDE was n’t new ; it was the packaging of it on the PC platform , marketing it to individual developers , and then pricing it at one - tenth the cost of competitors that made the magic happen .
Turbo Pascal was ridiculously successful , so successful that Microsoft was obliged to pull its Pascal offering from the market altogether .
It ’s hard to measure exactly how much of a problem this caused for Microsoft , but one thing is certain : they did n’t like it very much .
Turbo Pascal made Borland into the dominant force in the PC developer tool marketplace , but Borland ultimately lost control of the market .
Microsoft regained the market by traditional means : they spent a lot of money on development and then worked diligently at making sales .
Any company with sufficiently deep pockets could have supplanted Borland at that time had they done the same thing , but it ’s instructive to note that Microsoft did while other companies ( e.g. IBM ) did not .
Control of the DOS and Windows platforms was simply more important to Microsoft than it was to anybody else .
At the present , Microsoft is in a position to either spend Borland completely out of existence or buy them outright .
And yet they do not .
In any normal business proposition , they certainly would , so that they could drive up the prices and make some money off of their considerable investment in controlling the market .
However , as they are not terribly concerned about making a profit on their development tools , Microsoft behaves differently .
Their main concern is to avoid both being too aggressive and being too conservative .
The presence of a vendor like Borland allows Microsoft to gauge new technologies and to keep its technologies modern without ever appearing to be too far on the edge .
But the principal lesson to take from the Turbo Pascal event is this : platform vendors must incorporate ideas from the community into their products .
While this is a good thing for the platform ’s development community , it ’s a very bad thing for the small tool vendor , because there ’s no rule at that says the tool vendor has to get paid .
Web Services and the Struggle Between C# and Java
" Clash of the Titans " struggles like Microsoft vs. Borland are fairly rare , but we happen to have another one going on right now between Microsoft and Sun .
When trying to understand where this struggle will go , it ’s instructive to note how it started .
Microsoft ’s initial reaction to Java was to try to out - Java Sun by creating the Microsoft JVM .
They employed the long established technique of introducing subtle incompatibilities between their Java and Sun ’s Java , so that if you developed for the Microsoft platform , you would have a difficult time moving to Sun’s .
By the time Sun made that plan intractable , it had become clear that web servers collectively were not extensions to an operating system platform , but rather a platform in and of itself .
When Microsoft was forced to conclude that they could not co-opt this new platform from Sun , they set about creating their own platform .
At the outset , Microsoft knew that they had a very safe market base .
The developers who have been working on other applications using Windows platforms will want to stick with a Windows platform for developing web applications .
Just as we previously discussed , Microsoft had only two ways to lose their market : either appear to be out - of - date or appear to be too far out on the leading edge .
So when Microsoft designed C# and the other .
Net languages , they started with the core concepts from Java and added just a few carefully chosen refinements .
Most of the refinements they chose were openly discussed as refinements to Java well before C# .
So even though Microsoft created a whole new language , they chose a very conservative path .
Going forward , we can expect to see incremental improvements to both the Java and C# toolkits , executed virtually simultaneously as both try to " me too ! " one another .
Unfortunately , even though a huge amount of blood and treasure will be undoubtedly be expended , we really should n’t hold our breath waiting for something dramatic to emerge .
Big Money , Small Result
We have shown that the platform vendors are the dominant force in the development tools market , but also that they are the most conservative .
Moreover , even if they wanted to become more aggressive , they could not because they can only employ a tiny subset of the people who have good ideas about software tools .
Consequently , their offerings primarily consist of things that have been conceived , implemented , and proven useful by others .
This is not unique to the software market .
Generally speaking , if you are looking for real innovation , you do n’t look at large , well - funded labs .
You look in garages and basements .
This is n’t because the garages and basements are better places to do research , it ’s because there are a whole lot more garages and basements than there are well - funded labs .
The Low End of the Market
Let ’s say that you have written a nifty little program that simplifies your daily grind a little bit .
Let ’s further suppose that you find that quite a few other folks would benefit from your program .
What are your options ?
In many cases , your hands are tied because you wrote the tool on the company ’s dime , and they deny your request to publish it .
But let ’s take an optimistic case and say that you own the code .
What then ?
Publishing commercial software is not easy , and definitely not free .
Still , you can make a decent living selling a software development tool .
The problem is that you face the constant risk that a platform vendor will release a new version of its IDE with your tool ’s functionality built in , which could destroy your business entirely .
Given this reality , it ’s little wonder that people commonly choose to release a product as some form of freeware .
Free software enjoys a number of competitive advantages aside from being free .
The trouble with the freeware approach is that the author ’s initial vision is often not quite enough .
That is , the author designed the software under the assumption that it would be used in a particular environment , and in certain ways .
The wider world includes diverse environments , and not all people will have the same notion of how to use the tool as the author did .
Inevitably , your product will require some support .
Ideally , your users will take some of the load off of you , but you really can’t count on that .
In most cases , only a tiny fraction of freeware users will contribute to the code .
The reality is that even open source code requires sales , marketing , and support ; the author must supply most of this .
If you falter , your tool will likely go nowhere .
But let ’s assume that your tool gains some traction , and you continue to maintain it .
Further , let ’s say one of your users looks at it and thinks of an idea that substantially improves on what you have done .
If this person wants to charge money for his tool , he now has even more problems than the ones you faced originally , because he has to compete with your tool .
Perl ’s Unrealized Potential
Even one of the most successful freeware software tools ever , Perl , has unrealized potential .
Perl is fantastically popular , but the tools surrounding this language are less mature compared than those available for other , far younger languages ( e.g. C# and Java ) .
Perl has solved a large number of problems and has increased the productivity of countless people .
It ’s hard to say how much , but even the most conservative guess as to the net productivity gain from the creation of Perl would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars — and yet its principal author has had to maintain a day job to support his family .
Perl and Turbo Pascal make an excellent comparison .
While both products have been hugely influential , neither was really new in and of itself at the time of creation ; each is an amalgam of existing ideas , put into an attractive package and sold at a very low price .
Turbo Pascal fused the notion of an IDE with an existing , already popular language and a fast , lean compiler .
It ’s unlikely that Turbo Pascal would have succeeded in the way it did had Borland not substantially undercut its competitors on price .
And even though the price was low , it was still enough for Borland to pay a team of developers to make Turbo Pascal better .
Perl fused a bunch of disparate and often incompatible shell scripting languages and tools into a unified , platform - neutral language .
Due to the culture and economics that existed at the time , one could argue that Perl could not have succeeded had it not been free .
It ’s also reasonable to say that Perl would not have become the de facto language of CGI had it not been free .
There is no doubt that Perl is a good product , but imagine what it could have been if it had the kind of revenue stream that Turbo Pascal enjoyed in its time .
Solutions
Unwinding the effects of subsidies is tricky , as their consequences are not always entirely obvious .
On the surface , a subsidy of any form is just free money and can do nothing but good , but really , it ’s not so .
One form of subsidy whose deleterious effects are starting to become well known is food aid to developing countries .
Agricultural subsidies in the developed world are a long established tradition .
These subsidies keep our food prices low , our farmers paid , and their lobbyists very well paid .
Thus , they are popular .
It seems obvious that it would be helpful to ship agricultural surpluses created by our subsidy programs to places in the developing world where there is hunger .
However , developing countries usually have an economy based on agriculture and they certainly do not have the resources to subsidize their own farmers .
These countries became impoverished partly because world food prices are artificially depressed by subsidies in the developed world .
When boatloads of free food arrive , the local farmers have little choice but to find some other way to make a living .
The money that the platform vendors pour into their development tools is entirely analogous .
The influx of money decreases the overall price of development tools by a small margin , but it severely reduces the profitability of unsubsidized , independent vendors .
Free software equates to the donated food , and the independent software tool vendor is the unfortunate farmer who gets squeezed out and has to find something else to do .
The sad fact is , software developers have been spending their creative energies helping others do their jobs , but few are able to do anything for their own productivity .
This is because the development tool market is doubly cursed .
First , we have the platform vendors capping the amount of money that can be made in the business .
This causes a great deal of software that should be sold commercially to be given away freely .
And second , the free software further limits the amount of money that can be made from software tools .
The net result is that most good ideas in this software development tools space have no commercial outlet .
The inventor is left with little alternative but to either table the idea altogether , or to release it as freeware and hope to gain some little fame out of it .
Ideas that would in any other market sector be proudly paraded in front of drooling investors are , in the software development space , either dropped altogether or languish for want of somebody to work on them .
Just as those in the developed world do not intend for their agricultural policies to hurt other countries , the platform vendors and other large players do not mean to hurt the small tool vendor .
On the contrary , they all see the advantages the small players can offer and so have individuals and even entire departments dedicated to helping these shops with sales and marketing .
The problem with this is that it starts too late in the process .
Since there is such limited upside to creating a development tool , few of them ever get to the point where marketing is even an issue .
The platform vendors give with one hand and take away with another .
Change can only come when the large players recognize that they are choking off the very innovations that can drive sales of their platforms .
The programs they have in place to assist small tools companies are admirable , but they are also entirely insufficient .
They need to set up a system to help ideas in their infancy .
Further , should one of these nurtured ideas become popular enough to be incorporated into the vendor ’s main development tool line , the author should be fairly compensated .
If history teaches us anything , it is that there probably will never be a " Eureka ! " moment where somebody discovers some single thing that can instantly multiply productivity across the board .
Innovation comes in small packages from unexpected sources ; most of the apparently dramatic changes we see are just several small ideas knitted together .
Right now , most of these small ideas die silently because they can’t make money .
Somehow , we need to change the underlying economics of the development tool marketplace so that it fosters innovation , rather than stifles it .
As we have shown , it is now and will probably remain very difficult to ever reap large rewards by creating a popular software tool .
In the end , the platform vendors will copy any idea that ’s good enough to become popular and price it such that it will not be profitable .
This is an effect that probably cannot be changed .
So , if people cannot be persuaded to bring their tools to market with the promise of a big reward , we need to make it so that they can bring their products to market with substantially less financial risk .
The best way to do that would be to have the platform vendors provide guaranteed loans and outright cash grants to individual developers and small shops that want to produce a software development tool targeted at their platform .
Perhaps there are other ways in which the problem can be attacked , but in any case , we simply must do something to break the established trends .
The slow growth of productivity of the programming market has already led to decreased wages .
As a programmer , this is of grave concern to me .
However , more than just us programmers should be concerned .
As we have shown , this computer - driven rise in global productivity is something we developers are responsible for .
It ’s not only our salaries that are in jeopardy , but also that of the X - Ray technician and everybody else who touches a computer in their daily work .
Conclusion
In the past , it has been widely assumed that the only way to get more productivity out of software development teams is to make them work together better .
In fact , when we look at the definition of the software crisis , it is couched in just those terms .
This viewpoint ignores the fact that team performance can be improved by improving the performance of the individual team members .
The main reason for this one - sided thinking is the belief , propagated by Brooks and others , that there is little that can be done in this arena .
As proof , they point to the long history of anemic progress in development tools and techniques .
In this paper , I have tried to show that the slow progress is not due to the inherent difficulty of the problem , but rather due to economic conditions that have persisted in the marketplace since its birth .
Declining salaries and declining university enrollment are signs that we are on the verge of another crisis , and this time , it is not about the team , it ’s about individual performers .
If we are to do anything about this new " software crisis , " it will have to start with a realization on the part of vendors like Sun , Microsoft , and IBM that their policies are hurting themselves , the software industry , and the entire global economy .

It 's four in the morning , and schoolgirl Bethany McQuerry is starting her homework .
Her dad , Clay , does the family 's washing before going to the 24 - hour supermarket .
Meanwhile , Bethany 's mum and brother , Janelle and Casey , sleep on .
But Bethany is no swot and Clay is no housework obsessive .
They just wake up early every single day , whether they like it or not - it's as if they have permanent jet lag .
Bethany and Clay have to get things done early in the morning , because they also fall asleep in the early evening .
The difference in timekeeping has divided the family , from North Carolina , US .
" There have been times when I wished we would function the same as other families , " says Janelle .
" It does make it hard when you 're wanting to be together . "
Only recently did Clay discover there was a biological explanation for his and Bethany 's unusual behaviour , known as ASPS , or Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome - a disorder of the body clock that shifts their day forward .
Caveman experiment
The body clock determines our most fundamental behaviours : when we wake up , go to sleep , and eat .
But it also determines our physical strength and performance over a day .
Early doors : Clay and Bethany McQuerry , sufferers of ASPS
Michel Siffre had been planning to study the movement of a glacier through an underground cave , when he realised the enormous potential of his experiment for the field of biology .
" I had the idea of my life : I decided not to take a watch in the cave .
I decided to live without time cues , " he said .
By isolating himself underground , away from daylight , clocks or routines , he hoped to discover whether the body had its own rhythm .
And if so , what it was .
" I decided to live following my feelings of hunger , my feelings of going to sleep .
In the cave it 's always dark , then your body follows its own sense , " said Mr Siffre .
His plan was to call a surface - team of assistants every time he woke , ate , exercised or urinated so every one of his biological functions could be monitored .
I think Bethany and I are very close because we 've had those early mornings together
Clay McQuerry
Each time , he would give an estimate of the date and time , and the surface - team would compare this with the real time .
This he did for two months , before emerging into the real world .
Mentally , he had completely lost track of time , but the results showed his body had kept up a rhythm .
While the length of Siffre 's waking days varied widely , from 40 hours to just six , a clear pattern emerged .
The average length of his days was just over 24 hours .
Evolution , it seems , had tailored his body 's clock to run closely to the Earth 's day length .
It 's now known that the body clock is controlled by a tiny pea-sized organ in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus , or SCN .
This tiny region commands a chain of chemical and nervous instructions that ripple through the body , controlling how each organ and tissue functions over the 24 - hour day .
It 's this mechanism that has gone wrong in the case of Clay and Bethany McQuerry .
Their early rising is due to the inheritance of a single mutation that throws the whole body clock off kilter .
Does time fly ?
While the body clock keeps the rest of us " in synch " with the world around us , that 's not our only experience of time .
We also have a completely separate sense of time passing .
Mostly , we 're pretty good at estimating durations of time - how long you 've been online , for example .
But people also speak of " time flying " when they 're enjoying themselves , or slowing right down in perilous situations such as car crash .
Dr David Eagleman , at the site of the free - fall experiment
Psychologist Dr David Eagleman , of the University of Texas , recently set out to nail this assumption , and a BBC film crew was there to record it .
He asked volunteer Jesse Kallus to perform a terrifying backwards free - fall of 33 metres .
If the anecdotes are correct , Jesse 's perception of time would be slowed by the terrifying experience .
But how could one monitor such a thing ?
Mr Eagleman came up with a cunning device : the " perceptual chronometer " , a wristwatch - like device which flicked blindingly fast between two LED screens .
Normally the flicker would be so fast Jesse could only see a blur .
But if time slowed down for him , he might be able to discern the two different screens and read a random number on one of them .
" There 's no way to fake this test , " says Dr Eagleman , " because if time is not running more slowly , they can't see the sequence . "
All Jesse had to do was jump , and read .
As he ascended the 33ft metal cage no - one seemed to believe this curious experiment might work .
Jesse Kallus , right , preparing for the 33ft drop
" I would have loved it if he had seen the numbers exactly , " says Dr Eagleman .
" But this at least suggests to me that he 's able to take in information faster than he was before " .
Further jumps got similar results - all suggesting that time did seem to slow down for Jesse during the jump .
So while time on the clock may be constant , the time in one 's brain is elastic and personal - something to remember in a boring meeting when time seems to grind to a halt .
Time is not simply a fourth dimension in which we exist .
It 's something we , at least partly , create in our minds .
Time , a four - part series , starts on BBC Four on Sunday 26 February , at 2000 GMT .
I have a pet theory about time , specifically whether it may not be a myth that it appears to pass more quickly as one ages .
With age , short term memory very often deteriorates .
The crux of this theory is that memory is really comprised of remembered events , significant or otherwise .
Thus , as events fade from memory the perceived time lapse between the remaining memories - as there is nothing left to fill the ' gap ' , must , of necessity , appear shorter .
Anyone agree ?

I have been wondering how my body manages to wake up before the alarm clock goes off in the morning .
I live a somewhat irregular life , but that inner clock does a most remarkable job - accurate 9 times out of ten , as far as I can tell , and to within 15 minutes ( always prior to the time set for the alarm ! ) .
Acquaintances of mine , a married couple , appear to suffer from the same syndrome as do the father and daughter mentioned in the article .
They cannot stay up late - there is no use trying to socialise normally with them , unless one is willing to accept that things start in the afternoon and stop around 8 p.m .
That is not so bad , but on the other hand they seem totally unable to arrange themselves in any other way - the slightest deviation ' from the plan ' apparently upsets them .
Conscious time is certainly a curious matter !
D. Fear , Heidelberg , Germany
I 'm glad to see that science is finally coming around to understanding what philosophers such as Hume , Kant , and McTaggart knew , and that is that time is something purely subjective .
Now if only these scientists can also get rid of the silly idea of time being a " fourth dimension . "

I 've often thought that this is true .
For example , when I 'm at work no matter what I 'm doing I know exactly when it 's lunchtime and exactly when it 's 5 o'clock and time to go home .
However , when I 'm in my local pub , the Griffin , I can never remember the how long I 've there or when I have to go home .
I can now blame my SCN for these aberrations .

Why does time slow down for some people in a crisis situation , yet speed up for others with the same experience ?

I am very sceptical about the experiments described above .
Siffre 's 1962 experiment could only have explained that we are conditioned into a 24 hour day and not that it is due to evolution .
The only way of proving this would be to put a new - born in the cave , which would be unethical .
Simiar studies with animals showed a natural cycle produced by the SCN , but with wake / sleep periods much longer than 24 hours .

I 've lived with this all my adult life , except I cannot sleep until after 3 am , and if I wake up before 10 am I feel dreadful all day .
I have lived several places around the world , and the problem follows me .
Andy , Hong Kong
For me it 's very much which hours of night I sleep and not strictly how long .
If I sleep around 10 pm I get refreshed after 7 hours .
But if I sleep after 11 pm even after 12 hours of sleep I still wake up exhausted .
Also apart from babyhood , I never managed to sleep in the afternoon until I I was in my late teens at university .
And to do so I had to draw the curtains and cover up .
Victor , Newport , Wales
The first part of this story has to be a joke .
I 've changed my bodys ' natural rhythm so many times I 've lost count .
In basic training for the army I went to sleep at 10 pm and woke at 4:30 .
At the stock exchange I went to sleep at 2 am and woke at 7 .
When I became a waiter I went to sleep between 2 - 4 am and woke at 11 am .
If the people in the story just tweaked their sleep schedule they 'd be fine .
No need for another " syndrome . "

Very interesting experiment but I do n't quite believe it proves much at all - maybe time does n't slow but we 're more perceptive to a greater amount of information in dangerous situations ?
A sort of defence mechanism to help us find our way out of danger ?
Just a thought ...

While the case described is clearly an extreme one , it 's not news to some of us that body clocks vary widely .
I have the opposite problem : I have always found it extremely hard to get up early , and even if I do I am rarely functioning properly before late morning .
On the other hand , I have no difficulty staying up late : I am rarely in bed before 1.30 am , and am frequently still awake at 3 am or later .
Even if I 'm lacking in sleep , I usually find I become more alert at 10 or 11 in the evening , which usually thwarts any plans I might have had for an early night .
I have frequently been labelled lazy for my reluctance to get up in the morning , even though I do n't think I sleep for significantly longer than most people do , and I 'm sure there are those who regard me as dissolute because of my late night habits .
I have frequently been told that I would feel so much better if only I went to bed earlier , but I simply do n't think this is true - any more than it is that people who are at their best in the early morning would feel better if they tried to imitate my sleep pattern .
Our society is not set up to deal with people with naturally different sleep rhythms , and I am convinced that society as a whole ( as well as the people concerned ) suffers as a result .
Enforcing standard working hours of nine till five will not produce the best results if a significant proportion of the workforce is not functioning at full strength until 11 am or later .
The advent of flexi - time is a big help , and some of us are lucky enough to have jobs that allow us to plan our own time , but there are many who are not so fortunate , and spend years feeling permanently exhausted as a result of being forced into an unnatural sleep pattern by a world that for some unfathomable reason regards being awake early as somehow more virtuous and valuable than staying awake late .

An alternative explanation for being able to resolve a rapidly flickering " perceptual chronometer " is that rapid eye movements ( so - called saccades ) cause the different LED images to be projected onto different parts of the retina .
This effect can sometimes be seen by glancing from one side of a flickering display ( a mains LED alarm clock , for example ) to another , suppressing your normal reflex eye - blink .
Were the subject 's eye movements monitored during the experiment to guard against such changes of fixation point ?

It seems to me that the free - fall experiment could be measuring the effect of adrenaline on eyesight or neural processing of visual input , rather than time distortion .
A better experiment might be to have people estimate the passage of time when they 're in life - or - death situations , such as relatives of trauma victims .

I can vouch that time runs slower ( or your brain speeds up in a crisis ) .
In my first parachute jump my ' chute did n't open correctly .
To cut a long story short , I sorted it , and landed safely , but my instructor asked how long it took me to sort myself out .
I replied that it was probably about a minute .
He replied , " It took you less than 7 seconds ..... " .
I still swear to this day that it took me a minute in my mind .

Brilliantly insightful .
I am a traumatologist who deals with the issue of memory formation all the time .
When one imagines the ways in which memories can vary , one seldom considers the possibility that the perception of time itself might be one of those variables .
Very interesting implications indeed .

I know when I am ill ( or going to be ill ) as time seems to go inexorably slowly .
The night after my spinal surgery , it was like the minutes of the hands never moved , but once I got better , time returned to " normal " .
I find now that time " slowing down " for me is an indicator that I am brewing an illness .
Weird but true !

Attempts to thwart identity theft and fraud through technology advances are likely to prove counterproductive , a British academic warns .
Dr Emily Finch , of the University of East Anglia , said the introduction of Chip and PIN on credit cards and UK government plans to introduce identity card schemes will only encourage crooks to become more imaginative .
She said there was no substitute for individual vigilance .
" There is a worrying assumption that advances in technology will provide the solution to identity theft whereas it is possible that they may actually aggravate the problem , " Finch told the British Association science conference , Reuters reports .
Finch ( something of the Clarice Starling of the Fens , it would seem ) bases her warning on her interviews with convicted fraudsters on the likely impact of technology advances on criminal behaviour .
" Studying the way that individuals disclose sensitive information would be far more valuable in preventing identity fraud than the evolution of technologically advanced but ultimately fallible measures to prevent misuse of personal information after it has been obtained , " she added .
The conclusions Finch reaches parallel those of some security experts who warn government attempts to sell identity cards as a means to combat ID theft are misguided .
These and other objections to the UK government 's ID card plans were outlined in a London School of Economics ' study involving more than 100 academics published in March . ®
Sources : Pentagon Wants ' Able Danger ' Hearings Closed
Friday , September 16 , 2005

WASHINGTON —
The Pentagon is pressuring the Senate Judiciary Committee to close to the public next week 's hearings on a former secret military intelligence unit called " Able Danger , " two congressional sources have confirmed to FOX News .
Witnesses from the Pentagon are expected to testify at that hearing ; that 's why they want it classified .
FOX News has learned that committee Chairman Arlen Specter 's office is vigorously resisting the request .
Some former Able Danger analysts and Rep. Curt Weldon ( search ) say the formerly clandestine intelligence unit identified Mohammed Atta ( search ) and three other of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , hijackers one year before the attacks that left over 3,000 people dead .
They also claim that their repeated requests to turn over the information to the FBI were ignored .
Weldon said a former Army officer will testify next week that he was also ordered to destroy data that included reference to Atta .
" In the summer of 2000 , he was ordered and , or , he would go to jail if he did n't comply , " the Pennsylvania Republican said .
" He was ordered to destroy 2.5 terabytes of data specific to Able Danger , the Brooklyn [ terror ] cell and Mohammad Atta .
He will name the person who ordered him to destroy that material . "
Other witnesses will include an FBI agent who will testify that she set up three meetings in 2000 between the FBI 's Washington field office and the Able Danger , but each was cancelled at the last minute , Weldon said .
The Pentagon has changed its position on this story , from originally questioning the very existence of Able Danger ( search ) to now confirming that the Defense Department has identified five former members of the unit who all say they remember Atta 's picture or name , on a chart in 2000 .
Weldon wrote a letter over the summer that ignited a debate over what the Sept. 11 commission ( search ) probing the attacks knew or did n't know about the intelligence group , and whether it ignored evidence that would have helped shed light on the timeline of investigations into the hijackers ' presence in the United States .
The commission also has been criticized for not including the Able Danger project in their report last summer .
" The Sept. 11 commission 's statement that it does not believe a secret military intelligence unit discovered a group of future hijackers more than a year before the terrorist attacks is " a total denial of the facts , " Weldon said Thursday .
" For the 9/11 commission to say that this did not exist is just absolutely outrageous .
It 's a total denial of the facts . "
The commission 's chairman , Thomas Kean , said that the panel had acquired no evidence anyone in the government knew about lead hijacker Atta before Sept. 11 , 2001 .
According to Weldon and several members of Able Danger , the secret group identified Atta and three other hijackers as potential members of a terrorist cell in New York City .
Weldon and the Able Danger analysts — Army Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer ( search ) and Navy Capt . Scott Phillpott ( search ) — maintain that Pentagon lawyers rejected the unit 's recommendation that the information be turned over to the FBI in 2000 based on immigration rules at the time .
Shaffer and Phillpott also say they met with staff members on the Sept. 11 commission about their findings .
But commission members have denied that Atta was mentioned by name at those meetings , some of which were in October of 2002 .
While the Pentagon says Shaffer and Phillpott are credible , the Defense Department says it has found no documents to back up their claims .
However , the Pentagon confirmed this month that documents associated with Able Danger were destroyed because of strict regulations governing the collection of data on foreign visitors in the United States .
The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States , informally called the Sept. 11 commission , was set up in 2002 to investigate pre-attack intelligence and communication failures between U.S. law enforcement and spy agencies .
On Wednesday , former members of the Sept. 11 commission said they were n't buying the story that the Able Danger group identified the hijackers so early .
" Bluntly , it just did n't happen and that 's the conclusion of all 10 of us , " said Sept. 11 commissioner Slade Gorton , a former Republican senator from Washington state .
The panel had appeared at a news conference to argue that the response to Hurricane Katrina ( search ) might have been more successful if more of the recommendations it had made last year had been implemented .
During the press event , the commissioners criticized the government for not putting in place changes recommended last year for homeland security and emergency response .
They pointed most notably to the failure to improve communication systems , which they said might have saved lives after Hurricane Katrina .
" It is a scandal in our minds that four years after Sept. 11 , we have not yet set aside radio spectrum to insure that police , firefighters and emergency medical technicians can communicate reliably during any kind of attack or any kind of major disaster , " Kean said .
The commissioners also faulted state , local and federal authorities responding to Katrina for not having a clear chain of command , leading to some of the same confusion that plagued the Sept. 11 rescue effort .
" Many of these recommendations proposed by the Sept. 11 commission one year ago might have made a difference in saving lives and preventing loss of lives in this hurricane , " said member Tim Roemer , a former Democratic congressman from Indiana .
The commissioners , who now belong to the Sept. 11 Discourse Project ( search ) to oversee the translation of their recommendations into reality , also played down claims by the Defense Department 's secret intelligence unit .
Earlier this month , the Pentagon confirmed in a briefing that it had identified five people involved with Able Danger who claimed they had either seen a picture of Atta or had seen his name on a chart prepared in 1999 by the intelligence unit .
It was the first extensive briefing by Pentagon officials since questions about Able Danger began circulating last month .
But while Pentagon officials call these sources credible , they say that after interviewing some 80 individuals associated with Able Danger and reviewing hundreds of thousands of documents , they still have not found such a chart and do n't even know if it exists .
The Pentagon said that documents associated with the project had been destroyed .
The Defense Department did confirm that documents associated with Able Danger were destroyed in accordance with strict regulations about collection , dissemination and destruction procedures for intelligence gathered on people inside the United States .
The officials denied that military lawyers ordered the destruction of the documents .
Navy Commander Christopher Chope of the U.S. military 's Special Operations Command added that the Pentagon investigation found no evidence to back up claims that the military refused to share key information gleaned by Able Danger with the FBI .
While the document review is now over , the Pentagon says it continues to interview and re-interview people associated with the program .
FOX News ' Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report .
The state of Massachusetts has recently been flirting with open standards , but the process has so far had more twists and turns than a soap opera .
The state currently plans to standardize on OpenDocument format ( ODF ) , a move that has met substantial resistance from Microsoft as well as some others in state government .
The transition is scheduled to take place by January 1 , 2007 , but was recently thrown into doubt by the resignation of Peter Quinn , the CIO of the state .
In an e-mail , Quinn lamented the fact that he could no longer do his job successfully in the current political climate .
" I have become a lightning rod with regard to any IT initiative .
Even the smallest initiatives are being mitigated or stopped by some of the most unlikely and often uninformed parties .
The last thing I can let happen is my presence be the major contributing factor in marginalizing the good work of ITD and the entire IT community . "
Quinn 's resignation is scheduled to take place January 12 , 2006 , and many supporters of open standards saw the resignation as an indicator that the state had caved in to pressure from Microsoft , which is pushing to have its own Office XML endorsed as an open standard .
When Microsoft recently decided to submit Office XML to ECMA , Quinn 's boss , Secretary of Administration and Finance Thomas Trimarco , stated publicly that the format might well become acceptable to the state .
State legislators also raised issues with OpenDocument , which would require the statewide use of OpenOffice.org , because of concerns over interoperability with other governments , accessibility issues for people with disabilities , and the fact that an Adobe 's PDF format was also approved as an open standard , despite having the same licensing problems as Microsoft 's Office XML .
It quickly began to look like OpenDocument was dead in the water .
But now comes word from Trimarco himself that the state intends to stick with its policy on open standards , and OpenDocument will remain one of those standards .
Trimarco reportedly told the general counsel of the state 's Information Technology Division that Quinn 's resignation " will result in no change to the Administration 's position on the ODF standard . "
Note , however , that this is not the same as saying that the entire state will ditch Microsoft Office and make the switch to OpenOffice.org .
What Trimarco appears to be saying is that OpenDocument will remain on the list of formats that are acceptable to the state .
Office XML could still be added to the list , and Microsoft has a whole year in which to convince Massachusetts that it has seen the light regarding open standards .
If it does so , the state might well continue to run Office .
In fact , the whole saga could turn out to be a victory to Microsoft if the state decides to upgrade all its copies of Office in order to gain seamless access to the Office XML file format .
And , of course , if Office XML is declared an open standard , you can forget about seeing OpenDocument support in Office .
One of the most important personal development principles is that your weakest area will limit your ability to take advantage of your strongest area .
The various parts of our lives — physical , mental , social , spiritual — are deeply interwoven , and we cannot simply consider each part in isolation .
People often identify themselves with their strongest area : I ’m an athlete ( physical ) .
I ’m a geek ( mental ) .
I ’m a party animal ( social ) .
I ’m a Christian ( spiritual ) .
But then they may fall into the trap of allowing their other areas to lag behind .
While capitalizing on your strengths is good advice , your ability to do that will largely be determined by how you handle your weaknesses .
A dumb , unfocused athlete is unlikely to do as well as a smart one .
An anti-social athlete will miss out on the chance to be part of a team .
And an athlete who experiences spiritual chaos may lapse into drugs , steroid use , or immoral behavioral that ultimately hurts his / her body .
Consider each possible pairing of physical , mental , social , and spiritual and notice how each element can help or hinder any of the others .
It ’s tempting to continue working on our strengths while ignoring our weaknesses .
Our most important results will often come from our strengths — that ’s true .
However , the best way to improve those results is often to work on our weakest areas .
This helps us in two ways :
First , by shoring up our weak areas , we prevent them from getting in the way of our strengths .
Secondly , if we take it far enough , we can turn those weak areas into secondary strengths that augment our primary strength .
For example , let ’s assume that my primary strength is in the mental area and that I make a living through my writing .
That ’s an oversimplification , but it will suit us for now .
If I focus all my energy on writing and identify myself as being predominantly mental , I might do OK for a while .
Some good writers treat their physical body as if it ’s a hunk of useless garbage .
However , the body and mind are very connected , and neglecting the body will prevent the mind from achieving its full potential .
A good writer might become a great one by taking better care of his / her physical equipment .
I recall that as I switched to a vegan diet many years ago and started exercising regularly , the most significant benefits I experienced were mental , not physical .
My concentration improved dramatically , I felt far more clear - headed , and I also perceived an increase in my ability to think more deeply about complex subjects .
It was like getting a mental upgrade .
Many people tell me that my writing is very deep , and I largely credit that to diet and exercise .
I can sit for hours at a time totally absorbed by a single topic without being distracted and without feeling physically uncomfortable .
Moreover , my physical activities also provide source material for my writing , such as martial arts , running , yoga , various diets , weight training , etc .
Similarly , most physical activities work the mind too , helping thoughts to become more focused and less chaotic .
So there ’s a synergistic interplay between the mental and physical .
What about social ?
If I ’m a writer , does n’t that mean that social development must lag behind ?
Not at all .
If I become a recluse , I wo n’t have nearly as much to write about .
I ’m very active in Toastmasters , I frequently give speeches , and I recently started doing improv comedy .
Plus with a wife and two young kids , I ’m rarely alone in the house .
My rich social activities challenge me mentally , keep me from becoming dark and brooding , and give me abundant writing ideas .
And because of my writing , I find it easy to socialize with people because I always have something interesting to talk about .
The mental and social parts of my life enjoy a mutual flow of energy and ideas .
If either side were to lag behind , the other side would be crippled as well .
And finally there ’s the spiritual .
This means different things to different people .
I consider this area equally important for atheists , Christians , and Buddhists alike .
What ’s your purpose in life ?
What is your model of how the universe works ?
Are your beliefs accurate ?
By striving to develop an accurate and empowering belief system , I generate a lot of interesting ideas to write about .
In fact , this has been a source of many of my most popular articles , such as The Meaning of Life Series .
Also , by writing about these topics publicly , I receive a lot of feedback that helps me greatly in my own spiritual growth .
I do n’t pretend to have all the answers , but I do my best to keep asking the questions .
And of course we could go on and do all the other pairings , but I think you get the point .
Each area of your life has a powerful effect on every other area .
If you allow any one area to lag too far behind , it ’s like attaching a lead weight to all the others .
You ’ll experience drag .
No matter how hard you continue to work on your strengths , it will feel like you ’re getting out a lot less than you ’re putting in .
It ’s rare that all of these areas are in perfect balance .
That certainly is n’t the case for me , despite working on this consciously .
At different times in my life , at least one area is always lagging behind .
Two years ago when I moved from L.A. to Vegas , my social area dropped because I did n’t know anyone here .
So for that first year , I put a lot of effort into building a local social network .
Now it ’s one of my strongest areas .
But in the process of doing lots of writing and expanding my social activities , I did n’t exercise as much as I used to , so recently I ’ve recommitted to the physical and have been hitting the gym every morning .
While putting more energy into that area , some other areas may slip a little .
It ’s an ongoing process of shoring up the weakest area , so that I can extract the maximum value from the strongest .
Some slippage is OK , as long as the choice is made consciously .
I ’m OK with letting my spiritual area slide a bit while I work on improving my physical conditioning .
I probably wo n’t meditate as often as I used to , but I can always return to that later .
Whenever a weak area falls too far behind and needs several months ( or years ) of focus to bring it back into balance , you may have to divert resources from the strong areas .
But this is temporary .
One simple technique I use is to rate each of these areas on a scale of 1 - 10 .
Then look at your strongest area and your weakest area and understand the connection between them .
How would your strongest area improve if your weakest area went from a 2 to an 8 ?
Yes , it may take some time to reach that 8 , maybe even a few years , but the time is going to pass anyway , so why not emerge with an 8 instead of a 2 ?
If your physical area is lagging behind , you can improve your diet and exercising habits .
If your mental area is your worst , begin reading a book a week , and listen to audio programs or podcasts that make you think .
If your social area lags behind , join a club ( keep trying until you find one you like ) .
And if your spiritual area has been neglected , read some books in this field , begin keeping a journal , and try meditation .
What if all your areas are down in the dumps ?
In that case I recommend you start with the physical .
Repairing those other areas will require lots of energy .
If you get yourself into good physical condition , it will help you feel better emotionally too .
And that physical and emotional energy will serve you well in making changes across the board .
If you ’re really fat and out of shape , this is especially crucial .
Your body is with you all the time , and carrying around too much extra weight will slow you down and wear you out .
Plus you ’re not as likely to feel good about yourself when you look in the mirror .
There ’s no need to worry about becoming a fitness model , but make basic physical fitness a priority in your life .
Turn off the TV , and hit the gym instead .
If you want to go deeper , you can expand this 4 - part model into a 12 - part one :
Work Financial Relationship Home & Family Physical Health Mental Social Emotional Spiritual Character Contribution Fun & Adventure
For more detail on how to analyze your current performance in these 12 areas , listen to Podcast # 2 .
You ca n’t make all 12 or even the basic 4 areas your top priority at the same time .
You have to pick your primary training area and let the others slide a bit .
Do n’t neglect the importance of training though .
It ’s obvious that proper training can transform a person ’s physical body , but it can produce gains just as powerful in any other area of your life too .
I think you will find as I do that by training your weakest area up to an acceptable level , you get even better results than if you continued to focus only on your strengths .
Work from your strengths .
Train up your weaknesses .
And always be training .
BIDDING ON SEATS BIDDING ON SEATS Ticket prices for Bon Jovi , July 29 at Giants Stadium : Top regular price : $ 125 Ticketmaster auction : $ 150 minimum bid RazorGator : Listed by resellers at $ 61 to $ 1,232 StubHub : Listed by resellers at $ 65 to $ 1,412 Source : USA TODAY research Ticketmaster uses auctions to fight online scalpers LOS ANGELES 
Do n't be surprised if the best seats for a summer concert are available only via an auction .
Ticketmaster , which dominates the ticket business , is fighting back against online ticket resellers by letting customers bid up the prices for the best seats and returning profits to promoters and artists .
It will auction the best seats to many top summer tours , including Madonna , Shakira , Kelly Clarkson , Red Hot Chili Peppers , Bon Jovi and former Pink Floyd composer Roger Waters .
The Internet has made it easy for speculators to buy tickets and resell them at huge prices at online sites such as Craigslist and eBay .
Ticket sites StubHub and RazorGator do nothing but resell tickets , charging both sellers and buyers service fees .
Ticketmaster auction money is split between the promoter and artist , with Ticketmaster taking a service fee .
Waters will perform Pink Floyd 's complete Dark Side of the Moon with a backup band at New York 's Madison Square Garden on Sept. 12 .
Regular top ticket prices are $ 175 ; the first four rows ' minimum Ticketmaster auction bid is $ 500 .
Seats are being resold on StubHub and RazorGator with asking prices soaring to $ 4,600 and $ 7,000 , respectively .
With the Ticketmaster auctions , " the whole point was to try and recapture revenue that 's being generated on the back of the artist and promoter , " says Arthur Fogel , president of tour promoter TNA International , which is behind Madonna 's summer tour .
The best seats for Madonna 's Confessions tour have a face value of $ 350 .
The Ticketmaster auction averaged $ 400 to $ 500 a ticket , Fogel says .
David Goldberg , Ticketmaster executive vice president , calls the online bidding for show seats " a market solution to an industry problem .
It makes it a much more level playing field . "
The problem is that the hottest shows sell out in minutes on the Internet .
And , Fogel says , resale websites have made it easy for the ordinary computer user to become a ticket broker .
Auctions " move the concert market even further from its roots : music for the people , " says Gary Bongiovanni , editor of trade magazine Pollstar .
" Concerts are supply and demand , and the person with the most coconuts gets the prize . "

From HaskellWiki
Haskell I/O has always been a source of confusion and surprises for new Haskellers .
While simple I/ O code in Haskell looks very similar to its equivalents in imperative languages , attempts to write somewhat more complex code often result in a total mess .
This is because Haskell I/O is really very different internally .
Haskell is a pure language and even the I/ O system can't break this purity .
The following text is an attempt to explain the details of Haskell I/O implementations .
This explanation should help you eventually master all the smart I /O tricks .
Moreover , I 've added a detailed explanation of various traps you might encounter along the way .
After reading this text , you will receive a " Master of Haskell I/O " degree that is equal to a Bachelor in Computer Science and Mathematics , simultaneously .
If you are new to Haskell I / O you may prefer to start by reading the Introduction to IO page .
Haskell is a pure language
Haskell is a pure language , which means that the result of any function call is fully determined by its arguments .
Pseudo - functions like rand ( ) or getchar ( ) in C , which return different results on each call , are simply impossible to write in Haskell .
Moreover , Haskell functions can't have side effects , which means that they can't effect any changes to the " real world " , like changing files , writing to the screen , printing , sending data over the network , and so on .
These two restrictions together mean that any function call can be replaced by the result of a previous call with the same parameters , and the language guarantees that all these rearrangements will not change the program result !
Let 's compare this to C : optimizing C compilers try to guess which functions have no side effects and do n't depend on mutable global variables .
If this guess is wrong , an optimization can change the program 's semantics !
To avoid this kind of disaster , C optimizers are conservative in their guesses or require hints from the programmer about the purity of functions .
Compared to an optimizing C compiler , a Haskell compiler is a set of pure mathematical transformations .
This results in much better high - level optimization facilities .
Moreover , pure mathematical computations can be much more easily divided into several threads that may be executed in parallel , which is increasingly important in these days of multi-core CPUs .
Finally , pure computations are less error - prone and easier to verify , which adds to Haskell 's robustness and to the speed of program development using Haskell .
Haskell 's purity allows the compiler to call only functions whose results are really required to calculate the final value of a top - level function ( e.g. , main ) - this is called lazy evaluation .
It 's a great thing for pure mathematical computations , but how about I /O actions ?
A function like
putStrLn " Press any key to begin formatting "
ca n't return any meaningful result value , so how can we ensure that the compiler will not omit or reorder its execution ?
And in general :
How we can work with stateful algorithms and side effects in an entirely lazy language ?
This question has had many different solutions proposed while Haskell was developed ( see History of Haskell ) , though a solution based on monads is now the standard .
What is a monad ?
What is a monad ?
It 's a concept from mathematical category theory .
In order to understand how monads are used to solve the problem of I/O and side effects , you do n't need to know category theory .
It 's enough to just know elementary mathematics .
Let 's imagine that we want to implement the well - known ' getchar ' function in Haskell .
What type should it have ?
Let 's try :
getchar :: Char get2chars = [ getchar , getchar ]
What will we get with ' getchar ' having just the ' Char ' type ?
You can see all the possible problems in the definition of ' get2chars ' :
Because the Haskell compiler treats all functions as pure ( not having side effects ) , it can avoid " unnecessary " calls to ' getchar ' and use one returned value twice .
Even if it does make two calls , there is no way to determine which call should be performed first .
Do you want to return the two chars in the order in which they were read , or in the opposite order ?
Nothing in the definition of ' get2 chars ' answers this question .
How can these problems be solved , from the programmer 's perspective ?
Let 's introduce a fake parameter of ' getchar ' to make each call " different " from the compiler 's point of view :
getchar :: Int ->
Char get2chars = [ getchar 1 , getchar 2 ]
Right away , this solves the first problem mentioned above - now the compiler will make two calls because it sees that the calls have different parameters .
The whole ' get2 chars ' function should also have a fake parameter , otherwise we will have the same problem calling it :
getchar :: Int ->
Char get2chars :: Int ->
String get2chars _ = [ getchar 1 , getchar 2 ]
Now we need to give the compiler some clue to determine which function it should call first .
The Haskell language does n't provide any way to express order of evaluation — except for data dependencies !
How about adding an artificial data dependency which prevents evaluation of the second ' getchar ' before the first one ?
In order to achieve this , we will return an additional fake result from ' getchar ' that will be used as a parameter for the next ' getchar ' call :
getchar :: Int -> ( Char , Int ) get2 chars _ = [ a , b ] where ( a , i ) = getchar 1 ( b , _ ) = getchar i
So far so good — now we can guarantee that ' a ' is read before ' b ' because reading ' b ' needs the value ( ' i ' ) that is returned by reading ' a ' !
We 've added a fake parameter to ' get2 chars ' but the problem is that the Haskell compiler is too smart !
It can believe that the external ' getchar ' function is really dependent on its parameter but for ' get2 chars ' it will see that we 're just cheating because we throw it away !
Therefore it wo n't feel obliged to execute the calls in the order we want .
How can we fix this ?
How about passing this fake parameter to the ' getchar ' function ?
In this case the compiler can't guess that it is really unused .
get2 chars i0 = [ a , b ] where ( a , i1 ) = getchar i0 ( b , i2 ) = getchar i1
Furthermore , ' get2 chars ' has the same purity problems as the ' getchar ' function .
If you need to call it two times , you need a way to describe the order of these calls .
Consider this :
get4chars = [ get2chars 1 , get2chars 2 ] -- order of ' get2 chars ' calls is n't defined
We already know how to deal with these problems : ' get2 chars ' should also return some fake value that can be used to order calls :
get2chars :: Int -> ( String , Int ) get4chars i0 = ( a ++ b ) where ( a , i1 ) = get2chars i0 ( b , i2 ) = get2chars i1
But what should the fake return value of ' get2 chars ' be ?
If we use some integer constant , the excessively smart Haskell compiler will guess that we 're cheating again .
What about returning the value returned by ' getchar ' ?
See :
get2chars :: Int -> ( String , Int ) get2 chars i0 = ( [ a , b ] , i2 ) where ( a , i1 ) = getchar i0 ( b , i2 ) = getchar i1
Believe it or not , but we 've just constructed the whole " monadic " Haskell I /O system .
Welcome to the RealWorld , baby
Warning :
The following story about IO is incorrect in that it cannot actually explain some important aspects of IO ( including interaction and concurrency ) .
However , some people find it useful to begin developing an understanding .
The ' main '
Haskell function has the type :
main :: RealWorld -> ( ( ) , RealWorld )
where ' RealWorld ' is a fake type used instead of our Int .
It 's something like the baton passed in a relay race .
When ' main ' calls some IO function , it passes the " RealWorld " it received as a parameter .
All IO functions have similar types involving RealWorld as a parameter and result .
To be exact , " IO " is a type synonym defined in the following way :
type IO a = RealWorld -> ( a , RealWorld )
So , ' main ' just has type " IO ( ) " , ' getChar ' has type " IO Char " and so on .
You can think of the type " IO Char " as meaning " take the current RealWorld , do something to it , and return a Char and a ( possibly changed ) RealWorld " .
Let 's look at ' main ' calling ' getChar ' two times :
getChar :: RealWorld -> ( Char , RealWorld ) main :: RealWorld -> ( ( ) , RealWorld ) main world0 = let ( a , world1 ) = getChar world0 ( b , world2 ) = getChar world1 in ( ( ) , world2 )
Look at this closely : ' main ' passes the " world " it received to the first ' getChar ' .
This ' getChar ' returns some new value of type RealWorld that gets used in the next call .
Finally , ' main ' returns the " world " it got from the second ' getChar ' .
Is it possible here to omit any call of ' getChar ' if the Char it read is not used ?
No , because we need to return the " world " that is the result of the second ' getChar ' and this in turn requires the " world " returned from the first ' getChar ' .
Is it possible to reorder the ' getChar ' calls ?
No : the second ' getChar ' can't be called before the first one because it uses the " world " returned from the first call .
Is it possible to duplicate calls ?
In Haskell semantics - yes , but real compilers never duplicate work in such simple cases ( otherwise , the programs generated will not have any speed guarantees ) .
As we already said , RealWorld values are used like a baton which gets passed between all routines called by ' main ' in strict order .
Inside each routine called , RealWorld values are used in the same way .
Overall , in order to " compute " the world to be returned from ' main ' , we should perform each IO procedure that is called from ' main ' , directly or indirectly .
This means that each procedure inserted in the chain will be performed just at the moment ( relative to the other IO actions ) when we intended it to be called .
Let 's consider the following program :
main = do a <- ask " What is your name ? " b <- ask " How old are you ? " return ( ) ask s = do putStr s readLn
Now you have enough knowledge to rewrite it in a low - level way and check that each operation that should be performed will really be performed with the arguments it should have and in the order we expect .
But what about conditional execution ?
No problem .
Let 's define the well - known ' when ' operation :
when :: Bool -> IO ( ) -> IO ( ) when condition action world = if condition then action world else ( ( ) , world )
As you can see , we can easily include or exclude from the execution chain IO procedures ( actions ) depending on the data values .
If ' condition ' will be False on the call of ' when ' , ' action ' will never be called because real Haskell compilers , again , never call functions whose results are not required to calculate the final result ( i.e. , here , the final " world " value of ' main ' ) .
Loops and more complex control structures can be implemented in the same way .
Try it as an exercise !
Finally , you may want to know how much passing these RealWorld values around the program costs .
It 's free !
These fake values exist solely for the compiler while it analyzes and optimizes the code , but when it gets to assembly code generation , it " suddenly " realize that this type is like " ( ) " , so all these parameters and result values can be omitted from the final generated code .
Is n't it beautiful ?
' >>=' and ' do ' notation
All beginners ( including me ) start by thinking that ' do ' is some magic statement that executes IO actions .
That 's wrong - ' do ' is just syntactic sugar that simplifies the writing of procedures that use IO ( and also other monads , but that 's beyond the scope of this tutorial ) .
' do ' notation eventually gets translated to statements passing " world " values around like we 've manually written above and is used to simplify the gluing of several IO actions together .
You do n't need to use ' do ' for just one statement ; for instance ,
main = do putStr " Hello ! "
is desugared to :
main = putStr " Hello ! "
Let 's examine how to desugar a ' do ' with multiple statements in the following example :
main = do putStr " What is your name ? " putStr " How old are you ? " putStr " Nice day ! "
The ' do ' statement here just joins several IO actions that should be performed sequentially .
It 's translated to sequential applications of one of the so - called " binding operators " , namely '>>':
main = ( putStr " What is your name ? " ) >> ( ( putStr " How old are you ? " ) >> ( putStr " Nice day ! " ) )
This binding operator just combines two IO actions , executing them sequentially by passing the " world " between them :
( >> ) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b ( action1 >> action2 ) world0 = let ( a , world1 ) = action1 world0 ( b , world2 ) = action2 world1 in ( b , world2 )
If defining operators this way looks strange to you , read this definition as follows :
action1 >> action2 = action where action world0 = let ( a , world1 ) = action1 world0 ( b , world2 ) = action2 world1 in ( b , world2 )
Now you can substitute the definition of '>>' at the places of its usage and check that program constructed by the ' do ' desugaring is actually the same as we could write by manually manipulating " world " values .
A more complex example involves the binding of variables using " <- " :
main = do a <- readLn print a
This code is desugared into :
main = readLn >>= ( \ a -> print a )
As you should remember , the ' >>' binding operator silently ignores the value of its first action and returns as an overall result the result of its second action only .
On the other hand , the ' >>= ' binding operator ( note the extra ' = ' at the end ) allows us to use the result of its first action - it gets passed as an additional parameter to the second one !
Look at the definition :
( >>= ) :: IO a -> ( a -> IO b ) ->
IO b ( action1 >>= action2 ) world0 = let ( a , world1 ) = action1 world0 ( b , world2 ) = action2 a world1 in ( b , world2 )
First , what does the type of the second " action " ( more precisely , a function which returns an IO action ) , namely " a -> IO b " , mean ?
By substituting the " IO " definition , we get " a -> RealWorld -> ( b , RealWorld ) " .
This means that second action actually has two parameters - the type ' a ' actually used inside it , and the value of type RealWorld used for sequencing of IO actions .
That 's always the case - any IO procedure has one more parameter compared to what you see in its type signature .
This parameter is hidden inside the definition of the type alias " IO " .
Second , you can use these '>>' and '>>=' operations to simplify your program .
For example , in the code above we do n't need to introduce the variable , because the result of ' readLn ' can be send directly to ' print ' :
main = readLn >>= print
And third - as you see , the notation :
do x <- action1 action2
where ' action1 ' has type " IO a " and ' action2 ' has type " IO b " , translates into :
action1 >>= ( \ x -> action2 )
where the second argument of '>>=' has the type " a -> IO b " .
It 's the way the ' < -' binding is processed - the name on the left - hand side of '< -' just becomes a parameter of subsequent operations represented as one large IO action .
Note also that if ' action1 ' has type " IO a " then ' x ' will just have type " a " ; you can think of the effect of ' < -' as " unpacking " the IO value of ' action1 ' into ' x ' .
Note also that '< -' is not a true operator ; it 's pure syntax , just like ' do ' itself .
Its meaning results only from the way it gets desugared .
Look at the next example :
main = do putStr " What is your name ? " a <- readLn putStr " How old are you ? " b <- readLn print ( a , b )
This code is desugared into :
main = putStr " What is your name ? " >> readLn >>= \ a -> putStr " How old are you ? " >> readLn >>= \ b -> print ( a , b )
I omitted the parentheses here ; both the ' >>' and the ' >>= ' operators are left - associative , but lambda - bindings always stretches as far to the right as possible , which means that the ' a ' and ' b ' bindings introduced here are valid for all remaining actions .
As an exercise , add the parentheses yourself and translate this procedure into the low - level code that explicitly passes " world " values .
I think it should be enough to help you finally realize how the ' do ' translation and binding operators work .
Oh , no !
I forgot the third monadic operator - ' return ' .
It just combines its two parameters - the value passed and " world " :
return :: a ->
IO a return a world0 = ( a , world0 )
How about translating a simple example of ' return ' usage ?
Say ,
main = do a <- readLn return ( a * 2 )
Programmers with an imperative language background often think that ' return ' in Haskell , as in other languages , immediately returns from the IO procedure .
As you can see in its definition ( and even just from its type ! ) , such an assumption is totally wrong .
The only purpose of using ' return ' is to " lift " some value ( of type ' a ' ) into the result of a whole action ( of type " IO a " ) and therefore it should generally be used only as the last executed statement of some IO sequence .
For example try to translate the following procedure into the corresponding low - level code :
main = do a <- readLn when ( a >= 0 ) $ do return ( ) print " a is negative "
and you will realize that the ' print ' statement is executed even for non-negative values of ' a ' .
If you need to escape from the middle of an IO procedure , you can use the ' if ' statement :
main = do a <- readLn if ( a >= 0 ) then return ( ) else print " a is negative "
Moreover , Haskell layout rules allow us to use the following layout :
main = do a <- readLn if ( a >= 0 ) then return ( ) else do print " a is negative " ...
that may be useful for escaping from the middle of a longish ' do ' statement .
Last exercise : implement a function ' liftM ' that lifts operations on plain values to the operations on monadic ones .
Its type signature :
liftM :: ( a -> b ) -> ( IO a -> IO b )
If that 's too hard for you , start with the following high - level definition and rewrite it in low - level fashion :
liftM f action = do x <- action return ( f x )
Mutable data ( references , arrays , hash tables ... )
As you should know , every name in Haskell is bound to one fixed ( immutable ) value .
This greatly simplifies understanding algorithms and code optimization , but it 's inappropriate in some cases .
As we all know , there are plenty of algorithms that are simpler to implement in terms of updatable variables , arrays and so on .
This means that the value associated with a variable , for example , can be different at different execution points , so reading its value can't be considered as a pure function .
Imagine , for example , the following code :
main = do let a0 = readVariable varA _ = writeVariable varA 1 a1 = readVariable varA print ( a0 , a 1 )
Does this look strange ?
First , the two calls to ' readVariable ' look the same , so the compiler can just reuse the value returned by the first call .
Second , the result of the ' writeVariable ' call is n't used so the compiler can ( and will ! ) omit this call completely .
To complete the picture , these three calls may be rearranged in any order because they appear to be independent of each other .
This is obviously not what was intended .
What 's the solution ?
You already know this - use IO actions !
Using IO actions guarantees that :
the execution order will be retained as written each action will have to be executed the result of the " same " action ( such as " readVariable varA " ) will not be reused
So , the code above really should be written as :
import Data .IORef main = do varA <- newIORef 0 -- Create and initialize a new variable a0 <- readIORef varA writeIORef varA 1 a1 <- readIORef varA print ( a0 , a 1 )
Here , ' varA ' has the type " IORef Int " which means " a variable ( reference ) in the IO monad holding a value of type Int " .
newIORef creates a new variable ( reference ) and returns it , and then read / write actions use this reference .
The value returned by the " readIORef varA " action depends not only on the variable involved but also on the moment this operation is performed so it can return different values on each call .
Arrays , hash tables and any other _mutable_ data structures are defined in the same way - for each of them , there 's an operation that creates new " mutable values " and returns a reference to it .
Then special read and write operations in the IO monad are used .
The following code shows an example using mutable arrays :
import Data .
Array .IO main = do arr <- newArray ( 1 , 10 ) 37 :: IO ( IOArray Int Int ) a <- readArray arr 1 writeArray arr 1 64 b <- readArray arr 1 print ( a , b )
Here , an array of 10 elements with 37 as the initial value at each location is created .
After reading the value of the first element ( index 1 ) into ' a ' this element 's value is changed to 64 and then read again into ' b ' .
As you can see by executing this code , ' a ' will be set to 37 and ' b ' to 64 .
Other state - dependent operations are also often implemented as IO actions .
For example , a random number generator should return a different value on each call .
It looks natural to give it a type involving IO :
rand :: IO Int
Moreover , when you import C routines you should be careful - if this routine is impure , i.e. its result depends on something in the " real world " ( file system , memory contents ... ) , internal state and so on , you should give it an IO type .
Otherwise , the compiler can " optimize " repetitive calls of this procedure with the same parameters !
For example , we can write a non -IO type for :
foreign import ccall sin :: Double ->
Double
because the result of ' sin ' depends only on its argument , but
foreign import ccall tell :: Int ->
IO Int
If you will declare ' tell ' as a pure function ( without IO ) then you may get the same position on each call !
IO actions as values
By this point you should understand why it 's impossible to use IO actions inside non-IO ( pure ) procedures .
Such procedures just do n't get a " baton " ; they do n't know any " world " value to pass to an IO action .
The RealWorld type is an abstract datatype , so pure functions also can't construct RealWorld values by themselves , and it's a strict type , so ' undefined ' also can't be used .
So , the prohibition of using IO actions inside pure procedures is just a type system trick ( as it usually is in Haskell ) .
But while pure code can't _execute_ IO actions , it can work with them as with any other functional values - they can be stored in data structures , passed as parameters , returned as results , collected in lists , and partially applied .
But an IO action will remain a functional value because we can't apply it to the last argument - of type RealWorld .
In order to _execute_ the IO action we need to apply it to some RealWorld value .
That can be done only inside some IO procedure , in its " actions chain " .
And real execution of this action will take place only when this procedure is called as part of the process of " calculating the final value of world " for ' main ' .
Look at this example :
main world0 = let get2chars = getChar >> getChar ( ( ) , world1 ) = putStr " Press two keys " world0 ( answer , world2 ) = get2chars world1 in ( ( ) , world2 )
Here we first bind a value to ' get2 chars ' and then write a binding involving ' putStr ' .
But what 's the execution order ?
It 's not defined by the order of the ' let ' bindings , it 's defined by the order of processing " world " values !
You can arbitrarily reorder the binding statements - the execution order will be defined by the data dependency with respect to the " world " values that get passed around .
Let 's see what this ' main ' looks like in the ' do ' notation :
main = do let get2chars = getChar >> get Char putStr " Press two keys " get2 chars return ()
As you can see , we 've eliminated two of the ' let ' bindings and left only the one defining ' get2 chars ' .
The non -' let ' statements are executed in the exact order in which they 're written , because they pass the " world " value from statement to statement as we described above .
Thus , this version of the function is much easier to understand because we do n't have to mentally figure out the data dependency of the " world " value .
Moreover , IO actions like ' get2 chars ' can't be executed directly because they are functions with a RealWorld parameter .
To execute them , we need to supply the RealWorld parameter , i.e. insert them in the ' main ' chain , placing them in some ' do ' sequence executed from ' main ' ( either directly in the ' main ' function , or indirectly in an IO function called from ' main ' ) .
Until that 's done , they will remain like any function , in partially evaluated form .
And we can work with IO actions as with any other functions - bind them to names ( as we did above ) , save them in data structures , pass them as function parameters and return them as results - and they wo n't be performed until you give them the magic RealWorld parameter !
Example : a list of IO actions
Let 's try defining a list of IO actions :
ioActions :: [ IO ( ) ] ioActions = [ ( print " Hello ! " ) , ( putStr " just kidding " ) , ( getChar >> return ( ) ) ]
I used additional parentheses around each action , although they are n't really required .
If you still can't believe that these actions wo n't be executed immediately , just recall the real type of this list :
ioActions :: [ RealWorld -> ( ( ) , RealWorld ) ]
Well , now we want to execute some of these actions .
No problem , just insert them into the ' main ' chain :
main = do head ioActions ioActions !!
1 last ioActions
Looks strange , right ?
Really , any IO action that you write in a ' do ' statement ( or use as a parameter for the '>>'/'>>=' operators ) is an expression returning a result of type ' IO a ' for some type ' a ' .
Typically , you use some function that has the type 'x -> y -> ... -> IO a' and provide all the x , y , etc. parameters .
But you 're not limited to this standard scenario - do n't forget that Haskell is a functional language and you 're free to compute the functional value required ( recall that " IO a " is really a function type ) in any possible way .
Here we just extracted several functions from the list - no problem .
This functional value can also be constructed on - the - fly , as we 've done in the previous example - that 's also OK .
Want to see this functional value passed as a parameter ?
Just look at the definition of ' when ' .
Hey , we can buy , sell , and rent these IO actions just like we can with any other functional values !
For example , let 's define a function that executes all the IO actions in the list :
sequence_ :: [ IO a ] -> IO ( ) sequence_ [ ] = return ( ) sequence_ ( x : xs ) = do x sequence_
xs
No black magic - we just extract IO actions from the list and insert them into a chain of IO operations that should be performed one after another ( in the same order that they occurred in the list ) to " compute the final world value " of the entire ' sequence_ ' call .
With the help of ' sequence_ ' , we can rewrite our last ' main ' function as :
main = sequence_ ioActions
Haskell 's ability to work with IO actions as with any other ( functional and non-functional ) values allows us to define control structures of arbitrary complexity .
Try , for example , to define a control structure that repeats an action until it returns the ' False ' result :
while :: IO Bool -> IO ( ) while action = ???
Most programming languages do n't allow you to define control structures at all , and those that do often require you to use a macro- expansion system .
In Haskell , control structures are just trivial functions anyone can write .
Example : returning an IO action as a result
How about returning an IO action as the result of a function ?
Well , we 've done this each time we 've defined an IO procedure - they all return IO actions that need a RealWorld value to be performed .
While we usually just execute them as part of a higher - level IO procedure , it 's also possible to just collect them without actual execution :
main = do let a = sequence ioActions b = when True getChar c = getChar >> get Char putStr
" These ' let ' statements are not executed ! "
These assigned IO procedures can be used as parameters to other procedures , or written to global variables , or processed in some other way , or just executed later , as we did in the example with ' get2 chars ' .
But how about returning a parameterized IO action from an IO procedure ?
Let 's define a procedure that returns the i'th byte from a file represented as a Handle :
readi h i = do hSeek h AbsoluteSeek i hGetChar h
So far so good .
But how about a procedure that returns the i'th byte of a file with a given name without reopening it each time ?
readfilei :: String -> IO ( Integer -> IO Char ) readfilei name = do h <- open
File name ReadMode return ( readi h )
As you can see , it 's an IO procedure that opens a file and returns ... another IO procedure that will read the specified byte .
But we can go further and include the ' readi ' body in ' readfilei ' :
readfilei name = do h <- open
File name ReadMode let readi h i = do hSeek h AbsoluteSeek i hGetChar h return ( readi h )
That 's a little better .
But why do we add ' h ' as a parameter to ' readi ' if it can be obtained from the environment where ' readi ' is now defined ?
An even shorter version is this :
readfilei name = do h <- open
File name ReadMode let readi i = do hSeek h AbsoluteSeek i hGetChar h return readi
What have we done here ?
We 've build a parameterized IO action involving local names inside ' readfilei ' and returned it as the result .
Now it can be used in the following way :
main = do myfile <- readfilei " test " a <- myfile 0 b <- myfile 1 print ( a , b )
This way of using IO actions is very typical for Haskell programs - you just construct one or more IO actions that you need , with or without parameters , possibly involving the parameters that your " constructor " received , and return them to the caller .
Then these IO actions can be used in the rest of the program without any knowledge about your internal implementation strategy .
One thing this can be used for is to partially emulate the OOP ( or more precisely , the ADT ) programming paradigm .
Example : a memory allocator generator
As an example , one of my programs has a module which is a memory suballocator .
It receives the address and size of a large memory block and returns two procedures - one to allocate a subblock of a given size and the other to free the allocated subblock :
memoryAllocator :: Ptr a ->
Int -> IO ( Int -> IO ( Ptr b ) , Ptr c -> IO ( ) ) memory Allocator buf size = do ...... let alloc size = do ... ... free ptr = do ... ... return ( alloc , free )
How this is implemented ?
' alloc ' and ' free ' work with references created inside the memory Allocator procedure .
Because the creation of these references is a part of the memory Allocator IO actions chain , a new independent set of references will be created for each memory block for which memory Allocator is called :
memoryAllocator buf size = do start <- newIORef buf end <- newIORef ( buf ` plusPtr ` size ) ...
These two references are read and written in the ' alloc ' and ' free ' definitions ( we 'll implement a very simple memory allocator for this example ) :
... let alloc size = do addr <- readIORef start writeIORef start ( addr ` plusPtr ` size ) return addr let free ptr = do writeIORef start ptr
What we 've defined here is just a pair of closures that use state available at the moment of their definition .
As you can see , it 's as easy as in any other functional language , despite Haskell 's lack of direct support for impure functions .
The following example uses procedures , returned by memory Allocator , to simultaneously allocate / free blocks in two independent memory buffers :
main = do buf1 <- mallocBytes ( 2 ^ 16 ) buf2 <- mallocBytes ( 2 ^ 20 ) ( alloc1 , free1 ) <- memoryAllocator buf1 ( 2 ^ 16 ) ( alloc2 , free2 ) <- memoryAllocator buf2 ( 2 ^ 20 ) ptr11 <- alloc1 100 ptr21 <- alloc2 1000 free1 ptr11 free2 ptr21 ptr12 <- alloc1 100 ptr22 <- alloc2 1000
Example : emulating OOP with record types
Let 's implement the classical OOP example : drawing figures .
There are figures of different types : circles , rectangles and so on .
The task is to create a heterogeneous list of figures .
All figures in this list should support the same set of operations : draw , move and so on .
We will represent these operations as IO procedures .
Instead of a " class " let 's define a structure containing implementations of all the procedures required :
data Figure = Figure { draw :: IO ( ) , move :: Displacement -> IO ( ) } type Displacement = ( Int , Int ) -- horizontal and vertical displacement in points
The constructor of each figure 's type should just return a Figure record :
circle :: Point -> Radius -> IO Figure rectangle :: Point -> Point -> IO Figure type Point = ( Int , Int ) -- point coordinates type Radius =
Int -- circle radius in points
We will " draw " figures by just printing their current parameters .
Let 's start with a simplified implementation of the ' circle ' and ' rectangle ' constructors , without actual ' move ' support :
circle center radius = do let description = " Circle at " ++ show center ++ " with radius " ++ show radius return $ Figure { draw = putStrLn description } rectangle from to = do let description = " Rectangle " ++ show from ++ " - " ++ show to ) return $ Figure { draw = putStrLn description }
As you see , each constructor just returns a fixed ' draw ' procedure that prints parameters with which the concrete figure was created .
Let 's test it :
drawAll :: [ Figure ] -> IO ( ) drawAll figures = do putStrLn " Drawing figures : " mapM_ draw figures main = do figures <- sequence [ circle ( 10 , 10 ) 5 , circle ( 20 , 20 ) 3 , rectangle ( 10 , 10 ) ( 20 , 20 ) , rectangle ( 15 , 15 ) ( 40 , 40 ) ] drawAll figures
Now let 's define " full - featured " figures that can actually be moved around .
In order to achieve this , we should provide each figure with a mutable variable that holds each figure 's current screen location .
The type of this variable will be " IORef Point " .
This variable should be created in the figure constructor and manipulated in IO procedures ( closures ) enclosed in the Figure record :
circle center radius = do centerVar <- newIORef center let drawF = do center <- readIORef centerVar putStrLn ( " Circle at " ++ show center ++ " with radius " ++ show radius ) let moveF ( addX , addY ) = do ( x , y ) <- readIORef centerVar writeIORef centerVar ( x + addX , y + addY ) return $ Figure { draw = drawF , move = moveF } rectangle from to = do fromVar <- newIORef from toVar <- newIORef to let drawF = do from <- readIORef fromVar to <- readIORef toVar putStrLn ( " Rectangle " ++ show from ++ " - " ++ show to ) let moveF ( addX , addY ) = do ( fromX , fromY ) <- readIORef fromVar ( toX , toY ) <- readIORef toVar writeIORef fromVar ( fromX + addX , fromY + addY ) writeIORef toVar ( toX + addX , toY + addY ) return $ Figure { draw = drawF , move = moveF }
Now we can test the code which moves figures around :
main = do figures <- sequence [ circle ( 10 , 10 ) 5 , rectangle ( 10 , 10 ) ( 20 , 20 ) ] drawAll figures mapM_ ( \ fig -> move fig ( 10 , 10 ) ) figures drawAll figures
It 's important to realize that we are not limited to including only IO actions in a record that 's intended to simulate a C++/ Java - style interface .
The record can also include values , IORefs , pure functions - in short , any type of data .
For example , we can easily add to the Figure interface fields for area and origin :
data Figure = Figure { draw :: IO ( ) , move :: Displacement -> IO ( ) , area :: Double , origin :: IORef Point }
Exception handling ( under development )
Although Haskell provides a set of exception raising / handling features comparable to those in popular OOP languages ( C++ , Java , C# ) , this part of the language receives much less attention .
This is for two reasons .
First , you just do n't need to worry as much about them - most of the time it just works " behind the scenes " .
The second reason is that Haskell , lacking OOP inheritance , does n't allow the programmer to easily subclass exception types , therefore limiting flexibility of exception handling .
The Haskell RTS raises more exceptions than traditional languages - pattern match failures , calls with invalid arguments ( such as head [ ] ) and computations whose results depend on special values undefined and error " .... " all raise their own exceptions :
example 1 :
main = print ( f 2 ) f 0 = " zero " f 1 = " one "
example 2 :
main = print ( head [ ] )
example 3 :
main = print ( 1 + ( error " Value that was n't initialized or cannot be computed " ) )
This allows to write programs in much more error - prone way .
Interfacing with C/C++ and foreign libraries ( under development )
While Haskell is great at algorithm development , speed is n't its best side .
We can combine the best of both worlds , though , by writing speed - critical parts of program in C and rest in Haskell .
We just need a way to call C functions from Haskell and vice versa , and to marshal data between two worlds .
We also need to interact with C world for using Windows / Linux APIs , linking to various libraries and DLLs .
Even interfacing with other languages requires to go through C world as " common denominator " .
Chapter 8 of the Haskell 2010 report provides a complete description of interfacing with C .
We will learn FFI via a series of examples .
These examples include C/C++ code , so they need C/C++ compilers to be installed , the same will be true if you need to include code written in C / C++ in your program ( C/C++ compilers are not required when you just need to link with existing libraries providing APIs with C calling convention ) .
On Unix ( and Mac OS ? ) systems , the system - wide default C/C++ compiler is typically used by GHC installation .
On Windows , no default compilers exist , so GHC is typically shipped with a C compiler , and you may find on the download page a GHC distribution bundled with C and C++ compilers .
Alternatively , you may find and install a GCC / MinGW version compatible with your GHC installation .
If you need to make your C/C++ code as fast as possible , you may compile your code by Intel compilers instead of GCC .
However , these compilers are not free , moreover on Windows , code compiled by Intel compilers may not interact correctly with GHC - compiled code , unless one of them is put into DLLs ( due to object file incompatibility ) .

Calling functions
First , we will learn how to call C functions from Haskell and Haskell functions from C .
The first example consists of three files :
main.hs :
{-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-} main = do print " Hello from main " c_function haskell_function = print " Hello from haskell_function " foreign import ccall safe " prototypes.h " c_function :: IO ( ) foreign export ccall haskell_function :: IO ()
evil.c :
# include < stdio . h > # include " prototypes.h " void c_function ( void ) { printf ( " Hello from c_function
" ) ; haskell_function () ; }
prototypes.h :
extern void c_function ( void ) ; extern void haskell_function ( void ) ;
It may be compiled and linked in one step by ghc :
ghc -- make main.hs evil.c
Or , you may compile C module (s ) separately and link in .o files ( this may be preferable if you use make and do n't want to recompile unchanged sources ; ghc 's -- make option provides smart recompilation only for .hs files ) :
ghc -c evil .c ghc -- make main.hs evil .o
You may use gcc / g++ directly to compile your C/C++ files but I recommend to do linking via ghc because it adds a lot of libraries required for execution of Haskell code .
For the same reason , even if your main routine is written in C/C++ , I recommend calling it from the Haskell function main - otherwise you 'll have to explicitly init / shutdown the GHC RTS ( run- time system ) .
We use the " foreign import " specification to import foreign routines into our Haskell world , and " foreign export " to export Haskell routines into the external world .
Note that the import statement creates a new Haskell symbol ( from the external one ) , while the export statement uses a Haskell symbol previously defined .
Technically speaking , both types of statements create a wrapper that converts the names and calling conventions from C to Haskell or vice versa .
All about the " foreign " statement
The " ccall " specifier in foreign statements means the use of C ( not C++ ! ) calling convention .
This means that if you want to write the external function in C++ ( instead of C ) you should add export " C " specification to its declaration - otherwise you 'll get linking errors .
Let 's rewrite our first example to use C++ instead of C :
prototypes.h :
# ifdef __cplusplus extern " C " { # endif extern void c_function ( void ) ; extern void haskell_function ( void ) ; # ifdef __cplusplus } # endif
Compile it via :
ghc -- make main.hs evil.cpp
where evil.cpp is just a renamed copy of evil .c from the first example .
Note that the new prototypes.h is written to allow compiling it both as C and C++ code .
When it 's included from evil.cpp , it 's compiled as C++ code .
When GHC compiles main.hs via the C compiler ( enabled by - fvia - C option ) , it also includes prototypes.h but compiles it in C mode .
It 's why you need to specify .h files in " foreign " declarations - depending on which Haskell compiler you use , these files may be included to check consistency of C and Haskell declarations .
The quoted part of the foreign statement may also be used to import or export a function under another name -- for example ,
foreign import ccall safe " prototypes.h CFunction " c_function :: IO ( ) foreign export ccall " HaskellFunction " haskell_function :: IO ()
specifies that the C function called CFunction will become known as the Haskell function c_function , while the Haskell function haskell_function will be known in the C world as HaskellFunction .
It 's required when the C name does n't conform to Haskell naming requirements .
Although the Haskell FFI standard tells about many other calling conventions in addition to ccall ( e.g. cplusplus , jvm , net ) current Haskell implementations support only ccall and stdcall .
The latter , also called the " Pascal " calling convention , is used to interface with WinAPI :
foreign import stdcall unsafe " windows.h SetFileApisToOEM " setFileApisToOEM :: IO ()
And finally , about the safe / unsafe specifier : a C function imported with the " unsafe " keyword is called directly and the Haskell runtime is stopped while the C function is executed ( when there are several OS threads executing the Haskell program , only the current OS thread is delayed ) .
This call does n't allow recursively entering into the Haskell world by calling any Haskell function - the Haskell RTS is just not prepared for such an event .
However , unsafe calls are as quick as calls in C world .
It 's ideal for " momentary " calls that quickly return back to the caller .
When " safe " is specified , the C function is called in safe environment - the Haskell execution context is saved , so it 's possible to call back to Haskell and , if the C call takes a long time , another OS thread may be started to execute Haskell code ( of course , in threads other than the one that called the C code ) .
This has its own price , though - around 1000 CPU ticks per call .
You can read more about interaction between FFI calls and Haskell concurrency in [ 7 ] .
Marshalling simple types
Calling by itself is relatively easy ; the real problem of interfacing languages with different data models is passing data between them .
In this case , there is no guarantee that Haskell 's Int is represented in memory the same way as C's int , nor Haskell 's Double the same as C's double and so on .
While on * some * platforms they are the same and you can write throw - away programs relying on these , the goal of portability requires you to declare imported and exported functions using special types described in the FFI standard , which are guaranteed to correspond to C types .
These are :
import Foreign .
C.Types ( -- equivalent to the following C type : CChar , CUChar , -- char / unsigned char CShort , CUShort , -- short / unsigned short CInt , CUInt , CLong , CULong , -- int/unsigned / long / unsigned long CFloat , CDouble ... ) -- float / double
Now we can import and export typeful C / Haskell functions :
foreign import ccall unsafe " math.h " c_sin :: CDouble -> CDouble
Note that pure C functions ( those whose results depend only on their arguments ) are imported without IO in their return type .
The " const " specifier in C is not reflected in Haskell types , so appropriate compiler checks are not performed .
All these numeric types are instances of the same classes as their Haskell cousins ( Ord , Num , Show and so on ) , so you may perform calculations on these data directly .
Alternatively , you may convert them to native Haskell types .
It 's very typical to write simple wrappers around imported and exported functions just to provide interfaces having native Haskell types :
-- | Type - conversion wrapper around c_sin sin :: Double ->
Double sin = fromRational .
c_sin .
toRational
Memory management
Marshalling strings
import Foreign .
C.String ( -- representation of strings in C CString , -- = Ptr CChar CStringLen ) -- = ( Ptr CChar , Int )
foreign import ccall unsafe " string.h " c_strlen :: CString -> IO CSize -- CSize defined in Foreign .
C.Types and is equal to size_t
-- | Type - conversion wrapper around c_strlen strlen :: String ->
Int strlen = ....
Marshalling composite types
A C array may be manipulated in Haskell as StorableArray .
There is no built - in support for marshalling C structures and using C constants in Haskell .
These are implemented in c2hs preprocessor , though .
Binary marshalling ( serializing ) of data structures of any complexity is implemented in library Binary .
Dynamic calls
DLLs
because i do n't have experience of using DLLs , can someone write into this section ?
ultimately , we need to consider the following tasks :
using DLLs of 3rd- party libraries ( such as ziplib )
putting your own C code into a DLL to use in Haskell
putting Haskell code into a DLL which may be called from C code
Dark side of IO monad
unsafePerformIO
Programmers coming from an imperative language background often look for a way to execute IO actions inside a pure procedure .
But what does this mean ?
Imagine that you 're trying to write a procedure that reads the contents of a file with a given name , and you try to write it as a pure ( non - IO ) function :
readContents :: Filename ->
String
Defining readContents as a pure function will certainly simplify the code that uses it .
But it will also create problems for the compiler :
This call is not inserted in a sequence of " world transformations " , so the compiler does n't know at what exact moment you want to execute this action .
For example , if the file has one kind of contents at the beginning of the program and another at the end - which contents do you want to see ?
You have no idea when ( or even if ) this function is going to get invoked , because Haskell sees this function as pure and feels free to reorder the execution of any or all pure functions as needed .
Attempts to read the contents of files with the same name can be factored ( i.e. reduced to a single call ) despite the fact that the file ( or the current directory ) can be changed between calls .
Again , Haskell considers all non-IO functions to be pure and feels free to omit multiple calls with the same parameters .
So , implementing pure functions that interact with the Real World is considered to be Bad Behavior .
Good boys and girls never do it ;)
Nevertheless , there are ( semi- official ) ways to use IO actions inside of pure functions .
As you should remember this is prohibited by requiring the RealWorld " baton " in order to call an IO action .
Pure functions do n't have the baton , but there is a special " magic " procedure that produces this baton from nowhere , uses it to call an IO action and then throws the resulting " world " away !
It 's a little low - level magic .
This very special ( and dangerous ) procedure is :
unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a
Let 's look at its ( possible ) definition :
unsafePerformIO :: ( RealWorld -> ( a , RealWorld ) ) -> a unsafePerformIO action = let ( a , world1 ) = action createNewWorld in a
where ' createNewWorld ' is an internal function producing a new value of the RealWorld type .
Using unsafePerformIO , you can easily write pure functions that do I /O inside .
But do n't do this without a real need , and remember to follow this rule : the compiler does n't know that you are cheating ; it still considers each non-IO function to be a pure one .
Therefore , all the usual optimization rules can ( and will ! ) be applied to its execution .
So you must ensure that :
The result of each call depends only on its arguments .
You do n't rely on side - effects of this function , which may be not executed if its results are not needed .
Let 's investigate this problem more deeply .
Function evaluation in Haskell is determined by a value 's necessity - the language computes only the values that are really required to calculate the final result .
But what does this mean with respect to the ' main ' function ?
To " calculate the final world 's " value , you need to perform all the intermediate IO actions that are included in the ' main ' chain .
By using ' unsafePerformIO ' we call IO actions outside of this chain .
What guarantee do we have that they will be run at all ?
None .
The only time they will be run is if running them is required to compute the overall function result ( which in turn should be required to perform some action in the ' main ' chain ) .
This is an example of Haskell 's evaluation - by - need strategy .
Now you should clearly see the difference :
- An IO action inside an IO procedure is guaranteed to execute as long as it is ( directly or indirectly ) inside the ' main ' chain - even when its result is n't used ( because the implicit " world " value it returns will be used ) .
You directly specify the order of the action 's execution inside the IO procedure .
Data dependencies are simulated via the implicit " world " values that are passed from each IO action to the next .
- An IO action inside ' unsafePerformIO ' will be performed only if result of this operation is really used .
The evaluation order is not guaranteed and you should not rely on it ( except when you 're sure about whatever data dependencies may exist ) .
I should also say that inside ' unsafePerformIO ' call you can organize a small internal chain of IO actions with the help of the same binding operators and / or ' do ' syntactic sugar we 've seen above .
For example , here 's a particularly convoluted way to compute the integer that comes after zero :
one :: Int one = unsafePerformIO $ do var <- newIORef 0 modifyIORef var ( + 1 ) readIORef var
and in this case ALL the operations in this chain will be performed as long as the result of the ' unsafePerformIO ' call is needed .
To ensure this , the actual ' unsafePerformIO ' implementation evaluates the " world " returned by the ' action ' :
unsafePerformIO action = let ( a , world1 ) = action createNewWorld in ( world1 ` seq ` a )
( The ' seq ' operation strictly evaluates its first argument before returning the value of the second one [ 8 ] ) .
inlinePerformIO
inlinePerformIO has the same definition as unsafePerformIO but with addition of INLINE pragma :
-- | Just like unsafePerformIO , but we inline it .
Big performance gains as -- it exposes lots of things to further inlining {-# INLINE inlinePerformIO #-} inlinePerformIO action = let ( a , world1 ) = action createNewWorld in ( world1 ` seq ` a ) # endif
Semantically inlinePerformIO = unsafePerformIO in as much as either of those have any semantics at all .
The difference of course is that inlinePerformIO is even less safe than unsafePerformIO .
While ghc will try not to duplicate or common up different uses of unsafePerformIO , we aggressively inline inlinePerformIO .
So you can really only use it where the IO content is really properly pure , like reading from an immutable memory buffer ( as in the case of ByteStrings ) .
However things like allocating new buffers should not be done inside inlinePerformIO since that can easily be floated out and performed just once for the whole program , so you end up with many things sharing the same buffer , which would be bad .
So the rule of thumb is that IO things wrapped in unsafePerformIO have to be externally pure while with inlinePerformIO it has to be really really pure or it 'll all go horribly wrong .
That said , here 's some really hairy code .
This should frighten any pure functional programmer ...
write :: Int -> ( Ptr Word8 -> IO ( ) ) ->
Put ( ) write !
n body =
Put $ \ c buf @ ( Buffer fp o u l ) -> if n <= l then write ' c fp o u l else write ' ( flushOld c n fp o u ) ( new Buffer c n ) 0 0 0 where {-# NOINLINE write ' # -} write ' c ! fp ! o ! u ! l = -- warning : this is a tad hardcore inlinePerformIO ( withForeign Ptr fp ( \ p -> body $ ! ( p ` plusPtr ` ( o + u ) ) ) ) ` seq ` c () ( Buffer fp o ( u + n ) ( l - n ) )
it 's used like :
word8 w = write 1 ( \ p -> poke p w )
This does not adhere to my rule of thumb above .
Do n't ask exactly why we claim it 's safe :-) ( and if anyone really wants to know , ask Ross Paterson who did it first in the Builder monoid )
unsafeInterleaveIO
But there is an even stranger operation called ' unsafeInterleaveIO ' that gets the " official baton " , makes its own pirate copy , and then runs an " illegal " relay - race in parallel with the main one !
I can't talk further about its behavior without causing grief and indignation , so it 's no surprise that this operation is widely used in countries that are hotbeds of software piracy such as Russia and China ! ;)
Do n't even ask me - I wo n't say anything more about this dirty trick I use all the time ;)
One can use unsafePerformIO ( not unsafeInterleaveIO ) to perform I / O operations not in predefined order but by demand .
For example , the following code :
do let c = unsafePerformIO getChar do_proc c
will perform getChar I / O call only when value of c is really required by code , i.e. it this call will be performed lazily as any usual Haskell computation .
Now imagine the following code :
do let s = [ unsafePerformIO getChar , unsafePerformIO getChar , unsafePerformIO getChar ] do_proc s
Three chars inside this list will be computed on demand too , and this means that their values will depend on the order they are consumed .
It is not that we usually need .
unsafeInterleaveIO solves this problem - it performs I / O only on demand but allows to define exact * internal * execution order for parts of your datastructure .
It is why I wrote that unsafeInterleaveIO makes illegal copy of baton .
First , unsafeInterleaveIO has ( IO a ) action as a parameter and returns value of type ' a ' :
do str <- unsafeInterleaveIO myGetContents
Second , unsafeInterleaveIO do n't perform any action immediately , it only creates a box of type ' a ' which on requesting this value will perform action specified as a parameter .
Third , this action by itself may compute the whole value immediately or ... use unsafeInterleaveIO again to defer calculation of some sub-components :
myGetContents = do c <- get Char s <- unsafeInterleaveIO myGetContents return ( c : s )
This code will be executed only at the moment when value of str is really demanded .
In this moment , getChar will be performed ( with result assigned to c ) and one more lazy IO box will be created - for s .
This box again contains link to the myGetContents call
Then , list cell returned that contains one char read and link to myGetContents call as a way to compute rest of the list .
Only at the moment when next value in list required , this operation will be performed again
As a final result , we get inability to read second char in list before first one , but lazy character of reading in whole .
bingo !
PS : of course , actual code should include EOF checking .
also note that you can read many chars / records at each call :
myGetContents = do c <- replicateM 512 getChar s <- unsafeInterleaveIO myGetContents return ( c ++ s )
A safer approach : the ST monad
We said earlier that we can use unsafePerformIO to perform computations that are totally pure but nevertheless interact with the Real World in some way .
There is , however , a better way !
One that remains totally pure and yet allows the use of references , arrays , and so on -- and it 's done using , you guessed it , type magic .
This is the ST monad .
The ST monad 's version of unsafePerformIO is called runST , and it has a very unusual type .
runST :: ( forall s . ST s a ) -> a
The s variable in the ST monad is the state type .
Moreover , all the fun mutable stuff available in the ST monad is quantified over s :
newSTRef :: a -> ST s ( STRef s a ) newArray_ :: Ix i => ( i , i ) ->
ST s ( STArray s i e )
So why does runST have such a funky type ?
Let 's see what would happen if we wrote
makeSTRef :: a ->
STRef s a makeSTRef a = runST ( newSTRef a )
This fails , because newSTRef a does n't work for all state types s -- it only works for the s from the return type STRef s a .
This is all sort of wacky , but the result is that you can only run an ST computation where the output type is functionally pure , and makes no references to the internal mutable state of the computation .
The ST monad does n't have access to I/O operations like writing to the console , either -- only references , arrays , and suchlike that come in handy for pure computations .
Important note -- the state type does n't actually mean anything .
We never have a value of type s , for instance .
It 's just a way of getting the type system to do the work of ensuring purity for us , with smoke and mirrors .
It 's really just type system magic : secretly , on the inside , runST runs a computation with the real world baton just like unsafePerformIO .
Their internal implementations are almost identical : in fact , there 's a function
stToIO :: ST RealWorld a -> IO a
The difference is that ST uses type system magic to forbid unsafe behavior like extracting mutable objects from their safe ST wrapping , but allowing purely functional outputs to be performed with all the handy access to mutable references and arrays .
So here 's how we 'd rewrite our function using unsafePerformIO from above :
oneST :: ST s Int -- note that this works correctly for any s oneST = do var <- newSTRef 0 modifySTRef var ( + 1 ) readSTRef var one ::
Int one = runST oneST
Welcome to the machine : the actual GHC implementation
A little disclaimer : I should say that I 'm not describing here exactly what a monad is ( I do n't even completely understand it myself ) and my explanation shows only one _possible_ way to implement the IO monad in Haskell .
For example , the hbc Haskell compiler and the Hugs interpreter implements the IO monad via continuations [ 9 ] .
I also have n't said anything about exception handling , which is a natural part of the " monad " concept .
You can read the " All About Monads " guide to learn more about these topics .
But there is some good news : first , the IO monad understanding you 've just acquired will work with any implementation and with many other monads .
You just can't work with RealWorld values directly .
Second , the IO monad implementation described here is really used in the GHC , yhc / nhc ( jhc , too ? ) compilers .
Here is the actual IO definition from the GHC sources :
newtype IO a = IO ( State # RealWorld -> ( # State # RealWorld , a # ) )
It uses the " State # RealWorld " type instead of our RealWorld , it uses the " (# # ) " strict tuple for optimization , and it adds an IO data constructor around the type .
Nevertheless , there are no significant changes from the standpoint of our explanation .
Knowing the principle of " chaining " IO actions via fake " state of the world " values , you can now easily understand and write low - level implementations of GHC I/O operations .
The Yhc / nhc98 implementation
data World = World newtype IO a = IO ( World -> Either IOError a )
This implementation makes the " World " disappear somewhat [ 10 ] , and returns Either a result of type " a " , or if an error occurs then " IOError " .
The lack of the World on the right - hand side of the function can only be done because the compiler knows special things about the IO type , and wo n't overoptimise it .

In 1971 , the UNIX Time Sharing system , First Edition was released .
This simple operating system allowed multiple users to use a single , low - end minicomputer .
It became popular , largely due to the fact that the source code was available for free to universities , which produced a generation of graduates who grew up learning UNIX .
Rather than developing their own operating systems , a lot of companies licensed the UNIX source code and produced their own derivatives to run on their hardware .
Eventually , UNIX replaced most commercial operating systems .
In the last decade , free clones and derivatives of UNIX have started to take over from the old - guard UNIX systems .
In terms of source code , these versions share very little , if anything , with their predecessors , but in terms of design and philosophy a lot can be traced back to the original roots .
UNIX has a lot of strengths , but like any other design it 's starting to show its age .
Some of the points listed in this article apply less to some UNIX - like systems , some apply more .
Everything Is a File ( Unless It Isn't )
Everything in a UNIX system is a file .
Well , except things that are n't files , such as sockets .
This is widely regarded as one of the defining points of UNIX .
What is a file in UNIX ?
It 's a collection of bytes .
No type information is encoded , so the only way of understanding the contents of a file is to already know about it .
The file metaphor is becoming increasingly strained in UNIX :
Physical disks are files — these have a fixed size , but you can seek to any point on the disk .
Serial ports are files — these can be read from and written to , but seeking in a serial port has no meaning .
Normal files are also files , and these can be read sequentially or randomly and even increased or reduced in size .
Of course , a program that 's given a filename has no way of knowing what kind of operations are possible on a file , other than to try an operation and see if it fails .
In good UNIX tradition , some of these operations , such as locking an NFS - shared file , will appear to work but silently fail .
The often stated advantage of this paradigm is that you can connect programs to devices and they 'll just work , without being specially designed to interface with the device .
This was almost true at one point .
Writing to a text - only line printer was exactly the same as writing to a text - only terminal or writing to a text file .
Now , however , most people tend to deal in a little more than just plain text .
If I have a program that outputs an image , can I just send that image to a terminal and have it display ?
Can I send it to the printer in the same way ?
Well , if I happen to have an X server that supports the XPrint extension , the answer is maybe .
If I do n't , then I have to send it in X drawing calls to the screen , in PostScript to the printer , and in a serialized byte stream to a file .
Having the same interface for these devices does no good at all when I have to understand the device on the far end — far less good , in fact , than a higher - level abstraction layer would do me .
The law of unintended consequences , often cited but rarely defined , is that actions of people — and especially of government — always have effects that are unanticipated or unintended .
Economists and other social scientists have heeded its power for centuries ; for just as long , politicians and popular opinion have largely ignored it .
The concept of unintended consequences is one of the building blocks of economics .
Adam Smith ’s “ invisible hand , ” the most famous metaphor in social science , is an example of a positive unintended consequence .
Smith maintained that each individual , seeking only his own gain , “ is led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention , ” that end being the public interest .
“ It is not from the benevolence of the butcher , or the baker , that we expect our dinner , ” Smith wrote , “ but from regard to their own self interest . ”
Most often , however , the law of unintended consequences illuminates the perverse unanticipated effects of legislation and regulation .
In 1692 the English philosopher John Locke , a forerunner of modern economists , urged the defeat of a parliamentary bill designed to cut the maximum permissible rate of interest from 6 percent to 4 percent .
Locke argued that instead of benefiting borrowers , as intended , it would hurt them .
People would find ways to circumvent the law , with the costs of circumvention borne by borrowers .
To the extent the law was obeyed , Locke concluded , the chief results would be less available credit and a redistribution of income away from “ widows , orphans and all those who have their estates in money . ”
In the first half of the nineteenth century , the famous French economic journalist Frédéric Bastiat often distinguished in his writing between the “ seen ” and the “ unseen . ”
The seen were the obvious visible consequences of an action or policy .
The unseen were the less obvious , and often unintended , consequences .
In his famous essay “ What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen , ” Bastiat wrote : Bastiat applied his analysis to a wide range of issues , including trade barriers , taxes , and government spending .
The first and most complete analysis of the concept of unintended consequences was done in 1936 by the American sociologist Robert K. Merton .
In an influential article titled “ The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action , ” Merton identified five sources of unanticipated consequences .
The first two — and the most pervasive — were “ ignorance ” and “ error . ”
Merton labeled the third source the “ imperious immediacy of interest . ”
By that he was referring to instances in which someone wants the intended consequence of an action so much that he purposefully chooses to ignore any unintended effects .
( That type of willful ignorance is very different from true ignorance . )
The Food and Drug Administration , for example , creates enormously destructive unintended consequences with its regulation of pharmaceutical drugs .
By requiring that drugs be not only safe but efficacious for a particular use , as it has done since 1962 , the FDA has slowed down by years the introduction of each drug .
An unintended consequence is that many people die or suffer who would have been able to live or thrive .
This consequence , however , has been so well documented that the regulators and legislators now foresee it but accept it .
“ Basic values ” was Merton ’s fourth source of unintended consequences .
The Protestant ethic of hard work and asceticism , he wrote , “ paradoxically leads to its own decline through the accumulation of wealth and possessions . ”
His final case was the “ self - defeating prediction . ”
Here he was referring to the instances when the public prediction of a social development proves false precisely because the prediction changes the course of history .
For example , the warnings earlier in this century that population growth would lead to mass starvation helped spur scientific breakthroughs in agricultural productivity that have since made it unlikely that the gloomy prophecy will come true .
Merton later developed the flip side of this idea , coining the phrase “ the self - fulfilling prophecy . ”
In a footnote to the 1936 article , he vowed to write a book devoted to the history and analysis of unanticipated consequences .
Although Merton worked on the book over the next sixty years , it remained uncompleted when he died in 2003 at age ninety - two .
The law of unintended consequences provides the basis for many criticisms of government programs .
As the critics see it , unintended consequences can add so much to the costs of some programs that they make the programs unwise even if they achieve their stated goals .
For instance , the U.S. government has imposed quotas on imports of steel in order to protect steel companies and steelworkers from lower - priced competition .
The quotas do help steel companies .
But they also make less of the cheap steel available to U.S. automakers .
As a result , the automakers have to pay more for steel than their foreign competitors do .
So a policy that protects one industry from foreign competition makes it harder for another industry to compete with imports .
Similarly , Social Security has helped alleviate poverty among senior citizens .
Many economists argue , however , that it has carried a cost that goes beyond the payroll taxes levied on workers and employers .
Martin Feldstein and others maintain that today ’s workers save less for their old age because they know they will receive Social Security checks when they retire .
If Feldstein and the others are correct , it means that less savings are available , less investment takes place , and the economy and wages grow more slowly than they would without Social Security .
The law of unintended consequences is at work always and everywhere .
People outraged about high prices of plywood in areas devastated by hurricanes , for example , may advocate price controls to keep the prices closer to usual levels .
An unintended consequence is that suppliers of plywood from outside the region , who would have been willing to supply plywood quickly at the higher market price , are less willing to do so at the government - controlled price .
Thus results a shortage of a good where it is badly needed .
Government licensing of electricians , to take another example , keeps the supply of electricians below what it would otherwise be , and thus keeps the price of electricians ’ services higher than otherwise .
One unintended consequence is that people sometimes do their own electrical work , and , occasionally , one of these amateurs is electrocuted .
One final sobering example is the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 .
Afterward , many coastal states enacted laws placing unlimited liability on tanker operators .
As a result , the Royal Dutch / Shell group , one of the world ’s biggest oil companies , began hiring independent ships to deliver oil to the United States instead of using its own forty - six - tanker fleet .
Oil specialists fretted that other reputable shippers would flee as well rather than face such unquantifiable risk , leaving the field to fly - by - night tanker operators with leaky ships and iffy insurance .
Thus , the probability of spills probably increased and the likelihood of collecting damages probably decreased as a consequence of the new laws .

Ungeliebte Evolutionstheorie Florian Rötzer
In den USA sagen mehr als die Hälfte der Menschen , dass Gott die Menschen so geschaffen hat , wie sie jetzt sind , in Deutschland glauben dies bislang nur 12 Prozent
Offenbar wächst die Ablehnung der Evolutionstheorie , zumindest was die Abstammung des Menschen betrifft , egal ob unter Christen oder Muslims ( Gott oder die Evolution ? ) .
Viele können oder wollen sich nicht vorstellen , dass die Menschen und damit natürlich auch sie selber , zufällig und ohne Einwirkung einer höheren
Macht entstanden sind und dass sie ebenfalls ein zufälliges , aber nur vorläufiges Endprodukt darstellen .
Dabei gibt es allerdings Unterschiede .
Nach einer forsa - Umfrage im Herbst 2005 „ stimmten mit der Evolutionstheorie “ immerhin 61 Prozent der Befragten in Deutschland überein .
Über 40 Prozent bezeichneten sich allerdings als konfessionslos .
Aber auch in Deutschland sagen knapp über 25 Prozent , dass sie der Auffassung des Intelligent Design zustimmen , also die Evolutionstheorie ablehnen .
Die konfessionslosen sind hier nur mit 11 Prozent vertreten , Katholiken aber mit 45,7 Prozent und Evangelische mit 37,6 Prozent .
Als Intelligent Design wurde bei der Frage verstanden : „ Das Leben auf der Erde wurde von einem höheren Wesen bzw .
von Gott erschaffen , durchlief aber einen langwierigen Entwicklungsprozess , der von dem höheren Wesen bzw .
von Gott gesteuert wurde . “
Die Anhänger des Kreationismus in Deutschland ( Noch nicht aus dem Vollen geschöpft ) , die der Meinung sind , dass Gott das Leben auf der Erde direkt so erschaffen hat , wie es in der Bibel steht , stellen zwar nur 12 Prozent .
Hier sind die Christen beider Konfessionen , aber auch die Anhänger anderer Religionen anteilsmäßig noch stärker vertreten .
Allerdings stimmten auch 8 Prozent der Konfessionslosen dem Kreationismus zu .
Sie glauben also an den christlichen Gott und die Bibel , sind aber in keiner Kirche .
Bei den Briten sieht es schon anders .
In einer Umfrage zu Beginn des Jahres sprachen sich nur 48 Prozent für die Evolutionstheorie aus .
17 Prozent fanden Intelligent Design sympathischer , mit 22 Prozent halten aber noch mehr die Version der Bibel wortwörtlich für glaubwürdig .
Daher plädieren auch viele dafür , Kreationismus bzw .
Intelligent Design in den Schulunterricht aufzunehmen .
In den USA , im Westen das Land mit einer überwiegend sich zur Religion bekennenden Bevölkerung , ist die Situation gerade umgekehrt .
Hier stellen diejenigen , die der Evolutionstheorie zuneigen und nicht an das Einwirken eines Gottes glauben , gerade einmal 12 Prozent der in einer aktuellen Gallup - Umfrage Befragten .
Dafür lehnen 53 Prozent die Evolutionstheorie ab und sagen , dass der Mensch von Gott so geschaffen wurde , wie er jetzt ist .
Und 31 Prozent halten sich an die mildere Form , dass der Mensch sich zwar entwickelt hat , aber unter Gottes Führung .
Mit 57 Prozent glauben mehr Republikaner als Demokraten ( 44 Prozent ) an die wörtliche Version der Bibel .
Deutlich aber wir auch , dass mit zunehmenden
Alter die Religiosität und die Ablehnung der Evolutionstheorie zunimmt , während sie mit besserer Schul - bzw .
Universitätsausbildung kontinuierlich abnimmt .
Aber auch noch 25 Prozent der Hochschulabgänger neigen der Bibelversion zu .
Allerdings sind diese klaren Abgrenzungen , die solche Umfragen bieten , vermutlich nicht mehr ganz so deutlich , wenn man tiefer bohrt oder mehr Antworten zulässt .
Nach einer Pew - Studie vom September 2005 erscheint die Situation weniger deutlich und kognitiv konfuser .
Lässt man den Befragten ein wenig mehr Spielraum , so entschieden sich bei einer Pew - Umfrage 26 Prozent für eine natürliche Evolution , 42 Prozent für die biblische Version und 18 Prozent für eine Entwicklung unter Steuerung Gottes .
Bei einer anderen Umfrage waren es 33 Prozent für die Evolution und 44 Prozent für die biblische Schöpfung in sechs Tagen .
In einer Gallup - Umfrage vom letzten Jahr , bei der Mehrfachnennungen möglich waren , sagten denn manche auch , dass sie sowohl die Evolutionstheorie ( 55 % ) als auch die biblische Version ( 58 % ) oder die Vorstellung des Intelligent Design ( 31 % ) für wahr halten .
Wie auch immer , der Zweifel ist groß , das Verlangen nach Sinn ebenso .

Alan J. Perlis
What is the Turing tar - pit ?
It ’s the place where a program has become so powerful , so general , that the effort to configure it to solve a specific problem matches or exceeds the effort to start over and write a program that solves the specific problem .
I suffer from a tendancy to go swimming in tar .
I start out trying to solve a specific problem .
I become frustrated with the obvious deficiencies of the tools , and before I know it I ’m sketching out ideas for platforms , frameworks , and architectures to solve a whole class of similar problems .
( This is especially dangerous for programming language designers .
There ’s an irresistable urge to reduce a language to the smallest , most elegant core of axioms . )
I think a programming language should be mostly defined in itself .
A language spec should be divided into two parts , a small core of operators that play the role of axioms , and the rest of the language , which , like theorems , are defined in terms of the axioms .
Paul Graham
The danger of the tar - pit is that instead of developing a solution to a problem , you develop a tool for solving problems .
And invariably , the wider the class of problems the tool can solve , the less useful it is for solving any one problem .
In my own case , I often find myself engaging in “ bottom - up programming , ” trying to invent the perfect programming language for expressing the program I ’m trying to write .
When I find myself working on language syntaxes , I realize I ’m mired in tar and I need to reset .
The Turing tar - pit ’s lure is that it is situated right in the centre of some of the most attractive real - estate in your imagination .
Tools that solve whole classes of problems in generic ways offer the potential for vast improvements is productivity .
Consider VisiCalc : this application actually turned its users into programmers !
In programming , everything we do is a special case of something more general — and often we know it too quickly .
Alan J. Perlis
The very exercise of trying to understand the relationship between the problem you ’re trying to solve and the general class of problems can help you understand your problem in more detail .
And you can get some wonderful Aha ! moments .
So I believe that to do really great work , you must be prepared to skirt very close to the edge of the tar - pit .
Hopefully you have an iron will and can avoid disaster with ease .
In my own case , I have little will and I ’m further hampered by an enormous curiosity .
Out of self defence , I ’ve developed some heuristics for exploring the edges of the tar - pit and mining generalization for insights :
Keep Alan Kay ’s words in mind : “ We aim to make simple things simple and complex things possible . ”
When solving the general problem makes complex things possible , that ’s good .
But it should n’t be at the expense of making simple things simple .
Mentally retrace your steps to the safe safe ground of the problem domain on a frequent basis .
In my own case , I work with fairly disposable user stories .
The important thing I do is return to them every once in a while and ask “ how will this marvellous widget make any of these things easy ? ”
Eat your own dog food / go round trip on an infrequent basis .
Okay , you ’re convinced you need to run your application inside a special purpose virtual machine .
Fine .
Pick one small operation and make it work .
Program for your virtual machine , end to end .
Do n’t skip any of the steps .
It ’s better to go thin ( few functions ) and deep ( use the entire stack ) than to go wide and shallow .
If your VM is a pain in the rump , you ’ve discovered something .
( This is a cornerstone of Ken Schwaber ’s Scrum methodology ) .
Do n’t beat yourself up if you get mired .
If you never produce anything more than an esoteric programming language or tool , you ’ll still have gone where strong minds fear to tread .
Okay , your started out trying to solve problem A and you found yourself solving a general class of problems C that does n’t even include A . Once again , Alan Kay : “ A successful technology creates problems that only it can solve . ”
Do n’t be so sure you have n’t created something really important .
Finish it up , you wo n’t know what you have until you start using it .
Are you quite sure that all those bells and whistles , all those wonderful facilities of your so called powerful programming languages , belong to the solution set rather than the problem set ?
Edsger Dijkstra
Amen .

Project Shamrock
Decades before 9/11 , and the subsequent Bush order that directed the NSA to eavesdrop on every phone call , e-mail message , and who - knows - what - else going into or out of the United States , U.S. citizens included , they did the same thing with telegrams .
It was called Project Shamrock , and anyone who thinks this is new legal and technological terrain should read up on that program .
Project SHAMROCK …was an espionage exercise that involved the accumulation of all telegraphic data entering into or exiting from the United States .
The Armed Forces Security Agency ( AFSA ) and its successor NSA were given direct access to daily microfilm copies of all incoming , outgoing , and transiting telegraphs via the Western Union and its associates RCA and ITT .
Operation Shamrock lasted well into the 1960s when computerized operations ( HARVEST ) made it possible to search for keywords rather than read through all communications .
Project SHAMROCK became so successful that in 1966 the NSA and CIA set up a front company in lower Manhattan ( where the offices of the telegraph companies were located ) under the codename LPMEDLEY .
At the height of Project SHAMROCK , 150,000 messages a month were printed and analyzed by NSA agents .
In May 1975 however , congressional critics began to investigate and expose the program .
As a result , NSA director Lew Allen terminated it .
The testimony of both the representatives from the cable companies and of director Allen at the hearings prompted Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Sen .
Frank Church to conclude that Project SHAMROCK was “ probably the largest government interception program affecting Americans ever undertaken . ”
If you want details , the best place is James Banford ’s books about the NSA : his 1982 book , The Puzzle Palace , and his 2001 book , Body of Secrets .
This quote is from the latter book , page 440 :
Among the reforms to come out of the Church Committee investigation was the creation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , which for the first time outlined what NSA was and was not permitted to do .
The new statute outlawed wholesale , warrantless acquisition of raw telegrams such as had been provided under Shamrock .
It also outlawed the arbitrary compilation of watch list containing the names of Americans .
Under FISA , a secret federal court was set up , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
In order for NSA to target an American citizen or a permanent resident alien–a “ green card ” holder –within the United States , a secret warrant must be obtained from the court .
To get the warrant , NSA officials must show that the person they wish to target is either an agent of a foreign power or involved in espionage or terrorism .
A lot of people are trying to say that it ’s a different world today , and that eavesdropping on a massive scale is not covered under the FISA statute , because it just was n’t possible or anticipated back then .
That ’s a lie .
Project Shamrock began in the 1950s , and ran for about twenty years .
It too had a massive program to eavesdrop on all international telegram communications , including communications to and from American citizens .
It too was to counter a terrorist threat inside the United States .
It too was secret , and illegal .
It is exactly , by name , the sort of program that the FISA process was supposed to get under control .
Twenty years ago , Senator Frank Church warned of the dangers of letting the NSA get involved in domestic intelligence gathering .
He said that the “ potential to violate the privacy of Americans is unmatched by any other intelligence agency . ”
If the resources of the NSA were ever used domestically , “ no American would have any privacy left … .
There would be no place to hide … .
We must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision , so that we never cross over that abyss .
That is an abyss from which there is no return . ”
Bush ’s eavesdropping program was explicitly anticipated in 1978 , and made illegal by FISA .
There might not have been fax machines , or e-mail , or the Internet , but the NSA did the exact same thing with telegrams .
We can decide as a society that we need to revisit FISA .
We can debate the relative merits of police - state surveillance tactics and counterterrorism .
We can discuss the prohibitions against spying on American citizens without a warrant , crossing over that abyss that Church warned us about twenty years ago .
But the president can’t simply decide that the law does n’t apply to him .
This issue is not about terrorism .
It ’s not about intelligence gathering .
It ’s about the executive branch of the United States ignoring a law , passed by the legislative branch and signed by President Jimmy Carter : a law that directs the judicial branch to monitor eavesdropping on Americans in national security investigations .
It ’s not the spying , it ’s the illegality .

Google plans to strengthen its Picasa photo management software and service with the acquisition of Neven Vision , a Santa Monica , California , company specializing in mobile photo search .
Adrian Graham , Picasa product manager , announced the deal in an official Google blog posting today , saying that Neven Vision brings expertise on automatically obtaining information from a photo .
" It could be as simple as detecting whether or not a photo contains a person , or , one day , as complex as recognizing people , places , and objects .
This technology just may make it a lot easier for you to organize and find the photos you care about , " Graham wrote .
Image Recognition
A spokeswoman for Neven Vision confirmed the acquisition has been finalized , but declined to provide details about the deal .
Google did n't immediately reply to a request for comment .
Neven Vision , which also has offices in Japan , Germany , and the U.K. , has developed a suite of image - recognition and facial - analysis tools for mobile devices , according to the company 's Web site , which has since been shut down .
The tools can be used for marketing , e-commerce , search , security and biometric verification purposes .
Google recently retooled its Picasa photo management software , giving users the ability to publish albums to the Web and share them with other people , making Picasa more competitive with rival service Flickr , which is owned by Yahoo and is considered a pioneer in online photo sharing .
On Brain Training
It tells you a lot about both the game industry , and Japan itself .
The game ?
Nintendo's 東北大学未来科学技術共同研究センター川島隆太教授監修 脳を鍛える大人 のＤＳトレーニング .
That 's right !
" Touhokudai Gaku Mirai Kagakugijutsu Kyoudoukenkyuu Center : Kahashima Ryuuta Kyouju no Nou o Kitaeru Otono DS Training " .
Seriously .
You can call it
Brain Training is , basically , an application — one you just happen to play on a handheld videogame system .
In this case , the system is Nintendo 's DS — a quirky , two - screen - with - touchscreen handheld system that 's technically creakier than Sony 's PSP , but which has lived up to its intended purpose of generating innovative new styles of games for a
And what does Brain Training do ?
Well , you hold your Nintendo DS like a book ( with left and right screens ) , and you basically use the touchscreen to undergo a wide variety of simple , cleanly - designed , interesting exercises intended to make you smarter .
Or , at least , keep your brain sharp and fresh and delicious .
At the end of your " fun " , the game eventually calculates and reports your " mental age " —
Sales Madness
It may sound painfully simple , but it 's been unstoppable .
From Dec 26th to January 1st , Brain Training 2 sold 414,556 copies .
In one week .
It has consistently been the number one videogame since its release , and — this is important to remember — it 's not even a videogame .
Has it driven hardware sales ?
In the same period , the Nintendo DS moved 390,181 units .
That 's more units sold than every other hardware system that week — combined .
( Yes , that 's two dramatic ItalicsFacts ! )
Most importantly , though , Brain Training is doing what Nintendo said they would do but nobody really believed them on : opened gaming up to a whole new generation of players .
Seeing grandmothers on the train holding their Nintendo DS like a book sends an instant signal — " brain training in progress " .
How It All Came Together I asked Nobuhiro " Noby " Hasegawa — President and CEO of the monolithic , sprawling Japanese entity known as Panic Japan — to elaborate on what makes it so successful .
Here 's what I learned from him .
1 . There 's an existing brain - training boom in Japan .
Dr. Kawashima , the creator of Brain Training , is leading authority in Japan on brain medicine .
His research shows that :
- The brain becomes weaker every year , just as the body becomes weaker every year
- Effective training is a way to regain body strength
- The brain can also be trained , and can be rejuvenated
- The brain does n't need difficult training : even easy work is effective , like reading a book out loud , simple calculations , etc .
Freaky Polygon Dr.Kawashima Freaky Polygon Dr.Kawashima
On the other hand , when very simple calculations are performed quickly ,
With this research , Dr. Kawashima published a " training manual " for the brain , and it became incredibly popular .
They were usually bought as presents from grandchildren and children for their parents and grandparents .
Is it junk science ?
Is there truth to it ?
I 'd certainly love to know more , but it 's already all the rage .
To quote Noby : " People always want to remain young !
Health and dieting are always interesting .
Now , this is true with the brain as well . "
2 . The Japanese do n't necessarily attach stigmas to " childrens " activities .
In America , most adults do n't read comics , or play videogames .
This is , of course , changing , presumably as my generation grows older and has kids ( bring it , Jack Thompson ! ) , but it 's still basically true .
Games aree children 's activities — not for adults .
Of course , in Japan , manga is hugely popular , and the enduring image of a expensive - suited businessman reading a thick - as - a - baby 's - arm comic book on the way to his desk job is as strong as ever .
Thus , as Noby said , " the sense of resistence of the Japanese adult to Nintendo DS 's Brain Training was little . "
3 . It 's priced really well .
It costs about 2,800 yen in Japan — $ 25 — the same price as two Brain Training textbooks .
So , anyone considering a purchase of the books will likely consider the game .
4. Really , it 's a fiendish trojan horse .
But , the parents will need a Nintendo DS to play , right ?
Will an adult buy one just for Brain Training ?
No , and they do n't need to — their children already own one .
And thus , the true genius of Nintendo 's trojan - horse " Touch Generations " concept is revealed .
Many parents might be reluctant to pick up a game system for their children .
Noby specifically uses the ( somewhat sexist but contextually - correct ) example of " Game System vs. Japanese Mom " , which he puts this way : " A game system is obstructive for cleaning .
The controller is complicated so Mom does n't want to try it .
It gets in the way of the child 's studying .
Etc. "
In order for the game machine to succeed in the household , it 'll basically need the mother 's approval .
The adult only needs to borrow the game system while , say , the child is at school , furiously Brain Training while the child is , presumably , learning themselves .
Before you know it , the game system is something mom uses — every day .
Noby concluded , " I expect that Nintendo developed BRAIN TRAINING as a method for obtaining the video - gaming approval of parents .
And , the attempt seems to have succeeded . "
Nintendo wins , and the industry grows .
Tricky !
What does it all mean ?
The included " Relax Mode " , a.k.a. Dr. Mario
The included " Relax Mode " , a.k.a. Dr. Mario
At first it's hard to imagine something like Brain Training ever hitting the top of the USA video game charts .
Virtually impossible , I 'd wager .
But , if you had told me that " Deer Hunter " would 've become the top - selling computer game a few years ago , I would have pulled the car over and laughed you out of it — and yet , it happened , stunning a whole generation of developers who were working on " Brown Devil Alien Guns III " - style games .
Both successes tell a valuable lesson : there are a lot of people who could play video games , but do n't , because the right software is n't there .
This is also interesting to me because we 've already watched applications slowly becoming more " fun " on the Mac , a testament to simplified design and strong UI .
In fact , the whole iPhilosophy seems to be taking complex tasks and boiling them down to bare but highly enjoyable essentials , creating applications that — yes — anyone can use .
Even creating a DVD in iDVD is now just as much " work " as it is " fun " : setting your goal , trying different themes , experimenting with music , dragging and connecting all of the pieces together , managing available disc space , testing it all out , etc .
With a certain degree of ridiculousness , I 'll say this : iDVD is basically a 2D strategy game without the historical setting .
Brain Training may be the very first app hiding out as a " game " , and the lines , as mentioned , will only blur further .
I like this .
But most importantly , I look forward to picking up Brain Training 's US release .
Even if it does n't catch on like wildfire , I look forward to training the hell out of my brain .
I secretly hope it will grow to kick other brain - asses .
As you read this , a fairly significant revolution in the videogame industry is taking place in Japan .
A quirky " game " is gaussian - blurring the line between games and applications , old and young , fun and utility , gamer and non-gamer — and you might be surprised by the results .
It tells you a lot about both the game industry , and Japan itself .
The game ?

The brain does n't need difficult training : even easy work is effective , like reading a book out loud , simple calculations , etc.
Hooking humans up to some presumably expensive and freakish brain - scanning equipment , Dr. Kawashima did some interesting tests .
When a brain is simply " thinking " , presumably about chocolate chips and where cat hair goes , it generates this much activity .
When a very difficult expression is being worked out .
looks something like this .
Not a lot going on , really .
On the other hand , when very simple calculations are performed quickly , the brain lights up like a drunk at a drunk convention .
It also shows lots of activity when sentences are simply read aloud .
With this research , Dr. Kawashima published a " training manual " for the brain , and it became incredibly popular .

The controller is complicated so Mom does n't want to try it .
It gets in the way of the child 's studying .
Etc. "
In order for the game machine to succeed in the household , it 'll basically need the mother 's approval .
The adult only needs to borrow the game system while , say , the child is at school , furiously Brain Training while the child is , presumably , learning themselves .
Before you know it , the game system is something mom uses — every day .
Noby concluded , " I expect that Nintendo developed BRAIN TRAINING as a method for obtaining the video - gaming approval of parents .
And , the attempt seems to have succeeded .
" Nintendo wins , and the industry grows .
Tricky !
So , the # 1 game in Japan is a non-game .
My ( shocking ) conclusion : there is a huge market for new styles of games and new game players , and the gap between " games " and " apps " is getting smaller .
At first it's hard to imagine something like Brain Training ever hitting the top of the USA video game charts .
Virtually impossible , I 'd wager .
But , if you had told me that " Deer Hunter " would 've become the top - selling computer game a few years ago , I would have pulled the car over and laughed you out of it — and yet , it happened , stunning a whole generation of developers who were working on " Brown Devil Alien Guns III " - style games .
Both successes tell a valuable lesson : there are a lot of people who could play video games , but do n't , because the right software is n't there .
This is also interesting to me because we 've already watched applications slowly becoming more " fun " on the Mac , a testament to simplified design and strong UI .
In fact , the whole iPhilosophy seems to be taking complex tasks and boiling them down to bare but highly enjoyable essentials , creating applications that — yes — anyone can use .
Even creating a DVD in iDVD is now just as much " work " as it is " fun " : setting your goal , trying different themes , experimenting with music , dragging and connecting all of the pieces together , managing available disc space , testing it all out , etc .
With a certain degree of ridiculousness , I 'll say this : iDVD is basically a 2D strategy game without the historical setting .
Brain
Training may be the very first app hiding out as a " game " , and the lines , as mentioned , will only blur further .
I like this .
But most importantly , I look forward to picking up Brain Training 's US release .
Even if it does n't catch on like wildfire , I look forward to training the hell out of my brain .
I secretly hope it will grow to kick other brain - asses .

JOHN HALPERN clearly remembers what made him change his mind about psychedelic drugs .
It was the early 1990s and the young medical student at a hospital in Brooklyn , New York , was getting frustrated that he could not do more to help the alcoholics and addicts in his care .
He sounded off to an older psychiatrist , who mentioned that LSD and related drugs had once been considered promising treatments for addiction .
“ I was so fascinated that I did all this research , ” Halpern recalls .
“ I was reading all these papers from the 60s and going , whoa , wait a minute !
How come nobody ’s talking about this ? ”
More than a decade later , Halpern is now an associate director of substance abuse research at Harvard University ’s McLean Hospital and is at the forefront of a revival of research into psychedelic medicine .
He recently received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to give late - stage cancer patients the psychedelic drug MDMA , also known as ecstasy .
He is also laying the groundwork for testing LSD as a treatment for dreaded super - migraines known as cluster headaches .
And Halpern is not alone .
Clinical trials of psychedelic drugs are planned or under way at numerous centres around the world for conditions ranging from anxiety to alcoholism .
It may not be long before doctors are legally prescribing hallucinogens for the first time in decades .
“ There are medicines here that have been overlooked , that are fundamentally valuable , ” says Halpern .
These developments are a remarkable turnaround .
Scientists first became interested in psychedelic drugs – also called hallucinogens because of their profound effect on perception – after Albert Hofmann , a chemist working …
Google is really trying to put the beating on Internet Explorer by advertising Firefox on the Google homepage .
This is the first time that Google has ever promoted a third - party program on their homepage .
Also , you will only see the advertisement if you are using Internet Explorer and you are located in the United States .
Ever since Google started to support Firefox I was wondering when they were going to start and push users to switch to Firefox .
This will definitely get Firefox some more publicity … and I wonder how many people will download Firefox each day from this subtle promotion ?
Any ideas ?
Keep in mind that that Google ’s homepage gets approximately 91 million page views in one day .

The cult of overwork is the prevailing belief that the more hours people work , the better for the company .
That notion is not only harmful , it is dead wrong , as this story from Arlie Hochschild ’s book The Time Bind demonstrates .
One executive , Doug Strain , the vice chairman of ESI , a computer company in Portland Oregon , saw the link between reduced hours for some and more jobs for others .
At a 1990 focus group for CEOs and managers , he volunteered the following story :
When demand for a product is down , normally a company fires some people and makes the rest work twice as hard .
So we put it to a vote of everyone in the plant .
We asked them what they wanted to do : layoffs for some workers or thirty - two - hour workweeks for everyone .
They thought about it and decided they ’d rather hold the team together .
So we went down to a thirty - two - hour - a - week schedule for everyone furing a down time .
We took everybody ’s hours and salary down – executives too .
But Strain discovered two surprises .
First , productivity did not decline .
I swear to God we get as much out of them at thirty - two hours as we did at forty .
So it ’s not a bad business decision .
But second , when economic conditions improved , we offered them one hundred percent time again .
No one wanted to go back !
Never in our wildest dreams would our managers have designed a four - day week .
But it ’s endured at the insistence of our employees .
I want to get an MBA .
And before you reader 's out there rip me a new asshole :
Yes , I know that 99 % of MBAs out there are useless and pretentious douchebags .
MBAs never shut up about " value - adds " and " push - backs " and " managing expectations . "
MBAs always laughingly tell you about how they " ca n't stand Cambridge " because of the terrible time they had at HBS ( Harvard Business School ) .
Every time an MBA opens his mouth , I have to suppress the instinct to immediately club him like a baby seal .
There are some advantages to having an MBA .
MBAs on average ( at least from a good school ) make 170 % of the salary they made before getting their MBA .
Also , you get a nice diploma you can hang on the wall of your office and make your parents proud !
But I could n't really care less about those reasons : I fully expect never to have to work again after this startup , and I already have a degree from a school with a name that Asian parents drool about ( and that degree says " with distinction " bitches ! ) .
The reason I want to go to business school is that business school is a fucking joke .
B - school is basically like college , except as far as I can tell , the work is n't as important , and there 's less of it .
The real point of business school is to go to all the social events and make friends with other future rich ass business people .
And by " go to all the social events " of course I mean " go to all the social events and get wasted . "
I have a friend at a top rated business school .
My co-founder and I went to a happy hour at the bschool this afternoon .
The happy hour was basically 300 people in a room getting drunk .
What the hell am I doing at a startup ???
I should have gone to bschool .
( If this post is a little disordered , a little rambling , and not very funny , its because I had a few beers at said happy hour , and am not my usual charming , intelligent self . )
Jan. 6 , 2006  --
Americans bought an estimated $ 125 billion worth of consumer electronics -- computers , monitors , cell phones , televisions -- this past year .
With hundreds of millions of them becoming obsolete every year in this country , what happens to all the stuff we do n't want any more ?
Some of us just hang on to it , or pass it on as hand - me - downs to friends or family .
And some of us donate our old tech gadgets and computers to charity .
But the hard truth is that your old clunker of a computer may be more of a burden than a blessing to many charities .
" I 've tried to give the equipment to the Salvation Army -- they do n't take it anymore , " one man told " 20/20 . "
The reality is much of the stuff ends up in the garbage .
E - Waste Is Hazardous Waste
But there 's a dirty little secret piling up with those electronics thrown into the garbage .
This " e- waste " is tainted with hazardous contaminants .
The average computer monitor contains more than five pounds of lead .
Computers can also contain mercury and cadmium .
When you multiply that by the millions of outdated computers and monitors , you 've got lots of toxins that you do n't want to put back into the earth .
It 's environmentally unsafe for individuals to just throw out computers and monitors , but federal law prohibits businesses from doing it .
Businesses usually pay electronic recyclers to haul away the old equipment and pull it apart , and if it 's done right , pretty much everything can be reused .
Unfortunately , it 's not always done right .
That 's dirty little secret No. 2 : Some recyclers may not be recycling everything .
Actually , some experts say most recyclers are n't recycling everything .
" Eighty percent of all the scrap electronics in the United States end up offshore and usually in Third World countries , " said Bob Glavin of Chicago , who runs one of the biggest recycling plants in the country .
" I honestly believe there 's a secret brotherhood that ships this stuff over there late at night when no one 's watching , because none of our competitors do it , but it 's all over there , " he said .
Waste Dumped Abroad Is Rarely Recyclable or Reusable
Glavin and his son used to export some of their scrap to China , until they went there and saw for themselves what happened to it .
" There was no environmental regulations .
There 's no safety regulations .
There 's no data security , because it 's not being recycled over there .
It 's being dumped over there , " he said .
" We do n't send our trash to China .
Why should we send the electronic trash to China ? " his son , Jim added .
Jim Puckett , coordinator of a group called Basel Action Network , which monitors exports of hazardous waste , also saw what was happening in China firsthand .
Three years ago he documented it in a video called " Exporting Harm . "
" What we witnessed was these former farmers cooking circuit boards over little wok - type operations over little coal fires and melting the chips so they could pull them off .
These chips would then go to acid strippers using very dangerous acids , dumping all the waste from the process into the river , and that acid process was to extract the tiny bit of gold that was in those chips .
It was quite a cyber - age nightmare , " he said .
Much of this stuff came from the United States , yet U.S. authorities did nothing .
Frustrated , Puckett 's group released a second report this past year , this time from Nigeria , where they found the same thing .
" Everywhere there 's space -- empty lots , swampy areas -- they 'll throw the cathode - ray tubes , the computer carcasses , the plastic housings and routinely set them ablaze , " Puckett said .
Puckett says his group saw dusty warehouses piled high with computers and components exported from the United States and Europe , supposedly bought for Nigerians to fix and use .
According to Puckett , however , " About 75 percent of what they were receiving was not repairable , not usable and was simply dumped and burned in the landfills of Africa . "
That 's what 's happening to many of the old computers we get rid of .
They 're sent overseas .
We 're simply exporting a huge environmental problem .
" The recyclers that are shipping over there certainly know what 's going on , and it 's good business , " said Lauren Roman , an electronics recycler and an expert on the hazardous chemicals found in household electronics .
Still , some recycling brokers " 20/20 " talked to insisted that sending the machines abroad helped get computers into the hands of societies that need them .
Roman disagrees with that .
She said lots of companies should call themselves waste exporters instead of recyclers .
And she showed " 20/20 " just how easy it is to pass yourself off as a responsible recycler .
You can simply print out a certificate declaring yourself an Environmental Protection Agency - certified recycler .
It 's that simple , according to Roman , " because there 's no such thing , but you can claim it because most of the recyclers out there are . "
Personal Data Often Remains on Discarded Computers
And there 's one more thing you should worry about when you throw out your old computer .
Call it dirty little secret No. 3 . And this one affects you very personally .
Everything that 's been on your computer 's hard drive -- unless you know how to wipe it clean -- is still there .
And it will be there if you donate it to charity , or give it to a friend , or throw it out or recycle it .
When Puckett 's group was in Nigeria , they bought hard drives that they discovered had a wealth of private information on them .
" One of these hard drives had documents from the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family services , another from the World Bank .
So even if you are not concerned about the environment , you should be concerned about your very , very private data , " he said .
But there are some solutions to the mounting e-waste problem .
Let 's start with hard drives .
One good way to trash your hard drive is literally to trash your hard drive .
Smash it by taking a hammer to it .
There are also less barbaric ways , especially if you want someone else to be able to use it .
There are programs you can buy or download that will truly get rid of everything .
The growing recycling problem is a bit more complicated .
Roman and other advocates say we should do with computers and television monitors and fax machines what we do with soda pop bottles or cans :
Pay a fee up front that is returnable to you when you get rid of your electronics properly .
Roman says Europe is far ahead of the United States in this regard .
Indeed , in Europe it is the manufacturers who are responsible for taking back and properly recycling old computers .
Here 's the bottom line :
Now that you know you can't -- or at least you should n't -- ignore this problem , do n't throw out your computers .
Look into participating in -- or starting a community - based electronics recycling drive .
Not one but two Register readers emailed us to tell us that MSN's Virtual Earth is promoting a world free of the menace of Apple Computers .
If you 've got time on your hands - stand up Jens and Stefan - have a look at Apple 's Cupertino headquarters from Google and MSN 's rival map sites .
Both sites offer aerial photos alongside maps .
MSN 's version is here and Google 's is here .
See the difference ?
Google shows the Apple Cupertino HQ - a lovely , shiny building probably full of iPods .
MSN on the other hand shows an apparently empty field .
Not as much as a black turtle - necked jumper remains of Apple 's headquarters .
This could be no more than an old picture taken before Cupertino was built or a glimpse of an imagined future .
How this terrible error came about is not yet clear .
Nor can we be certain who else has been removed from Bill 's upgraded planet .
Reg reader Michael Sage pointed out that zooming in on the UK will reveal towns like Norwich and Lowestoft long before little old London appears .
Is London next to be removed ?
We need to know .
Even more disturbing MSN's Virtual Earth still shows the twin towers of the World Trade Center in all their pre-9/11 glory .
No comment from Microsoft HQ as yet but we 'll keep you posted . ®

But the mysterious discovery of an alien in his attic has spooked the 54 - year - old screenwriter and bewildered extraterrestrial experts , who yesterday suggested the US military could be involved .
The delicate 30 cm ( 12 inch ) figure of a baby alien is stored in a pungent liquid and has a US serial number painted on its four - toed foot .
Possibly sculpted from a clay - like substance and painted grey , the model closely resembles the aliens depicted in a hoax film of an autopsy of the infamous " Roswell incident " .
Curiously , the alien was discovered stored in an old toffee jar wrapped in a copy of the Daily Mirror dating from October 1947 .
In July of that year , officials at the American air base of Roswell reported and then denied finding the remains of a flying saucer .
The Roswell incident sparked a popular fascination with UFOs and led the US air force to collect data on sightings .
One theory is that the alien was left in the loft by a US serviceman working at a nearby US air base .
Mr Broom 's two - bedroom cottage at Gunthorpe , north Norfolk , which he bought eight months ago , is 45 miles from two large US air bases at RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall .
Many US servicemen and women live and work in the region .
Mr Broom told the Guardian he was " a bit spooked " by the discovery but said he was not yet living in fear of being beamed up by aliens .
" It was stuffed in the corner of the loft with other old newspapers .
Before me , an old spinster lived in the house .
I do n't think anybody had been up there for years .
I have n't got three heads and I 'm not the sort of eccentric lunatic to think it 's an alien but it's a funny thing to find in your loft . "
Mr Broom reported his finding to the Sci Fi Channel , who called in Professor Adam Roberts , an expert in science fiction literature , to examine the creature .
" The easy thing to do is dismiss it all and say it 's a hoax .
It may be or may not be , " said Prof Roberts .
" The fact that it was found near a US air base suggests there may be a military component to it . "
A spokeswoman for the US air force said it had never made such models of an alien , the figure was not government property and the serial number could mean it had been catalogued by a museum .
" It 's a hoax , " the spokeswoman said .
Prof Roberts admitted it could be a film prop dating from the 1960s , but said he was not surprised at US denials : " That is the US air force line .
They deny these alien encounters .
It is quite possible they concoct stories to cover up for more nefarious activities . "
The Sci Fi Channel will this week broadcast live footage of the alien on its website .
After further tests , Mr Broom will put it on his mantelpiece .
It has always gotten my goat that Internet Explorer ’s non-standard use of the object tag has forced standards - loving browsers to use the non-standard embed tag in order to embed movies on a web page .
Even on Apple ’s site , the embed tag — a Netscape extension , for Pete ’s sake !— is so entrenched that it ’s hard to even find information about using the object element for QuickTime , except in a non-standard way .
Article Continues Below
The use of embed has gone on too long .
Wishing for it to become part of the official specs is like wishing your partner would start putting the cap on the toothpaste .
It ’s not going to happen .
It ’s time to move on .
If you want to validate your website , you have to get rid of embed .
In this article , I ’ll show you how .
Online Movies : Google Video and YouTube#section2
ALA readers will remember Drew McLellan ’s seminal article on Flash Satay .
In that article , Drew described a method for inserting Flash animations on a page without using the embed element .
Flash Satay has two parts .
First , Drew figured out that you can use a single object element to call Flash as long as you specify its type adequately .
Second , to properly stream Flash movies , you have to embed a sort of reference movie .
I ’ve been experimenting with Drew ’s code on Google Video and YouTube content .
I was shocked to find that Google Video suggests you use only the embed tag to embed their video on Web pages .
Alas , not shocked that they would suggest such a thing — just shocked that it actually works on Internet Explorer , which stopped supporting the non-standard , but universally - supported embed tag years ago in favor of its proprietary implementation of the standard object tag that renders that tag completely invisible to standards - loving browsers .
It turns out that IE supports embed as long as the visitor has the appropriate player already installed .
If not , they get an error and a generic broken - plugin icon , but no help .
YouTube , for its part , does the often seen but hardly standard twice cooked approach , offering both the object and embed tags .
Since both Google Video and YouTube serve movies through the Flash player — regardless of your movie ’s format when you uploaded it — you can use Drew ’s single object method to embed such movies on your page .
Indeed , you do n’t have to use the Satay part of his code ; movies on Google Video and YouTube stream even without the reference movie he suggests .

My real peeve , however , as I mentioned above , is n’t with Flash movies — which I have little experience with — but with QuickTime and Windows Media Player movies .
I ’ve been trying to embed these in a standard way for years , but without much luck .
Quite recently , I came upon the MIME type that will let you use a single object for Windows Media Player files ( .wmv ) .
I still ca n’t quite believe it .
Eureka !
One object for Windows Media Player #section3
I am a firm believer in paying attention to mistakes .
It ’s only when I notice that I ’ve done something wrong , and figure out why , that I am able to figure out new ways of doing things right .
As I was reviewing the technique , I noticed that although it did work well for QuickTime movies ( as described below ) , it did n’t work for Windows Media Player movies …on Opera …for Windows .
I suppressed the urge to ignore it , and as I dug for an answer to that problem , I came across the MIME type that will let you use a single object to embed Windows Media Player files : video / x - ms - wmv .
To embed a Windows Media Player file , you should be able to use this code ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< object type =" video/x-ms-wmv " data= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » fishstore.wmv " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " autostart " value = " true " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> </object >
But it turns out that IE6 and IE7 and Safari ( strange bedfellows if ever there were ) , all need a little extra push , in the form of an extra param element :
< object type =" video/x-ms-wmv " data= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » fishstore.wmv " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » fishstore.wmv " /> < param name = " autostart " value = " true " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> </object >
And it works .
Personally , I consider this pretty experimental , or at the very least sacrilegious … embedding a Windows Media Player movie without a classid !
( What ’s next ?
Valid documents with no DOCTYPE ? )
I tested this simple example in IE5.5 , IE6 , IE7 , Opera Win / Mac , Firefox Win / Mac , and Safari and it worked just fine .
That said , I do n’t do a lot of scripting or Microsoft stuff , so your mileage may vary .
( Note : Of course , there are many more param elements that you may wish to use . )
Embedding QuickTime movies without embed #section4
Unfortunately , I ’m still pretty sure there ’s no type that would convince IE to open a QuickTime movie without an ActiveX control .
The obvious choices , type =" video/ quicktime " or even type =" application / x- quicktime " , only work on standards - loving browsers .
So I went a different route .
Some basic premises #section5
This technique is based on a couple of premises :
First , the object element is designed to be nested in order to help browsers degrade gracefully .
If a browser ca n’t display the outermost object , it should try the next one and then the next one until it finds one it can handle .
Once it does find an object it can deal with , it is supposed to ignore the rest .

If a browser ca n’t display the outermost , it should try the next one and then the next one until it finds one it can handle .
Once it does find an it can deal with , it is supposed to ignore the rest .
Second , most major browsers fully support the object element .
The big exception is ( surprise ) Internet Explorer .
IE6 displays all object elements it can deal with — even if they ’re nested — as well as rather ugly , ghostly apparitions of the ones it can’t .
Thankfully , IE7 does n’t do the ghosts , but it unfortunately does n’t favor the nested objects if there ’s a problem with the outer object .
It just gives you an error .

It just gives you an error .
Third , Internet Explorer ( up to and including version 7 ) implements the object element in a non-standard way that makes other browsers ignore it .
I think the answer can be found in IE ’s system of conditional comments .
I started hearing about it when folks were trying to decide how to deal with IE7 ’s new approximation to CSS .
And while IE ’s commenting is peculiar to IE ( read : proprietary ) , so is its failure to properly use the object element .
It ’s a perfect match .
Embedding QuickTime for Internet Explorer#section6
I ’m going to use QuickTime for my example , but you can use the same technique with Windows Media Player movies with the classid attribute , as I ’ll show you a bit farther along .
To insert a basic QuickTime movie in Internet Explorer , we ’ll use something like this ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< object classid=" clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80 » - D3488ABDDC6B " codebase = " http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab " width = " 320 " height = " 256 " > < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> </object >
Do n’t forget the height or the width or that horrendous classid which calls the QuickTime ActiveX control .
Note that the param element that specifies the URI of the movie has a name attribute of “ src , ” not “ url ” or “ movie . ”
You can preview the effect here .
In IE , you ’ll see a movie , in other browsers you wo n’t see a thing .
Embedding QuickTime movies for everyone else#section7
Although standards - loving browsers can’t deal with that object since the classid attribute is that awful number instead of a URL , they will keep looking to see if there ’s any nested objects they can deal with .
So , just before the closing < / object > tag , we ’ll use a standard implementation of the object element ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< object classid=" clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80- » D3488ABDDC6B " codebase = " http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab " width = " 320 " height = " 256 " > < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> < object type=" video/quicktime " data= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " width = " 320 " height = " 256 " > < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> </object > </object >
The width and height are required , as is the type .
If you view this combination in a standards - loving browser , it looks great , if a bit loud .
IE 6 ( and earlier ) , as we mentioned before , ca n’t quite decide what to do with the second object and basically botches it with a ghostly apparition .
What IE ca n’t see , it ca n’t mess up #section8
Although IE ’s conditional comments were designed to be used for the rather questionable purpose of serving it special code that is hidden from other browsers , we ’ll use them here to hide code from IE but not from other browsers .
( It ’s a bit of a slap in the face — though not really that surprising — that Microsoft has the nerve to refer to these other browsers as “ downlevel ” . )
Comments written with Microsoft ’s “ original syntax ” do n’t validate ( surprise ) but thankfully , Lachlan Hunt figured out a way to adjust them so that they do .
So we need to hide the second object from IE with its own commenting system .
Insert <!--[ if !IE ] >--> in front of the second < object > tag and <!--<![ endif ] --> right after the first closing < / object > tag .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< object classid=" clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80- » D3488ABDDC6B " codebase = " http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " src " value= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> <!--[ if !IE ] >--> < object type=" video/quicktime " data= " http://www.sarahsnotecards.com/catalunyalive/ » diables.mov " width = " 320 " height = " 260 " > < param name = " autoplay " value= " false " /> < param name= " controller " value = " true " /> </object > <!--<![ endif ] --> </object >
Now it ’s beautiful !
What ’s more you can use the whole collection of parameters with the object element as described on Apple ’s Developers site .
Next time , I ’ll test with a slightly less raucous movie .
The details for Windows Media Player #section9
If you ’d rather embed Windows Media Player files with the classid and not in the one - object method I demonstrate near the beginning of this article , the code is only slightly different .
For the classid in the initial object tag , use classid= " CLSID :6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153-00C04F79FAA6 " .
To specify the URL of your Windows Media Player movie , use a param element with a name attribute equal to “ url ” for most browsers and then repeat the value using a name attribute equal to “ src ” for Safari .

A small wrinkle , or , what ’s left to do#section10
As of January 2006 , Apple started promoting the use of JavaScript to call movies for web pages so that users would n’t have to click on ActiveX controls in order to activate them .
It ’s a long , convoluted story that began with a lawsuit against Microsoft and ended up making life difficult for the rest of us .
At any rate , the methods described above work almost perfectly without any JavaScript at all , with one caveat : QuickTime movies wo n’t autoplay in IE .
I ’m not sure I ’d even want the example video to autoplay !
Nevertheless , I find it highly suspicious that Windows Media Player files load in the background and autoplay without any interaction while QuickTime movies show just the initial frame while the audio plays , but no moving pictures are shown .
At any rate , I want to see how the activating ActiveX controls issue plays out before I implement what I consider a rather laborious JavaScript solution to my whole site .
I use very little JavaScript and like to keep it that way .
Whether you go the JavaScript route or not is actually irrelevant to the article at hand .
Either way , you can still eschew the embed tag for the standard object element .
I would have liked to figure out a way to hide the inner objects only from IE 6 and earlier , since IE 7 ( at least in beta 2 ) seems to be handling nested object elements properly , but I was unsuccessful .
While there is a conditional comment that would allow such a thing ( <!--[ if gte IE 7 ] >--> ) , the extra characters ( --> ) that Lachlan offered to make the thing validate are visible with IE7 ( as they should be logically ) .
Any ideas ?
On the shoulders of giants # section11
Other people have also worked on this problem .
This article agreed that two nested object elements should work but relied on what I consider rather complicated CSS to hide the second object .
Ian Hickson used the IE comments to hide a second object from IE that had Flash content .
And the aforementioned Lachlan Hunt figured out how to write valid Internet Explorer conditional comments that hide content from IE while revealing it to other browsers .
Debunking 8 Anti-War Myths About The Conflict In Iraq
1 ) George Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . :
This is a charge that has been repeated ad nauseum by opponents of the war , but the claim that Bush “ lied ” about stockpiles of WMDs does n’t hold up to the least bit of scrutiny .
Once you understand one crucial fact , that : numerous prominent Democrats with access to intelligence data also openly declared and obviously believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , it becomes nearly impossible for a rational person to believe that Bush lied about WMDs in Iraq .
We ’re not talking about small fry or just proponents of the war either .
The aforementioned Democrats include Bill Clinton , Hillary Clinton , Al Gore , John Kerry , John Edwards , Robert Byrd , Henry Waxman , Tom Daschle , and Nancy Pelosi among many , many others .
Just to hammer the point home , here ’s a quote from the 800 pound gorilla of the Democratic Party , Hillary Clinton , that was made on Oct 8 , 2002 :
“ In the four years since the inspectors left , intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock , his missile delivery capability , and his nuclear program .
He has also given aid , comfort , and sanctuary to terrorists , including Al Qaeda members , though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11 , 2001 .
It is clear , however , that if left unchecked , Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare , and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons .
Should he succeed in that endeavor , he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East , which as we know all too well affects American security . ”
Trending : The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet
To believe that George Bush lied about WMDs is to believe that there is a vast conspiracy to lie about WMDs that goes to the highest level of both parties & that stretches across both the pro and anti-war movements .
It ’s just not possible — and that ’s before we even consider the numerous other pieces of exculpating evidence like : all the non-American intelligence agencies that also believed Saddam had WMDs , CIA Director George Tenet famously saying it was a : “ ‘ slam - dunk ’ that Hussein possessed the banned weapons ” , the once secret : Downing Street Memo : which certainly proves that our allies in Britain believed Saddam had WMDs …
“ For instance , what were the consequences , if Saddam used WMD on day one , or if Baghdad did not collapse and urban warfighting began ?
You said that Saddam could also use his WMD on Kuwait .
Or on Israel , added the Defence Secretary . ”
… and of course , that we did find : warheads designed to carry chemical warfare agents : and artillery shells filled with : mustard gas : & : sarin : ( even though they were small in number and were n’t recently made ) .
When you add it all up , it appears that George Bush , like a lot of other people , was wrong about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of WMDs .
But without question , he did not lie about it .
2 ) A study released in March of 2003 by a British medical journal , the Lancet , showed that 100,000 civilians had been killed as a result of the US invasion .
To be perfectly frank , it ’s hard to see how anyone who has even a passing familiarity with statistics could take Lancet ’s numbers seriously . : Fred Kaplanfrom
Slate explains :
“ The authors of a peer - reviewed study , conducted by a survey team from Johns Hopkins University , claim that about 100,000 Iraqi civilians have died as a result of the war .
Yet a close look at the actual study , published online today by the British medical journal the Lancet , reveals that this number is so loose as to be meaningless .
The report ’s authors derive this figure by estimating how many Iraqis died in a 14 - month period before the U.S. invasion , conducting surveys on how many died in a similar period after the invasion began ( more on those surveys later ) , and subtracting the difference .
That difference ’the number of “ extra ” deaths in the post - invasion period ’signifies the war ’s toll .
That number is 98,000 .
But read the passage that cites the calculation more fully :
We estimate there were 98,000 extra deaths ( 95 % CI 8000 - 194 000 ) during the post - war period .
Readers who are accustomed to perusing statistical documents know what the set of numbers in the parentheses means .
For the other 99.9 percent of you , I ’ll spell it out in plain English ’ which , disturbingly , the study never does .
It means that the authors are 95 percent confident that the war - caused deaths totaled some number between 8,000 and 194,000 .
( The number cited in plain language ’98,000 ’is roughly at the halfway point in this absurdly vast range . )
This is n’t an estimate .
It ’s a dart board .
Imagine reading a poll reporting that George W. Bush will win somewhere between 4 percent and 96 percent of the votes in this Tuesday ’s election .
You would say that this is a useless poll and that something must have gone terribly wrong with the sampling .
The same is true of the Lancet article :
It ’s a useless study ; something went terribly wrong with the sampling . ”
Bingo !
What Lancet was in effect saying was that they believed 98,000 civilians died , but they might have been off by roughly 90,000 people or so in either direction .
Moreover , other sources at the time were coming in with numbers that were a tiny fraction of the 98,000 figure that the Lancet settled on .
From a : New York Times : article on the Lancet study :
“ The 100,000 estimate immediately came under attack .
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain questioned the methodology of the study and compared it with an Iraq Health Ministry figure that put civilian fatalities at less than 4,000 .
Other critics referred to the findings of the Iraq Body Count project , which has constructed a database of war - related civilian deaths from verified news media reports or official sources like hospitals and morgues .
That database recently placed civilian deaths somewhere between 14,429 and 16,579 , the range arising largely from uncertainty about whether some victims were civilians or insurgents .
But because of its stringent conditions for including deaths in the database , the project has quite explicitly said , ” Our own total is certain to be an underestimate . ”
Via : GlobalSecurity.org , here ’s another Iraqi civilian death estimate :
“ On 20 October 2003 the Project on Defense Alternatives estimated that between 10,800 and 15,100 Iraqis were killed in the war .
Of these , between 3,200 and 4,300 were noncombatants — that is : civilians who did not take up arms . ”
Given all that , how any informed person can buy into Lancet ’s numbers is simply beyond me .
3 ) The Bush Administration claimed Iraq was responsible for 9/11 . :
It ’s always difficult to prove a negative , but that simply never happened .
Many people may believe this was the case because in “ Fahrenheit 9/11 , ” Michael Moore truncated a comment by Condi Rice in order to deliberately give viewers of his movie that false impression .
Here ’s the quote as it appeared in the film :
“ There is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9/11 ”
Now here ’s the full quote :
“ Oh , indeed there is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9/11 .
It ’s not that Saddam Hussein was somehow himself and his regime involved in 9/11 , but , if you think about what caused 9/11 , it is the rise of ideologies of hatred that lead people to drive airplanes into buildings in New York . ”
Setting aside Moore ’s little deceit , there just are n’t any quotations I ’ve ever seen from anyone in the Bush administration saying that Saddam was responsible for 9/11 .
That ’s why , in a piece called “ Answering 50 Frequently Asked Questions About The War On Terrorism , ” which incidentally was written about a week before the war began , I wrote this :
The Bush administration has never claimed that Iraq was involved in 9/11 …
Furthermore , after the war had begun , in September of 2003 , : President Bush himself publicly & explicitly said :
“ We have no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with the 11 September attacks . ”
It does n’t get much clearer than that .
4 ) The war in Iraq was actually planned by people like Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and Paul Wolfowitz back in 1998 at a think tank called the Project for the New American Century . :
The problem with trying to claim that the war in Iraq was preordained during some 1998 PNAC meeting is that the United States government has been trying to find a way to get rid of Saddam Hussein since the Gulf War .
In an interview I did with him back in January of 2004 , : David Frum , went into detail on this subject :
“ The idea that overthrowing Saddam Hussein sprung out of the minds of a few people in Washington forgets an awful lot of history .
In the 2000 election , both candidates spoke openly about the need to deal with Saddam Hussein .
Al Gore was actually more emphatic on the topic than George Bush was .
In 1998 , Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act .
Just to show how conspiratorial they were , they put it in the Congressional record .
In 1995 , the CIA tried to organize a coup against Saddam Hussein and it failed .
The coup was secret , but it has been written about in 5 or 6 books that I know of .
In 1991 , representatives of President George H. W. Bush went on the radio and urged the Iraqi people to rise up against Saddam Hussein .
So America ’s policy on Saddam has been consistent .
What we have been arguing about for years are the methods .
First , we tried to encourage a rebellion in Iraq , that did n’t work .
Then we tried coups ; that did n’t work .
Then in 1998 , we tried funding Iraqi opposition .
That might have worked , but the money never actually got appropriated .
Then , ultimately we tried direct military power .
The idea that Saddam should go has been the policy of the United States since 1991 . ”
The reality is just as Frum pointed out : overthrowing Saddam Hussein by hook or crook was the de facto policy of the US government for more than a decade before the war in Iraq and the disagreement was over how to do it .
That argument was settled in many people ’s minds by 9/11 , not by people conspiring in a think tank back in 1998 .
5 ) The war on terror has nothing to do with Iraq . :
This is another historical rewrite .
The reality is that the pro-war movement in this country since 9/11 has plainly spoken of dealing with Saddam Hussein as part of the war on terrorism almost from the very beginning .
Here ’s George Bush in a : speech given on 9/20/2001 :
“ Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes .
Americans should not expect one battle , but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen .
It may include dramatic strikes visible on TV and covert operations secret even in success .
We will starve terrorists of funding , turn them one against another , drive them from place to place until there is no refuge or no rest .
And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism .
Every nation in every region now has a decision to make :
Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists .
From this day forward , any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime . ”
Iraq certainly was a state that harbored and supported terrorists and the approach Bush discussed , the Bush Doctrine , was adopted and talked about often in relation to Iraq during the lead up to the war .
As proof , look to a column called “ Answering 50 Frequently Asked Questions About The War On Terrorism ” that I wrote back on March 13 , 2003 :
Why are we going to invade Iraq ? :
Nine days after 9/11 , George Bush said , “ ( W )e will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism .
Every nation in every region now has a decision to make Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists .
From this day forward , any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime . ”
That definition fits Iraq and since they happened to be the easiest nation to make a case against at the UN and in the court of World Opinion , they were our next logical target after Afghanistan — although they ’re not our last target . ”
The war on terrorism cannot be won as long as there are terrorist supporting states out there .
So one way or the other , we need to get those rogue regimes out of the business of supporting terrorist groups of international reach .
Saddam led one of those regimes and now , happily , he ’s gone — perhaps before the US was hit with an Iraqi based terrorist attack :
“ I can confirm that after the events of September 11 , 2001 , and up to the military operation in Iraq , Russian special services and Russian intelligence several times received … information that official organs of Saddam ’s regime were preparing terrorist acts on the territory of the United States and beyond its borders , at U.S. military and civilian locations . ” — Russian President Vladimir Putin as quoted by CNN on June 18 , 2004
Even : John Kerry , the flip - flopping Democratic candidate for President last year , seemed to at least agree that the fate of Iraq was crucial to the war on terror :
“ Iraq may not be the war on terror itself , but it is critical to the outcome of the war on terror , and therefore any advance in Iraq is an advance forward in that and I disagree with the Governor [ Howard Dean ] . ” — John Kerry , 12/15/03
Kerry even pointed out that he thought Saddam might give WMDs to terrorists :
“ I would disagree with John McCain that it ’s the actual weapons of mass destruction he may use against us , it ’s what he may do in another invasion of Kuwait or in a miscalculation about the Kurds or a miscalculation about Iran or particularly Israel .
Those are the things that – that I think present the greatest danger .
He may even miscalculate and slide these weapons off to terrorist groups to invite them to be a surrogate to use them against the United States .
It ’s the miscalculation that poses the greatest threat . ” — John Kerry , “ Face The Nation ” , 9/15/02
Now if even John Kerry of all people is willing to admit that Iraq is : “ critical to the outcome of the war on terror ” : and that Saddam was the kind of guy who might use terrorist groups to attack the US , we should be able to at least agree at this point that it ’s not the least bit disingenuous to suggest that Iraq is an important part of the war on terrorism .
6 ) Saddam Hussein had no ties to terrorism . :
It ’s amazing to me that today in 2005 , people are still trotting out that oft - disproven quip .
Christopher Hitchens was also apparently surprised when Ron Reagan , Jr. made a similar assertion recently and you may find his : response to be most enlightening :
“ CH : : Do you know nothing about the subject at all ?
Do you wonder how Mr. Zarqawi got there under the rule of Saddam Hussein ?
Have you ever heard of Abu Nidal ?
RR : : Well , I ’m following the lead of the 9/11 Commission , which …
CH : : Have you ever heard of Abu Nidal , the most wanted man in the world , who was sheltered in Baghdad ?
The man who pushed Leon Klinghoffer off the boat , was sheltered by Saddam Hussein .
The man who blew up the World Trade Center in 1993 was sheltered by Saddam Hussein , and you have the nerve to say that terrorism is caused by resisting it ?
And by deposing governments that endorse it ? …
At this stage , after what happened in London yesterday ? …
RR : : Zarqawi is not an envoy of Saddam Hussein , either .
CH : : Excuse me .
When I went to interview Abu Nidal , then the most wanted terrorist in the world , in Baghdad , he was operating out of an Iraqi government office .
He was an arm of the Iraqi State , while being the most wanted man in the world .
The same is true of the shelter and safe house offered by the Iraqi government , to the murderers of Leon Klinghoffer , and to Mr. Yassin , who mixed the chemicals for the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 .
How can you know so little about this , and be occupying a chair at the time that you do ? ”
Mr. Hitchens is entirely correct .
Saddam provided “ safe haven ” for : terrorists with “ global reach . ” :
Among them were terrormaster Abu Nidal , Abdul Rahman Yassin , one of the conspirators in the 1993 WTC bombing , “ Khala Khadr al - Salahat , the man who reputedly made the bomb for the Libyans that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over … Scotland , ” Abu Abbas , mastermind of the October 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking and murder of Leon Klinghoffer , ” & “ Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , formerly the director of an al Qaeda training base in Afghanistan ” who is now believed to be leading Al - Qaeda ’s forces in Iraq .
Without question , Saddam Hussein had extensive ties to terrorism .
7 ) Saddam Hussein had no ties to Al - Qaeda . :
A couple of quotes by the 9/11 Commission , which were often used out of context during the polarizing 2004 election cycle , have fueled the ridiculous claim that Saddam Hussein had no ties with Al - Qaeda .
Here ’s an excerpt from an article at : MSNBC : called : “ 9/11 panel sees no link between Iraq , al - Qaida , ” : that should give you a good idea of the anti-war spin that was put on the Commission ’s comments :
“ It said that reports of subsequent contacts between Iraq and al - Qaida after bin Laden had returned to Afghanistan ‘ do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship , ’ and added that two unidentified senior bin Laden associates “ have adamantly denied that any ties existed between al - Qaida and Iraq .
” The report , the 15th released by the commission staff , concluded , ‘ We have no credible evidence that Iraq and al - Qaida cooperated on attacks against the United States . ’
However , the spin does n’t match the reality .
What the 9/11 Commission was trying to get across was that there was no evidence that Saddam and Al - Qaeda collaborated on specific attacks , not that they did n’t have a working relationship . : 9/11 Commission Vice - Chairman ( and former Democratic Congressman ) Lee Hamiliton : echoed exactly that point in comments that were largely ignored because they did n’t fit the anti-war storyline some people were pushing :
“ The vice president is saying , I think , that there were connections between Al Qaeda and the Saddam Hussein government .
We do n’t disagree with that .
What we have said is what the governor ( Commission Chairman Thomas Kean ) just said , we do n’t have any evidence of a cooperative , or a corroborative , relationship between Saddam Hussein ’s government and these Al Qaeda operatives with regard to the attacks on the United States . ”
While there may not be evidence that Saddam and Al - Qaeda cooperated in attacks on the United States , the evidence that Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq and Al - Qaeda worked together is absolutely undeniable .
For example , no one disputes that Abu Musab al Zarqawi , who once ran an Al - Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan and is leading Al - Qaeda terrorist attacks in Iraq today , was in Iraq BEFORE the war started getting medical care .
In and of itself , that would seem to strongly suggest a significant connection .
But wait , there ’s more !
Consider this comment by former : CIA Director George Tenet : in a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee on October 7 , 2002 :
“ Credible reporting states that al Qaeda leaders sought contacts in Iraq who could help them acquire WMD capabilities .
The reporting also stated that Iraq has provided training to al Qaeda members in the areas of poisons and gases and making conventional bombs . ”
Here ’s more from : Richard Miniter , author of “ Losing Bin Laden : How Bill Clinton ’s Failures Unleashed Global Terror “ :
* Abdul Rahman Yasin was the only member of the al Qaeda cell that detonated the 1993 World Trade Center bomb to remain at large in the Clinton years .
He fled to Iraq .
U.S. forces recently discovered a cache of documents in Tikrit , Saddam ’s hometown , that show that Iraq gave Mr. Yasin both a house and monthly salary . *
Bin Laden met at least eight times with officers of Iraq ’s Special Security Organization , a secret police agency run by Saddam ’s son Qusay , and met with officials from Saddam ’s mukhabarat , its external intelligence service , according to intelligence made public by Secretary of State Colin Powell , who was speaking before the United Nations Security Council on February 6 , 2003 .
*
In 1998 , Abbas al - Janabi , a longtime aide to Saddam ’s son Uday , defected to the West .
At the time , he repeatedly told reporters that there was a direct connection between Iraq and al Qaeda .
* Mohamed Mansour Shahab , a smuggler hired by Iraq to transport weapons to bin Laden in Afghanistan , was arrested by anti-Hussein Kurdish forces in May , 2000 .
He later told his story to American intelligence and a reporter for the New Yorker magazine .
Here ’s more from Weekly Standard columnist Stephen Hayes , author of “ The Connection : How al Qaeda ’s Collaboration with Saddam Hussein Has Endangered America “ :
“ Evan Bayh , Democrat from Indiana , has described the Iraq -al Qaeda connection as a relationship of “ mutual exploitation . ”
Joe Lieberman said , “ There are extensive contacts between Saddam Hussein ’s government and al Qaeda . ” George Tenet , too , has spoken of those contacts and goes further , claiming Iraqi “ training ” of al Qaeda terrorists on WMDs and provision of “ safe haven ” for al Qaeda in Baghdad .
Richard Clarke once said the U.S. government was “ sure ” Iraq had provided a chemical - weapons precursor to an al Qaeda - linked pharmaceutical plant in Sudan .
Even Hillary Clinton cited the Iraq -al Qaeda connection as one reason she voted for the Iraq War . ”
So is there proof that Saddam Hussein and Al - Qaeda worked together to hit targets in the US ?
No .
But , is there extensive evidence that they had ties and worked together at times ?
Absolutely .
8 ) The Downing Street Memo proves Bush lied to the American people about the war . :
The left - side of the blogosphere has been bleating ceaselessly about the Downing Street Memo since the beginning of May which might lead you to wonder why the reaction to the memo has been so tepid in the scandal loving mainstream media .
Well , the problem with the DSM is that there ’s no “ there , there . ”
Some of the anti-war crowd ’s rantings about the memo have hinged on its acknowledgement of increased bombings in the Iraqi no - fly zones ( “ spikes of activity ” ) during the run-up to the war .
However , the increased frequency of bombings was common knowledge even back in 2002 ( See : here , : here , & : here ) .
We had already been bombing the Iraqis in the no-fly zone and we increased the pace to soften them up a bit just in case we had to go in .
It probably saved the lives of some of our soldiers and almost no one except members of Saddam ’s government seemed upset about it while it was actually going on .
So why should it be a big deal now in 2005 ?
The carping about it at this point is pure political gamesmanship .
Moving on to another jejune point in the memos that has led to hyperventilation among Bush foes , take a look at this line :
“ C reported on his recent talks in Washington .
There was a perceptible shift in attitude .
Military action was now seen as inevitable . ”
Note that no particular person in the Bush administration said war is “ inevitable , ” it ’s just the perception that C , AKA Sir Richard Dearlove , has .
Again , we ’re talking about something that was common knowledge back in July of 2002 , as even liberal : Michael Kinsley : pointed out in a notably unenthusiastic LA Times column about the DSM :
“ Just look at what was in the newspapers on July 23 , 2002 , and the day before .
Left - wing Los Angeles Times columnist Robert Scheer casually referred to the coming war as “ much planned for . ”
The New York Times reported Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ’s response to a story that “ reported preliminary planning on ways the United States might attack Iraq to topple President Saddam Hussein . ”
Rumsfeld effectively confirmed the report by announcing an investigation of the leak .
A Wall Street Journal Op - Ed declared that “ the drums of war beat louder . ”
A dispatch from Turkey in the New York Times even used the same word , “ inevitable , ” to describe the thinking in Ankara about the thinking in Washington about the decision “ to topple President Saddam Hussein of Iraq by force . ”
Why , it almost sounds as if many people who were n’t passing around secret documents saw the invasion of Iraq as “ inevitable , ” even back then !
I guess those “ secret ” memos are n’t as as chock full of sensitive information as you ’d think .
But , let ’s move on to the meat of the DSM .
Via : Wikipedia , here is the part of the Downing Street Memo that has caused the most “ excitement ” on the left :
Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy .
The NSC had no patience with the UN route , and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime ’s record .
There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action .
Basically the charge here is supposed to be that Bush “ fixed ” the evidence for the war .
When the word “ fixed ” is mentioned in the memo , it ’s obviously not being used as Americans would use it if they were talking about “ fixing ” a horse race .
Instead , the writer was trying to get across that the Bush administration was attempting to build a solid case to justify its policy publicly .
That ’s certainly not a unique way of looking at it either .
For example , : John Ware , a reporter at the very liberal BBC , seems to have roughly the same interpretation :
“ Several well placed sources have told us that Sir Richard Dearlove was minuted as saying : “ The facts and the intelligence were being fixed round the policy by the Bush administration . ”
By ‘ fixed ’ the MI6 chief meant that the Americans were trawling for evidence to reinforce their claim that Saddam was a threat . ”
Furthermore , to even try to interpret the Downing Street Memo as supporting the idea that Bush was making up evidence — presumably about weapons of mass destruction — is extremely difficult to square with the fact that the DSM itself makes it absolutely clear that the British believed Saddam had WMDs .
From theDSM :
“ For instance , what were the consequences , if Saddam used WMD on day one , or if Baghdad did not collapse and urban warfighting began ?
You said that Saddam could also use his WMD on Kuwait .
Or on Israel , added the Defence Secretary . ”
If the Bush administration and the Brits believed Saddam had WMDs and was capable of using them , what exactly is supposed to have been forged ?
Nothing of course , because that ’s not how the person taking the notes meant it to be interpreted .
If he ’d known his notes were ever going to be read by the public , I ’m sure he would have been more careful about ambiguous phrasing that could be willfully misinterpreted for political gain .
On top of all that , there have already been investigations that have cleared the Bush administration of doing anything shady on the intelligence front .
As Cassandra at : Villainous Company : correctly pointed out :
Quote ( the DSM ) all you want .
Is there some evidence to back this up ?
Say , to refute the conclusions of the Butler Report ( British ) , the Senate Select Intelligence Committee , or the 9/11 Commission , which all concluded that there was no improper manipulation of intelligence ?
Or are we now willing to disregard the conclusions of three official inquiries on the strength of one ( word in an ) unattributed set of minutes from a single foreign staff meeting ? ”
The Downing Street Memo is a lot of hullabaloo over nothing of note .
What do you get when you mix a hippie with Andre 3000 in the desert ?

今日は、emacs で Rails でのコーディングをする上での tips を紹介します 。
その名も grep - gems コマンドです 。
これを実行することで、/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/
以下のディレクトリに対して再帰的に grep を実行します。
私はメソッドの定義や、テストプログラムでのそのメソッドの使われ方を調べるときによく利用しています。
正直言って、現在でも Ruby On Rails ではかなり多くのメソッドは、まだ、充分にドキュメントが整備されているとはいえない状況です。
そのため、今でもソースを読み込むことが自分がやりたいことが可能かどうかを調査する一番優れた方法となってしまっています。Rails
のソースを全文検索することはどうしても必要不可欠な作業です。
しかしながら、繰り返し行っていると、生産性が落ちます。DRY
の原則にも反します。だいたい単純に面倒です。というわけで、せっかく emacs を使っているのだから、M-x grep や
M-x grep - find をベースにして gems ディレクトリ以下を全文検索するように再定義したのが grep - gems 関数です 。
関数の定義は次のとおりです。
( defun grep - gems ( command - args ) ( interactive ( progn ( unless grep - find - command ( grep - compute - defaults ) ) ( list ( read - from - minibuffer " Run find ( like this ) : " grep - find - command nil nil ' grep - find - history ) ) ) ) ( cd " /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems / " ) ( let ( ( null - device nil ) ) ; see grep ( grep command - args ) ) )
見てもらえればすぐに分かるとおり、emacs で標準に添付されている grep - find コマンドをカレントディレクトリを変更してから実行しているだけです。
これを .emacs に書いておけば 、M-x grep - gems と実行するだけで gems ディレクトリを全文検索できます 。
President George W. Bush has faced surprisingly little serious opposition while taking the U.S. down an international primrose path .
The Left was divided on his mad adventure in Iraq , with most leading Democrats , including 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry and potential 2008 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton backing the administration .
Many of those who opposed Bush appeared to do so for partisan or even personal reasons .
Rather than take his case for war seriously and refute it , they fulminated about Halliburton , rehashed the 2000 election controversy , and offered nonexistent alternatives .
Few were able to explain why Bush ’s proposed attack on a genuine human monster who had sought WMD was not in America ’s national interest .
Most liberal critics , such as general and then presidential candidate Wesley Clark , remained unapologetic supporters of President Bill Clinton ’s joyride in Kosovo  a place with less strategic value , a killing field with far fewer bodies , a dictator with dramatically less threatening ambitions , and an attack with as little international legal sanction .
In short , it was impossible to take the Left seriously during the Iraq debate , even though they were far closer to being correct than were conservatives , most of whom genuflected as the president charted his disastrous course .
Unfortunately , little has changed three and a half years after the invasion .
The Left remains depressingly clueless about global strategy even as administration policy has gone from bad to worse .
Yes , liberals have noticed that the president and his senior aides are uniformly arrogant and incompetent .
The Left points out how dissembling , name - calling , and demagoguery are the administration ’s trademark responses to any problem or setback .
Democrats highlight the fantasy world within which President Bush appears to make policy .
But what is the Left ’s view of world events ?
More important , what do liberals think our foreign policy should be ?
For most of them , whether they supported or opposed intervening in Iraq , it is Clinton administration redux : moralistic and promiscuous foreign intervention , preferably multilateral rather than unilateral .
Many liberals , and especially Democratic politicians , are no less disciples of Woodrow Wilson than are President Bush and the neoconservative coterie surrounding him .
In short , they want to ignite war around the globe in the name of promoting democracy , only do so competently and under the United Nations flag .
Thankfully , some on the Left recognize the problem of resting the case against Iraq on the unique failings of the bunglers currently running U.S. policy .
For instance , Sam Rosenfeld and Matthew Yglesias forthrightly challenge liberal hawks who now criticize the administration only for its ineptitude .
Write Rosenfeld and Yglesias :
" Though defending the competence of the Bush administration is a fool ’s endeavor , administrative bungling is simply not the root source of America ’s failure in Iraq .
The alternative scenarios liberal hawks retrospectively envision for a successful administration of the war reflect blithe assumptions  about the capabilities of the U.S. military and the prospects for nation building in polities wracked by civil conflict  that would be shattered by a few minutes of Googling .
" The incompetence critique is , in short , a dodge  a way for liberal hawks to acknowledge the obviously grim reality of the war without rethinking any of the premises that led them to support it in the first place .
In part , the dodge helps protect its exponents from personal embarrassment .
But it also serves a more important , and dangerous , function .
Liberal hawks see themselves as defenders of the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention  such as the Clinton - era military campaigns in Haiti and the Balkans  and as advocates for the role of idealism and values in foreign policy .
The dodgers believe that to reject the idea of the Iraq War is , necessarily , to embrace either isolationism or , even worse , in their world view , realism . "
But focusing on the arguments of liberals who originally backed the war is a mistake .
The Rosenfeld - Yglesias criticism applies no less trenchantly to leftists who opposed the war not out of principle , but because of their doubts about President Bush .
Had President Bill Clinton decided in 1999 to initiate regime change in Iraq rather than occupy a section of Serbia , most of Bush ’s liberal critics would have cheered themselves hoarse , using arguments that sounded eerily close to those advanced by the neoconservatives four years later .
In fact , the desperate attempt by liberal notables to distinguish their program of promiscuous intervention from the Bush program of promiscuous intervention demonstrates how little difference there really is between the two perspectives .
For example , The New Republic ‘s Peter Beinart has authored a new book seeking to recreate “ Truman ’s anti-totalitarian liberalism . ”
Beinart endorses the Kosovo bombing as “ a multilateral war ” to prevent “ ethnic cleansing . ”
He wants the anti-totalitarian campaign he supports to be based on “ international institutions and international law . ”
When she was secretary of state , Madeleine Albright talked endlessly about the lessons of Munich , sounding like the many Bush administration officials who ca n’t make a statement or speech about any foreign policy topic without denouncing “ appeasement . ”
Her inability to tell the difference between Adolf Hitler and Slobodan Milosevic mirrors the neoconservative inability to tell the difference between Hitler and the series of petty dictators whom they want to oust .
Still , she is critical of the Bush administration  while blathering about “ realistic idealism ” and continued “ support ” for democracy abroad , as if that were a real alternative to the GOP ’s policy .
Robert Wright of the New American Foundation suggests “ progressive realism . ”
Washington should promote the nation ’s interest but , conveniently , the national interest incorporates traditional liberal concerns , warranting continuing intervention abroad  perhaps even more intervention than that pressed by neocon armchair warriors .
For instance , Wright contends that “ the slaughter in Darfur , though a humanitarian crisis , is also a security issue . ”
So full speed ahead on another war , apparently .
Then there is Michael Signer of the Truman National Security Project , who offers something called “ exemplarism . ”
What foreign conflict would he avoid ?
None .
It would be even more important to act in Sudan , while exemplarism would , with an “ emphatic yes , ” have justified forcibly ousting Saddam Hussein .
What ’s the difference from neocon Wilsonianism ?
“ Exemplarism would have required American policymakers to weigh more seriously unilateralism ’s impact on our standing in the global community , ” Signer writes .
Wow , some limit on counterproductive warmongering .
More recently , Shadi Hamid argues in two essays in The American Prospect for “ a foreign policy that puts democracy promotion at its center as the only way to secure our strategic interests , stay true to our ideals , and keep America safe . ”
He might as well be working at the American Enterprise Institute , writing for The Weekly Standard , and advising the Bush administration .
Well , no , he likes the UN .
Hamid wants “ to reclaim the democratic idealism of the neoconservative movement while wedding it to a more multilateral framework that recognizes the importance of alliances and international institutions . ”
In short , this is the multilateral rather than the incompetence dodge .
Bomb other nations and kill other peoples in order to transform the international system , but do so only with an acceptable multilateral patina .
Although Hamid makes the welcome admission that “ democracy cannot be imposed at gunpoint , ” he apparently wants to point a gun along with offering aid and utilizing diplomatic pressure .
He approvingly cites Signer and Wright , who have developed new theories to justify military intervention .
And , writes Hamid , “ we made a mistake in invading Iraq the way we did , ” not “ we made a mistake in invading Iraq . ”
Moreover , he argues , “ the cause of Iraqi democracy remains a just one that deserves  rather , demands  the international community ’s participation , ” whatever that means .
Thankfully , some on the Left have taken up the challenge of developing a less interventionist liberal philosophy .
Spencer Ackerman of The New Republic criticizes Hamid : “ The idea of democratic failure  the idea that democracy in certain conditions cannot meet social expectations , leading to its collapse  never occurs to him , despite three and a half years of the Iraq War . ”
Ackerman advocates emphasizing human rights rather than democracy , and continues to back U.S. intervention in the Balkans in the name of fighting genocide , which he views as warranting the use of military force .
Although it ’s hard to take the latter argument seriously , he does see Iraq more clearly .
Ackerman explains :
" For all its tough - minded posturing , this [ Hamid ’s argument ] is doughfaced liberalism at its worst : the implicit assumption that good intentions excuse actual , real - world consequences .
To take the example of Iraq , the rise of democracy is directly correlative with marauding death squads .
Among the most powerful figures in democratic Iraq is Moqtada al - Sadr , whose followers serve in parliament , run ministries , and slaughter men in barber shops for insufficient beard growth . "
Whatever this is , Ackerman realizes that it is not liberalism .
He offers a telling challenge to the Left : “ The Bush administration has taken both the United States and the world into catastrophe  fetishizing instability today in the messianic promise of a democratic tomorrow .
Liberals of all people should not be buying into the same illusion while promising to do it better . ”
Ackerman is moving in the right direction , though he still is not there .
More promising is the attempt by Anatol Lieven on the Left to join with John Hulsman on the Right on behalf of a philosophy that they label “ ethical realism . ”
Building a foreign policy for a free and virtuous people is challenging .
Even if everyone everywhere were free and virtuous , there would sometimes be sharp differences between peoples , nations , and cultures .
With many unfree states , and many evil people , the difficulties grow .
But the starting point should be that the U.S. government ’s primary responsibility is to the American people .
That is n’t because the lives of Americans are more important than those of others .
It is because the government represents Americans , is funded and defended by them , and is entrusted with the protection of their lives .
Moreover , it is they who are directly responsible for their government ’s actions .
Washington ’s duty to act responsibly extends to those in uniform .
They have joined freely , yes , but nevertheless their lives should not be forfeit absent a compelling interest involving their own political community .
Policymakers should not take advantage of their patriotism for secondary or tertiary goals .
Thus , Washington should act to protect and promote U.S. interests .
Such a perspective typically characterizes the “ realist ” school , but there are variants of “ realism . ”
To focus on advancing American objectives does not mean doing everything for anything .
It means recognizing that the U.S. has a range of objectives and a range of tools to advance those interests .
The means used should be thoughtfully calibrated with the ends sought .
That is , for numerous minor goals  economic advancement , political advantage , modest security gain  diplomatic efforts and other small steps are appropriate .
For more important questions , the U.S. can employ greater pressure : high - level government contacts , foreign aid payments , trade penalties , and more .
Where issues are more vital , Washington can , and sometimes must , do more , including economic sanctions , military threats , and war .
But such cases are not common and such steps are not for the faint - hearted .
Coercion should be reserved for truly serious and , in the case of military action , vital interests .
That is , when America ’s territorial integrity , basic liberties , constitutional system , and economic prosperity are at risk .
Obviously , the term " vital interest " is not self - defining , and advocates of intervention tend to treat almost anything , no matter how peripheral to America , as “ vital ” in order to justify proposals to bomb more countries and kill more people .
However , it usually is evident when something is largely irrelevant or critically important .
One can legitimately disagree over degree , not kind .
Although the U.S. should focus on protecting American interests , in doing so Washington should be constrained by moral principles .
That is , the U.S. is not entitled to wage aggressive war to lower energy prices , prop up foreign dictators to improve the local investment climate , invade socialist nations to prevent nationalization of corporate assets , train authoritarian security forces to ensure the survival of a U.S. - friendly regime , and so on .
Not every means is appropriate even for legitimate ends .
For the same reason , Washington should take into account the interests of other people around the globe .
The U.S. government is accountable to the American polity but should be cognizant of larger principles of justice and morality .
Thus , genuine transnational environmental problems may warrant international cooperation ( but not UN diktats ) even if there is a cost to America .
The U.S. should take a principled approach to free trade , even if some domestic industries suffer .
Although most foreign aid can best be provided privately , Washington has a unique capacity , particularly the military , to respond quickly to humanitarian crises , such as the 2004 Asian tsunami .
Advancing democracy and human rights also is an important interest because the U.S. is part of a global human community .
However , though a valid objective , it should not be the driving principle behind American foreign policy .
That is , Washington should focus on advancing U.S. goals , while looking for opportunities to better the life of others around the world .
Thus , Washington should not stand against democratic movements merely because a new regime might be less friendly to American interests .
At the same time , the U.S. should not recklessly explode existing political systems in an abstract devotion to democracy , especially where the result might be murder and mayhem , jihadist revolution , and / or frenetic anti-Americanism .
Certainly Iraq has destroyed the illusion that military action can create a liberal democracy where the underlying civil society and culture have not yet developed .
The toughest humanitarian case is genocide , but even there aggressive war is hard to justify .
First , one can rarely intervene easily and can almost never leave easily .
Virtually all wars turn out unexpectedly and cost far more than originally projected .
Colin Powell ’s “ Pottery Barn ” rule usually applies : you break it and you own it .
A consistent policy of “ examplarism ” or “ progressive realism ” or “ democracy promotion ” as advocated by today ’s liberal thinkers would logically have the U.S. occupying Sudan , Congo , Rwanda , and Sri Lanka as well as Afghanistan , the Balkans , and Iraq , and who knows where else .
Second , supposedly humanitarian intervention often has anti-humanitarian results .
It is ironic that liberals hold up Kosovo as a success .
After the victory of America and its allies , the ethnic Albanian majority drove out a quarter of a million Serbs , Jews , Roma , and non-Albanian Muslims .
It was the second or third largest bout of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans , and it occurred on America ’s and Europe ’s watch .
Third , U.S. servicemen and women have enlisted to defend America , not patrol the globe .
It is easy for armchair warriors to risk the lives of others , but American troops are morally responsible only to protect those inside their own political community .
Moreover , Iraq alone has greatly strained the American military .
A policy of genuine humanitarian intervention , inserting U.S. forces in a half - dozen foreign hellholes , would wreck the military : how many 18 - year - olds would enlist to garrison an expansive foreign empire , however benevolently justified ?
Fourth , war is the gift that keeps on giving .
An expansive interventionist policy and constant war require a large military , big budgets , government secrecy , restrictions on civil liberties , and the other attributes of the national security state .
Promiscuous intervention , humanitarian or otherwise , is anathema to the maintenance of a republic based on limited government and individual liberty .
Then there is terrorism .
Although there are many reasons why the U.S. is hated and feared around the world , only one factor explains why some of those who hate and fear America are willing to go to great efforts , including sacrificing their lives , to kill Americans .
And that is the perception that the U.S. already is at war with them , that Washington is killing Muslims , backing Israel as it occupies and attacks Arab lands , and supporting compliant Muslim overlords in Arab nations .
To recognize that Islamic jihadists have grievances neither endorses their perspective nor justifies their murderous activities .
But it explains why they do what they do .
The problem of terrorism is not Disneyland or the Bill of Rights or MTV .
The problem is America ’s interventionist foreign policy , which creates enemies at every turn .
The consequences will be the same for liberal intervention as for neoconservative intervention .
The Bush administration was supposed to return “ the adults ” to run U.S. foreign policy .
Alas , the result has been catastrophic .
Instead of a policy of mature restraint , the Bush team has leavened arrogance with ignorance and incompetence .
But the principal problem is principle : using war and the threat of war to advance peripheral and sometimes frivolous objectives , usually objectives which cannot be achieved through coercion .
Liberals must do more than rename neoconservative policies .
They must develop a foreign policy that advocates doing less as well as doing it better .
