For decades , paleoartists have told the story of human evolution through sculpture and drawing .
Now their tools have evolved , too .
Computers allow a level of detail and control that is n't possible with other media .
Their creations can come closer than ever to bringing our ancestors to life .
" What 's driven my work has always been , ' I want to see that thing alive .
I want to see that world , " said paleoartist Viktor Deak , who provided the reconstructions used in the Becoming Human documentaries , which aired in November on PBS .
" Computer graphics is developing to the point where , in movies like " Benjamin Button , " you do n't know what parts are not digital . "
Deak still begins his reconstructions in traditional fashion , sculpting bodies from clay .
Like other paleoartists , he does n't know what his fossil interpretation will look like when complete , but comes to an understanding of anatomic nuances , of tissue and muscle thickness and how it might have linked to ancient bone , while working with his hands in three dimensions .
Once he 's done , he converts the work to digital format .
For a 78 - foot - long mural now traveling with Lucy 's Legacy , a touring exhibition featuring the famous 3.2 million year old fossils , he photographed his sculptures and imported them to Photoshop .
There he added hundreds of layers of texture and light , tweaking them for maximum combinatorial realism .
That was the old way .
For Becoming Human , he worked with ZBrush , a 3 - D modeling program that lets him work with the sculpture in even greater detail .
" The nuances of the skin , the way light scatters underneath it , they figured all that out , " he said of the program 's naturalism .
" There 's no limitation on what you can do , as long as your machine can handle it . "
He poses his sculptures in desired position , then renders it with different materials and lighting .
The renderings are then sent to Photoshop , layered and tweaked for maximum realism .
" They look realer to me , " said Deak .
" For a couple seconds , people might say , ' What 's that a photo of ?
Where 'd you get that picture ?
There 's that moment of belief when they 're not looking at it as a painting or sculpture , but as a living thing . "
" He does wonderful stuff , " said Rick Potts , curator of anthropology at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History .
Potts described the digital transition as something that many artists have greeted reluctantly if at all , but is necessary .
" I 'm excited about it , because it means you 're not just dealing with static appearance , " he said .
" One of the great challenges of science communication is taking dead , dusty things we find in the ground , and helping people understand that these were part of a living world .
Our ancestors were living and dying , just as we do .
Bringing things to life in the digital world can really help . "
The ultimate form of resurrection is as animation , which was done in Becoming Human by mapping Deak 's models onto the motion recordings of suited human actors .
But no human can ever move quite like a creature with a different skeleton , and relying on other people to realize his ideas of how ancient hominids moved adds an extra layer of separation .
" Learning animation is my goal right now .
That would cross out any ambiguity between the science and the final depiction of it .
Once I get the software down , then I can do the whole thing and create the vision of human evolution I have banging around in my brain , " said Deak .
Of course , whatever the tool , the task is still poised at what Potts called " the edge of science and art . "
Even for scientists , fossils are heavily interpreted —
Lucy , the most complete ancient hominid skeleton , is only 40 percent complete — and Deak immerses himself in the field 's literature , taking in every new find and revision .
" I 'm an anthropologist who happens to do art .
I do n't write that well and would get bored doing 30 - page papers on mandible synthesis , " said Deak .
" In my mind I have a tree of skulls that I 'm always repositioning and thinking about .
As much thinking and analysis as possible goes into each work .
I 've taken it upon myself to be a voice for these fossils . "

Today we'd like to share with the web community information about SPDY , pronounced " SPeeDY " , an early - stage research project that is part of our effort to make the web faster .
SPDY is at its core an application - layer protocol for transporting content over the web .
It is designed specifically for minimizing latency through features such as multiplexed streams , request prioritization and HTTP header compression .
We started working on SPDY while exploring ways to optimize the way browsers and servers communicate .
Today , web clients and servers speak HTTP .
HTTP is an elegantly simple protocol that emerged as a web standard in 1996 after a series of experiments .
HTTP has served the web incredibly well .
We want to continue building on the web 's tradition of experimentation and optimization , to further support the evolution of websites and browsers .
So over the last few months , a few of us here at Google have been experimenting with new ways for web browsers and servers to speak to each other , resulting in a prototype web server and Google Chrome client with SPDY support .
So far we have only tested SPDY in lab conditions .
The initial results are very encouraging : when we download the top 25 websites over simulated home network connections , we see a significant improvement in performance - pages loaded up to 55 % faster .
There is still a lot of work we need to do to evaluate the performance of SPDY in real - world conditions .
However , we believe that we have reached the stage where our small team could benefit from the active participation , feedback and assistance of the web community .
For those of you who would like to learn more and hopefully contribute to our experiment , we invite you to review our early stage documentation , look at our current code and provide feedback through the Chromium Google Group

Timothy Geithner told members of the Joint Economic Committee , ' We are working to put TARP out of its misery , and no one will be happier than I am to see that program terminated . '
Dems fight over funds left from bailout
Congressional Democrats could be careening toward a head - on collision with the White House over $ 200 billion in leftover bailout money — money that Republicans think should simply be returned to taxpayers .
The Treasury Department is pushing for fiscal prudence and wants to use the money to pay down the deficit and keep a small rainy - day fund in case of economic catastrophe .

But Democrats are salivating over the possibility of $ 200 billion in unspent money .
House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Larson of Connecticut wants dough to fund job - creation legislation .
Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank , the powerful chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , wants to direct $ 2 billion of repaid Troubled Asset Relief Program funds to loans for unemployed homeowners so they can avoid foreclosure .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California admits that “ there ’s a good bit of interest ” in spreading the money around to various economic projects .
And Senate Democrats want to put a big chunk — say , $ 40 billion — toward loans to small businesses .
Republicans , who regret ever voting for the $ 700 billion bailout in the first place , are moving in for the kill , convinced that a deficit - weary nation would thank them for pulling the plug on the great bank bailout of 2008 .
“ We do n’t need it anymore , and the American people never liked it .
Let ’s just do away with it , ” Rep. Michael Burgess ( R - Texas ) told Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner during a hearing Thursday .
The White House realizes its goals clash with Democrats in Congress .
“ As people on the Hill realize that there was money allocated and not spent , it becomes attractive .
We need to find ways to make that less attractive , ” said a senior administration official .
News reports in recent weeks and sources close to Treasury indicate that Geithner and his team are leaning toward extending the bailout fund beyond its Dec. 31 expiration date while putting some of the funds toward the deficit .
But administration officials pushed back against those reports Thursday , stressing that no decisions have been made and that an announcement on the issue is far from imminent .
Geithner did some pushback himself , telling members of the Joint Economic Committee , “ We are working to put TARP out of its misery , and no one will be happier than I am to see that program terminated . ”
But under Burgess ’s pummeling to just end the program , Geithner said that “ this economy still faces tremendous financial challenges , ” ticking off the continued problems in the housing market and small - business sector .
The conflicting messages coming from the administration highlight the perils of its position on this issue .
The White House has signaled that it wants to dedicate 2010 to deficit reduction , and putting the bulk of TARP funds into paying down the debt could please budget hawks on the Hill .
But it also wants to keep an emergency fund just in case .
“ The question is , what can you keep in your hip pocket for if the world collapses again ? ” said the senior administration official .
“ They need it .
We ’re not out of the woods yet .
... [ But ] they ’re struggling because the optics suck , ” said an industry official familiar with the situation .
“ They were leaning toward doing it , but now it gets even messier ... with Geithner ’s latest troubles over AIG , ” the official said , referring to a report by TARP ’s watchdog this week that slammed Geithner ’s handling of the American International Group bailout while heading up the New York Federal Reserve Bank .
But while administration officials are trying to see the big picture on the deficit , lawmakers see a chance to play the populist role .
“ It was taxpayers who rescued Wall Street .
Now it is time for Wall Street to contribute to the growth of Main Street , ” Larson said this week .
Alaska Sen. Mark Begich , one of more than two dozen Senate Democrats who support directing some TARP dollars toward loans for small businesses , said “ that ’s where it should have gone . ”
Begich said his constituents “ saw the big banks walk away with these bailouts and then at the same time ended up with huge salaries , ” while the small - business folks in his district wonder what happened to their help , he said .
Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - Ill . ) said Congress needs strong assurances that any future TARP money is going to be directed at Main Street , not big banks or credit card companies .
“ We need to insist on that , on a plan that ordinary people can relate to , ” she told POLITICO .
Some Democrats are concerned that TARP ’s image is so tarnished that no amount of refashioning the program as a lifeline for regular folks will help .
“ If it were up to me , I would scrap TARP and all of the baggage that goes along with it , and I would do something specifically for the community banks , so we do n’t depend on the bureaucracy and workings of the administration , etc. , to make sure that it happens , ” said New York Rep. Dan Maffei .
On Tuesday , Maffei was one of three Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee to vote in favor of a GOP amendment to force the sunset of TARP .
Maffei said he ’s concerned that voters back home just are n’t going to buy the notion that money used for unpopular bailouts of Wall Street firms and American automakers is suddenly going to help them .
“ Branding matters , ” said Maffei , a former Hill communications director .
“ Frankly , even if I believed that this would now be used for the smaller community banks , etc. , I do n’t believe my community banks would . ”

Mail : An All New Ruby E-mail Library
By Peter Cooper
To date , the main ways to send e-mails from Ruby have been Net: : SMTP , TMail , and Rails ' ActionMailer ( which uses TMail ) .
Now , however , there 's a fourth option , the simply named " mail " by Mikel Lindsaar .
Mail is a new pure Ruby library designed to handle the generation , parsing , and sending of e-mail in a " Rubyesque " manner .
Both the sending and receiving e-mails can be handled through the library and , where necessary , Mail proxies methods from libraries like Net: : SMTP and Net:: POP3 .
Ruby 1.9 support has been built in from day one so dealing with different text encodings in your e-mails is easier than ever ( Mikel claims this is less than straightforward with TMail ) .
Mikel also points out that Mail has 100 % spec coverage .
There are lots of code examples on the Mail page but to give you an idea of how it works , here 's a code example that sends an e-mail with an attachment :
Mail .
defaults do smtp ' 127.0.0.1 ' end mail = Mail .
new do from ' me@test.lindsaar.net ' to ' you@test.lindsaar.net ' subject '
Here is the image you wanted ' body File . read ( ' body.
txt ') add_file { : filename => ' somefile.png ' , : data =>
File . read ( ' / somefile.png ') } end mail .
deliver !
As well as the main GitHub page for the Mail project , there 's also a mail - ruby Google Group where questions can be asked , etc .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Preliminary results of an International investigation by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) suggest there may be a " significantly increased risk " of some types of brain tumors after use of mobile phones for a decade or more .
The investigation lasted a decade and covered studies of 12,800 people in 13 countries during the period 2000 to 2004 .
Six of eight studies on brain tumors found a link between an increased risk of the most common type of brain tumor , glioma , and heavy use of mobile phones , with one finding a 39 percent increase .
Of seven studies into a benign tumor of a nerve between the brain and the ear ( acoustic neurinoma ) , two found an elevated risk in people using cell phones for ten years or more .
Previous studies have yielded inconclusive results , but head of the WHO study , Dr Elisabeth Cardis , said the report would include a public health message and a recommendation the use of mobile phones by young children should be restricted .
She noted that cell phones can be an important tool in emergencies , and maintaining contact between parents and children can be reassuring , and therefore she would not go as far as suggesting their use should be banned .
Dr Cardis said that a number of studies have suggested possible deleterious effects of the radio frequency radiation emitted by mobile phones , and while these studies were limited and not yet definitive , precautions are important , especially in their use by children except for essential calls .
Critics of the study have pointed out that it included people who only made one call a week using a cell phone , and it did not include any children , both of which could underplay the results .
They also point out the research was partly funded by the mobile phone industry .
Other critics have noted that some results suggested short - term use appeared to protect against cancer , which may indicate flaws in the studies .
Publication of the results of the 30 million dollar investigation has been delayed because of disagreements over the best way to present the conclusions , but the findings have been submitted and are expected to be published within the next few months .
Meanwhile , for people in the market for a new cell phone who are interested in limiting their exposure to radiation , the Environmental Working Group has published a guide to the radiation emitted by most models of cell phone , as explained in this article .
You can also reduce exposure by sending text rather than speaking , and by avoiding cell phone use if the signal is weak , because the radiation is greatest then .
Children should also limit their use because their skulls are thinner and less able to protect their brains from the radiation .

Our lovely blue planet is extraordinary for a number of reasons .
The most significant of these reasons , to most of us , is the fact that it is the only place in the universe that we know for certain houses life .
But on the thin film of gas and liquid that coats our planet , that life has developed in such a dazzling array of forms that even today , biologists are finding new species on a daily basis .
Living things thrive in the blazing sun of arid deserts , in the crushing pressure of deep sea trenches , in the icy wastes of Antarctica , and even within the very stones beneath our feet .
The adaptations that allow this versatility have created species with some very extreme features .
10 . Blue Whale
The Blue Whale , known to taxonomists ( those biological eggheads who make up complicated scientific names ) as Balaenoptera musculus , is a baleen whale that is easily the largest of animal on the planet .
Blue whales have been found that measured at up to 109 feet in length and weighing up to 200 tons .
This places the blue whale far in the lead for the title of largest animal that has ever lived .
No known dinosaurs , outside of a few possible theoretical species , even approach this big boy ’s size .
9. Platypus
While it may not be the biggest , fastest , or most impressive species in the world , the little Australian oddball known as the platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus in geek - speak ) is certainly one of the most confusing .
The bizarre forces of evolution ( which apparently love a good joke ) that led to this animal have blessed it with a wide array of characteristics that you ’re unlikely to find together outside a biology textbook .
As a mammal , it is warm - blooded and furry , but is a monotreme , meaning that it lays eggs for reproduction .
It has flat , webbed feet to propel it through the water , a duck - like bill for a snout , and a flat tail resembling that of a beaver .
It has sensitive organs on its bill that can detect the electrical signals in the muscles of fish swimming through the water , sharp spurs , which in the males secrete a potent , though non-lethal , venom .
That ’s right , it ’s poisonous , too .
Or , rather , venomous .
Turns out that there ’s a difference .
8. Komodo Dragon
It ’s not enough that the monitor lizard known as Varanus komodoensis , or the Komodo Dragon , can grow 10 feet long and have a weight of over 150 pounds , making them the largest lizard around today .
It ’s not enough that they are ferocious , rapacious carnivores who , although they generally feed on carrion , can ambush and bring down a water buffalo with their jagged teeth and huge claws .
It ’s not even enough that their toothy mouths are awash with both venom and a soup of bacteria that almost always causes serious or fatal infection in bite wounds .
If all that were n’t enough , the females can lay viable eggs even if there are no males around .
I ’m just glad they ’re only found on a few islands in Indonesia .
7. Ocean Quahog
This unassuming little shellfish , arctica islandica , which looks much like a clam and is harvested for food in many areas of the North Atlantic , including Iceland , does n’t look particularly impressive .
It ’s even used to top sushi on occasion , and does n’t get a lot of attention .
But it has the distinction of being one of the longest - lived animals .
It ’s hard to tell how old they grow to be on average , but at least one specimen was brought up from the deep that had lived for over 405 years .
That is , until some biologist dredged it up into the air and tested its age , which was fatal .
C’est la vie .
6. MRL Mouse
You ’ve seen the movies .
Some scientists are working in a lab .
Unbeknownst to them , mutations in the lab ’s experimental animals have transformed some of the creatures , giving them strange new powers .
And before the world is prepared , upon the unsuspecting population is unleashed … a little white mouse .
The strain of white lab mouse known as Murphy Roth ’s Large ( or MRL ) mouse was being used for routine scientific experimentation when it was discovered that this particular mouse had the ability to not only heal from injuries inflicted on it , but to regenerate .
It was able to recover from injuries without any detectable scarring , and even to re-grow toes , tails , or even vital organs , including the heart , that were destroyed or removed .
Could this indicate that science could someday use this mouse to allow injured humans to regenerate lost limbs and organs ?
Stay tuned .
Big things may be on the way .
5. Pompeii Worm
Unless you are a very lucky marine biologist , you are unlikely to ever see Alvinella pompejana , or the Pompeii worm , in person .
That ’s because this fanciful - looking tube - worm lives its life stuck around volcanic hydrothermal vents in deep ocean trenches .
These little worms live in an environment that is incredibly hostile to life , and that goes beyond the water pressure that would easily crush you or me to death in seconds .
Their lower end is usually resting ( within their tubes ) in water up to 176 degrees Fahrenheit , while their head end is often in water at a far more amenable 72 degrees Fahrenheit .
This makes them the second most heat - tolerant of all complex animals .
For the most heat tolerant , see number 3 on this list .
4. Deinococcus radiodurans
This tiny bacterium is little known to the general public , but is of great interest to the scientific community , which might explain why it ’s sole name is pronounceable only by people who prefer biological taxonomy to inconsequential things like dating or hygiene .
Although it is known for several interesting properties , including the ability to withstand heat and exposure to acids , it is named for its most astounding ability .
It can survive doses of radiation that would kill virtually anything else on the planet .
For comparison , a human will die after absorbing 10 Grays of radiation .
D. radiodurans has been dosed with up to 15,000 Grays , and come through without being wiped out .
Its ability to withstand radiation and repair its own DNA is being researched for use in medicine as well as use as a computer storage medium .
3. Water Bear
The water bear , also called a tardigrade , is my nominee for the Toughest SOB You ’ll Ever Lay Eyes On After Bruce Willis award .
There are over a thousand species of this little eight - legged animal , and they have been found living literally everywhere on Earth .
Some sadistic poking and prodding by scientists has revealed that these little action heroes can survive at temperatures of 303 degrees Fahrenheit at the top end ( remember that water boils at 212 degrees ) , and at the lower end , have survived at only a few degrees above absolute zero .
They can withstand pressures ranging from 6,000 atmospheres , which is not even found in the deepest oceans , to the vacuum of outer space .
They have shown resistance to radiation that is unparalleled in the animal kingdom , allowing them to survive doses of radiation over a thousand times the intensity that it takes to kill a human ( unless , of course , you are the previously - mentioned Bruce Willis ) .
And they can be completely dehydrated and then come back to life after decades of being tiny mummies .
It ’s little wonder that these guys have been about for around 500 million years .
2. Archaea
The tiny bacteria - like organisms classified as archaea were only classified in the 1950’s , and then they were considered to be a group of relatively uncommon microorganisms that could be found in areas of extreme temperatures , acidity , salinity , or other unpleasant conditions .
More recently , scientists have been able to use new biochemical technologies to show that , not only are they a totally separate form of life from the other kingdoms on Earth , but that they actually thrive in every environment on the planet .
In fact , archaea can be found even down deep into the planet ’s crust , everywhere that the ground is porous enough to allow anything to get there .
They are so common , in fact , that they are now estimated to make up as much as one fifth of the mass of life on the Earth , and are a major and indispensable part of our ecosystem .
Their strange qualities and the genetic differences between Archaea and the other forms of Earth life have caused some scientists to suggest that they may be the common ancestor of every living thing on our planet .
Others go even further , with the theory that they are n’t even native to Earth , but were somehow transported here from another planet .
1. Mankind
You had to know that we would make the list .
Humans , or Homo sapiens , exists today in only a single species with a single variety .
Presumably , we killed off the various other varieties and species of humanity that existed up to as little as ten thousand years ago .
Of all the different species on the planet , not one has a more powerful ability to change its environment to adapt it to its needs .
While other species use evolution to change and meet changing conditions , humanity decided that it had had enough of the whole evolution game , and started forcing the environment to change .
We burn down forests to plant food , spread transportation networks across the entire planet , and even alter the atmosphere itself ( although that ’s not so much on purpose ) .
Although we are a relatively large species with large food requirements , we are currently increasing our population at a rate formerly reserved for disease cultures .
We ’re not all bad , and I believe that we ’ll figure out how to pull out of this nose - dive , but for now it looks like we ’ve been voted Most Likely to Cause Armageddon .

Although each encounter was interesting and memorable , this was notable .
A fellow , who 's name I never got came by to exclaim , " It was a tragedy ! , 9/11 was a tragedy ! " .
And he did n't find any disagreement .
He mumbled some things like planes can bring down buildings ... that 's just the way it is ... " .
He went on about having respect for the those who lost family members and exclaimed , " It 's a tragedy that you 're here ! " .
Meaning , of course , that we were stirring up the rubble that had long solidified from its weeks long molten state and was probably better off left alone .
I pointed out that many family members were part of the movement and desired further investigation .
Unconvinced he turned to me and repeated himself .
I agreed with him , emotionally .
I knew exactly what he meant .
I said , " I agree with you but to me it 's a tragedy and a disgrace that we HAVE to be here .
To us , the events of 9/11 is an unfinished story that demands answers particularly for those affected that day . "
I encouraged him to read the questions on the board but he moved on in a cloak that prohibited any objectivity .
Another elderly gentleman , an architect from Williamsburg came by to express how stunned he was that the towers fell in the manner they did .
But he said , anything can happen in those circumstances , considering the impacts , that no one can predict or possibly explain .
I agreed with his general conjecture , to a point .
I said there 's a lot we would like to explain and some that we can't .
I could tell that he had had some doubts but had convinced himself by means of the ' chaos ' theory , that all was well .
That is , certain things , like impacts of this nature , can foment unpredictable results .
I was trying to point out the many characteristics similar to controlled demolition ( our talking points ) .
He looked behind me and said , " now that 's controlled demolition . "
He was referring to the video of wtc7 collapsing alongside an actual demolition that we had running in back .
I said , we think so , that 's world - trade 7 .
He was taken aback .
He said , " they took that one down " , I replied , " no planes hit that one . "
As it dawned on him what he was looking at , why we paired it with the demolition demo and yet another inconsistency that seemed to have been withheld from him in this incredulous tale , his jaw dropped .
He turned without saying another word and walked away .
Was he unprepared to face the truth ?
Is it unkind to reveal this kind of truth to people ?
At times it seems so .
But for me it was rewarding to see the reactions of those passing by , most of which was positive .
Thanks goes to the efforts and the time put in by Jon Cole and the others helping AE911 Truth organize these booths and events where it 's needed .
But I wonder , how long can these jaw - dropping , obvious truths remain unspoken , unmentioned and unaccounted for in this country of ours ?
It does n't take long , maybe 10 minutes for someone knowledgeable to look over the facts gathered and either to walk away with their blinders firmly fastened or to be genuinely disturbed .
There 's a tragedy and a travesty somehere in there too .

Michael Love on the Pleco iPhone App
by John Pasden in language
The following is an interview with Pleco founder Michael Love , regarding the Pleco iPhone app , which is now in beta testing .
John :
The long wait for the iPhone app has caused much distress amongst all the Pleco fans out there .
Any comments on the development process of your first Pleco iPhone app ?
Michael :
Well , much of the delay stems from the fact that we really only started working on the iPhone version in earnest in January ’09 – before that we were mainly working on finishing / debugging Pleco 2.0 on Windows Mobile and Palm OS .
We laid out the feature map for that back in early 2006 , when the iPhone was nothing but a glimmer in Steve Jobs ’ eye , so by the time Apple released the first iPhone SDK in Spring ’08 we were already well past the point where we could seriously scale back 2.0 in order to get started on the iPhone version sooner .
Pleco 2.0
But as far as how the actual development has gone , the biggest time drain has been working around the things that iPhone OS does n’t do very well .
We ’ve gone through the same process on Palm / WM too – we start off implementing everything in the manufacturer - recommended way only to find that there are certain areas of the OS that are too buggy / slow / inflexible and need to be replaced by our own , custom - designed alternatives .
On iPhone the two big problems were file management and text rendering .
There ’s no built - in mechanism on iPhone for users to load their own data files onto their devices ; all they can do is install and uninstall software .
So we had to add both our own web browser ( for downloading data files from the web ) and our own web server ( for uploading data file from a computer ) in order to allow people to install their own documents / flashcard lists / etc .
We also had to implement a very elaborate system for downloading and installing add - on dictionaries and other data
files ; for a number of reasons it was n’t feasible to bundle all of those into the main software package , and again there was no way for users to install those directly from a desktop as they can on other mobile platforms .
And the iPhone ’s text rendering system is actually quite slow and inflexible , which is rather disappointing coming from a company with as long and rich a history in the world of computer typography as Apple .
The only official mechanism for drawing rich text ( multiple fonts , bold , italic , etc ) is to render it as a web page , which took way too long and used way too much memory to be practical for us ; there also seem to be some bugs in the way Apple ’s WebKit page rendering engine handles pages with a mix of Chinese and non-Chinese text .
And even simple , non - rich - text input fields and the like are a big performance hog – it took the handwriting recognizer panel about 8 x as long to insert a new character into Apple ’s text input box as it did to actually recognize a character .
So we basically ended up having to write our own versions of three different iPhone user interface controls in order to get the text rendering to work the way we wanted it too .
So a quick - and - dirty port of Pleco on iPhone could probably have been ready last spring , but getting everything working really smoothly took a lot longer .
John : The iPhone version of Pleco got a complete UI overhaul .
What can you tell us about the thought that went into the redesign ?
How do you feel about it compared to the last UI design ?
Michael : Most of the redesign was done simply to meet the needs of a finger - driven interface – we had to find ways of doing the same things with fewer , larger buttons , and no possibility for the sort of fine - grained control that you can get on a stylus - driven Windows Mobile handheld .
So aside from simplifying things , reducing the number of buttons and switching from a one - panel to a two - panel interface ( where you enter a search term , then tap on a search result to view it full - size on a separate screen ) , the main changes were in the areas of text selection and handwriting input .
Selecting text
Apple actually has a pretty good system for English text selection in iPhone OS 3.0 – drag your finger around and it shows you a magnified version the character / word you ’re trying to select – but it ’s way too fussy to individually select Chinese characters , so instead we modified the interface we use for the document reader in Pleco 2.0 on Palm / Windows Mobile ; you tap on a character and it automatically highlights the surrounding word , then you can use some nice big finger - friendly arrow buttons to move the highlight around or expand / shrink it to cover individual characters .
For handwriting input , the main change was simply making the input box bigger ; Apple actually includes a built - in Chinese handwriting recognizer in iPhone OS , but it ’s confined to a box the width / height of the iPhone ’s keyboard area ( since they did n’t want to make programmers redesign their apps to accommodate a differently - sized keyboard just for Chinese ) , so we licensed a Chinese handwriting engine for iPhone from our friends at Hanwang Technology and implemented that in a fullscreen box .
We also added a multi - touch gesture – tap on the screen with two fingers to clear the input box ( and begin entering another character ) , tap again to backspace .
We tested the same gesture in an Apple - sized input box and it did n’t work as well ( easy to have one finger land outside of the box ) , so it ’s probably only practical in a fullscreen box , but it works really well in one of those .
Of course , having gone to all of the trouble to implement this Apple will inevitably decide to add fullscreen Chinese handwriting recognition system - wide in iPhone OS 4.0 , but at least we should get a few months of being the only dictionary to offer it , and even if they do implement their own fullscreen recognizer the one we licensed from Hanwang is a lot more accurate than Apple ’s.
( which was adapted from an obscure late - 90s Apple product called the Advanced Chinese Input Suite )
John :
What elements of the iPhone app are you most and least pleased with ?
Handwriting input
Michael :
The handwriting input is great – I still think writing characters with a stylus is better in some respects , but most Pleco users should find the transition to fingertip - based handwriting pretty seamless .
I ’m also really happy we managed to implement the experimental “ Live Mode ” feature , letting people look up characters in web pages ( and offline HTML documents ) by tapping on them – in current - generation iPhones it ’s a little too slow / memory - intensive to really work well , but after another hardware update or two it should be the closest thing available to a mouseover dictionary .
And in general I think we ’ve done a good job at translating the Pleco interface to touchscreens – when the finger - driven Windows Mobile 7 comes out ( hopefully in 2010 ) , whatever version of Pleco we release on that can be expected to look very similar to what we ’re about to release on iPhone .
As far as disappointments , the custom text controls I mentioned above are still a bit rough – for our second iPhone release we ’re probably going to need to implement our own version of the iPhone ’s keyboard , since the interactions between that and our text input fields are somewhat less - than - perfect .
( clipboard support is also kind of spotty at the moment ) I ’m also a little disappointed in the fact that there wo n’t be flashcards in the first release , and of course in the long wait for our iPhone version in general , though now that we ’ve got the core product working on we should be able to get additional iPhone features / updates out a lot faster .
John :
What elements of the iPhone 3.x firmware has Pleco implemented ( or plans to implement ) ?
Dictionary add-ons
Michael :
We ’re very big on In App Purchase – now that it ’s supported in free apps , we ’ll likely be selling Pleco in the form of a free “ Lite ” version with the various dictionaries and other add - ons available as additional purchases on the device .
We also make pretty heavy use of the new clipboard – the built - in document reader lets you look up words from inside of a piece of Chinese text on the clipboard , which provides an admittedly - slightly - awkward way to translate Chinese SMSes .
We also make heavy use of the new ability to compose emails without leaving the application – there ’s a new feature that lets you instantly send us a report if you ca n’t find a match for a particular word ( and we are in fact planning to add new entries to some of them based on that feedback ) .
There are also some new things developers have been given access to that we have n’t done any work with yet but are actively looking into ; for example , iTunes music playback can now be controlled from within an application , so we might be able to use that to let people queue up Chinese - language audio programs and listen to them while reading through / looking up words in transcripts in Pleco .
John :
We know how the infamous iPhone app approval process goes , but can you tell us when you plan to officially submit the new Pleco for iPhone app to the Apple app store ?
How much should users expect to pay for it ?
Michael :
We ’ll be submitting it to Apple as soon as the beta - test is finished – there have n’t been too many severe bugs reported so far , so best - case it might be just a couple of weeks from now .
As far as prices , we ’re aiming to keep things pretty similar to our Palm / Windows Mobile software , but with a bit more flexibility about exactly which dictionaries / features you can purchase ; there should be less of a distinction between buying a dictionary in a bundle and buying it as a separate add - on later , and it should be possible to save money by skipping any or all of the stroke order / audio / handwriting input / flashcards / document reader modules if you ’re not interested them .
( That , of course , is all still subject to Apple ’s approval – in theory they could demand that we release exactly one , non-customizable version of Pleco and charge $ 224 for it .
( February 24th being Steve Jobs ’ birthday . ) )
John :
Any plans for an Android version ?
Michael : Not at the moment .
Our cross - platform engine code is written in C , while Android mainly uses Java – it is possible to execute C code on Android , but the mechanism for doing so is rather awkward , so a Pleco Android port would be extremely labor - intensive .
If the release of the iPhone version leaves us sufficiently flush with cash to hire a couple of Java programmers , we could certainly consider an Android port then , but for now we prefer to focus on iPhone , Windows Mobile , and a desktop version ( very easy due to the overlap between desktop / mobile Windows and Mac OS X / iPhone ) .
John :
Oh , one more thing …
Any comment on the tone - color issue ?
Tones and color
Michael :
The palette we use was actually devised by my friend Sam Lipoff , who was pitching me on the idea of tone coloring way back when I was putting together Oxford Dict 1.0 on Palm OS back in 2001 .
He ’s actually found a reference to the idea in a Chinese teaching book from several decades ago , so I think it ’s been bouncing around for a while but has only started to see widespread use recently between Dummitt ’s book and a couple of different pieces of software integrating it .
Which is not to say that Dummitt did n’t independently invent tone coloring , just that he ’s probably not the only person to do so .

Before the fame - seeking backyard scientist Richard Heene phoned the police to report that his 6 - year - old son , Falcon , had floated away on a homemade flying saucer Thursday morning , he called a local TV station and asked them to send a news helicopter .
Taken aback by the request , the news director at the station , KUSA - TV , Patti Dennis , said she called back and told Mr. Heene flatly , “ I do n’t believe you . ”
Still skeptical when Mr. Heene put a police officer on the phone to verify the story , Ms. Dennis added , “ I told the deputy that I did n’t believe he was real , either . ”
Eventually satisfied by the local police ’s report of a missing child , she dispatched the helicopter to the skies over Fort Collins , Colo. , where the helium - filled balloon had taken flight , jump - starting an extraordinary afternoon of television coverage .
Cable news anchors suspended skepticism in favor of spectacular images of the balloon as it glided across northern Colorado and landed in a dusty field about 60 miles away , and the ratings for CNN and the Fox News Channel doubled for the duration of the spectacle .
But even before Falcon was found hours later hiding inside a box in the Heene family home , incredulous observers were asking :
Is it all a hoax ?
Local congressman John Carter said : “ I had a man on the scene , who is the former chaplian at Fort Hood .
He was waiting to go to a graduation ceremony when a soldier came running up to him saying somebody was shooting .
He heard small arms and some rifle fire . ”
A female mallard duck nudges along a pair of painted turtles sunning themselves on a rock at the edge of Granville Island pond in Vancouver , British Columbia on August 1 , 2006 .

CHALFORD HILL , England , Nov. 9 ( UPI ) -- A British lobbying group has criticized a fire department for spending six hours on the rescue of a pet duck trapped in a pond 's overflow pipe .
Chris and Karen Hutchens said a five - man team of Gloucestershire firefighters arrived at their Chalford Hill , England , home just before 9:30 a.m. and dug a trench to free their duck , Brownie , from the pipe , The Sun reported Monday .

" It was such a relief when a fire engine turned up and they started digging the hole .
The pipe was about 4 feet underground but they kept going , they were wonderful and really went beyond the call of duty , " Karen Hutchens said .
However , a spokeswoman for lobbying group TaxPayers ' Alliance criticized the firefighters ' actions .
" Whilst no one likes to see a duck suffering , animal rescue is not the central job of the fire service , " she said .
" In this case there were no emergency calls pending , but calls can crop up at the last minute which could be much more pressing than the rescue of a duck . "
A spokesman for the fire department said firefighters have humanitarian roles in their communities and were able to help in this case due to the lack of emergency calls .
Breakthrough Technology Converts CO2 to Ethanol without Biomass
Producing fuel out of thin air sounds like a pipe dream , but a new process from a biofuel company promises to be able to turn CO2 and sunlight into fuel , bypassing the current need for large amounts of agricultural land and water to produce biomass feedstock .
Joule Biotechnologies has announced that it can use direct microbial conversion of CO2 into hydrocarbons , powered by solar energy , creating biofuels such as ethanol without biomass or agricultural feedstocks , which minimizes the land and water usage in the production of fuel .
The company ’s Helioculture process uses sunlight and engineered organisms designed to secrete hydrocarbon molecules to produce the fuel products .
Current biofuel technologies are dependent on the use of biomass and an extensive extraction and refinement process , so the new technology from Joule is a true breakthrough in next generation fuel production .
The company discovered genes which are coded for enzymatic mechanisms that can directly synthesize olefin and alkane molecules , which is the chemical composition of diesel .
Current production by the company is lab scale , and a pilot development program is expected in early 2011 .
“ What we have are highly engineered photosynthetic organisms existing in a solution of nonfresh water … and some nutrients .
They exist inside this novel solarconverter that is capturing the sun ’s rays …
We have sunlight as an input and CO2 as a feedstock .
So , we are capturing CO2 and driving photosynthesis inside the converter .
The organisms have been modified to directly secrete a variety of solar fuels and solar chemicals . ”
– Bill Sims , CEO of Joule Biotechnology
Joule Biotechnologies states that the process is capable of producing over 20,000 gallons of ethanol or other hydrocarbons per acre per year , and the price would be competitive with $ 50 a barrel oil .
“ The SolarConverter ™ system applies sophisticated optical and thermal engineering to allow its deployment on just minimal amounts of non-agricultural land , and it requires no fresh water .
Its modular design means that the very same system in our laboratory today can easily move to wide - scale production .
Interconnected assemblies can be multiplied to virtually any size based on land , CO2 availability and desired output . ”
Joule is privately held company based in Cambridge , Massachusetts , founded in 2007 by Flagship Ventures .

If your budget does n’t stretch to one of Honda ’s famously rare and storied RC30s , you can find all of the exotic tech in a slightly smaller , much cheaper package with their VFR400R NC30 .
You get a V4 with a 360° crank and gear - driven cams , a sexy ELF - designed “ ProArm ” single - sided swingarm , and the twin - headlight , endurance - racing bodywork that is easily mistaken for the RC30 at a glance .
The NC30 is down on power , compared to the RC30 , but it also weighs almost 100 lbs less , and the 60 hp on tap will move the 400lb machine along pretty smartly , with a wide spread of power .
But the little V4 ’s real party trick was its incredibly agile and forgiving handling that made it the darling of the 400 cc class both on the road and in racing .
Prices have increased in recent years , but you can still pick these up for very reasonable prices , considering how cool and exotic they are , with Honda reliability thrown into the bargain !
This particular example looks solid and complete , but does need a bit of work as outlined in the original listing .
From the original eBay listing : 1989 Honda VFR400R NC30 for Sale
1989 Honda VFR400R NC30 with 12,909 km , approx 7,745 mi , as shown on clock ’s photo .
This was recently imported from Asia , and i took it as a trade on another bike , so I do not have too much history .
Bike looks good for its year , but it was painted in its past life .
Plastic looks good as can be seen in photos , not sure if original plastics , but some repairs can be seen on inner side .
It has a Vermont transferable registration , most states accept this , but please check with your local DMV .
Bike starts and runs using a temporary fuel source , as it looks like its not getting fuel through the petcock , which seems to be a typical issue with these diaphragm petcocks .
Bike will come with a new petcock rebuild kit from UK .
I would say this is an easy project completion bike for somebody with repair ability , I have not ridden it , and it is 31 years old but the previous owner noted they did substantial work to the bike , but please expect to correct and fix other items not described .
I have other previous projects , so I ’m moving this one on .
Here ’s what I was told the previous owner completed recently , which looks about correct .
New screen , brace and mirrors .
New battery with tender connection .
Full service , air and oil filters , new oil and plugs .
New radiators , hoses , replacement fan and fluid .
New ignition and gas cap / keys .
New throttle and choke cables .
Carbs were removed , cleaned and rebuilt with new carb kit from Japan , including boot rubbers .
Refurbished rear brake caliper and new pads all around with new fluid .
What I visually see that need ’s to be corrected or finished , but I have not disassembled , is as follows .
General wiring needs to be checked and reconnected , like front and rear flashers , kill switch , radiator fan wiring , as fan was from a different model , but spins with power added , and general wiring .
As i said , it turns over , and starts with temp tank , so looks like only general wiring to lights , flashers , gauges and sensors , etc , need a going through .
Rev counter needle is partially broken , as can been seen in photo .
Rear tire has some age cracking .
Front tire is newer , but loosing air over time , maybe issue with wheel rim and seal .
Rear Exhaust canister has some wear marks , as can be seen in photos , missing springs to pipe .
Rear seat unit is missing lock unit , but new spare lock is included , but seat is east to open , I can send a video .
Bike comes with Haynes Manual and some spares like cables , carb kit , etc .
This is a 31 year old bike , with only the above history known , but with some good finishing , would make a nice collectible piece .
But again , its a 31 year old bike , so expect some additional work for a vintage bike like this , if you purchase .

DROGY : Mýty o morálce , společnosti atd .
Jan Vučka
Ve svých článcích
Mýty o legalizaci drog a Mýty o kriminalizaci drog jsem rozebíral několik obecně rozšířených pověr týkajících se drog .
Strefil jsem se dobře , protože v následující debatě k článkům nemalá část diskutujících reagovala tím , že již jednou vyvrácený mýtus prostě zopakovala , aniž by dokázali najít nějaký argument - tak silný je vliv některých utkvělých představ .
Zdaleka mě nepřekvapilo , kolik lidí má zdeformované představy o tom , co znamená slovo morálka , právo , svoboda .
Morálka pro ně znamená " ostatní musí dělat to , co je morální podle mne , jinak půjdou do vězení ! "
( 1 , 12 ) Právo pro ně znamená , že když někdo jiný než oni dělá něco jiného než oni , tak máme právo jim to zakázat , zejména když jsou ti druzí v menšině .
Ti ostatní jsou přece jenom " párprocentní řvoucí skupinka " ( 4 ) .
A svoboda pro ně znamená , že všichni musejí svobodně dělat totéž ( 11 , sledujte podvědomou my šlenku zdeňka , že všichni budou dělat to , co je legální , jako kdyby to bylo povinné ) .
Překvapením nebyla ani hrozná míra nenávisti a netolerance , která čiší z některých zap šklých bojovníků proti drogám ( 12 + různé výzvy k odstěhování do Antarktidy a podobně ) .
Potvrdily i se zprávy z výzkumů , že schopnosti funkčního čtení a aplikovat logická pravidla jsou v Čechách tristní ( 3 , 8 , 12 ) .
Bylo to spíš smutné , kolik lidí klidně napíše " společnost má právo " a " společnost nebude trpět " , když ve skutečnosti myslí " já vím nejlíp , co je pro vás dobré a vy mě budete poslouchat , rozumíte ! ! "
Tolik lidí se ohání morálkou a starostí o cizí dobro , když z jejich příspěvků čiší sobectví a touha být ředitel zeměkoule a rozhodovat o jiných .
Tohle je tak rozšířený a nebezpečný mýtus , že si zaslouží vlastní odstaveček :
Ti , kdo prosazují svobodu užívat drogy [ jakoukoli jinou svobodu , která se mluvčímu nehodí do krámu ] , jsou sobci !
Ne .
Sobectví se nejčast ěji definuje jako upřednostňování vlastních hledisek před hledisky ostatních lidí .
Tedy když já podporuji právo každého člověka rozhodnout se , zda bude užívat drogy či nikoli , nemohu být sobec už z definice .
Když říkám , že každý má právo uspořádat si život podle svého , říkám tím zároveň , že názor každého je stejně hodnotný .
Můj názor není hodnotnější než názor Váš , takže
Vy si žijte podle svého a nemusíte se mým názorem řídit .
Naopak fanatičtí " bojovníci za veřejnou morálku " jsou sobci , neboť si myslí , že jejich názor má větší hodnotu než názor někoho jiného a že svůj názor mohou někomu vnucovat .
To je sobectví !
Přesto se našlo dost diskutujících , kteří měli chuť zapojit se do smysluplné diskuze a hledat racionální argumenty pro nebo proti , za což jim děkuji .
K některým z nich nemám , co bych ještě dodal , na jiné odpověděli ostatní účastníci debaty .
Vybral jsem tucet typických nebo z nějakého důvodu zajímavých reakcí , které si zasluhují odpověď :
1. " Svoboda končí tam kde začíná svoboda dalšího . "
Vaše pojetí morálky je zajímavé přesto odporné .
zdeněk , 212.80.64.122
Pravidlo " moje svoboda končí tam , kde začíná svoboda někoho jiného " , které zdeněk cituje z mého článku , není z mojí hlavy .
Tradičn ě se uvádí jako nejzákladnější morální pravidlo naší kultury . :-)
Právě toto pravidlo nám říká , proč je nemorální krádež : protože cizí majetek patří do cizích práv .
Kdybych chtěl něco ukrást , již bych svou svobodu chtěl neoprávněně rozšířit za hranice svobody někoho jiného .
Nebo jiný příklad : propuštěný vězeň vyjde po deseti letech z vězení .
Deset let neměl ženskou a teď na ulici potká prostitutku , ale nemá peníze na to , aby ji zaplatil .
Má právo ji znásilnit ?
Nějaký zarytý kolektivista by možná tvrdil , že ano , protože pro vězně má znásilnění větší užitek než jakou ztrátou bude pro prostitutku , takže se zvýší celospolečenský užitek .
Naprostá většina lidí se však shodne na tom , že nemá právo ji znásilnit .
A proč ?
Právě proto , že vězňova svoboda končí tam , kde začíná svoboda prostitutky .
Takže pokud nechcete obhajovat krádeže a znásilňování ( což doufám nechcete ) , pane zdeňku , měl byste toto pravidlo přijmout .
2. Ještě k těm civilizacím co kouří trávu .
Která se dochovala do dnešních dnů ?
Islámská s hašišem také není moc vyspělá .
zdeněk , 212.80.64.122
A Cruton napsal :
Drogy zkreslují vnímání reality .
Pokud máte zkreslený obraz reality , nemůžete se přizp ůsobovat jejím změnám .
A živočišný druh , který se nedovede přizp ůsobit realitě , ten vyhyne .
Cruton , 147.229.146.127
Příklad evropské a islámské kultury celkem přesvědčivě dokazuje , že legalizace drog podpoří úspěch dané kultury .
Jak je to možné ?
Ono to je všechno o svobodě .
V současné době je evropská , respektive euroamerická civilizace zřetelně úspěšnější , progresivn ější a přizp ůsobivější než islámská .
Důvodem je více svobody a méně sešněrovanosti a duchovní zkostnatělosti v naší kultuře .
Dá se to ověřit i historicky : ve středověku v době , kdy byl tento poměr obrácený , byla naopak pokročilejší islámská kultura a my Evropané jsme byli za negramoty .
Nejsnadněji se to ukáže v oblasti ekonomiky , protože peníze se počítají lehce .
Kdy ž si uděláte graf , kam zanesete životní úroveň zemí světa a míru ekonomické svobody v dané zemi , zjistíte přímou úměru .
Čím víc svobody , tím statisticky větší úspěch .
Tím nechci tvrdit , že kultura potřebuje k úspěchu drogy .
Ale potřebuje k ú spěchu svobodu , ochranu práv a zodpovědnost svých členů ( příčiny jsou tak zjevné , že snad nemá cenu je rozvádět ) .
A k tomu ty drogy chtě nechtě patří , nemůžeme je od toho oddělit .
Nedokážete vychovat lidi k zodpovědnosti , když jim řeknete " máte odpovědnost za své peníze , ale ne za své tělo " .
To by bylo skoro stejně směšné jako učit je " zodpovědní musíte být od pondělka do středy a od čtvrtka do neděle ne " .
Naučili by se tak být spíš zodpovědní nebo nezodpovědní , co myslíte ?
Kdo chce podpořit naši civilizaci , měl by podporovat i legalizaci drog .
A malá faktická poznámka závěrem pro pana zdeňka : islámská civilizace hledí na omamné látky přísněji než evropská .
3 . Přes mohutnou mediální palbu všelijakých poslů dobra kupodivu většina společnosti NECHCE legalizaci ani měkkých drog ( v poslední době třeba referendum ve stát ě Aljaška společně s prezidentskými volbami ) .
Vučkům tohoto světa to ale vůbec nevadí - oni nás zachrání , i kdyby nás to mělo zabít !
LOJR , 194.213.41.2
Znáte to rčení o smítku v cizím oku a břevnu ve vlastním ? :-)
Zkuste se zamyslet nad tím , kdo koho chce zachránit , i kdyby ho to mělo zabít .
Vy mě chcete zachránit před nebezpečím drog i za cenu , že mě zastřelí v nějaké přestřelce mezi gangy nebo že mě oloupí feťák , aby měl na další dávku .
Přitom drogoví dealeři by v případě legalizace měli zrovna tolik důvodů po sobě střílet jako mají dnes trafikanti .
Ani uživatelé drog by pak nemuseli denně ukrást věci v hodnot ě
20.000 Kč , aby je v bazaru střelili za 1.000
Kč a mohli si tak koupit dávku , která by v případě legalizace stála 100 Kč a nikdo by kvůli ní krást ani loupit nemusel .
A to vše jen proto , abych byl chráněn před drogami - když jediné , co mi stačí udělat , abych byl chráněn , je říci " díky , nechci " .
Tak mi řekněte , kdo koho chce zachránit , i kdyby ho měl zabít !
Já se Vás nijak nežádal , abyste mě chránil před drogami , dokážu se před nimi ochránit sám .
4 . " Dějiny americké alkoholové prohibice jsou nepřehlédnutelným poučením - pokud se ovšem chcete poučit . "
Poučení - zakazovat alkohol , jehož občasné konzumaci podléhá 90 % populace je blbost - to se pochopitelně nedá vynutit .
Povolovat další drogy kvůli řvoucí párprocentní skupince feťáků je blbost ještě větší .
Ergo poučení z americké alkoholové prohibice je zde irelevantní .
Jura , jurax@seznam.cz , 195.47.14.126
Není pravda , že jde o řvoucí párprocentní skupinku feťáků .
V některých ročnících má již většina populace zkušenost s ilegální drogou .
Ale čísla teď nejsou důležitá .
I kdyby to bylo jen 1 % .
Co na tom záleží ?
Kdy ž je hráčů petanque v Česku o tolik méně než hráčů fotbalu , znamená to , že jim petanque máme zakázat ?
Asi ne , viďte ?
Takže na podílu na populaci nezáleží .
Určité principy jako svoboda a rovnost s počtem lidí nesouvisí .
Je však pravda , že pravidelných konzumentů ilegálních drog je méně než pravidelných konzumentů alkoholu .
Když říkáte , že jich je jen pár , mohu ten samý argument obrátit proti Vám.
Jestliže jde jen o pár feťáků , proč kvůli nim odsuzovat celou společnost k tomu , aby žila na ulicích Chicaga třicátých let ?
Stojí Vám to za to ?
Říkáte , že poučení z americké alkoholové prohibice je irelevantní .
Jak jste na to přišel ?
Před zavedením prohibice byl alkohol legální a negativní dopady s ním spojené byly kontrolovatelné .
Po zavedení prohibice se pilo dál , ale s neakceptovateln ými náklady .
Po legalizaci byla situace klidná jako před prohibicí .
Před prohibicí na ostatní drogy byly tyto drogy legální a negativní dopady s nimi spojené byly kontrolovatelné .
Po jejich kriminalizaci se fetuje dál , ale s neakceptovateln ými náklady .
Zkušenost třeba z Nizozemí ukazuje , že po legalizaci byla situace zase klidná .
( snadno ověřitelná fakta ) Nebije ta paralela do očí ?
Proč to odmítáte přijmout ?
Dále tvrdíte , že nelze vynutit zákaz alkoholu .
Máte snad pocit , že zákaz ostatních drog lze vynutit ?!
Asi žijete na jiné zem ěkouli než všichni ostatní .
Já kolem sebe vidím něco jiného .
V USA ( jedna z nejvíce prizonifikovaných zemí na světě ) sedí polovina vězňů za trestné činy související s drogami , a přesto si ten zákaz nedokázali vynutit .
Tak co dokazují fakta ?!
5 . Ve válce Irán - Irák použil Irán děti a ženy sfetované hašišem kteří utíkali proti samopalům Iráčanů .
Hold někdy víra nestačí a musíme více vidět realitu .
zdeněk , 212.80.64.122
V první světové válce zase vojáci dostávali víno , aby ochotn ěji pochodovali proti nepřátelským kulometům ( a dělo se to i v dřívějších evropských válkách ) .
Jak to souvisí s debatou o legalizaci drog ?
6. Spousta kidů
Argumenty typu " je to tak " a " každý ví " v článku , kde je spousta tvrzení bez jakéhokoli relevantního podkladu nedává moc prostoru k rozumné diskuzi ..........
Demosthenes , kdo@hleda.najde , 195.113.128.142
Dá se říci , že to byla právě pointa článků !
Důvody pro legalizaci drog nemusíte hledat někde ve vědeckých studiích a statistikách , je jich dost všude kolem a jsou každému zřejmé .
Záměrně jsem ve prospěch legalizace argumentoval fakty , která ví každý : učí se o nich už na základní škole ( existence a neúspěch americké prohibice ) , píše se o nich v běžném denním tisku ( kriminalizovaný obchod s drogami podporuje terorizmus ) nebo si je může každý domyslet pomocí obyčejného selského rozumu a elementárních pravidel ( cena legalizovaných drog několikanásobně poklesne ) .
Tyto důvody jsou každému přístupné , jde jen o to chtít je vidět .
V obou článcích dohromady jsem uvedl asi dvě konkrétní čísla , více ne .
A počet úmrtí v důsledku kouření je údaj , který každým rokem zveřejňuje ministerstvo zdravotnictví a každým rokem se to píše v novinách .
Jestli Vám to pomůže , můžu uvést jako pramen " běžný denní tisk za posledních deset let " , ale myslím si , že to opravdu není nutné .
7 . S měkk ými drogami jako alkohol a tabák lidstvo již žije stovky let .
Za ta století máme ověřeno , že důsledky zmíněných drog dokáže společnost udržet pod kontrolou .
Ale tuto zkušenost nemáme s jinými drogami .
Proto si myslím , že jistý konzervatismus je v tomto ohledu na místě .
Cruton , 147.229.146.127
Opatrnost Vám jistě nikdo nebude vyčítat .
Ale zde není na místě .
Máme zkušenost s prohibicí a víme , že nefunguje a přináší mnohem větší náklady .
A že nemáme zkušenosti s ostatními drogami ?
Opium , kokain , morfin , to vše bylo dříve legální !
Zeptám se ještě jednou : je Vám něco známo o tom , že by prodejci koka - koly po sobě stříleli ze samopal ů ze stupátek jedoucích automobilů jako po sobě stříleli prodejci alkoholu za prohibice ?
Nebo že by důsledky užívaní tehdy legálních drog byly neakceptovatelné ?
8. Poslouchejte , co Vám povím
Můj syn měl absolutně blbou učitelku .
Její muž byl lékař v blázinci za Prahou a měl tudíž pod palcem i drogisty .
Ta blbá učitelka jednoho dne vzala celou třídu autobusem do blázince , kde její muž pracoval , dovedla děti před jednu celu a řekla :
" Děti , teď Vám něco ukážu .
Uvnitř je člověk , kterýsi kdysi pře asi dvěma lety vzal drogu .
Podívejte se na něj , jak vypadá dnes a pamatujte si .....
Přesně tak dopadnete , pokud si budete zahrávat s drogami . "
Můj syn se kouknul kukátkem do té cely a asi 5 dní mi vyprávěl s vykulenýma očima , co tam viděl .
Na zemi seděl - ležel chlap , který pod sebe sral , vypadal jako smrtka a byl evidentně v posledním tažení .( taky asi 5 dní nato zemřel . )
Můj syn si ten pohled pamatuje dodnes .
Je mu 32 klet a nikdy k droze ani nečuchl .
A že v učilišti , kam chodil mu je nabízeli xkrát .
Můj pohled na tuhle učitelku se dost podstatně po této " předváděčce " změnil .
Současně vím od kluka , který se se svými spolužáky o tomhle několikrát bavil , že NIKDO z těch , kteří tuhle lidskou trosku v blázinci viděli si k droze ani nečuchl .
Možná byla blbá , ale jedenkrát vidět je víc , než dvacetkrát říkat .
Proto na mě argumenty autora moc nezabírají .
Logické jsou , ale nesedí mi .
Pavel Pekárek , pavpek@karneval.cz , 194.213.219.4
Proč svůj příběh uvádíte , jako kdyby snad vyvracel to , co jsem psal o legalizaci drog já ?
Vždy ť já s přístupem té učitelky plně souhlasím !
Také jsem sám psal , že drogy ničí zdraví .
Ještě jednou opakuji : nepodporuji užívání drog .
Legalizace drog a užívání drog jsou dvě různé věci .
9. Mimochodem , před lety běžel u nás v TV film o Australanech , kteří byli chyceni s 5 kg drogy a byli odsouzeni k smrti .
Kdy ž je popravili , jejich rodina uspořádala smuteční a vzpomínkovou slavnost na ně a přijímala kondolence .
A přišla tam paní a řekla :
Já to schvaluji , že je popravili , protože právě takoví zkurvenci dali drogy mé dceři a ta umřela .
Uklonila se a odešla .
A já s ní souhlasil , přestože celý tenhle australský film měl vyvolat lítost nad těmi popravenými .

Co kdybych argumentoval tím že počet trestných činů je u alkoholu větší , protože je legalizován ?
zdeněk , 212.80.64.122
Pak bych Vám řekl , že nejnebezpečnější trestné činy v souvislosti s drogami páchají dealeři .
Ti by při legalizaci měli zrovna tolik důvodů páchat zločiny jako dnes trafikanti .
A uživatelé drog páchají trestné činy především proto , aby si opatřili peníze na drogy .
Legalizace by cenu drog výrazně snížila .
Počet uživatelů tvrdých drog bude vždy nižší než alkoholu ( tradiční drogou je u nás alkohol , tvrdé drogy jsou navíc nebezpečnější , takže lákají méně lidí ) .
Policie dnes věnuje obrovské prostředky na stíhání něčeho , co stíhat nemusí .
Legalizací by se tyto prostředky uvolnily na stíhání skutečných zločinů .
Nelogické zákony a morální korupce ( my si odhlasujeme , že cizí tělo bude jako patřit nám ) narušují základní morální pravidla , úctu k tradičním hodnotám a k dodržování pořádku .
V zemích , kde legalizují drogy , nebyl pozorován zásadní nárůst kriminality , na rozdíl od zkušeností z prohibičních zemí .
Stačí Vám to takhle ?
11 . Podle jedné legendy Sokrata nezabili pro jeho názory ale proto že se scházel s mladými chlapci .
Morálka se příliš nemění , civilizace se snaží bránit rozvratu zevnitř .
Jestliže bude prostituce legální , bude společností akceptovaná .
Zde si dovolím připomenout Sodomu .
Důvod proč jsou prostitutky ve všech společnostech zavrhovány je jasný : starost o děti a zachování rodu .
Kněžky byly něco jiného .
Skuste říci dívce ve věku 16 let že by se měla stát prostitutkou .
Dá vám facku .
jestli prostituci legalizujem , bude si myslet že je to správné .
zdeněk , 212.80.64.122
Za prvé : prostituce je legální již dnes .
Za druhé : to , že je něco legální , neznamená , že to bude obecně akceptované a že to bude chtít dělat každý .
Již dnes je legální poslat vlastní matku na smrtelném loži do pr ... .
Mohu
Vám ukázat trestní zákon - není tam jediný paragraf , který by to zakazoval !
Taky není zákonem zakázáno dloubat se v nose , prdět na veřejnosti a spousta dalších věcí . :-)
Ptám se Vás tedy : prdíte na veřejnosti , dloubete se v nose a posíláte vlastní matku do oněch končin ?
A myslíte si , že je to správné dělat , když je to legální ?
Mimochodem - v té době byl styk s mladými chlapci běžný .
Morálka v oblasti sexu se v průběhu doby měnila docela hodně .
To , co bylo v jednom století normální , by v následujícím století šokovalo .

Jak jsem již psal výše , právě západní morálka je postavená na respektování svobody a zároveň odpovědnosti jednotlivce ( což pomáhání jiným samozřejmě nevylučuje ) .
Připomínám , že jsem ve svých článcích zastával morální krédo " moje svoboda končí tam , kde začíná svoboda někoho jiného " .
Byl byste tak laskav a vysvětlil , jak z toho plyne střílení do lidí a házení do propasti ?
Fakta překrucujete a divnou morálku plnou nenávisti a násilí tady zastáváte hlavně Vy .
( Co na to říká bible , pane zdeňku ? )
Dovolím si v této souvislosti zopakovat odstavec ze svého staršího článku o kuplířství , na němž ani s odstupem doby nemusím měnit ani čárku :
Pokud chce přesto někdo obhajovat potírání kuplířství ochranou morálky , bude muset vysvětlit , co je morálního na postoji " vy musíte dělat , co je morální podle mě , jinak vás pošlu do vězení ! "
Až se budou tito uvědomělí občané spravedlivě rozhořčovat nad diktaturou Talibanu , měli by se zamyslel nejdřív sami nad sebou , zda náhodou nedělají přesně totéž , co dělal Taliban .

Závěrem ještě jednou děkuji všem konstruktivně diskutujícím z obou táborů a doufám , že nezůstanou u krátkých příspěvků do diskuzního fóra a napíší sami delší články o problémech legalizace / kriminalizace drog .
Jak ukázala živost debaty k mým článkům , jde o palčivé téma , které si zaslouží co nejširší věcnou debatu .
Neurol23 , A. S. Pergill , V. Hoffman a další mají očividně k tématu co říci a umějí napsat věcný příspěvek , který obsahuje racionální argumenty místo výkřiků a nadávek .

P.S. Tohle s drogami sice nesouvisí , ale uživatelka liška to v debatě k mým článkům o drogách psala pořád dokolečka tak tvrdošíjně , že na to raději také odpovím , aby někdo neinformovaný nebyl zmaten :
13 . známý mluvčí mafiánů , který propaguje nejen legalizaci drog , ale taky policejní stát , neboť propaguje policejní reglementaci žen .
Pane Vučka zcela vážně - pokud máte děti přeji
Vám upřímně a z celého svého srdce , aby z nich byly kurvy jako jste vy , pasáci , drogově závislí a gamble ři .

Určitě jste měla jedničku z tělocviku , protože kotrmelce Vám jdou skvěle .
Jak jste přišla na to , že propaguji policejní stát , když jsem naopak soustavně říkal , že policii do toho nic není ?!
Jestli si dva dospělí lidé z vlastní vůle dohodnou , že budou mít sex za peníze , může se mi to líbit a nemusí , ale nevidím důvod , proč na jednoho z nich posílat policii .

THE ONLY REAL SURPRISE in the latest disastrous batch of data on housing is that anybody is surprised .
With the $ 8,000 tax credit originally set to expire , housing starts plunged nearly 11 % in October , to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529.000 units .
That put new home construction back to the dismal levels of last spring before a temporary blip lifted housing activity during the warm - weather months .
Even though the home - buying subsidy was extended through next March and expanded beyond first - time buyers , there 's little evidence that these giveaways are working .
Applications for mortgages for home purchases , for instance , fell to a 12 - year low last week even with a 30 - year mortgage going for well under 5 % .
For reasons best understood themselves , analysts had forecast an uptick in housing starts to the 600,000 annual rate in October from September 's 592,000 pace .
While the lowest fixed mortgage rates and reduced home prices have kept housing from collapsing further , the 10.2 % unemployment is working against home buying .
Meantime , foreclosures , which are running at 300,000 a month are adding to the inventory of homes available for sale .
In other words , prospective buyers have an array of houses available to them in most regions at knock - down prices .
But there 's no reason for them to hurry while apartment rents are tumbling .
Builders , meanwhile , would be loath to build new houses on spec , even if their banker would provide the financing .
All of which points to an extended period of depressed housing activity after the excess supply from the boom built on absurdly easy credit is worked off .
This is an example of what economists of the Austrian school call " malinvestments , " which are the inevitable result of a credit inflation .
The boom results in an inevitable bust , during which past excesses have to be corrected , however painfully .
That 's not in keeping with 20th century let alone 21st century political realities , which mean government actions to counter the downturn .
Do n't waste time debating the merits ; the matter is settled .
For practical investors , the question is the effectiveness of the government 's efforts .
Even with the Federal Reserve 's program to buy over $ 1 trillion of mortgage - backed securities and the myriad other schemes to bolster housing , including the tax credits for homebuyers , the government is n't getting much bang for all those bucks .
As noted here previously , the $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time homebuyers may have actually cost the government $ 43,000 for each extra house sold ( " Homebuyers ' Handout -- Worse Than Cash for Clunkers , " Oct. 21 . )
That 's because most of the recipients of Uncle Sam 's largesse would have bought a house anyway .
Now that the credit been extended to next March and applied to home buyers who were previously homeowners ( with some restrictions ) , who knows how much extra incremental house sale will cost the Treasury .
Yet another federal housing - support program also is looking like a boondoggle .
The Federal Housing Administration , which backs home loans with down payments of as little as 3.5 % , has become the new subprime lender , some contend ..
That charge comes from Robert Toll , chief executive of luxury home builder Toll Brothers ( ticker : TOL . )
As the Developments blog at wsj.com reports , Toll called the FHA a " definite train wreck " at a builder 's conference Wednesday , a week after the agency reported its insurance reserve ratio had fallen to just 0.53 % .
The FHA has become one of the sources of low - down - payment home loans , but that 's led to soaring defaults .
" What the government is doing is beyond belief in that once upon a time ...
FHA did very small percentage of business in the country , " the Developments blog quoted Toll as saying .
But he noted that the agency 's market share has boomed in recent years " and the reason is , yesterday 's subprime is today 's FHA . "
The FHA avers and contends its borrowers ' credit scores have increased to 690 from 625 two years ago and has improved its risk control .
But , as the latest Fed survey of senior bank loan officers released last week showed , private credit conditions continue to tighten , including for residential mortgages .
And given the overhang of unsold homes -- plus a shadow inventory from homeowners who have been holding back from putting their house for sale until the market improves -- no wonder homebuilders are glum .
The National Association of Home Builders / Wells Fargo index of builder confidence hovered at a low 17 for the second straight month in November .
A reading below 50 denotes conditions respondents deem as poor .
The gauge averaged 16 last year .
" What the government is doing is beyond belief in that once upon a time ...
FHA did very small percentage of business in the country , " Toll said .
But he noted that the agency 's market share has boomed in recent years " and the reason is , yesterday 's subprime is today 's FHA . "
Even with housing affordability the highest in years from low mortgage rates and reduced home prices , there 's little reason to expect a revival in homebuilding as long as the inventory of unsold houses and foreclosures remain high , credit is tight and unemployment is in double digits .
Perhaps that 's why the shares of the big public homebuilders , as represented by the SPDR S&P Homebuilders exchange - traded fund ( XHB ) , topped out two months ago and have been moving sideways to lower since .
That says more than economists ' misguided forecasts of rising housing starts .

The space shuttle Discovery landed in California on Friday evening after bad weather near Kennedy Space Center forced it to wave off a landing in Florida .
Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force Base after a 13 - day mission to the international space station .
" Welcome home Discovery , " mission control said after the shuttle landed .
" Congratulations on an extremely successful mission , stepping up science to a new level on the international space station . "
The shuttle touched down at 8:53 p.m. ET at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert , where NASA described the weather as " pristine . "
This may be the last California shuttle landing , because there are only six missions remaining on the NASA schedule , unless Congress gives the space agency more money .
Flight controllers prefer landings at Kennedy Space Center because of cost and schedule .
A California landing adds a week to the turnaround time before the shuttle can be ready for another mission .
NASA has estimated it costs about $ 1.7 million to bring a shuttle home to Kennedy Space Center from California .
It rides cross-country piggy - back on a Boeing 747 .
Discovery was initially scheduled to return to Earth on Thursday , but poor weather in central Florida forced a delay .
Watch the shuttle land in California »
Both Florida landing opportunities Friday were canceled by " a very deep moisture system that descended over the Florida spaceport , " a NASA spokesman said .
The seven astronauts are wrapping up a 13 - day mission to the international space station , where the crew made repairs and delivered supplies .
Do n't Miss Shuttle Discovery landing scrubbed
The crew executed three spacewalks and dropped off the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill , or COLBERT treadmill , named after comedian Stephen Colbert .
Colbert won an online poll conducted by NASA to name the newest space station compartment .
Instead , Colbert and the space agency worked together to give the moniker to the treadmill .
The new compartment was given the name Tranquility .
While in space , mission specialists Danny Olivas and Christer Fuglesang installed an ammonia tank on the international space station .
The depleted tank assembly is being returned to Earth in the shuttle 's cargo bay .
The tank is part of a cooling system that cycles 600 pounds of ammonia through the space station to " get rid of excess heat generated by the station 's systems , " NASA said .
Astronaut Nicole Stott remained at the space station as a flight engineer , replacing astronaut Timothy Kopra , who returned home aboard Discovery as a mission specialist , according to NASA 's Web site .
Another space icon is also coming home aboard the shuttle -- Buzz Lightyear .
The 12 - inch Disney / Pixar action figure has been aboard the space station for more than a year , according to NASA .
The action figure went into space aboard Discovery in May 2008 as part of a joint initiative between Disney and NASA to encourage students to study math , science and technology .
Weather and technical problems delayed Discovery 's launch three times before the mission began .

pain - stakingly drawn with pencil for my Layout and Design class .
This is a five - point - dual - warped perspective vertical pan which involved a 180 degree rotation of the camera .
Which is a pretentious way of saying that it's a fish eye lense drawing of downtown vancouver from 500 feet in the air
The story ;
the assignment was to draw a warped perspective or 3 point perspective scene which the camera could pan vertically through .
I like to make life difficult for myself , so I used this messed up type of perspective that confused my classmates whenever I tried to explain it without a thumbnail .
To get a good feeling for what Vancouver looks like from so high up , I needed to get onto the roof of a tall building downtown .
I tried to sneak onto the top of a government building , but I ended up setting off an alarm and having to leg it .
I did n't get caught though cuz I 'm a ninja .
I ended up getting access to the deck of the pentouse suite of a ritzy hotel to get some reference shots .
Every building in this drawing actually exists somewhere in Vancouver , so the archetecture is authentic .
Noteable structures ;
Science world , the docks by the bay , the downtownlibrary , a parlement building is in there somewhere , and the tall skyscraper on the horizon is the Vancouver Wall Centre .

Didier Drogba 's scriptwriter should take a bow .
The Ivory Coast striker set about restoring his reputation in European competition after the infamous histrionics against Barcelona after the semi-final back in May , and his late goals thrust Chelsea into the knockout phase .
A perfect record in the section may have been surrendered , but Carlo Ancelotti's team have been offered a reminder that they will benefit hugely from Drogba 's rehabilitation .
The forward 's form this season has been supremely impressive , with his timing last night just as impeccable .
There have been 11 goals already this term , defences shrinking in his presence all too readily as he batters beyond centre - halves at will .
Manchester United may be more vulnerable at the heart of their defence than anywhere else , moreover , and that suggests Chelsea will sense further reward when the teams meet at Stamford Bridge on Sunday .
Certainly , the striker 's post - match claim that he is currently enjoying the best form of his career may send shivers of apprehension through United 's ranks .
" A few years ago I was playing with the same confidence , but I think this is my best , " offered Drogba .
" I always score when I play injury - free .
There was n't anything special about being back again in the Champions League , but I 'm just enjoying playing with my friends out on the pitch . "
Chelsea had actually progressed smoothly enough to the top of Group D without their talismanic forward , whose furious reaction to elimination against Barça had prompted a three - game Uefa suspension , but he will add a new dimension to them for the more testing stages of this competition .
Indeed this game might have edged away from Chelsea only for Drogba 's class to tell in the final eight minutes .
" For sure I would n't want to swap him for any other striker in the world at the moment , " said Ancelotti .
" He is playing in a ' good moment ' right now , and I hope that can continue . "
His performances show no signs of dipping .
Chelsea had actually been in danger of losing their air of invincibility in the group , trailing to their first concession in the competition , when Drogba thumped in a header from Florent Malouda 's left - wing cross eight minutes from time .
That deflated Atlético , their brittle confidence fractured once again , with Juanito and Pablo Ibáñez duly wilting as the striker rampaged on to Ashley Cole 's pass .
The African then muscled his way towards goal as the centre - backs crumpled , smacking his first shot at the prone Sergio Asenjo then calmly converting the rebound .
Chelsea were effectively through with that goal , even if one final sting remained in the contest .
Sergio Agüero , rested initially with Sunday 's derby against Real Madrid in mind , had emerged from the bench to fire Atlético ahead with a stunningly executed volley at the far post after John Terry 's misguided clearance .
That was the home side 's first goal of the group , illuminating what had been a dull encounter and hinting at unlikely victory for a while , particularly given the visitors had only managed to rouse themselves in fits and starts on an awkward surface .
Yet Agüero would be required to provide a second glimpse of his class .
The game had lurched into stoppage time and the stands were emptying as the home support drifted away dejected and apparently defeated when the Argentinian thrashed a wonderful free - kick into the top corner from some 25 yards .
Scouts from the continent 's top clubs have filed regularly on Agüero in recent years .
" I like him , " said Ancelotti .
Asked whether he would delight in pairing him with Drogba , perhaps if Chelsea 's transfer ban is frozen in January , he added : " I think Agüero can play with Drogba , for sure . "
Chelsea departed mildly annoyed to have surrendered parity when Drogba 's efforts should have earned a fourth consecutive victory in the group , though they will be heartened to extend their unbeaten , year - long Champions League run .
" Perhaps we could have done better with the defensive wall , and maybe avoided conceding the free - kick as well , " said Drogba .
" It 's really frustrating to concede a goal like that after the effort we produced .
But we can be pleased with what we have achieved .
" We were also thinking about Sunday 's game [ against United ] .
We did everything we had to do tonight , and now it is important for us to beat United at home .
We have to improve and show different qualities , and be better than we were in Madrid .
But I think we still put in a good game .
It was n't a poor performance .
We played well , but it was n't enough to win . "
In the grand scheme of things , that matters little .
Drogba is back and Chelsea are in the knockout stage , with aspirations that they may return to Madrid and the Bernabéu in May very much intact .
Leaked documents prove alarmists planned to seek funding from “ energy agencies ”
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Wednesday , Nov 25 , 2009
A prominent scientist has called for criminal prosecutions to be brought against the UN affiliated scientists involved in what has been termed “ ClimateGate ” .
Australian geologist and long time opponent of anthropogenic global warming theory , Ian Plimer , has condemned what he describes as “ alarmism underpinned by fraud ” .
“ This behavior is that of criminals and all the data from the UK Hadley Centre and the US GISS must now be rejected .
These crooks perpetrated these crimes at the expense of the British and U.S. taxpayers . ”
Plimer writes in a commentary piece .
“ The same crooks control the IPCC and the fraudulent data in IPCC reports .
The same crooks meet in Copenhagen next week and want 0.7 % of the Western world ’s GDP to pass through an unelected UN government , and then on to sticky fingers in the developing world . ”
Plimer continues .
He points out that the emails intimate that figures were manipulated to cover up the medieval warming period , and continued global cooling , in addition to artificially inflated data to emphasize warming during the 20th century .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Plimer , author of the best selling book on the global warming debate , Heaven and Earth — Global Warming : The Missing Science , has long been a vocal critic of what he describes as the hijacked environmental movement .
Plimer has stated many times that he feels vast swathes of the scientific community have been co-opted to manipulate data in return for millions in continued research funding .
The leaked emails from the Hadley centre reveal that CRU chief P.D. Jones has received 55 endowments since 1990 from agencies ranging from the U.S. Department of Energy to NATO , worth a total of £ 13,718,547 , or approximately $ 22.6 million .
Another document titled ( potential - funding.doc ) lists sources of potential funding and shows that the scientists considered pressing “ energy agencies ” that specifically deal in new technology to reduce carbon emissions .
Three agencies listed as potential sources of funding are UK based Carbon Trust , the Northern Energy Initiative , and the Energy Saving Trust .
Renewables North West , an American company promoting the expansion of solar , wind , and geothermal energy , is listed as a fourth potential benefactor .
Of course , all these potential financial backers have a vested interest in maintaining the conception that human - induced global warming is a reality backed by science .
Anthropogenic global warming theorists have long attacked skeptical scientists , claiming they are bought and paid for by oil companies , yet here we have the most influential group of climate scientists acknowledging that they are a shoe - in to receive funding from energy companies with vested interests .
Ian Plimer joins another prominent figure in the debate , Lord Christopher Monckton , who called for a full investigation and criminal prosecutions earlier this week .

A new type of pterosaur has been found in northeast China and it's filling in some of the gaps in the evolutionary record of the extinct flying reptiles .
The fossil skull of the pterosaur Darwinopterus is about 19 centimetres long .
( ( Lü Junchang ) ) British and Chinese paleontologists found more than 20 fossil skeletons of the new pterosaur , which they 've dubbed Darwinopterus , to mark the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species , Darwin 's founding book on evolutionary biology .
Darwinopterus , about the size of a crow , had long jaws with rows of sharp , pointy teeth and a long , flexible neck .
The researchers said these features could suggest that it was a mid-air predator , catching and eating other flying creatures , such as other pterosaurs , gliding mammals and feathered dinosaurs .
( Pterosaurs , or pterodactyls , are often incorrectly considered dinosaurs , but paleontologists say the flying reptiles are in a different biological group .
Modern - day birds trace their lineage back not to pterosaurs , but to feathered dinosaurs . )
Darwinopterus was found in rocks about 160 million years old , placing it at a time between the two known groups of pterosaurs : older , primitive species with long tails and their descendants , short - tailed pterosaurs that reached huge sizes .
This drawing shows Darwinopterus hunting a small feathered dinosaur , called Anchiornis .
( ( Mark Witton , University of Portsmouth ) )
The gap in the fossil record between these two types of pterosaurs was identified in Darwin 's time , and the researchers were surprised to see Darwinopterus filling that gap .
" We had always expected a gap - filler with typically intermediate features such as a moderately elongate tail — neither long nor short — but the strange thing about Darwinopterus is that it has a head and neck just like that of advanced pterosaurs , while the rest of the skeleton , including a very long tail , is identical to that of primitive forms , " David Unwin of the University of Leicester said in a release .
Unwin said the rapid evolution of groups of related features , or modules , seen in Darwinopterus support a controversial theory called modular evolution .
" Whole groups of features that form important structures such as the skull , the neck or the tail seem to have evolved together , " Unwin said .
" It seems that natural selection was acting on and changing entire modules and not , as would normally be expected , just on single features such as the shape of the snout or the form of a tooth , " he said .
The scientists said more research needs to be done to support the idea of modular evolution , but it could explain instances of rapid evolution seen in both plants and animals , especially in mammals after dinosaurs became extinct .
DOE Hires a VC for The Green FDR
November 15th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
Under the new Green FDR administration of President Obama , there has been such an increase in renewable technologies funding , that keeping up with qualifying and selecting the best of the best in innovative new renewable energy tech is overwhelming the Department of Energy .
[ social_buttons ]
So Nobel - prizewinning scientist Steven Chu of the DOE has hired a professional Venture Capitalist to help run the DOE renewable energy loan guarantee program .
VC Jonathan Silver of Core - Capital Partners will help the DOE eliminate the so - called “ Valley of Death ” between the university lab and commercialization of groundbreaking renewable technologies .
President Obama had hired the the Nobel - prizewinning Steven Chu to bridge the gap between between unknown geniuses in university labs and the hungry VC ’s searching for the next big thing .
But the process of filtering through the pent - up supply of potential is overwhelming .
Our newly ramped up Department of Energy is having a hard time whisking out loan guarantees fast enough to keep up with both the demand for and the supply of these highly competitive DOE and ARPA - E awards .
To help speed up the processing , the Department of Energy has hired a former managing general partner at Core - Capital Partners who began his career at energy efficiency consultancy McKinsey &Co and through the 1990 ’s served as policy advisor to the Secretaries of Commerce , Interior and Treasury .
As Executive Director , Jonathan Silver will report directly to Secretary Steven Chu .
As he describes himself at Washington Biz Journals : “ There are n’t an enormous number of people who understand both private equity investment and government — how the sausage of public policy is made , where the opportunities are and how to access them ” .
Silver ’s responsibilities will cover staffing the programs and leading origination , analysis , and negotiation , and managing the full range of the Department ’s alternative energy investments .

The only privately - developed spacecraft to carry a pilot to suporbital space , SpaceShipOne made three successful flights in 2004 .
Built by aerospace visionary Burt Rutan and financed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , the spacecraft won the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize .
An evolved version , SpaceShipTwo , will serve as the foundation for Virgin Galactic 's fleet of suborbital space tourism vehicles .
It has beenfive years since SpaceShipOne screamed its way into the history books as thefirst privately built and financed manned craft to reach space .
While that roarfrom the ship ?s rocket engine has long since dissipated , the aftershocks fromits suborbital space shots are still being felt .
Roaring upwardover the Mojave , Calif. , desert on repeat flights , pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnieindividually controlled the craft to the suborbital heights - and within thespan of a 14 - day period .
In doing so , on Oct. 4 , 2004 , the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize was won - and the vision of non-governmental spaceflightbecame sharply focused .
Designed byMojave - based Burt Rutan - the lead out - of - the - box thinker of Scaled Compositesand his team - and financed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , thebarrier - breaking vehicle earnedits stripes .
Its victorywas hailed by the banner : ? SpaceShipOne , Government Zero .?
Today , atthe Mojave Air and Space Port all appears in readiness for the combined testflights of WhiteKnightTwo and the sleek two - pilot , six - personSpaceShipTwo - the world ?s first passenger - carrying suborbital spaceliner .
This outing is backed by British entrepreneur , Sir Richard Branson and hisVirgin Galactic company .
Like SpaceShipOne , the new SpaceShipTwo is designed tobe carried to a high altitude by a mothership aircraft where it can launch onsuborbital trips .
Abovethe fold
Burt Rutanreflects on the wake left by the pioneering SpaceShipOne flights , the winningof the Ansari X Prize , and a glimpse at the road ahead .
? Our big milestoneof 2004 occurred on June 21 , the date of the first non-governmentmanned spaceflight .
The X Prize flights were an opportunity for our sponsorand our employees to get a ? well - done bonus ?
and to show that our Juneaccomplishment was not a lucky fluke ?
that it really is feasible for low - costspace access to be offered to the public , ?
Rutan explained .
Rutanproudly spotlights a ?
Google Trends ?
search that also shows the importance oftheir first manned spaceflight .
The Newsworthy Record , that is the number ofworld newspapers that carried the story above the fold , showed that the June 21ststory was the second largest news event of 2004 - the first being the captureof Saddam Hussein .
Three of the five manned space flights of 2004 were flownfrom Mojave , California .
? SpaceShipOne was my 39th manned aircraft type to be flight tested and wasclearly the most significant , ?
Rutan said .
?
It was my last design ?
anopportunity to hand over the reins to the very talented young designers atScaled .?
Rutan saidthat he has continued to design new concepts as Chief Technology Officer and Chairman Emeritus of Scaled Composites .
? I maydesign a future aircraft or two , but because of the rewarding experience ofSpaceShipOne for all my employees , I personally feel that my aircraftdevelopment career is complete , ?
Rutan told SPACE.com .
Historic , game changing
A witnessto all three of the SpaceShipOne flights was Will Whitehorn , President of Virgin Galactic .
?
Those breathtaking X Prize flights were worthy of everyclich ?
in the book ?
historic , game changing ? all in all , the right stuff !?
WhenSpaceShipOne pilot Brian Binnie shot skyward on the second of back - to - backsuborbital treks to snag the X Prize purse , Whitehorn considered that historicday as ?
one which will change the face of the space industry forever .?
And as the wispycontrail from that prize - winning run turned invisible , there were a host ofjudgments remaining , Whitehorn told SPACE.com .
?
Big decisions had tofollow ? such as whether to rebuild SpaceShipOne as a commercial vehicle , or takethe braver and more costly decision to build a truly capable integrated spacelaunch system , ?
he said .
Fastforward to the present : The WhiteKnightTwo / SpaceShipTwo is viewed as that spacelaunch system .
The combo of flight hardware not only gives space tourists whatthey wanted , but also supports human - in - the - loop science and launchingsatellites as well , Whitehorn said .
? It is nowfive years on and where are we ?
Flying the launch vehicle ?
firing the rocketmotor ?
on the cusp of unveiling the finished SpaceShipTwo and of course watchinga runway unfold in the New Mexico desert , ?
Whitehorn added , pointing to thedevelopment of Spaceport America ?
home base for Virgin Galactic commercialoperations .
? Hundredsof Virgin Galactic , Scaled and Spaceport America people are working towards atrue industrial revolution in space , ?
Whitehorn concluded .
?I , for one , can ?
twait , but will never forget the fact that the Ansari X prize was a realcatalyst for these events .?
Quietbefore the storm
? Right nowis the quiet before the storm , ? said Rick Tumlinson , a leader in the NewSpacemovement and co-founder of the Space Frontier Foundation .
He points to a trioof past events that has brought about the emerging space squall .
? The winning of the X Prize , the takeover of the Mir space station by privateinvestors and the flight of Dennis Tito to the space station were the threeshots that convinced investors that there was a market for commercial humanspaceflight , a way to capitalize on it in the near term ?
and people willing toput money into the idea , ?
Tumlinson said .
Comparing it to the moment before the flag is dropped on a race track , ? theteams are building their cars and rolling them out to the starting line , ?Tumlinson said .
TheTumlinson timeline : Within the next few months the first companies will beginflights and within two years the first paying customers will be flying .
Withinthree years the first commercial facilities will be overhead and within fiveyears you will be able to fly commercially to orbit on a private spaceship .
? NewSpacehas been through some major shakeouts , with only a few of the many firms survivingthat were around when the X Prize was won .
In fact ,
Scaled Composites may be the only one of the registered competitors that didsurvive , ?
Tumlinson said .
? It is important to maintain perspective .
Some would have us believe that the XPrize all by itself signaled the NewSpace revolution .
It did not , ?
he added .
?
Therewere a lot of people working on a lot of important projects for at least adecade before it was won , and by itself it would not have been anything morethan a news blip .?
Tumlinsonsaid that beyond Scaled / Virgin Galactic , none of the other surviving NewSpacefirms that really have a chance to succeed competed for the X Prize at all .?
XCOR and Armadillo Aerospace refused to participate , and the billionaire guyslike Bezos , Bigelow and Musk are doing their own thing completely , ? he added .
New setof investors
PeterDiamandis , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the X Prize Foundation has adifferent take on the spark stemming from the X Prize .
? Since the Ansari X Prize was won in 2004 , over $ 1 billion in capital has been investedinto the personal spaceflight industry , ?
Diamandis said .
?
Of the 26 teams fromseven nations that competed , I would guess that about a quarter of them remainviable and are pushing toward commercial operations .?
In lookingback over the past five years , Diamandis said that one of the most importantresults of the Ansari X Prize involves credentialing this slice of the industryas real , as well as stimulating this market sector .
? People nowknow and believe that they can buy a private ticket to space without having tobe a government employee , ?
Diamandis noted .
?
Other benefits include helping toclarify the regulatory regime and bringing a new set of investors and sponsorsto fund the entrepreneurs who have dedicated their lives to this industrysector .?
Claims , rhetoric , and drama
WhileSpaceShipOne?s snaring of the X Prize showcased the possible , as well as whatwas attainable , hubris should n?t be the propellant for pushing forward .
Thatcautionary view is espoused by David Livingston , the host of ?
The Space Show ?- a popular talkradio and streaming Internet program .
On one hand , SpaceShipOne ?s victory started opening a tightlyclosed door for investment which is opening even wider today .
? That said , accessing space is noteasy or dirt cheap - be it suborbital , orbital , or actually going someplace ratherthan just orbiting Earth , ?
Livingston said .
?
While I believe the entrepreneursand businessmen and women know how to kick the door wideopen and establish needed space economic infrastructure to developthis new industry , I have my doubts about policy makers , our elected officials , and those motivated to hold on to old agendas that won ?t work for the newspace economy .?
Livingston sees an increase in theclaims and rhetoric by enthusiasts , dreamers , advocates , and those wanting tobe very much a part of a truly space - faring world .
? The risk here is that asthe extremes in the claims , rhetoric , and drama get exposed to the lightof the day as being nothing more than what they are , they fuel the argumentsand unenlightened ways of those in power - or in influential positions - and they add to the risks of sidetracking or slowing down commercialspace development , ?
Livingston asserted .
The bottom line is that real spacedevelopment is essential for our future , Livingston said .
?
Let ?s keep itreal so we can achieve our goals and improve our world .?

 Unas cuantas horas en México lo convirtieron en experto instantáneo de nuestra realidad , una cualidad que le permitió recetarnos un análisis crítico , afirma el ex funcionario
Tangent :
If I remember correctly , Christopher Walken once played a bond villain .
Instead of explaining the plan he merely gnashed his teeth while crushing handfuls of potato chips in his hands without breaking eye contact with his co-stars .
Actually , I do n’t think that happened .
Anyway , above you ’ll find a comic .
Waste of money :
A top White House ally , the labor - backed Americans United for Change , is up with a new Web video touting Bill O’Reilly ’s unexpected endorsement of the public option and hitting Republicans for trying to “ kill ” it .
But there ’s no mention of Dems who oppose a public plan : “ Republican leaders ” thought they could “ slow ” the public option and “ kill it , ” the vid says , claiming that in fact the public option is very much alive .
Republicans are in the deep minority in Congress .
The only reason they can try to slow things down and kill anything is because they are being enabled by Democrats .
In the Senate , it 's been Kent Conrad and Max Baucus .
In the House , it 's been the Blue Dogs .
And the White House itself has encouraged those efforts by reiterating public support for a " bipartisan " solution .
The American people elected huge Democratic majorities because they wanted Democratic solutions to many of our nation 's problems .
Not because they wanted Democrats to allow Republicans -- the cause of most of our problems -- to continue running the government .
Yet even now , after months of Democratic obstruction , the best these " White House allies " can do is lob barbs at irrelevant Republicans .
They should focus their fire on the individuals who are actually the problem .
The Obama administration will not seek to arrest medical marijuana users and suppliers as long as they conform to state laws , under new policy guidelines to be sent to federal prosecutors today .
Two Justice Department officials described the policy to the Associated Press , saying prosecutors will be told it is not a good use of their time to arrest people who use or provide medical marijuana in strict compliance with state laws .
The policy is a significant departure from the Bush administration , which insisted it would continue to enforce federal anti-pot laws regardless of state codes .
Fourteen states allow some use of marijuana for medical purposes : Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Maryland , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .

Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said in March that he wanted federal law enforcement officials to pursue those who violated federal and state law , but it has not been clear how that goal would be put into practice .
A three - page memo spelling out the policy is expected to be sent today to federal prosecutors in the 14 states and to top officials at the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration .
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the legal guidance before it is issued .
The government will still prosecute those who use medical marijuana as a cover for other illegal activity , the officials said .

The memo warns that some suspects may hide drug dealing or other crimes behind a medical marijuana business .
In particular , the memo urges prosecutors to pursue marijuana cases that involve violence , illegal use of firearms , selling pot to minors , money laundering or other crimes .
Clusters of plump , wine - red Empire apples hang from sagging boughs , yearning to be picked .
A small group of volunteers is obliging , quickly filling a truck bed with wooden boxes of fruit .
They 're led by a smiling , energetic young woman , her red hair pulled back and practical rubber boots on her feet , ready for tromping in an orchard on a day that threatens rain .
Later that afternoon Corinne Almquist will deliver some 20 bushels of apples , about 1,000 lbs. , to a food shelf for free distribution to hungry local residents .
Sunrise Orchards in Cornwall , Vt. , where Ms. Almquist and her helpers have been gleaning , can't sell the apples :
Most have cosmetic blemishes caused by being pelted in a late summer hailstorm .
Though grocery chains wo n't buy them , they 're still tasty and nutritious .
Gleaning – harvesting leftover crops for the poor – is an idea as old as the Bible .
In the story of Ruth she gleans in the fields of Boaz and the two fall in love .
Leviticus urges farmers to leave the corners of their fields unharvested , providing food for the poor and strangers .
The practice was common in 19th - century France , too , celebrated in Jean - François Millet 's 1867 painting " The Gleaners , " which shows women picking through a harvested wheat field .
But gleaning is also finding modern advocates in the United States as the recession eats a hole in many family budgets .
" This idea of rescuing food that 's going to go to waste makes an awful lot of sense to people , " says Teresa Snow , program director of agricultural resources at the Vermont Foodbank in South Barre .
Gleaning , she says , is growing in popularity " not only across Vermont but across the nation " as hard times are " forcing people to be creative . "
" There 's so much food available in fields .
It 's astounding how much is wasted , " says Almquist , who graduated from nearby Middlebury College in June with a degree in environmental studies .
A 2004 report from the University of Arizona in Tucson estimates that 40 to 50 percent of all the food that could be harvested from fields will never be eaten .
Funded by a year - long fellowship from the Compton Foundation Inc. in Redwood City , Calif. , Almquist wants to spread the good word about gleaning throughout northwestern Vermont .
Working with local farmers , and with help from loyal volunteers , in recent weeks she 's delivered about 6,000 lbs. of squash , carrots , potatoes , and apples to food shelves or senior centers .
Earlier in the summer she gathered cabbage , kale , radishes , and herbs .
" Gleaning is n't really happening on a widespread basis across the United States , and most people have n't even heard of it , " Almquist says .
" I 've found some really wonderful volunteers who are excited about doing this every week and working it into their routine . "
Almquist 's quest to introduce gleaning is " quite inspiring , " says Ms. Snow , who is acting as her mentor for the fellowship .
" She has tremendous energy and drive and sees her potential to make an impact . "
Gleaning often means harvesting what a farmer can't sell , such as produce that has a bruise or mark on it .
Sometimes the vegetable may be the wrong size ( too large or small ) or the wrong shape .
Other times , farmers simply overplant and do n't have time to harvest it all .
" It 's been incredible how open farmers are to the idea of gleaning and how generous they 've been , " she says .
" Farmers do n't like to see food go to waste when they 've worked so hard to grow it . "
Another form of gleaning involves hauling away leftover produce from a farmers ' market at the end of the day .
" It 's such a simple concept – the food is already harvested , " she says .
Farmers do n't want to have to pack up produce and haul it back to their farms to compost it .
What kinds of crops can be gleaned ?
" Probably any crop you can think of I 've gleaned , " Almquist says .
Her hardest task has been picking beans , she says with a laugh .
" It 's so labor - intensive to pick green beans .
You can spend three hours and get 10 lbs. of green beans .
It does n't always feel worthwhile . "
There can be other challenges too .
On some farms , she says , " The weeds were so out of control that it was more like a scavenger hunt to try to find vegetables in the ground . "
Her favorite glean has been raspberries .
" People are so excited to get fresh fruit , especially berries , " she says .
" Those are so rare for people who eat from the food shelf . "
They can eat the fruit immediately , while " they may not know what to do with a bunch of kale . "
After she stops gleaning for the winter , Almquist plans to teach cooking and nutrition classes , helping food - shelf visitors learn how to blend fresh foods into their diets .
One idea : Place easy recipe cards in front of the produce .
" This is what you can do with turnips , " for example .
Ideally , people who take free food from a food shelf would help with gleaning .
But " that 's really a time issue , " she says .
" Many of the people using the food shelf are working multiple jobs and are already struggling to find time to cook and feed their families .
They do n't necessarily have time to come out and help pick . "
Food shelves also need to shift their thinking to accommodate gleaned food .
Many are n't prepared to store perishable commodities .
" Some food shelves are still reluctant to take [ fresh food ] .
They 're not sure what to do with it or whether their clients will want it , " she says .
" Part of the challenge with gleaning is finding food shelves with cold - storage facilities and space to refrigerate things . "
Another challenge is to time gleaning to the schedule of the food pantries , which may be open only once a week or less .
Besides introducing fresh food into the diets of those who rely on food shelves , gleaning also leaves a smaller carbon footprint .
The produce travels perhaps 10 or 15 miles " instead of thousands of miles – and arriving really tired and stale , " she says .
Almquist grew up in New Jersey ( " the Garden State , " she points out ) an hour outside New York City .
She worked on an organic farm in Vermont for a semester as a high school junior , which instilled a love of growing things .
But she had made a special connection with one plant long before then , as a preschooler .
" I befriended this giant bush in my backyard , " she says with a smile .
" I would talk with it for hours at a time , telling it my 4 - year - old woes .
And the bush would talk back . "
This image shows the progress of Spirit after its second drive attempt .
( Click on the image for a " before " and " after " animation . )
In the " after " image , Spirit 's left - front wheel has become slightly less buried in the soft soil in which the rover had become embedded about six months ago .
The right - front wheel , which has not been usable for driving since 2006 , has been pushed perceptibly forward by the drive .
The amount of forward motion is less than one percent of the distance that would have been covered on firm ground by the amount of wheel rotation commanded in the drive .
NASA 's bogged - down Mars rover Spirit hit another snag in itsattempt to free itself from a sand trap when one of its wheels stalled as ittried to move forward , NASA reports .
Spirit's wheel stalled during the second step of its thirddrive attempt since the effortto free it from a sandy feature called Troy began in earnest on Nov. 17 .
The rover also hit a snag during its first drive attempt last week when itsensed it was tilting too much and stopped spinning its wheels after just a fewseconds .
The wheel that stalled during the third attempt was therover 's right - rear wheel ; Spirit 'sleft - middle wheel also stalled back in May , but has since worked normally .
The stall occurred this time because the wheel 's progressfell behind the expected rotation rate .
The rover had completed about 13 feet ( 4 meters ) of commanded wheel spin before the stall stopped the drive .
Though the wheel spun for that distance , the rover did notactually move that far .
The center of the rover moved about 0.2 inch ( 4millimeters ) forward , 0.1 inch ( 3 millimeters ) to the left and about 0.1 inch ( 3 millimeters ) down , NASA said .
During its second drive attempt , the rover alsomoved forward slightly .
On Monday , the rover team planned to run a set ofdiagnostics to explore the right rear wheel stall .
The diagnostics will includea rotor resistance test , a possible steering test , a small backward rotation ofjust the right - rear wheel and a short ( about 3 feet , or 1 meter ) forwardcommanded motion of the rover .
Spirit wo n't attempt to drive again until Wednesday at theearliest , according to a NASA statement .
Spirit and itsrover twin , Opportunity , have been on Mars for nearly six years now .
Play.com said the incident took place in the early hours Customers of Play.com have contacted the BBC to report problems with the online retailer 's ordering system .
Many customers have received e-mails from Play.com reporting the despatch of an order they did not place .
Those opening the orders found contact details , including names and addresses , for other Play.com customers .
The problem appears to be widespread with many reporting Play.com help lines were jammed as they called to find out what had happened .
Simon Hurley from Clevedon near Bristol said he woke up this morning to find more than 80 e-mails from Play.com .
" I 'm a big customer of theirs but not that big , " he said .
" I opened up each individual e-mail and it came up with another customer 's name and their order . "
Although there were no credit card details visible in the e-mails , Mr Hurley said all the messages had scrambled text at the bottom that could hide some information .
" People are being told to shred documents and then you have a big company like Play.com sending out hundreds of wrong e-mails to their customers , " he said .
Mr Hurley said he rang Play.com to find out more but it took a long time to get through because the lines were " jammed solid " .
Once he reached someone in customer services he was told that Play.com had a " massive problem . "
So far it is not clear how many Play.com customers have received other people 's e-mails nor how many e-mails have been sent out .
However , in other discussion forums on the web some customers talked about how many erroneous e-mails they had received .
On some forums customers said they were told that a " system error " was behind the sending of the e-mails .
In a statement a Play.com spokesperson said : " We were alerted to an incident that appears to have affected some customers for a short period of time in the early hours of this morning , and the first thing we'd like to say is that we apologise for any inconvenience our customers have experienced as a result .
" We 'd like to reassure our customers that the cause of the incident has been identified and resolved .
" We take these matters very seriously and are now investigating how this incident occurred in the first place , so that we can prevent it happening in the future . "

Some Neanderthals may have had pale skin and red hair similar to that of some modern humans .
Editor 's Note :
This is Part 6 in a 10 - part LiveScience series on the origin , evolution and future of the human species and the mysteries that remain to be solved .
We are currently the only human species alive , but as recently as maybe 24,000 years ago another one walked the earth — the Neanderthals .
These extinct humans were the closest relatives we had , and tantalizing new hints from researchers suggest that we might have been intimately close indeed .
The mystery of whether Neanderthals and us had sex might possibly get solved if the entire Neanderthal genome is reported soon as expected .
The matter of why they died and we succeeded , however , remains an open question .
Maybe not nasty and brutish , but still short
First recognized in the Neander Valley in Germany in 1856 , Neanderthals revealed that modern humans possess a rich and complex family tree that includes now - extinct relatives .
Neanderthals — also called Neandertals , due to changes in German spelling over the years — had robust skeletons that gave them wide bodies and short limbs compared to us .
This made them more like wrestlers , while modern humans in comparison are more like long - distance runners .
They were probably less brutish and more like modern humans than commonly portrayed .
Their brains were at least as large as ours .
They controlled fire , expertly made stone tools , were proficient hunters , lived complex social groups and buried their dead .
The discovery of the remains of an adult male Neanderthal with severely deformed arm bones , suggesting a major disability perhaps since childhood , hints they may have taken care of their sick .
Genetic research even suggests they might have shared basic language capabilities with modern humans .
" They were a lot more closely related to us than anything alive today , " said paleoanthropologist Katerina Harvati at the University of Tübingen in Germany .
Why did Neanderthals go extinct ?
Roughly 30,000 years ago , the Neanderthals disappeared , although pockets might have survived until as recently as 24,000 years ago .
Since they vanished just as modern humans were emerging there , scientists have long speculated that we might have driven their extinction .
" I think we did away with our competition , " asserted paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall at the American Museum of Natural History in New York .
" We either did it indirectly by out - competing them over resources or directly by conflict .
Homo sapiens is completely different from any other hominid that ever existed — we process information about the world in a different way . "
Other scientists have suggested that Neanderthals were n't destroyed so much as absorbed by modern humans .
" Maybe they were wiped out by disease or by conquerors , but maybe they did leave important genes into our gene pool , " said paleoanthropologist Milford Wolpoff at the University of Michigan .
Paleoanthropologist Tim Weaver at the University of California at Davis also noted that our species apparently could live at higher population densities than Neanderthals .
As a result , this slight difference , with or without interbreeding , would have led to us replacing them .
" A lot of scenarios have been imagined , from peaceful ' flower child ' behavior to violent interactions to even cannibalism , " Harvati said .
" I think a lot of these scenarios happened .
I think we probably tried interbreeding and maybe it worked , maybe it did n't .
I 'm sure there was violence at times .
I think in some places they went extinct before modern humans even arrived .
But you do n't even need any of those if there is even a slight advantage in how many offspring modern humans produce successfully as opposed to Neanderthals . "
However , if Neanderthals did coincide with modern humans until 24,000 years ago , then we might not have had anything to do with their disappearance .
Instead , evolutionary biologist Clive Finlayson at the Gibraltar Museum in Spain speculates the Neanderthals fell victim to a cooling of the climate that deteriorated their environment too rapidly for them to adapt .
Did Neanderthals have sex with modern humans ?
Did hybrids occur between humans and Neanderthals ?
In a surprisingly bold statement , the leader of the international consortium of researchers sequencing the Neanderthal genome , Svante Pääbo , recently said he was " sure that they had sex . "
" Would they have recognized each other as possible mates ? " Harvati asked .
" We know when closely related primate species meet , they sometimes interbreed in nature , not just in zoos , and this is something we see not just in primates , but with other closely related species among mammals . "
Past research had shown that Neanderthal genomes and ours were 99.5 percent identical , based on DNA extracted from three Croatian fossils .
At an October conference in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York , Pääbo — a geneticist of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany — said the two species had sex , but it remained an open question as to whether children resulted and left a legacy in our genomes .
" It 's a good , valid idea , and it needs to be examined , " Harvati said .
" Uncovering this could be vital to understanding our own origins . "

Why Lieberman Blocks a Public Option
With the health - reform bill ’s “ public option ” truly reduced to the “ sliver ” that President Barack Obama once called it – and indeed having become a feature that mostly benefits the insurance industry – the next question must be : why is it still being opposed by industry defenders like Sen.
Joe Lieberman ?
Email
Printer friendly
As the health bill has moved through Congress , the public option has been whittled down from an expansive alternative that might have enticed 119 million Americans to sign up , according to an industry - backed study , to a tiny remnant that the Congressional Budget Office believes will attract only six million customers , including many sick people whom private insurers do n’t want anyway .
Put crudely , the public option in its current form would vacuum up the chronically ill and thus spare the insurance industry not only the expense of paying for their care but also the administrative costs of figuring out new creative ways to deny these sick people medical coverage .
According to the CBO , the planned “ insurance exchanges ” thus would give private insurers an estimated 24 million new – and relatively healthy – customers , many with government subsidies that would go directly into the coffers of the insurance industry .
Without the public option , the industry might get six million more customers but they would include lots of sick people .
That means the current legislation with a weak public option is a win - win - win for the insurance industry .
Its most lucrative market – large employers providing group benefits for employees – would be protected from competition from the public option ; the surviving public option for individuals and small businesses would be barred from achieving savings by tying payments to Medicare rates ; and the public option thus would get stuck charging higher premiums than private insurers because it would end up with the sickest part of the population , the CBO says .
So , from the perspective of an insurance executive , what ’s not to like ?
One obvious concern for private insurers would be that after the public option becomes available in 2013 through the insurance exchanges , Congress might be pressured by dissatisfied Americans to expand it into a real alternative to the harsh , profit - making practices of the insurance industry .
That is called the “ camel ’s nose under the tent ” theory .
Yet , while it ’s hard to predict the future , it seems equally plausible that the industry would be worse off if it succeeds in eliminating the public option or killing health - care reform outright .
As the U.S. health - care crisis worsens , private insurers and their political defenders could be blamed – and a more radical change might become possible .
That is the view of some progressives , such as Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , who believe the House - passed bill is so thoroughly compromised that it makes more sense to vote it down and start over , seeking either a “ robust ” public option tied to Medicare rates or a full - scale single - payer system that could prove the death knell for the insurance industry .
On balance , therefore , it would seem that the House - passed legislation and a similar bill in the Senate would represent a fairly safe – and reasonably profitable – bet for the industry , at least relative to the risks of stripping out the public option or simply blocking reform .
So Why All the Fuss ?
Which brings us to the question of why industry defenders are determined to sink the bill .
For the Republicans , the answer is easy : they want Obama to fail .
Sen. Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina , put it bluntly in July when he declared that “ If we ’re able to stop Obama on this , it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him . ”
For conservative Democrats , the answer is slightly more complex .
Operating in districts or states where right - wing media is particularly powerful and largely unchallenged , they may think they can achieve some safety by positioning themselves as independent - minded critics of Obama ’s agenda .
For someone like Lieberman , however , the political equation is more troubling .
An independent from Connecticut who caucuses with the Democrats and who kept his Homeland Security Committee chairmanship despite campaigning for Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008 , Lieberman seems eager to let his opposition to the public option be traced to a crass calculation of protecting Hartford - based insurance companies .
However , it ’s harder to explain why Lieberman – who portrays himself as a social reformer – would vow to join a Republican filibuster against a bill that , for all its faults , would guarantee insurance for tens of millions of uninsured Americans , especially if the bill also stands to be a multi-billion - dollar boon for his constituent insurance companies .
Suspicions are growing among some Democrats that Lieberman has remained the ideological turncoat that many progressives viewed him as when he aggressively supported George W. Bush ’s war in Iraq and urged Americans to reject Obama as someone with dubious patriotism .
On the stump with McCain in August 2008 , Lieberman even questioned Obama ’s commitment to the United States , calling the election a choice “ between one candidate , John McCain , who has always put the country first , worked across party lines to get things done , and one candidate who has not . ’’
So , maybe Lieberman wants to punish Obama for his perceived failure to take a harder line against Islamic militants in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere .
As a neoconservative , Lieberman also has long ranked as one of Israel ’s most devoted backers in the United States .
Mark Vogel , chairman of the pro-Israel National Action Committee , once said , “ Joe Lieberman , without exception , no conditions … is the No. 1 pro-Israel advocate and leader in Congress .
There is nobody who does more on behalf of Israel than Joe Lieberman . ”
Given Lieberman ’s staunch support for Israel , his resistance to Obama ’s health - care initiative could be tinged by a desire to weaken the President ’s ability to pressure Israel ’s hawkish Likud government regarding concessions on Middle East peace .
Much like the Republicans who hope that defeat of health reform will lead to their political revival in 2010 and 2012 , Lieberman may foresee neocons returning to power as well or at least a hobbled Obama unable to compel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt expansion of West Bank settlements or to take other steps that might lead to a Palestinian state .
If that ’s the case , Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid may find that Lieberman wo n’t budge on the public option – even if the bill is sweetened to help Hartford - based insurance companies ensure bigger profits .

At first , people around this small farming town - even the horses grazing alongside the fence - seemed puzzled about the uniformed men who came to dig for the glass jars .
Now they know why .
And their curiosity has turned to hand - over - the - mouth shock .

Police say that for years Burrell Mohler and his sons , well known in the Bates City community and active in the church , led a bizarre , ritualistic child sex ring that included bestiality and the rape and sodomy of the elder Mohler 's grandchildren .
They held mock weddings in which girls as young as five would be paired with their father , uncles or grandfather and sent to the privacy of a chicken coop for consummation .

The National Library of Australia ( NLA ) in Canberra has uncovered a rare image of the arrival of Roald Amundsen 's 1911 expedition at the South Pole .
The small , brown photo is the only print in the world taken from the original negatives of the event .
The image was discovered by National Library of Norway curator Harald Ostgaard Lund while he was searching the NLA collection on the internet .
NLA picture curator Linda Groom says the photo was part of an album entitled ' Tasmanian Views ' which was catalogued and scanned in 2002 .
" We knew then it was a photograph of the Amundsen expedition at the South Pole , what we did n't realise was that it was the only one in the world , " she said .
Ostgaard Lund found clues to its origins from the NLA 's catalogue , including the print 's dimensions .
From those he was able to work out that it was taken directly from a negative .
He flew to Canberra and confirmed its value which Ms Groom says was an exciting moment .
" He had seen other copies of the print cropped , doctored so that the flag flew much more prominently and doctored so that Amundsen 's stomach was much trimmer but he had never actually seen the original , " she said .
" He was thrilled , and he 's decided to request the loan of the album for an exhibition in Norway . "
Developing the images
Amundsen 's first port of call on returning from the Antarctic in 1912 was Hobart , where he gave his negatives to well - known Hobart photographer JW Beattie .
Ms Groom says it appears Beattie gave the job to his young assistant Edward Searle , who later compiled them in an album of career highlights .
" Some of them are very nice Tasmanian views , as you would expect and then there are two pages of photographs related to Amundsen expedition , " she said .
The album was purchased by the NLA from Searle 's family in 1965 but they believe the negatives no longer exist .
Ms Groom says it is poignant that another almost identical photo was taken by Robert Scott 's expedition five weeks later .
" His diary records the moment , it says ' Great god this is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority ' , " she said .
" The comparison of those two photos really tells a story . "
Worth the effort
The NLA is currently digitising its entire image collection and making it available on the internet .
Ms Groom says many early photo albums were catalogued as one volume which makes it difficult to identify individual images .
So far the library has scanned 100,000 of its 700,000 image collection but Ms Groom says it is discoveries like Ostgaard Lund 's that make the painstaking project worthwhile .
" When you see the effect of what we 've done , and people as far away as Norway in the quite unlikely situation that this photograph should be hiding in an album of Tasmanian views , that 's part of what makes it so satisfying . "
London , 2 July 2009 - The partners of Research4 Life announced today at the World Conference of Science Journalists 2009 that a new research impact analysis has demonstrated a dramatic rise in research output by scientists in the developing world since 2002 .
By comparing absolute growth in published research before ( 1996 - 2002 ) and after ( 2002 - 2008 ) the advent of the Research4 Life programmes , the analysis has revealed a 194 % or 6.4 - fold increase in articles published in peer reviewed journals .
Research4Life is the collective name given to HINARI , AGORA and OARE , the three public - private partnerships that offer health , agriculture and environmental research for free or at very low cost to developing countries .
Key partners include WHO , FAO , UNEP , Cornell and Yale Universities , the International Association of Scientific , Technical and Medical Publishers and Microsoft as the technology partner .
Over 150 publishers , among them Elsevier , Springer , Wiley - Blackwell and Oxford University Press provide the journal content .
The analysis , conducted by Elsevier 's Associate Director of Scientometrics & Market Analysis , Dr Andrew Plume , showed that absolute growth in research between 1996 - 2002 was 25 % in non Research4 Life countries ( countries not eligible due to their GNI per capita ) , 22 % in Band 1 countries ( eligible countries with less than $ 1250 annual per capita income or GNI ) and 30 % in Band 2 countries ( eligible countries with $ 1251 to $ 3500 GNI ) .
Five years on , between 2002 - 2008 , the same figures are dramatically higher at 67 % , 145 % and 194 % respectively indicating 2.6- , 6.5 - and 6.4 - fold increases over the 1996 - 2002 growth .
Dr Plume used a database sourced from Thomson Reuters to count the appearance of each country in the author affiliations of indexed journal articles , and then grouped these countries by their Research4 Life eligibility .
In addition , an in - depth look at three selected Band 1 countries , ( Nigeria , Kenya , and Tanzania ) and one Band 2 country ( Bulgaria ) reveals a remarkable progression of article output from 1996 - 2008 .
By contrast , the non Research4 Life country Japan ( for example ) showed steady and continuous growth over this period without a sharp change in output over the period analysed .
" The opportunities to conduct original scholarly research without access to the world 's published literature are limited .
Discoveries build on generations of research done previously , " remarked Kimberly Parker , HINARI Program Manager at the WHO .
" Research4 Life has extended the reach of that scholarly heritage into the developing world , increasing researchers ' opportunities to participate in the global research community by conducting groundbreaking research , collaborating with global colleagues , and in time contributing to evidence - based scientific policy in their own countries .
We are very excited to see the growing output coming from the developing world . "
Dr Andrew Plume noted , " The massive and sustained growth in scholarly output from the Research4 Life countries , over and above the growth for the rest of the world , is probably the result of many related factors such as scientific policy , government and private research funding , and other global developments .
However , such a dramatic increase in research output also reflects a clear correlation with the launch of the Research4 Life programmes .
These statistics point to Research4 Life 's profound impact on institutions and individual researchers ' ability to publish . "
" Since we have had access to Research4 Life , the researchers , and especially the clinicians at the College of Medicine , University of Port Harcourt , have been able to engage more with the global science community , " stated Henrietta Otokunefor , Automation Librarian at the University of Port Harcourt Library in Nigeria .
" The library computers and those at the ICTC for faculty are often occupied and I 've seen a growth in published research from our students as well .
It is great to see that Nigeria has made progress in this area as increased scientific developments can lead to improved health and economics , and in the end , a better quality of life . "
The results of the impact analysis are further illustrated by Research4 Life 's recent institutional growth findings announced in May 2009 .
OARE , the Online Access to Research in the Environment program has registered 1500 institutions since its launch in 2006 , an increase of nearly 700 percent .
The Health Access to Research programme : HINARI has grown by 61 % since 2006 so that researchers at 3,866 not - for - profit institutions in 108 countries now have access to over 6,300 medical and health journals .
AGORA or Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture has increased registrants by 77 % since 2006 , providing researchers at 1,760 developing world institutions with access to 1,276 food , agriculture , and related social sciences journals .

Notes to Editors :
A Research4 Life reception will be held at the World Conference of Science Journalists on Thursday , July 2 18:30 - 20:00 at Central Hall Westminster .

BANGALORE --
Hair tucked into a surgical cap , eyes hidden behind thick - framed magnifying glasses , Devi Shetty leans over the sawed open chest of an 11 - year - old boy , using bright blue thread to sew an artificial aorta onto his stopped heart .
As Dr. Shetty pulls the thread tight with scissors , an assistant reads aloud a proposed agreement for him to build a new hospital in the Cayman Islands that would primarily serve Americans in search of lower - cost medical care .
The agreement is inked a few days later , pending approval of the Cayman parliament .
Dr. Shetty , who entered the limelight in the early 1990s as Mother Teresa 's cardiac surgeon , offers cutting - edge medical care in India at a fraction of what it costs elsewhere in the world .
His flagship heart hospital charges $ 2,000 , on average , for open - heart surgery , compared with hospitals in the U.S. that are paid between $ 20,000 and $ 100,000 , depending on the complexity of the surgery .
The approach has transformed health care in India through a simple premise that works in other industries : economies of scale .
By driving huge volumes , even of procedures as sophisticated , delicate and dangerous as heart surgery , Dr. Shetty has managed to drive down the cost of health care in his nation of one billion .
His model offers insights for countries worldwide that are struggling with soaring medical costs , including the U.S. as it debates major health - care overhaul .
My three dimensional unfolding of the quaternion Julia sets finally finished rendering .
There are a fair bit of compression artifacts in the embedded version , click on the Vimeo button on the bottom right side of the video to watch it in full quality HD .
Since each quaternion can be described using four numbers , I unfolded these four dimensional quaternion Julia sets into three dimensional space , and animated the final coefficient .
But once I did that I noticed some radial symmetry along the y-z plane – it looks like something that ’s been made on a lathe .
This means that we can “ index ” all these shapes in a more sensible manner by collapsing things along this axis of symmetry .
While previously we could index all of our shapes with four coefficients a , b , c , and d .
We can now index them with four coefficients a , r , theta , and d after this transformation .
But there ’s a nice side effect now that our coordinate system reflects our symmetry – if we vary theta , the appearance of the Julia set does n’t change , the object just appears to rotate about the a axis .
So really we can index all possible shapes using only three coefficients – a , r , and d .
This is awesome – it means we can use this symmetry to collapse a dimension and completely illustrate a discrete approximation of this four dimensional set in three dimensional space .
The following images ( click for 1080 p full resolution images ) illustrate the full set of these possible shapes – a is the horizontal axis , r is the vertical axis , and values iterate by 0.25 .
The grey sphere in the first image is the origin , and the images start at a d value of 0 and iterate upward by 0.25 .
We find that there exists additional symmetry with our d parameter – namely that d = -d , so we only need to illustrate the absolute value to see all shapes .
d = 0.00
d = 0.25
d = 0.50
d = 0.75
d = 1.00
When d = 1.25 there are only a few bits of unconnected dust loops visible .
This analysis only covers a single “ slice ” – namely the plane normal to ( 0,0,0,1 ) .
I ’d be very interested to see if there are any other symmetries …
He knows that by indulging his palate he 's playing with fire .

Zombieland co-writer Rhett Reese was shocked when he discovered more than a million people had downloaded his movie illegally on BitTorrent .
The Hollywood writer has now penned yet another horror scenario , claiming that this achievement could very well prevent a sequel to the successful movie from being made .
Yesterday we wrote about the makers of the film Ink , who thanked piracy for promoting their film .
“ We ’ve embraced the piracy and are just happy Ink is getting unprecedented exposure , ” they said .
Ink was downloaded more than 400,000 times last week and ended up in fourth place in our weekly chart of most downloaded movies on BitTorrent , where Zombieland occupied the top spot .
Zombieland co-writer Rhett Reese has been following our most pirated movies chart as well , and thus the online success of his film .
“ Zombieland currently the most pirated movie on bit torrent .
Over one million downloads and counting , ” he tweeted a few hours ago .
However , unlike the makers of Ink , Reese is not pleased with this achievement , claiming that this piracy disaster may very well prevent a Zombieland sequel from being shot .
“ Beyond depressing .
This greatly affects the likelihood of a Zombieland 2 , ” he wrote .
Reese ’s comments are the classic Hollywood response we wrote about yesterday .
Piracy is causing billions of dollars in lost revenue and prevents new movies from being funded , is the doomsday scenario they often paint .
But is there any truth in this hunch , or is it just another Hollywood performance ?
Facts seem to support the latter .
More piracy is not necessarily linked with a drop in box office grosses or DVD sales .
‘ The Dark Knight ’ , which was the most downloaded movie on BitTorrent in 2008 sold millions of DVDs , and grossed a record breaking billion dollars in cinemas worldwide .
But what about Zombieland ?
The Hollywood Insider wrote that the movie is “ alive and kicking ” at the box office , putting its success down in part to “ strong word - of - mouth ” .
The release also marks the most successful debut of Woody Harrelson ’s career , hitting the No.1 spot and taking $ 9.4 m on its first day and a worldwide $ 84 m to date – all this on a production budget of less than $ 24 m .
Zombieland grossed more than $ 60.8 million in 17 days , even surpassing the remake of the Dawn of the Dead to become the top - grossing zombie film in history .
That does not really sound like something that will prevent a sequel to us .
On the contrary , if anything success on BitTorrent has a direct relation with success at the box office .
Since unauthorized ripped versions of virtually all movies appear on the Internet nowadays , it would be a really bad sign if no pirate would want to download it .
But of course , Reese and others could still argue that they would have made even more money if there was no piracy .
There are no hard facts to refute this , but with the box office revenue steadily increasing since P2P file - sharing became mainstream , it has to be doubted as well .
The same can be said for the claim that less films receive funding .
As many independent filmmakers have already experienced , BitTorrent and the Internet in general can be a boon to the film industry .
Instead of seeing it as a threat Hollywood might want to embrace it before it ’s too late .
We are on our way !
Today is the first official day of our journey to Alaska .
We will be leaving at 10 am sharp from Renfro Valley KOA , Kentucky .
This first day will take us soutwest towards Somerset , with final destination Burnside State Park .
This morning we are going through our belongings to see what we can do without .
The journey yesterday was a very hard one .
Part because we did n't ride in the previous week , part because we just have way to much stuff , which slowed us down tremendously .
We are very excited that the day has come .
It has been very enjoyable preparing for our journey , as well as very strenuous and nerve wrecking from time to time .
We are off now and we have faith that it will work out .
We are very appreciative of our sponsors who have helped us and are still helping us undertake this journey .
Saturday , August 1 , 2009
Miles today : 22 , Total miles : 22
Campsite :
At a BP filling station near Somerset , Kentucky
Weather : Enough sun to get sunburned
A day to remember .
While we were packing to go on our first official day of the journey to Alaska , friends and family came rolling in to give us a major send off .
Going through our stuff was the hardest part .
What can we really do without ?
Well , quite a lot it turns out .
Although the truth of that statement can only be proven by the next months to come .
Help with packing came from all directions .
It was a beautiful display of love and friendship .
The girls got another chance to say good bye to their dear friends , and so did we .
When time to depart arrived many a tear was shed .
Then off we went , leaving Renfro Valley KOA behind us .
It has become a reality , we are on our way .
At the road the Mount Vernon Police and Fire Department are waiting for us .
They are escorting us all the way around Mount Vernon .
We are very thankful for their help with getting us on our way safely .
The Police and Fire Department went back to town , when we passed the last junction back to Mount Vernon .
It is up to us now to keep us safe on the road .
We can't say we are all alone now , because we have met the most kind and generous and sincere people on the road today .
We have received space on the road , honking horns for cheers , a person pulling off the road to pass us a couple of eye rinsers as used by motorcyclists , a gentleman purchasing peaches for us from Peach City , where the owners offered us bananas and a bathroom .
The girls have discovered a beautiful rock to have a break on .
It turns out to have barnacles on it , which means this rock must have been below sea level at one time , long , long ago .
Barnacles
At one of our breaks a crew of the WKYT 27 tv station from Lexington , Kentucky pulled over to do an interview with us .
They have followed us for a couple of miles to get some shots of us in action .
As we were told later , it was on the 6 o'clock news !
Everywhere we stop we strike up conversations .
People are wondering where we are going and of course why we are doing it .
The girls hand out our cards with web address to everyone that is interested in going to Alaska with us .
We truly hope we are an inpiration to others , to not give up on your dreams , to live life to the fullest and to do acts of kindness to one another .
Today we aimed to arrive at Burnside State Park .
We settled for a grassy field near the BP filling station off of Highway 80 .
We are to the end of our rope for today .
Before setting up camp we sit down for a while and let the day sink in .
We did n't get as far as we had hoped , but we gave it our all and we made it further then if we had n't went at all .
A journey of 7,000 miles starts with one stroke of the pedal .
Today we have done many .
It is a hustle bustle of traffic here at the filling station .
Lots of enthusiastic people , eager to hear about our journey .
The girls receive slush puppies .
All of us receive many blessings .
A man offers us a place to camp at his farm , 8 miles down the road .
Although this is very tempting , we decide to stay where we are .
Many pictures are taken of the bicycle .
We are used to it 's size and uniqueness now , but it sure is an eye catcher .
After setting up the tent and putting our things in it , we have time to rest a while .
Amarins , Cheyenne and Jasmine go inside the filling station to enjoy the airconditioning and play a game of Skip - Bo .
Jasmine is getting really good at recognizing the numbers .
Both Cheyenne and Jasmine are learning how to use the Skip - Bo's to their advantage .
Bill and Robin stay in the tent to rest .
Our dear friends Regina and Julio , with children Nathan , Erika , Jonathan and Victoria are bringing us supper tonight .
Ham , mashed potatoes , corn , macaroni and cheese and watermelon for dessert , as well as cake to celebrate that today is Jonathan 's birthday .
Jonathan is the first to receive a birthday card form us on this journey .
Do you have a child or grandchild who would like to receive a card ?
Click here !
Amarins ' library friend Wendy , with husband and daughters Destiny and Brandy also stop by .
It is an enjoyable reunion .
After this wonderful supper has filled our bellies , it is time for us to turn in and get some rest .
Tomorrow is another day ...
Click here to see more pictures of today 's journey .
Sunday , August 2 , 2009 Miles today : 15 , Total miles : 37
Campsite : Burnside State Park , south of Somerset , Kentucky
Weather : Cold and warm , cloudy and sunny ; just your ordinary weather forecast
Flat tires : 1 , Total 1
Falls with bicycle : 1 , Total 1
A filling station is a very noisy place to spend the night .
Still we all feel rested in the morning .
We have orange juice , coffee and a ham and cheese sandwich for breakfast .
We are not really hungry , munching seems to work better , so we wrap the remaining sandwich for on the road .
Apparently many people have been watching the news .
From time to time people stop by to tell us they saw us on tv yesterday .
It is like we have become overnight celebrities .
Yet let us remember that we are just ordinary people .
We eat , we sleep , we use the bathroom .
We make mistakes just like everybody else .
We are following our dream and we are hoping to inspire you to follow yours .
It takes us a while to get ready to ride , but once we are ready we are off .
Again we aim to get to Burnside State Park .
We are only a couple of miles down the road when Bill abrubtly brings us to a stop .
We have our first flat tire !
Bill has dodged nuts , bolts , screws , cigaret lighters , knife blades , cell phones and much more , but it is a little piece of wire , which seems to come out of a wire brush , that is stuck in the front wheel .
Amarins and the girls get off the bike and use it as an extra break .
We have something to eat and get to strech our legs .
Bill is getting his tools out to get the ' tire flipper ' .
But it is not there .
A police officer sees our struggle and pulls over to ask whether he can help .
Yes he can .
The police unit has a bicycle squad , so he will get their ' tire flipper ' for us to use .
In the mean while we rack up our brains to see what we could use to get the tire off .
Amarins comes up with the solution : our tablespoons .
They have a flat end at the back that is just right to flip the tire of it's rim .
Then the hole is easily fixed .
We wait for the cop to return before we are off again .
We thank him profusely for his effort .
And we are off again .
We are taking the by - pass around Somerset .
A nice rolling hill road .
With our bicycle clock broken , we only have the mile markers to go by .
Cheyenne is learning to add and subtract and Jasmine is learning to count .
Both of them have the basic number skills down already , but this puts it in a more useful perspective .
Twice we have to merge into traffic to get to the traffic light to turn left .
Twice this works out very well .
The cars around us mind us well and give us enough space to make the crossings safely .
South of Somerset we pick up highway 27 .
We will be staying on this highway for about the next one hundred miles .
Today we are only going about five miles on it , until we see the turn off for Burnside State Park .
We are riding through the little village of Burnside .
At the local supermarket we buy some protein - full supplies and some extra water .
We drink a lot of water during our rides .
The girls have learned to drink it too .
A couple more miles and we will be at our destination for today .
Being so close we think we can make it there and then have something to eat .
Not a good idea .
We have run out of energy to take us up the little hill to the camping .
We need many stops to make it .
After one of them , our start is wrong and we tip the bike over .
We are all fine and learned a valuable lesson : eat sooner .
We walk the remaining part of the hill and stop at a picnic area with playground .
We fill our bodies with energy and rest for a while before we get to the campground .
At the campground we find a nice spot under some shade trees .
The park has a playground , which is immediately put to use by the girls .
There are several other children to play with , so this adds to the fun .
While the girls play , Bill and Amarins set up camp .
We will be here for our rest day too .
The park has bathroom facilities with showers and a laundromat .
Before we take our showers we line up with our lifeline Barbara to bring us some dry milk , beef jerky and supper .
After our showers , we all crawl in the tent for a refreshing nap .
Being outdoors , absorbing new images , exercizing ; it all gives a fulfilling feeling .
Before we know it we are all asleep .
Picture taken by Jasmine .
After our nap Barbara arrives .
She brought all sorts of delights .
For supper we are having rotissery chicken , potato salad and coleslaw .
There is also chips and watermelon to go with it .
For breakfast we will have premade pancakes , strawberries , pear jam and bananas .
Since we are staying another day , we can spread it out over the day .
Visiting with Barbara is very enjoyable .
The girls received bubblesticks , which can also be used as magic wands , weapons and batons .
Barbara told us that bubbles in the winter is an experience by itself .
The bubbles will freeze and last for a long time .
When we get to Fairbanks , Alaska next summer , we will stock up on some bubble sticks and enjoy that that next winter .
It has again been a good day .
We crawl in bed and before we know it the lights are out .

Miles today : 0 , Total miles : 37
Campsite : Burnside State Park , south of Somerset , Kentucky
Weather : A foggy morning that was run off by a bright sun
Flat tires : 0 , Total 1
Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 1
We start the morning with working on the journal .
All three girls have a journal .
They will work on it one page a day .
The bottom half is for writing , the top half is for making a drawing .
Cheyenne writes on 5 lines about the experiences of the day .
This time it is about going to blow bubbles in wintertime .
The bottom is for practicing her cursive abc's .
At the top she has made a drawing of poison ivy .
Jasmine copies today 's date in her journal .
She also has a memorable experience written in her journal .
That is done by Amarins .
At the bottom she practises her block abc's .
Robin is just going to town with the pencils .
She is part of the journalling and that is the important part .
In the meanwhile Bill is preparing breakfast : smoked pancakes .
They look like pancakes , but they taste like smoke , even covered with pear jam .
At least they are nice and hot .
It is a new experience .
After breakfast and working on the journal it is time to go to the playground and meet new friends .
The girls are having a wonderful time .
There is a big sand box with lots of toys , there are swings and a climbing unit with slides .
They are having a ball .
While the girls are playing , Amarins cleans up the tent and prepares for laundry .
Just your ordinary daily stuff .
We need to do it too .
Bill is working on the bicycle .
Making sure everything is all right for the next day journey .
Burnside State Park is a nice campground .
Peaceful during the day , yet a little noisy during the night .
Lots of train traffic .
We actually thought there was a thunderstorm upon us !
The laundry facility is supurb .
Everything is nice and cleand and ready to go .
Because tomorrow we are leaving again , we decide to put everything we do n't need today back in the trailer .
That will safe us time with getting ready in the morning .
For supper we are invited by the Fitzpatrick & Heron families .
Hamburgers , hotdogs , baked beans , fresh tomatoes , chips .
Again a feast .
After supper it is yet again time for us to crawl in .
Tomorrow we plan on getting up with the sun .
We hope to leave by about 7 am .
Destination : Whitley City , Kentucky ; about 24 miles .
Tuesday , August 4 , 2009 Today 24 miles , Total 62 miles
Campsite : Visitor Center Park , Whitley City , Kentucky
Weather : A nice and cool cloudy day , afternoon thunderstorms
Flat tires : 0 , Total 1
Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 1 Getting up early was a great idea .
Most of the trailer was loaded , so we were ready to go in no time .
This was partly due to not having breakfast ...
As part of the preparation , Amarins laid out our breakfast items before going to bed .
Beef jerky , some crackers , bananas , a couple of apples , yummy .
Well , it would have been , if a raccoon ( or other climbing critter ) had n't climbed in the tree to get it .
Lesson here : even though you do n't see animals in the park during the day , it does n't mean there are none !
When Amarins and Bill come back from the bathroom , there is quite some comotion at the tent .
Cheyenne is n't feeling well and had to throw up .
Smart enough she did it outside of the tent .
Now this is out of her system , she is ready to go , although not whole heartedly .
The hills are rolling .
An uphill slope can sometimes be over a mile long .
We are getting used to these long hills .
It are the first hundred strokes after a break that are the hardest .
Once we are past this breaking point we can easily do another 2 - 3 hundred strokes .
Somewhere midway between Burnside and Whitley City , in what seems to be a little ghost town , we are taking a break .
A beautiful lawn with humongous trees and even a little slide provides a perfect spot to have a pick - nick .
The girls are enjoying the slide tremendously .
Picture taken by Jasmine .
This break was exactly what we needed to give our muscles a chance to recover .
It is not only a muscle game , as it is also a mind game .
It would be so easy to just stop pedalling at times .
Hill after hill after hill .
The mind starts to wonder what the use of it is .
Then out of the blue a beautiful memory is created .
This time by this great place to take a break , the laughter of the girls , the sparkle in their eyes .
Then the mind knows .
We lost our flag this morning , so Amarins ties a red tanktop to the flagpole .
It holds on for a while , but apparently also decides to fly off .
We do n't realize this , until a car stops in front of us and we are handed the tanktop back .
Out of coincidence or not , the man is Greg Bird , he writes for the McGreary County Voice .
Greg would like to take some pictures of us in action .
Which is of course fine with us .
He will meet us later at the Burger King for an interview .
Manager Tayna of Burger King Whitley City has offered us a free lunch .
Again the universe is providing .
Thank you Tanya .
It is another six miles to Whitley City , but we can already smell lunch .
Amarins decides to count how many strokes are in an uphill mile , while we are going in our lowest gear .
It takes about one thousand strokes .
That is quite daunting .
It does put the hills in perspective .
" Oh , this is just a three hundred stroke hill .
Piece of cake . "
" This hill took way more than one thousand strokes .
What a monster hill ! "
When we get to Whitley City , someone runs after us trying to get us to stop .
We do n't realize it at first until Cheyenne notifies us .
Peter Ferrara , from another Whitley City newspaper , would like to take our picture .
This provides a great break .
We are in the last mile or so , the hardest part of the day .
We agree to meet Peter at the Burger King as well .
The sign of Burger King has never looked so good .
A chicken salad , a hamburger , macaroni and cheese , combined with turbo coffee and some soda gives us the energy to do the interviews .
While Bill is doing most of the talking , Amarins enjoys a pieceful lunch .
The girls enjoy the crowns and the paper to draw on .
Cheyenne makes the most interesting drawing ... a picture of her " regurgitated food " of this morning .
Quite a likeness too ...
After the interview we go one more mile to the Visitor Center .
They are friendly enough to let us set up camp next to the building .
There is a little gazebo we can use to park the bicycle on .
It is supposed to storm later on today .
Next to the Visitor Center is the library .
When we are all set up for the night we walk over there .
Bill reads stories to the girls and has them work on their journal , while Amarins has time to update the website .
While we are in the library , a giant thunderstorm hits .
We are safe and sound inside .
When Bill checks on the tent all is well , with only a couple of specks of water in one corner .
When the library closes , the ladies of the library are so concerned about more upcoming storms and us being out there in the tent , they give us the key to the hall way , in case we need to hide for a storm .
How very thoughtful .
The evening provides us with more rain , but no more storms .
Amarins , Cheyenne and Jasmine play some Skip - Bo. Bill plays with Robin .
While we are playing , Greg stops by , to see if we are doing alright .
Some other people stop by to check on us too .
They offer Bill a ride to Kroger , where he gets us a rotissery chicken for supper .
During supper a lady from the local museum stops by to take a picture of us with the bicycle .
We are going to be added to the local museum .
Go check it out next time you are in Whitley City .
Bill asked Peter to stop by with some cubed watermelon in the evening .
It is about 8 pm and there he is .
Jasmine has already fallen asleep , but Robin and Cheyenne are still wide awake .
Peter did not only bring watermelon , but also a harmonica and a guitar .
While we are enjoying the watermelon , Peter is singing songs and playing the instruments .
Especially Cheyenne is enjoying it tremendously .
She has a harmonica herself and is practising from time to time on it .
For Jasmine we make a little movie , so she can hear it too .

Weather : Foggy , misting , with a pinch of rain
Flat tires : 0 , Total 1
Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 1
It is dry this morning .
Amarins walks the mile to Burger King and back , to provide for breakfast .
Cini-minis , french toast , bacon / egg / cheese croissant , combined with orange juice , chocolate milk and turbo coffee , are a good start to get ready to go .
Thanks again , Tayna from Whitley City Burger King for your hospitality .
After breakfast , the tent is dry enough to pack up .
The gazebo provides a perfect place to gather our things and organize them .
At 8.30 am we are ready to pull out .
We drop the key to the library off in the book drop and are on our way .
A little loop over main street brings us back to highway 27 south .
Today 's destination is Oneida , Tennessee .
A new state on the journey !
The hills do n't give us any problems .
We know the drill .
Pedal , pedal , pedal , rest .
Pedal , pedal , pedal , rest .
The drizzle keeps us nice and cool .
The girls are wearing raincoats , so they are protected from it .
We are on a roll this morning and arrive in Tennessee by mid morning .
Photo - op of course .
One of the people we call from the Tennessee line is Larry , from IMAXradio where we do our radio broadcast every Friday at 2 pm .
He has a surprise for us .
He has arranged for us to stay in the Oneida Guest House , in ( you guessed it ) Oneida Tennessee .
It is a two bedroom suite with a jacuzi bath tub .
That certainly keeps us going !
We dodge the mist as much as we can and arrive in Oneida at noon .
Another 19 miles bites the dust .
We lug our luggage up the stairs and are totally blown away by the suite Larry has arranged for us .
Staying in a tent might have changed our perception , but this certainly is supurb .
Thanks Larry !
First things first ... of course we start off with a bubble bath .
How wonderful it feels on the muscles .
After we are all clean we have a chance to take a nap in the real beds .
It takes a whole lot of strenght and will power to undertake a journey this big .
A nap is just what we need .
After this rest , we decide it is a good time for supper .
We eat at Preston 's Steakhouse .
A total western style restaurant .
Great relaxing athmosphere , delicious food .
We are celebrating our anniversary as well as our first state line .
Back at the Guest House , Bill works some on the bicycle , gets us a new flag for on the bicycle ( a Tennessee flag ... ) and does a load of laundry at a local laundromat .
Amarins works on updating the website , but without any luck .
Yet again it has been a day full of blessings and enjoyment .
Clean , warm and cozy , we soon fall asleep .

Campsite : Jimmy Jones ' home in Wartburg , Tennessee
Weather : Foggy and cool in the morning , warm and sweaty in the afternoon
Flat tires : 1 , Total 2
Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 1
We are on a roll today !
After a wonderful night on a real bed , we feel refreshed to hit the road again .
According to schedule today is our day off , but since we are not going to stay another night at the guest house , we just as well get a couple of miles out of the way .
We jet off around 8 am .
It is a little foggy when we start out , so we turn the blinking lights on the trailer on .
The road is relatively ' flat ' , so the first 10 miles are behind us quickly .
We do n't know what today 's destination is , Robbins , Elgin or perhaps even Wartburg .
Going thru Robbins shows us no space to camp or a place to refresh , so we keep on going .
Roadworks are ahead of us .
They are fixing one side of the road , so it is a one lane road for a while .
The road worker says we will be just fine .
He even radio's ahead that we are coming .
Somehow patience must have run out , because half a mile before we reach the end of the road works , heavy traffic is coming our way .
The shoulder is only two , maybe three feet wide , so that does not give any respite .
To our disbelief , traffic is not giving us an inch .
It is a if we are invisible .
It is a very scary experience .
We are glad when the road works are behind us .
Phew .
We actually are ready for a break , but decide to go a little further , to leave the road works behind us as far as possible .
Well , a break we are getting ...
It comes with a flat tire !
Number two , and only six road days sofar !
Bill uses a pine log to put the bicycle on , so he can take the rear tire out of the frame .
The rear tire is the flat one this time .
This time it is not obvious where the hole is , so Bill takes out the flat inner tube ( using the spoon method again ) and puts in a new one that we took with us .
The girls and Amarins take advantage of the break and have some snacks .
It is getting towards noon and we still have n't found a place to camp .
The sun has burned off the fog and it is getting warm , and muggy .
The next town on the map is Sunbright .
We are in bigger hills now .
What goes down must go up it seems .
We 've done about 19 miles when we get to a beautiful view .
It is a just reward for getting to the top of the hill .
A breathtaking view .
We get to cruise down into the city limits of Sunbright .
And there is nothing there , except for some houses .
Being ready for a break , we decide to have a pick nick under some trees , when an older gentleman invites us to have our pick nick on his property .
The gentleman is JP Morgan , a basket of knowledge about the area .
He is glad to share with us the history of the old homestead .
Indians used to travel where we are sitting , on their way from what we now call Knoxville to Nashville .
According to Mr Morgan it is about another 12 miles to Wartburg , a little bigger town with some stores .
Since the morning went so well , we think this will be easy .
According to descriptions , it is mostly downhill .
Two , maybe three uphill parts ...
Up the hill and down the hill , up the hill and down the hill we go .
Oh , we are so tired .
We know we could have pitched our tent in Sunbright and we would have been just fine .
We have plenty of food , we have plenty of water .
But no , we decide Wartburg is our destination .
It should take us only two hours or so .
We now know it took us 3 and a half hours , including an hour break in the enjoyable Pilot Mountain Diner .
Here we play some cards and have some protein filled food .
The people are very warm and friendly and do n't mind us lingering at all .
In the diner we meet Jimmy Jones from Wartburg .
He offers us his home to stay for the night .
Strengtened from this hour break , we are conquering the last 9 miles with many many stops and goes .
But we make it .
Close to 6 pm , after a 10 hour journey , we arrive at Jimmy 's place .
When we get there , Jimmy has supper ready .
Thank you very much Jimmy !
The evening is spend outdoors .
The girls run and play with the dog .
They wrestle with Amarins and Bill in the grass .
You can hardly tell they 've been on a long journey today .
After a pleasurable evening with Jimmy , it is good resting at night .

We sure slept well , till after 8 am .
It wo n't be an early start today .
A breakfast of oatmeal and bacon hits the spot .
After that we are ready to get on the road again .
When we get out of town it is basically down hill for a long time .
A beautiful creek runs along side the road .
Big boulders in the creek result in white rapids .
Too bad there is not a spot where we can park and put our feet in the creek .
Going down hill almost feels like cheating , but it also feels great .
The wind is blowing in our hair , the creek provides a cool breeze .
Approximately eight miles on our way we take a break .
It is n't one of the better spots , but a big hill is ahead of us , so we figure this is just as good a spot as any .
Just 200 yards further down the road we would have found a much better spot .
Under a shade tree , with a view of a lovely meadow filled with yellow flowers .
It is part of the journey .
We do not know what lies ahead of us , thus we take it the way it comes .
Eight more miles will take us to Harriman .
With our late start we decide that that is the town for a big break .
We want to make it to Kingston today .
Kingston is located on Watts Bar Lake , where the Tennessee and Clinch river meet .
In Harriman we find an Elementary school to have our big break .
The secretary of the school sees us come and invites us into the school , where we meet the principal and the teachers .
The teachers just happen to be in a meeting .
We get to share about our journey .
One of the teachers , Laura , offers us a place to stay for the night in Kingston .
Just what we were hoping for .
We stay at the school for over an hour .
Cheyenne and Jasmine are working on projects with natural materials they find .
They are so creative .
They use what is around them .
Bill goes shopping for water and comes back with his hands full .
When a man goes shopping ...
Rested from a good break .
Strenghtened with food and drinks .
Played out ... well , are they ever ?
We are ready to head to Kingston .
Only one big hill lies between Harriman and Kingston .
Up the big hill we stop from time to time .
At one of the times a couple from Michigan stops and hands out popsicles to all of us .
How refreshing !
We are not in the best place to have a longer break , but how can we pass this up !
We pass under the I - 40 interstate and get to the final intersection before cruising into Kingston .
It is alreaady after three and the temperature is still very high .
A couple more miles and we 'll be at our destination for today .
We are actually on a bike route now .
It comes and goes , so we are not quite sure what they have in mind with this road , but it sure is nice to have a lane to ourselves from time to time .
We cross the clinch river ...
... and arrive in Kingston , Tennessee .
On the sign it says Kingston was capitol of Tennessee for one day in September 1807 .
In Kingston we park at the courthouse .
While we wait for Laura to contact us we work on our journals .
At Laura 's home we rest a while , before we need to get ready for a swim party we are invited too .
We meet some of the same teachers of earlier today .
The girls are having a ball swimming and making new friends .
Randi , Laura 's husband , and son Bryson are also part of the fun .
A day where we made new friends .
A day filled with joy .
A day full of memories .

We are having our day off here at the best kept secret of Eastern Tennessee :
On the lake at Kingston .
It is wonderfully dark in the basement .
We sleep in till it 's nine .
When the girls climb the stairs to the main floor they shout " It 's day ! "
Laura is in the kitchen fixing all sorts of muffins and bacon for breakfast .
A cup of coffee is there to go with it .
The hospitality of Laura and Randi is heart warming .
The girls play with the dog and play board games with Randi .
Jasmine has a wonderful time .
She gets to be dressed up like the little princess she is .
A pretty dress , a flower in her hair , new nail polish on her finger and toes .
She is soaking it up .
In the afternoon Laura drives us to the lake to meet our friends Raney & Teresa , Tracy & Tami and Rick & Shirley , from Owsley county Kentucky .
They have come down for the day on their motorcycles .
It is good seeing them .
They can hardly believe how far we 've come this week .
Later we get to swim in the neighbor 's pool .
How refreshing after a hot day of doing nothing in particular .
For supper there is potatoes with carrots and a roast .
Good food to fill us with energy for a new day on the road .
The roast was brought by Laura 's teacher friend Emily .
Thanks Emily !
After supper it is time to call it a day .

As we left Kingston we passed the end of the Clinch river as it merged into another river .
At this meeting point stood an old fort , that stood guard over 200 years ago as our country was in it 's infancy .
We continued along the water route while the morning fog grew heavy .
Water droplets formed on Bill 's arm hair and glistened as the sun finally broke through .
The coolness of it felt great .
We meandered off the main road onto a seemingly harmless country road , according to our map .
It turned out to be the road from " Deliverance " .
The curves and the steep inclines challenged every ounce of our energy .
When we finally crested the highest point .... we still were n't there .
A break was just the thing .
We watched people drive by , all dressed up for church .
Finally on the downhill road , we stumbled upon an old two story flour mill , purched next to a creek .
Bill took the girls down to the water 's edge and introduced them to a good baptizing of cold creek water .
Jasmine was not to impressed because her shirt got wet .
Cheyenne and Robin asked for more cold water in their faces .
Cheyenne and Bill looked trough the cracks in the door to see what treasures lay in side .
Upon finding very little , Cheyenne tried to talk Bill into walking through the poison ivy to further investigate .
He refused on about 1,000 occasions .
We finally crossed I - 75 at exit 62 in Tennessee and were east of it for the first time since we left the Renfro Valley KOA , coincidentally at exit 62 in Kentucky .
We stopped at the Dinner Bell and had a great meal .
On our way out , the owner and her husband offered to give us our meal ( which we accepted of course ) .
After getting pictures in front of their establishment , we reached Sweetwater .
At the Sweetwater duck park we enjoyed the company of some hispanic ladies with their children .
They shared their ice cream sandwiches with us and we shared stories of our homes .
Not feeling that we should stay the night in Sweetwater , we moved on and ended up in Madisonville .
A couple of miles from Madisonville , a nice young educated couple in their black BMW were stopped and were taking pictures of us .
We stopped and chatted and then headed on to town .
As we pulled into the Wendy 's they pulled in as well .
They offered us a meal or a stay in a local hotel .
We chose the latter .
Total random acts of kindness by random people on this incredible planet we call earth .
So far the generosity ( Tzedakah ) has been staggering .
Despite what we see on the news , this country called America , is full of marvelous , generous people .
And we slept well .

Pride comes before the fall .
Sleeping in does n't make us more awake .
Bill put the safety break on the rear tire instead of the front tire .
While putting Robin on it and with Jasmine next to it , the front tire rolled and the kickstand fell .
And down came the bike .
Casualties : 1 => Jasmine had a booboo on her knee from falling over .
Out came the badages .
Robin was shaken , not stirred .
For Bill it was a difficult trip .
His legs were killing him and his butt was sore .
The girls had a good time .
They saw a deer crossing the road .
We had a long pick nick under some bradford pear trees in Mount Vernon , Tennessee .
We 've come to find out that the owner of the house was born in Fort Pierce , Florida , where Robin was born .
We got to talk with him and the inlaws who seem to own half the countryside around there .
They were very nice .
They shared soft drinks and ice from the back of their work pick - up truck .
We stumbled into the KOA in Tellico Plains .
Before swimming we did an interview with the Knoxville / NBC tv station .
Jerry Owens was a very nice and travelled man .
We spend the late afternoon cooling in the pool , hiding from the 95 + degree heat .
Some wonderful people from south Florida trated our kids like their grandkids and let them raid their camper of cool air and donuts .
It 's wonderful to see people in their early seventies still sucking every drop of enjoyment they can get from life .
We now have a cool breeze as the sun has set and we look forward to some together time ...

Weather : Great day for biking
Flat tires : 0 , Total 2
Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 2 Jasmine found another use for the goggles : to keep the bugs out of her eyes .
This in anticipation of us flying down the mountain we 'll climb today .
How we love to look for the moon .
Whether it is day or night .
It is a central part of our lives .
Robin can pick it out at the blink of an eye .
Bill often wonders how many ancient peoples and civilizations have looked at this very same moon .
And now there is no memory of them for the most part .
In this area of the world , the native americans were plentiful .
Now they are but a whisper to those that listen and look .
Here is a great example of how the native people have been replaced by a newer civilization .
Only after their extinction we begin to appreciate how many great things they had to offer .
As we are standing at this spot , we realize that the beginning of the Trail of Tears , was just up the road at the fort .
Most people riding this road , called stateroad 68 , are clueless of the tragic events .
Frank Murphy
Jr , owner of Coker Creek village is admiring the bicycle .
We spent several great hours meandering in the Hiawassee river .
On this hot day the cool water felt great to our feet and the girls bodies as they played in the shallows .
Ahhh .
We finally arrive exhausted in Turtletown .
Our tent is set up right below a deep stream , with a mountain of trees behind us .
We meet a not so local local man , Jersey Jim , whose house burned down about two weeks earlier at about one in the morning .
He told us the fire report showed that the fire ' fighters ' used six gallons of water in total !
Obviously , his house burned to the ground .
Jersey Jim brought us a hot chicken , cookies , cokes and water for supper .
Now it is time to play and run around .
It is a good spot to camp .
We finally settle in , after the entire town seems to have stopped by , as Bill notices lightning off in the distance .
At about one in the morning , a ferocious storm hits .
The tent is blowing around like a marshmellow bag in a wind tunnel .
After tons of lightning , thunder and rain , we ride the storm out bone dry .

Waiting for the rain to break , so we can get back on the road to Ducktown , Tennessee .
When it finally seems to clear off , we make a dash for Ducktown .
Yet , no luck , rain is upon us again .
It finally turns into a drizzle as we are nearing Ducktown , Tennessee .
A mile from Ducktown , we are greeting by an unmarked car with a blue flashing light and what we assume to be a police officer .
With no identification , nor uniform or introduction , he informs us that we are breaking Tennessee law .
Children are not allowed to be in the rain .
Under escort we make it to Ducktown and we hold up in a motel .
As we do not want the wrath of local law enforcement from Polk County Tennessee upon us , we will enclose more of this story in our book .
This same afternoon , Bill hitch hikes 120 miles to Atlanta , Georgia .
Where he gets a ride from a friend to Fort Benning , Georgia on Thursday morning .
Adam has his ceremony for finishing bootcamp for the US military .
Amarins and the girls are couped up in the motel , trying to stay out of the local law enforcement 's eye .
We made it to Ducktown and are safely in a motel .
Clean , warm and refreshed .

No excitement for Amarins and the girls today .
We read , play cards , work on mapping skills and nap .
Bill is in Fort Benning at Adam 's graduation .
He is enjoying the rest of his herd of kids ...
The meeting of Adam and Bill on the parade grounds after the ceremony was powerful .
Bill hitch hikes back north .
After five different vehicles he arrives on 515 in Elijay , Georgia .
Walking past the city limits , he sticks out his thumb and is immediately picked up by two police cars .
Here is another place where you 'll have to read the book to hear the rest of the story , when it comes out .
We still have a ways to go in Georgia and do n't want to burn future bridges ...
At seven Bill finally makes it to the motel where the girls are anxious to go swimming .
Bill and Amarins are anxious to get out of this town and out of this county .
Except for this small hickup , the people of Tennessee have been heart warming and welcoming .
We look back on a great journey through beautiful country and a group of very independent people .

We revel in the wonderful weather we are having .
Flat tires : 1 , Total 4
Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 2
The alarm rings at six .
Our aim is Calhoun Falls today .
We want to beat the heat .
At least some of it .
We do n't listen to the weather forecast .
We just watch the sky .
We pack up as much as we can , then we wake up the girls .
Breakfast with left overs works just fine .
Some fruit to tip it off .
It is a little after seven and we are off .
It is a monday morning so there is a bit of work traffick , but after eight it slacks off pretty much .
We take a backroad through what seems to be a forest .
The road is rough asphalt , but the scenery is astounding .
There are quite some inclines .
We did n't count on them .
Apparently we are not in the flatland yet ...
Are the bumps getting bigger or do we have another flat tire ?
It is the latter .
We pull off the road , spread the indian blanket and settle down for some cards and a snack .
Bill is the man for fixing the tire .
The tire is fixed and we are back on the road .
With the hills we did n't count on and the flat tire , we lost part of our advantage of being on the road early .
We keep on pedalling until we come to the little town of Iva .
It is almost lunchtime , so we settle for a little restaurant , Jacopys , in the center of town .
We are taking it easy .
It is an enjoyable place to relax .
The food is good as is the service .
We make some time to work on the journals .
Then the girls get to make a piece of art for Jacopys .
This under the enjoyment of chocolate icecream the owner gave them .
With renewed energy we hop back on the bicycle , to tackle some more miles .
The hills keep on appearing .
After each one appears another one .
We are enjoying the scenery , but are still clueless about how wrong we were to assume that this part of South Carolina would basically be flat .
We keep on chugging .
We take a break from time to time .
We arrive in Calhoun Falls in the middle of the afternoon .
A police officer waves at us .
He helps guide in - and outgoing school traffick .
At a filling station we stop to ask about a place to stay as well as to fill up our empty water containers .
While we are there the police officer and a fellow officer stop by .
We get to talking and sharing .
There are no good camping spots available just off the road .
They can recommend Calhoun Falls State Park .
It is a couple miles back north , but would be worth it .
We are debating about what we should do .
Do we want to back track , or go a couple miles further and see what that brings ?
We do n't need to make a decision .
The police officers have decided they are going to get us a place at the State Park .
One goes ahead to arrange the site , the other follows us to make sure we do n't get lost .
Thanks a lot Police Officers !
As we set up camp , the girls are playing at the playground .
Hanging up side down and climbing up a narrow post is Cheyenne 's favorite activity .
The camphost tells us there are laundry facilities at the other side of the park .
The candyman - we met him at the filling station earlier - gives us a lift .
We are very glad about it , it would have been a long hike .
As laundry is being processed we have the opportunity to take a shower .
We are not the only ones using the bathroom facilities .
Ms Spider and Mr Hopper are there too .
We get a ride back from a fellow camper .
Now it is time to fix supper .
A rice - a- roni tonight .
After todays experiences it tastes really good .
The girls like it too .
Bill does the dishes as Amarins finishes putting up the laundry .
These are the mundane part of our trip , probably of everyones life .
When all is put up , we crawl in our tent .
We camp under the trees and have decided not to put the fly on .
With all the screen mesh , we have a chance to look at the stars before we drift off asleep .

Today 34 miles , Total 440 miles
Campsite : At Reverend Bell 's home , six miles east of McCormick , South Carolina
Weather :
Phew it 's hot !
Flat tires : 1 , Total 5
Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 2
Again we get up early and are on the road a little after seven .
We go to Calhoun Falls once more .
Passing the same school , we pass the same police officer .
On the count of three we all yell ' Thank you !'
The hills are there and so are we .
We are trying to come up with a theory .
Not on how the hills arrived here , but how to detect them on a non-topographical map .
By all the fingers on the lake , we can safely assume that there where no dykes build to hold the water .
Since it is a manmade lake , a dam must have been build between a couple of hills .
Since the water stays in a designated area , there need to be hills to keep the water in , especially since we just ruled out building dykes .
Thus there are hills in the area of a manmade lake .
It did n't ring a bell with Amarins - being born and raised on the flatland of the Netherlands , with the thought of lakes being surrounded by dykes , or being leftovers from the ice age - that there would be hills here when she made up the route for the journey .
It will be very interesting to see what other misperceptions we have .
Assuming our theory is true , we pedal easier through these hills .
Is there peace in knowledge , even if it is assumed knowledge ?
For us there is .
Mount Carmel suddenly appears around the corner .
Old 1800s buildings stare us in the face .
How sad they are not maintained .
They are the most beautiful buildings we have seen yet .
Without economy even the most beautiful town fall apart .
In the center of town we stop at Alex ' Snackery .
A little store , slash eatery .
Certainly a stop on your trip .
Alex is an enjoyable man with lots of stories of other bikers passing through , and stopping by .
These breaks are so refreshing .
We rest , we meet new people , we hear new stories .
Then we are on the road again .
Within miles we have another mandatory stop .
Another flat tire .
Same routine ; indian blanket , snack , cards .
And Bill fixes the tire .
Three days in a row is quite enough .
It is about time to replace the outer tire .
As we get ready to go , a freelance reporter from Channel 4 in Greenville stops by .
He is going to follow us for a little bit and is going to interview us at our next break .
His angle is different .
He tapes as we put the girls on , as we mask them with suntan lotion , while we are having a break and are looking at the map .
It will be an interesting piece we think .
We arrive in McCormick in the early afternoon .
We do n't want to stop here , we want to go a little further down the road towards Aiken , before we call it a day .
East of McCormick is the Sumter National Forest , here we hope to find a place to camp .
For now we stop at the Hardees to enjoy some cool air and give a quick update on the homepage that we are still alive and pedalling !
It has been weird to be without internet reception for so long .
Being at Hardees does n't give us enough time to update the site , but we can check our e-mail .
We get quite many e-mails .
It is getting harder and harder to reply to them .
We keep doing our best though !
While we are taking it easy a local stops by to talk with us .
He would like to stop by the local media and inform them of us being here .
Of course we are fine with that .
Since he knows the area we ask him if he knows of a place to stay about five or six miles out of town on highway 378 .
Well , he lives six miles down that road and we can pitch a tent in his backyard !
Talking about the forces working together !
We ask and we receive .
It has happened so much on our journey .
And here it has happened again .
What are the chances ?
Close to 100 % we 'd say .
Believe in good and good will come around .
With internet access and over a 100 emails , we use the time at Hardees wisely and do our work .
Yes , we are on a journey of our choosing .
With making the journey public , we have taken on the responsibility of staying connected .
Email and the website are a part of that .
It does take a lot of time .
And it does give us the opportunity to relive recent wonderful memories as well as another smile when we see the pictures .
On the road again .
Due east .
Six miles easy peasy .
Cheyenne and Jasmine help us find the correct mailbox number .
We are involving them as much as we can .
Even Robin is looking out for numbers now .
It is close to five when we park at the home of Reverend Bell and his wife Carrie .
The girls jump right onto the playground set .
Once again Bill and Amarins set up camp .
Tired of playing the girls find the tv to be a great idea .
Clifford , Dragon Tails and Dora are always a good pick .
As Amarins is fine tuning the sleeping arrangements and is cooking dinner , Mr Bell 's son and his friend Kurtez stop by .
They are bringing a surprise ...
Two chicken and a rooster .
No pen needed , they will roost in the trees .
How they will lay eggs is a curiosity to all of us .
It is all good for a laugh .
The girls are immediately into feeding them .
Life is good with rice as a meal and watermelon , oranges and homemade cake with delicious icing as dessert .
It is close to nine when Cheyenne and Jasmine finally drift asleep on the couch in the house .
Robin is already asleep in the tent .
Amarins and Bill are enjoying a good movie with the master of the house .
After that it is also time for us to get some sleep .
It has been a good day .

Today 36 miles , Total 476 miles
Campsite : An oasis of noise behind Waffle House at I - 20 and SR - 19 , South Carolina
Weather :
The sun , the sun and a kingdom for a cloud
Flat tires : 0 , Total 5
Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 2
It is 6.30 am .
The rooster is perched on a branche in the cedar tree behind our tent .
One of the chicks is with him .
He does n't crow us awake .
He just lets us know he 's there in a raspy voice .
Cheyenne and Jasmine slept in the house last night .
We let them sleep in while Bill fixes yet again another flat tire .
A tiny puncture hole made yesterday 's work - out even harder .
Bill decides to put the new outer tire on the wheel .
The difference between the old tire and the new one is incredible .
We have worn the old one totally out .
Robin is playing coy .
She acts as if she is asleep .
When we ask her something she answers in a clear voice .
Silly girl .
Robin and Amarins wrestle for a while , before it is time to pack up the tent .
Robin is learning how to fold the tent poles .
Today we have our first rider going with us : Doug from Athens , Georgia .
We have been trying to line this up , but it 's been quite hard with us being out of cell phone reception .
This morning we give Doug a call again .
He is already in McCormick !
By the time we have finished breakfast , he 'll be here and we 'll be ready to go .
Our first day with company .
At 8 am we say goodbye to the hospitable Bell family .
Thanks for letting us stay and enjoy your company .
It is highly appreciated !
Two bikes , six people and the beautiful South Carolina country side .
We are off and can immediately enjoy the scenery .
Jasmine is counting horses today .
There are many pretty ones in the fields .
Brown with white , beige , brown .
They are just as curious about us as we are about them .
They run with us until they run out of field .
The road gently rolls us east .
Up and down and again up and down .
The grades of the hills get less and less steep .
Are we finally getting into the flatland ?
Having Doug with us is an enjoyable experience .
He rides behind us for safety reasons .
Doug and Cheyenne make up a space ship out of a bicycle .
Every screw , nut or bolt has a function .
We take a break under an old oak tree .
Eventhough the shade is good , we do n't rest long .
There are to many tiny little bugs swerving around us .
We surrender our spot back to them and go further through South Carolina .
We make it to Edgefield and take a lunch break at a McDonalds with playground .
It is still early , so we want to keep on going .
We hope to find a place to camp in Eureka .
Well , Eureka came and Eureka went .
We barely knew we were in it .
Anyway , not a place to spend the night .
We want some refreshings and a bathroom would be nice too .
Aiken is to far , so we call it quits at interstate 20 .
Doug and Bill scour the terrain .
Behind the Waffle House they find a good place to camp .
Fine sand , a little bit secluded by trees , walking distance to a filling station .
When that has been decided on , we choose Waffle House as the place to go for our supper .
While we are there , Mo from the Aiken Bicycle Club stops by .
He has never seen a quint before , so this will make a nice picture in the club magazine .
Tomorrow we are going to stay with Ray , also a member of the Aiken Bicycle Club .
Both of them will guide us into town tomorrow .
As Bill and Doug set up camp , Amarins and the girls enjoy the comfort of Waffle House .
A chance to update the journals as well as organizing notes for the website .
The girls pretend they are dinosaurs as the stomp their feet through the sand .
Cheyenne discovers six different colors sand in the area we are camping .
All the stomping through the sand turns the girls into little sandmen .
That calls for some creative bathing measures .
This is why we brought the porcelain wash pan .
Works great .
With the girls clean an in bed , although not by far asleep , it is time for grown up time .
Except for the breaks , we have not had a chance to talk much with Doug .
Riding next to each other on the main road just is n't such a good idea .

Doug needs to go back to McCormick today .
We are taking it easy this morning .
We sleep in as comfort allows .
Robin is taking that a bit to far .
While Amarins is emptying the tent and is sweeping it out around her , she just keeps on sleeping .
As Robin is finally waking up , we finish packing up our campsite and walk with the bikes to Waffle House for breakfast .
Basically the same as supper - by choice - yummy .
Breakfast is done , it is time to move on .
As we say goodbye to Doug , Mo arrives on his superlight bicycle .
A good timing for some picture opportunities .
The Pedouins with Doug
The Pedouins with Mo
With the last goodbyes we head in the direction of Aiken .
Only eight miles today .
Before we get far , Ray joins the ride .
With an escort in the front and in the back we roll into town .
It is a short ride to Ray 's place .
Welcoming short .
We have ushed it hard these days .
We can use some rest .
At Ray 's place we are welcomed by dogs Jojo and Dodger .
Some fine play buddies for the girls .
We feel very welcome .
The girls enjoy walking the dogs .
There are boardgames to play with and frresh fruit to enjoy .
We get to sleep in the house , which always makes things a lot easier .
We claim the bedroom and set up camp in there .
We rest , take a shower , take a nap and watch some tv .
In the afternoon Amarins goes shopping with Ray .
Bill takes the girls to the swimming pool .
The neighbor across the street invited us .
Ray has chicken , aspargus , beans and potato salad for supper .
His daughter Anna , as well as Mo and wife Betty are there as well .
We are sharing a good time together .
Talking about bicycling , our journey , life and living your dreams .

After a great night sleep we wake up with the smell of waffles .
It does n't take long before we are at the breakfast table .
Coffee , fresh blueberry waffles , strawberries , bacon .
Enough to fill us up .
Mo takes Bill to the bicycle store for some hardware and a new light for the trailer .
Jasmine and Cheyenne are playing games .
Robin decides it is time to take some pictures .
A self portrait is among them .
As we are enjoying our morning , Ray gets a phone call from the neighbors .
Greg and Mandy are professors at the University in Aiken .
The question is whether we are interested in a private tour of the planetarium as well as have a look at the animals .
An opportunity we are not to pass up .
We get to take Ray 's car while we follow Mandy to the university .
It is a great experience .
We see , touch and hold snakes , toads , salamanders and even a baby alligator .
Cheyenne is a daredevil , she will hold all of them .
Jasmine and Robin keep their distances for a while , but later warm up and hold the snakes too .
After visiting the animals , we get a private show in the planetarium .
Robin and Jasmine decide it is to dark in there for them and go out with Mandy .
Amarins and Cheyenne absorb everything Greg tells about our solar system , the stars and the constellations .
The next time we are camping under the stars , we will be able to pick out Ursa Major ( the big dipper ) , star Arcturus and star Spica .
With the help of Ursa Major , we can find Polaris ( the north star ) , which is part of Ursa Minor ( the little dipper ) .
After Robins nap it is time to pack up again .
We are staying in Aiken , but are going to another part of it .
Family of friends have invited us to stay with them .
We load the bike and ride with the Mo&Ray escort through beautiful downtown Aiken .
After roughly five miles we arrive at the Boardman residence .
We say goodbye to Ray and Mo and once again settle in .
A package has arrived for us from Berea , Kentucky .
It is like Christmas in July , but then in August .
Friends Glenda and Patricia from Berea have been shopping for us for light weight camping mats , camping towels and bike shorts for Cheyenne and Jasmine .
And they have succeeded .
At Phillip Gall and Pedal the Planet in Lexington , they were very enthusiastically helped with kindness and support .
We appreciate everyone 's help for contributing to the " Clothe the Pedouins in Safe Comfortable Traveling Gear " fund , as it has been called .
With these new supplies safely stored away and ready for use , we call it a night .
Tomorrow is another bike day .

Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 2
We are up early this morning .
Up earlier are Dot and Pat .
They are fixing a fantastic breakfast for us .
Again we have been blessed with our hosts .
We feel so welcome and at home .
It is hard to leave , even after such a short stay .
At 7.30 am Curt of the Aiken Bicycle Club arrives .
He is going to escort us out of town .
He knows the best roads for us to take .
It is a little foggy and cool .
The girls are layered up with clothes and we are ready to go .
With the help of Curt we reach Highway 78 by a beautiful couple of backroads .
From here it is a straight shot to Charleston .
We see the first sign with Charleston on it .
It is only 107 more miles .
We are within reach !
Highway 78 is a very straight road .
We are in the flatter country now .
An incline every now and then .
We are making many miles in a shorter time .
The road takes us between cotton , peanut and soy fields .
The girls are learning to distinguish between the one and the other based on the leaves and blooms .
Our destination for today is Bamberg , 45 miles from Aiken .
When we get there it is still early .
We look at the map .
Our next host town is Ladson .
If we can make it to Branchville today , we can make it to Ladson tomorrow .
That would take us into Charleston on Monday , August 31 , 2009 .
There is magic in that date .
From Renfro Valley KOA to Charleston within one month ...
It is 14 more miles to Branchville .
It takes us about one hour and a half .
Oh , how we make miles in this flatter land .
In the mountains it would have taken us at least three hours .
Something we certainly would n't have done after the mileage we 've done already .
Branchville is n't a very big town .
A couple of filling stations , an ice cream parlor and a Subway are in the center of it .
We do n't see shade at the ice cream parlor , so we choose to sit down in the Subway , until our friend Harding arrives from Raleigh , North Carolina .
He is going to spend the evening with us .
As Amarins walks into the Subway with the girls , an older lady is , as it looks like , jumping up and down with excitement to see us .
She saw us earlier today in Bamberg and wished we were coming to Branchville .
Well , here we are .
Ms Arlene lives in Branchville , so she is the person to ask about a camp spot .
Immediately she offers her backyard !
We barely made it to Branchville , or Harding walks in .
It is good seeing him again .
Together we ride and drive over to Ms Arlene 's home , just a couple of blocks away .
For supper we decide to go to St George , a neighboring town .
By car this time .
The journey has made a deeper bond between Cheyenne and Jasmine .
We feel we are on the right path to bond even deeper as a family .
After a great supper with lots of vegetables , we return to spend the rest of the evening with Ms Arlene .
She has traveled all over the states .
We feel we have found a kindred spirit .
With the moon shining into our tent , we close our eyes for a good night sleep .
Especially the girls are excited to be sleeping on real mats this night .
The time of roughing it is over .

Campsite : At the Fraze home , Ladson , South Carolina
Weather :
Too excited to notice the weather , we 're nearing Charleston .
Flat tires : 0 , Total 5
Falls with bicycle : 0 , Total 2
We break camp at dawn .
Ms Arlene comes outside to wave us goodbye .
Once more we say goodbye and once more we are on our way , living a new day with new experiences .
Harding is staying with us this morning .
He is our first follow car .
We have all our belongings packed on the trailer and the bike , that is just easier for later .
Harding tells us we do around 15 miles per hour .
That feels good .
By following us at this low speed , for a car , he has the chance to listen to the morning sounds , to look at the beautiful dew covered cobwebs and to smell the fragrances of nature .
As we continue on an almost desolate highway 78 , a church sign catches our eyes :
It is one of the reasons we are on this journey .
The further east we travel , the higher the interstate numbers .
It is really a great system .
All you have to know is that odd numbers are interstates that run south to north and even numbers are interstates that run east to west .
We are now at interstate 95 .
At the interstate Harding buys us breakfast at the Huddle House where the girls make a new friend .
Cheyenne and Jasmine sit at the bar , being big girls .
It is a little after 10 when we are back on the road .
The temperature is already rising quickly .
It is a peaaceful morning on the road .
This changes when it turns afternoon .
It 's like entire South Carolina is on the road .
The drivers are very courteous though .
We are given a lot of space on the road , as well as patience from passing traffic .
We feel the miles we 've done yesterday .
We are very tired and take many breaks .
Especially when we are closer to Ladson , we stop at every filling station we see .
We enjoy the cool air and have a refreshment .
The benefit of this is that we get to share about our journey .
We also receive a lot of generosity , which will help us stay in Charleston .
With only 22 more miles to Charleston , we turn off of highway 78 for the night , to spend the evening at the Fraze residence in Ladson .
There is a storm coming tonight .
They are letting us stay in their home for the night .
Thanks Fraze family !

Campsite : Holiday Inn , Folly Beach , South Carolina
Weather : Rain !
Flat tires : 0 , Total 5
Falls with bicycle : 1 , Total 3
It is a weekday .
Morning traffic will be heavy .
We decide not to leave before 9 am .
This turns out to be no problem .
There is a heavy rainstorm upon us .
We are waiting and waiting and waiting .
At 10 am there is a dry spell .
We are making a run for it !
We are back on highway 78 .
It will take us all the way to the Battery in downtown Charleston .
The weather is holding up .
It is cloudy , but the rain is staying away .
The traffic is light as we slowly work our way to the finish of our first leg of the journey .
Then it happens .
What we 've all been scared off .
We cross the railroad tracks under the wrong angle and come crashing down .
The shock is tremendous .
The wounds are light .
Jasmine has a light scrape on her knee , Cheyenne bruised the palm of her hand a little , Robin is all okay .
Bill has a scrape on his knee and Amarins has a scrape on both her knee and her elbow .
The bike is worse off .
Bill 's crankarm is bend , Bill and Amarins ' pedals are misformed , the handlebar tape is broken and the rear tire is warped a little .
Still all works well .
After we catch our breath , we continue on our journey .
We feel deflated with what happened , but we can recognize the feeling .
We know as long as we focus on positive events , the day will turn out alright .
Even Cheyenne already understands this and is looking forward to the better part of the day .
Slowly we ride through town , admiring the old buildings .
Then , there it is , the end of the peninsula , Fort Sumter and the ocean in the distance .
We are on the Battery , from where we can see Fort Johnson , where the first shots of the civil war were fired .
We sit down and absorb our surroundings under the enjoyment of sandwiches and cookies .
From the battery we look off in the distance where we can see the shape of Fort Sumter .
There is a plaque on the battery with historical information .
We ride a little further , looking for the playground , looking for a place to put our feet in the ocean .
We can't find either .
Trying not to feel defeated , we decide to go on to Folly Beach .
Before we do that , we meet a nice gentleman , Mr George McFadden , he 's been taking pictures of our bicycle and of us .
Obviously this leads to talking .
While Amarins is gathering energy for the next ride , Bill and George are talking about the journey .
Out of the blue , George reaches in his pocket and hands us a bill as his support of the journey .
Although we do n't know where we 'll stay yet , our night has been taken care off again .
We leave downtown towards Folly Beach .
To get there we need to ride over a giant overpass over the water .
The shoulder is superwide and the sun comes out .
We are in an upswing again .
From the overpass we see downtown Charleston in the distance on our left and lush green marshes on our right .
We have a beautiful view from here .
At the bottom of the overpass , we see someone making lots of pictures .
Bill hollers out ' Hey , we need a place to stay on Folly Beach , can you help ? '
He hollers back ' Let me make some calls ! '.
A little later we meet him again .
Certainly a reason to stop .
His name is Mark and he happens to work for the Charleston Bicycle Company and he lives here on James Island .
He knows his company would love to help us with getting the bike back in shape .
Furthermore he will call around to see if he can find us a place to stay on Folly Beach .
We exchange phone numbers and we are back on the road .
It is the middle of the afternoon by now .
Time to get us a decent meal .
We stumble upon Applebees .
A great choice .
We plan on staying for a little while before finishing the day in the Atlantic Ocean .
An even better choice .
There are not many customers , but the ones that are there are very curious about our escapades .
Brandy the manager is excited about our journey as well .
We eat and enjoy and talk .
When we get ready to go , some of the customers we talked with have already picked up the tab .
On top of this the manager invites us for lunch tomorrow .
Thanks everyone !
It is sprinkling a little bit , so we put the raincoats on the girls .
Robin has Bill 's raincoat .
It wraps around her and her seat , keeping her nice and dry .
While we were enjoying our time at Applebees , Mark gave us a call .
He has arranged for us to stay at the Holiday Inn on Folly Beach , basically at no cost .
With regained energy from the food and rest , we head back down the road .
We are not quite sure where to find the Holiday Inn , but it turns out we do n't need to churn our heads about it .
It is straight ahead of us , at the end of the road .
Amarins checks in .
With the help of a very friendly desk clerk , Chris , we obtain a room on the first floor , with sliding doors that open on the patio , with view of the ocean .
We load our gear in the room , park the bicycle against the wall and walk out the sliding doors .
It is time to put our feet in the Atlantic Ocean .
We are at the end of our first leg of the journey .
After 633 miles , 31 days , 5 states and a tremendous amount of generosity from a lot of great people , we finally put our feet in the Atlantic Ocean !!!
With this great accomplishment fresh on our minds , we turn in for the night .

MYTISHCHI , Russia 
It was late on a Monday afternoon at the drunk tank in this Moscow suburb , but it could have been any day , at any hour , at any similar facility across this land .
People would come .
They always do .
Such is Russia ’s ruinous penchant for the bottle  and the challenge facing a new government policy to curb it .
First to be escorted in by police officers was a construction worker named Damir M. Askerkhanov , who said he had been bingeing on vodka and beer 
“ This is my very own holiday ! ”  before he was found stumbling about in the cold .
At 23 , he admitted that he had already been picked up intoxicated twice recently .
“ Only even drunker , ” he said .
Sergey A. Yurovsky , 36 , who is studying to be a government clerk , arrived next , mumbling and getting tangled up in his sweater when he was asked to take it off for a brief medical exam .
After he was moved to a room to sober up , and dozed off , officers showed up with Larisa V. Lobachyova , 53 , whose hair was matted with dirt from a fall .
“ It is this way all the time , ” said Inspector Igor I. Poludnitsyn , who has supervised the drunk tank for seven years .
“ It is our national calamity . ”
Police described the attack as a " frightening experience " for the victims
A two - year - old girl was punched in the head by two teenage girls during an attempted robbery in north - west London .
The girl was with her mother when the pair were targeted by two female suspects in Preston Road , Wembley , at about 1645 GMT on Tuesday .
They demanded money from the mother , aged 23 , before punching her in the arm and attacking her daughter .
The attackers are described as being of Mediterranean appearance and aged between 14 and 18 .
" Although the victim and her daughter do not have any visible injuries , this was a frightening experience for them , " said Det Insp Rebecca Reeves , of the Metropolitan Police .
" We have released these images in the hope that someone may recognise the suspects and report them to the police . "

FOR nearly three decades , I ’ve felt conflicted about presidential salutes .
After all , my United States Marine Corps instructors drilled into me the idea that “ you never salute without a cover ” which , in civilian , meant without a hat .
My fellow Marines and I were also informed , in no uncertain terms , that we were n’t to salute out of uniform .
( I do n’t think that presidential blue suits , white shirts and red ties quite qualify . )
So whenever I saw a president stepping off a helicopter and bringing hand to brow , my drill instructor ’s unambiguous words came back to me with much of their original force .

Then there were the salutes themselves , which ranged from halfhearted to jaunty .
None of them fulfilled the characteristically succinct prescription that Capt .
Jack O’Donnell of the Marine Corps delivered , in 1963 , to my platoon of freshly minted second lieutenants at basic school in Quantico , Va. : “ Your salute , ” he pronounced , “ must be impeccable , ” by which we took him to mean like his : a straight line running from elbow to fingertips , the fingers and thumb forming a seamless whole , the arm brought swiftly to the brim of the cap , no palm showing , and then lowered smartly to the side .
Up to 80 % of the world 's toys are made in China - often by children .
But there are beautiful and affordable alternatives
With the festive countdown underway , the Toy Retailers Association has just released its " dream toys " list of this year 's must - have Christmas gifts for kids , which they say wo n't break the bank
However , according to research recently carried out by Ethical Consumer magazine where I work , the price of many of these toys fail to reflect the hidden environmental and social costs of their production .
Take Hasbro .
Its Transformer toys are made with PVC , a plastic that has come under fire from campaigners for its alleged carcinogenic properties and the dangerous byproducts , such as mercury , produced during its manufacture .
The campaigning organisation Centre for Health Environment and Justice says of PVC : " It is useless without the addition of a plethora of toxic additives including phthalates .
These chemicals can evaporate or leach out of PVC , posing risks to children . "
Hasbro defends the use of PVC , saying it has " carefully considered the science and believe that toys made from PVC and softened with phthalates pose no risk to children " .
The EU attempted to remedy the situation in 2005 when it banned certain additives , but many still remain .
In contrast to Hasbro , Lego – also on its Christmas list – banned the use of PVC in its products in 2003 .
Hasbro has also been challenged over human rights abuses in its Chinese supplier factories .
Up to 80 % of the world 's toys are made in China , where human rights are often overlooked .
The report " Nightmare on Sesame Street " by the US - based National Labour Committee last year highlighted many of these problems .
It found that in the Kai Da factory in Shenzhen city , which supplies Hasbro , a hundred 16 - year - old high - school children and several younger children were working .
Conditions in the factory were said to be dangerous , with potentially toxic solvents and paints routinely handled by workers with only rudimentary protective gear .
Shifts were allegedly routinely over 12 hours long , seven days a week , with no days off for many months , plus mandatory 19 - and 23 - hour shifts at busy times such as the pre-Christmas rush .
Workers were also reported to be docked wages for room and board , leaving them receiving only 28 cents an hour .
Little wonder , then , that Hasbro toys wo n't break the bank .
There are ethical alternatives .
German manufacturer Holz
Toys only uses European factories where labour rights are guaranteed while all its wooden products come from FSC - certified and sustainable forests .
Maya Organic , which also produces wooden toys , is an umbrella organisation providing training , marketing and other support to a range of small worker - owned cooperatives in Karnataka , India and was established with the aim of alleviating poverty and empowering workers .
Its toys are made from local wood , which is harvested by cutting branches rather than felling whole trees .
Distributors include Greenshop.co.uk and Littlegreenagels.com .
Not all ethical toys are made of wood .
The market has recently grown and a much wider range is now available – everything from recycled board games to science kits with an environmental theme can be found online .
The price of the toys produced by Holz , Maya Organic and other ethically - minded companies better reflects the true environmental and social costs of production .
A quick glance at their websites reveals that their toys wo n't break the bank either .

The art of carving foods is an Eastern custom that has been adopted by creative food preparers around the world .
In Thailand and Japan food carving is considered part of the presentation of the meal .
The art story of Vegetable and Fruit Carving dates back to more than 700 years ago in Sukhothai , the Capital of the Thai people , in what is now called Central Thailand .
There a story of a King who asked one of his servants ; how she could make the festival Loi Kratong more beautiful .
The servant suggested Vegetable Fruit Carvings to decorate the Table during festivities and since then this tradition has carried on .
There are schools and institutes available internationally for training and conducting such classes and courses in vegetable and fruit carving and you could even find free training lessons , videos and step by step lessons on the internet .
Budget deficits are soaring and printing presses are running at full steam everywhere you look including Germany and the Eurozone countries .
Please consider Recession Upends German Zeal for Fiscal Prudence .
It has come to this : Germany will almost certainly have a bigger budget deficit next year than Italy will .
Traditionally , Germany is the Continent ’s keeper of fiscal rectitude , perpetually fretting that the Italians and other free - spending Southern Europeans are about to undermine the euro and rekindle inflation by not reducing their red ink .
But in 2010 , the German deficit is expected to total 6.5 percent of its gross domestic product , while the Italian gap is forecast at 6.2 percent of G.D.P. , according to Deutsche Bank .
The German shift underscores just how profoundly the economic and political situation has changed in Berlin , as well as how desperate Chancellor Angela Merkel is to restore growth in Europe ’s largest economy as she begins her second term .
Given the longstanding aversion to borrowing and spending that has shaped German fiscal policy since the great hyperinflation of the Weimar era during the 1920s , Mrs. Merkel and her new finance minister , Wolfgang Schäuble , have set off a fierce debate by proposing to cut taxes by 24 billion euro , or $ 35.9 billion , in 2010 and 2011 , rather than immediately attack the country ’s projected budget gap .
The terms of the treaty that created the euro currency are supposed to limit each country ’s deficit to no more than 3 percent of its G.D.P .
None of the 16 countries that use the euro are expected to meet that goal soon , however , with the typical budget deficit projected to reach a record 6.9 percent of G.D.P. next year , according to the European Commission .
But for all the efforts to keep everybody on board , Mrs. Merkel could be on a collision course with much of the business community , as well as Axel A. Weber , the head of the Deutsche Bundesbank , who sits on the governing council of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt .
In a speech last month , Mr. Weber set 2011 as a crucial deadline for Europe to begin digging out of the stimulus measures and deficit spending now under way .
“ Given the enormous rise in public deficits and the strain this will put on future budgets , the fiscal exit strategy will have to kick in as soon as the recovery has firmed up , which means no later than 2011 , ” he said .
Among ordinary Germans , the desire for fiscal discipline still runs deep as well , setting the stage for further tensions down the road if the economy lags .
A poll published last month by Forsa , the independent polling institute , showed that only 22 percent wanted tax cuts if they would lead to a wider budget deficit and more public borrowing .
Nearly 70 percent were against the idea .
Moreover , a new law limits federal deficits to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product from 2016 onward and no longer allows the federal states to run deficits at all from 2020 onward .
US Federal Deficit As Percent Of GDP
Japan's Deficits
The DPJ campaigned on a platform of people - first social services , promising to boost domestic demand by easing the financial burden on households with a child - care allowance , health - care changes and the elimination of highway tolls .
The proposals are expected to cost some seven trillion yen , or around $ 75 billion , in the fiscal year starting April 2010 , rising to 16.8 trillion yen in the fiscal year ending March 2014 .
As it stands , next year 's initial budget is on track to require 21.9 trillion yen to finance Japan 's public debt , or about 170 % of gross domestic product , the highest among industrialized nations , the Finance Ministry said Monday .
The victors have an emotive name for it : seiken kotai , or regime change .
It came in brutal fashion on Sunday August 30th when Japan , Asia ’s richest democracy , dumped the party that has ruled it for almost all of the last 53 years and gave a huge win to one that until recently had little idea of how it would govern .
In a historic result , unofficial results showed that the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , a leftist grouping of ruling - party renegades , social democrats and socialists , was heading for a landslide .
It is led by Yukio Hatoyama , a mild - mannered career politician likely to be the next prime minister .
He promises a government less beholden to the powerful civil service , wants to temper the free market and is keen to dole out cash to the disadvantaged in the economically stagnant and ageing country .
Yen 's Last Hurrah
How much debt can an industrialized country carry before the nation ’s economy and its currency bow , then break ?
The question looms large in the United States , as a surging budget deficit pushes government debt to nearly 98 percent of the gross domestic product .
But it looms even larger in Japan .
Here , years of stimulus spending on expensive dams and roads have inflated the country ’s gross public debt to twice the size of its $ 5 trillion economy — by far the highest debt - to - G.D.P. ratio in recent memory .
Just paying the interest on its debt consumed a fifth of Japan ’s budget for 2008 , compared with debt payments that compose about a tenth of the United States budget .
Yet , the finance minister , Hirohisa Fujii , suggested Tuesday that the government would sell 50 trillion yen , about $ 550 billion , in new bonds — or more .
“ There ’s no mistaking the budget deficit stems from the past year ’s global recession .
Now is the time to be bold and issue more deficit bonds , ” Mr. Fujii told reporters at the National Press Club in Tokyo .
“ Those who may call this pork - barrel spending — that ’s a total lie . ”
“ Public sector finances are spinning out of control — fast , ” said Carl Weinberg , chief economist at High Frequency Economics in a recent note to clients .
“ We believe a fiscal crisis is imminent . ”
“ Japan will keep on selling more bonds this year and next , but that wo n’t work in three to five years , ” said Akito Fukunaga , a Tokyo - based fixed - income strategist at Credit Suisse .
“ If you ask me what Japan can resort to after that , my answer would be ‘ not very much . ’ ”
How Japan got into such a deep hole , and kept digging , is a tale of reckless spending .
The Democratic Party , which swept to victory in August , promises to rein in public works spending .
But the party ’s generous welfare agenda — like cash support to families with children and free high schools — could ultimately enlarge budget deficits .
“ It ’s dangerous for the Democrats to push on with all of their policies when tax revenues are so low , ” said Chotaro Morita , head of fixed - income strategy at Barclays Capital Japan .
“ From a global perspective , Japan ’s debt ratio is way off the charts , ” he said .
In the long run , even Japan ’s sizable assets could fall and eventually turn negative .
Japan ’s rapidly aging population means retirees are starting to dip into their nest eggs — just as government spending increases to cover their rising medical bills and pension payments .
“ The yen is set to enter a long decline ” in both stature and value as investors lose confidence in Japan , said Hideo Kumano , chief economist at the Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo .
Considering the state of Japan ’s finances and economy , Mr. Kumano said , the yen ’s recent strength against the dollar “ is n’t an affirmation of Japan — it ’s the yen ’s last hurrah . ”
UK Debt Also Soars Out Of Control
In the financial year 2008 / 09 the UK recorded a general government deficit of £ 101.3 billion , which was equivalent to 7.1 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) .

The Department of Transportation has imposed its first fines ever , against three airlines that were involved in stranding passengers on an airport tarmac for nearly six hours .
Continental Airlines , ExpressJet Airlines and Mesaba Airlines will pay a total of $ 175,000 for their roles in last summer ’s incident in Rochester , Minn. , in which 47 passengers were stuck aboard a plane overnight .
Continental Express Flight 2816 , operated by the airline ’s regional partner ExpressJet , was en route from Houston to Minneapolis - St. Paul on Aug .
8 . It was diverted because of bad weather and landed at Rochester International Airport at 12:30 a.m .
Employees for Mesaba Airlines , the only staff at the airport , told the ExpressJet crew that the passengers could not enter the terminal because no one from the Transportation Security Administration was on duty to screen them .
Instead , the passengers stayed in the cramped plane until 6:15 a.m. , when they were finally released into the terminal .

The fines were applauded by airline critics , who have been calling on Congress to adopt a passengers ’ bill of rights that would require airlines to return to the terminal if a plane is delayed more than three hours on the tarmac .
“ This fine is not only a first but $ 175,000 is dissuasive enough that U.S. domestic airlines will really have to think about their behavior before putting passengers in harm ’s way , ” said Kate Hanni , founder of FlyersRights.org , a website that advocates a bill of rights for airline passengers .
“ The DOT appears to be willing to protect us .
For that we are grateful . ”
The Department of Transportation fined Continental and ExpressJet $ 50,000 each and charged Mesaba $ 75,000 for their roles in the Aug. 8 incident .
Mesaba is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines .
All three airlines agreed to the fines to settle violations charged by the federal agency ’s Aviation Enforcement Office .

In a statement , Continental said it agreed to the fine to avoid costly litigation .
The airline also said that ExpressJet worked to discharge the passengers earlier but blamed the Mesaba crew for giving out false information .
Mesaba President John Spanjers said his airline “ operated in good faith by providing voluntary ground handling assistance to ExpressJet during this delay .
However , customer service is paramount , and we are reevaluating our policies and procedures for the courtesy handling of other airlines ’ flights to do our part to mitigate this type of delay . ”

A major problem with string theory is that it has never been confirmed experimentally , which is where Donner Professor of Science Cumrun Vafa and the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) come in .
Photo : Stephanie Mitchell / Harvard Staff Photographer
( PhysOrg.com ) -- A Harvard theoretical physicist has discussed with scientists at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland the possibility that they may discover a theorized " stau " particle , with a lifetime of a minute or so , that could provide the first experimental confirmation of string theory .
String theory , developed in the late 1960s and early ’ 70s , is a theoretical physicists ’ multitool , explaining in one model all four of the universe ’s main forces : gravity , electromagnetism , and the two that operate inside atomic nuclei , the strong force and the weak force .
Without string theory , physicists need two theories to explain how the universe works .
General relativity explains gravity , while the other three basic forces are explained by the “ standard model . ”
Moreover , gravity has been very difficult to reconcile with quantum theory , a problem for which string theory offers a solution .
A major problem with string theory , however , is that it has never been confirmed experimentally , which is where Donner Professor of Science Cumrun Vafa and the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) come in .
Several years of work with graduate student Jonathan Heckman , who graduated in June , and other colleagues , has led Vafa to suggest that a particle whose properties are predicted by string theory may be detectable at the energy levels produced by the LHC .
The LHC is the world ’s largest particle collider , located in a 16.8 - mile - long underground ring that runs from Switzerland under the border into France and back .
Once it is fully operational , it should be able to smash beams of protons into each other with an energy of 14 trillion electron volts , seven times more powerful than the current highest - power collider , the Tevatron at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois .
After glitches and equipment failures marred the LHC ’s start last year , operators are trying again this month .
In late October , scientists at CERN , the European Organization for Nuclear Research , were celebrating the first particles to enter sectors of the accelerator since it was shut down .
Operators expect a gradual ramp - up of activity , first circling beams , then creating low - power collisions , and slowly increasing the collisions ’ energy .
Vafa is n’t the only Harvard faculty member eagerly anticipating the LHC start - up .
Harvard experimental physicists have lent a hand to build ATLAS , one of the two main detectors there .
Other theoretical physicists , including Lisa Randall , the Frank Baird Jr. Professor of Science , and Howard Georgi , the Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics , also await the light that the LHC will shed on their work .
Most physicists expect the LHC will discover the elusive particle known as “ Higgs , ” which is the origin of mass for all known particles .
One major remaining question is what else the LHC might discover .
Vafa traveled to CERN in late October to discuss with teams of scientists at the two main detectors on what else they might see .
If the assumptions that he and Heckman make in the context of string theory are valid , Vafa said , the two lightest of the new particles are the gravitino and the stau .
The gravitino , however , is so weakly interactive that it is hard to produce directly , Vafa said .
A stau particle , however , is easier to produce and should be semi-stable , lasting as long as a minute .
And it should leave a signature track — unexplainable by any of the already - observed particles — as it streaks across the LHC ’s detectors .
“ It would be the smoking gun for our stringy models , ” Vafa said .
While Vafa and Heckman ’s work predicts there is a good likelihood of generating a stau particle , there is also a less likely possibility that a semi-stable neutral particle will be generated .
If the particle proves neutral , it wo n’t manifest itself in a way that the LHC ’s detectors would see .
It could still be found , but indirectly .
If the particle is created and escapes the accelerator , it would manifest as missing energy and could be located as scientists tally their experimental results .
Vafa and Heckman came up with their stau conclusion by winnowing the many possibilities in string theory .
One difficulty of the theory , Vafa said , is its flexibility .
String theory has hundreds of variables , which he described as “ dials ” that physicists can turn up and down to generate innumerable possible universes .
While that is interesting to theoreticians , Vafa said , it can also muddy the theoretical search for one universe : ours .
Vafa and Heckman devised two constraints that greatly narrowed the possible string universes .
First , they assumed that gravity does not have to play a role in the unification of the other three forces .
And second , they assumed that one property of string theory , called supersymmetry , is present at the energy levels generated by the LHC .
If string theory is correct , our universe is made up not of particles , as has been generally taught , but of tiny vibrating strings .
The different vibrations manifest themselves as the familiar particles and forces that students learn about in physics class .
In addition to string theory ’s ability to encompass gravity and the other forces in one framework , it can also fill a second important theoretical gap in understanding the universe , by explaining all the missing matter .
The known constellation of particles under conventional theories — electrons , quarks , neutrinos , and the like — can only account for about a sixth of the matter in the universe .
The rest of it is made up of theorized “ dark matter , ” whose form remains unknown .
Dark matter is explained in string theory by the concept of supersymmetry .
Supersymmetry , which was first discovered in the context of string theory , holds that for each known particle there is a corresponding particle of different spin .
At the time of the big bang , the theory says , the paired particles had similar properties such as mass and charge , but as the universe cooled off , the symmetry got broken .
Now , according to the theory , in our broken - symmetry universe , the supersymmetric particles have much higher masses than their known partners .
This higher mass also would explain why scientists have n’t seen them yet , since particle colliders must generate more energy than they have been able to do to create them .
In the stringy models of Vafa and Heckman , the gravitino , which is predicted to be about 100 times more massive than the electron , comprises the bulk of the dark matter .
With the start - up of the LHC , Vafa said , science may be on the threshold of energies needed to create new supersymmetric particles , and of gaining a new understanding of the universe .
“ I think it ’s probably the most exciting experiment we ’ll see in our lifetimes , ” Vafa said of the LHC .
“ We ’ll be excited by whatever they find — whether or not they confirm our predictions — because it ’s the truth of nature , and it will teach us about the fundamental ways nature works . ”

The amazing video below was taken on October 19 in Arizona 's Maricopa County Superior Court .
As defense attorney Joanne Cuccia discusses her client 's sentencing hearing with the judge , Maricopa County Sheriff 's Department detention officer Adam Stoddard walks up behind her , and begins sifting through one of her files , which she has placed on the defense table .
Remarkably , Stoddard then removes a document from the file and hands it off to another deputy , who then leaves the courtroom with it .
They do n't even bother to inform Cuccia , who has her back turned the entire time .
The judge appears to have missed the incident as well .
But it was all captured on video :
Cuccia was justifiably upset , and requested a hearing .
That hearing was last week .
According to freelance journalist Nick Martin , who writes at the Heat City blog , Stoddard 's story changed several times over the course of the hearing .
His main defense was apparently that he spotted " keywords " on the document that made him think it contained threats to the courtroom .
The problem with that story is that if you watch the video , he swiped the document from the middle of the file .
It was n't lying in open view .
Which leaves open the question of why , in open court , he went snooping through a defense attorney 's file in the first place .
I do n't know Arizona law , so perhaps a Hit & Run reader with some experience there can help out .
Could it possibly be legal for a law enforcement official to meander up to the defense table , begin reading the defense team 's files , then take documents from said files without notifying the attorney ?
That sounds absurd on its face , even for Maricopa County .
It gets weirder .
According to Heat City , the purpose of Friday 's hearing was to determine if Stoddard had violated the attorney - client privilege of Cuccia 's client , Antonio Lozano , and / or if Stoddard should be held in contempt of court .
But Judge Gary Donahoe ruled that because the swiped document itself is protected by attorney - client privilege Stoddard would n't be able to mount his " keyword " defense , because the contents of the document can't be divulged .
According to Heat City , Donahoe said Lozano would have to wave attorney - client privilege if he wanted to proceed with the hearing on whether Stoddard violated his rights .
If this is an accurate portrayal of the hearing , stand back and admire the absurdity : Judge Donahoe is refusing to punish Stoddard for possibly violating Lozano 's attorney - client privilege unless Lozano waives his attorney - client privilege .

In the same way a person can be chained to an oak tree , a mind can be chained to an assumption , a religion , a political party , or any idea of any kind .
But the idea , like the tree , should not be blamed .
Ideas are inanimate things and are good or bad only in how they are used by the living .
Instead it is the chain that must be questioned , along with the motivations of people who work to chain minds to things ( especially if they call themselves educators ) .
A mind is unique in the world for its infinity of ideas , for it can be used to think about almost anything in a million different ways .
Any act that deliberately confines a mind to a singular way of seeing the world can not be acting for good .
Most communities , from families , to schools , to gangs , have ideas members are expected to adopt without question .
This does n’t make them evil , but it does n’t make them bastions of freedom either .
Like the rules to a new board game , we read these rules with our minds at half - power , as our goal is to learn and follow .
Even under the guise of what we comically call education , most of us , most of the time , are taught to copy .
To memorize .
To understand someone elses ’s theories .
What are we being trained for in life by this other than to perform these same thoughtless behaviors when we graduate ?
And the things that are considered taboo in our societies , acts that violate our traditions , are often followed without anyone involved , from parents , to teachers , to leaders and other enforcers , understanding why .
Why is being seen in underwear embarrassing , but being seen in a bathing suit is not ?
Why are nipples and flesh so scary , when everyone has them ?
Why are alcohol , nicotine and Prozac legal , but marijuana and Absinthe criminal ?
It ’s un - free thinking , this accepting of an idea simply because someone else said so .
If the reasons are so good , they should do well in debate and discussion on their merits , should n’t they ?
Nothing should be beyond discussion .
The beginning of wisdom starts with asking two questions .
Why do we believe what we believe ?
And how we know what we know ?
They should be stamped on every school book , in every meeting place and in every home where independence of mind and free thinking are advocated .
It should be tattooed on the forehead of anyone arrogant enough to dictate orders for others to follow .
The children ’s game of why , where a child says “ Why ? ” to every answer that an adult offers , often ends with the parent embarrassing the child .
“ Stop being silly ” they say .
But it ’s the parent who should be embarrassed by their hubris .
Why is it so uncomfortable to say “ I do n’t know ” .
Why is n’t their pride in their children learning things they do n’t know ?
Is n’t that the basis for progress ?
We all know less than we think we do , and if we wish to learn more it ’s only going to come from taking comfort from questions instead of fearing them .
Ignorance is not dangerous if you admit to it .
Same for lack of control .
It ’s a fact most of what we experience in life is hard to understand and out of our control .
To feel shame or joy at a fact of life is a decision we ’ve forgotten is ours to make .
Without questions we can’t discover the chains we ’ve hidden .
Chains forced upon us as children when we did not have the will to refuse or ask questions .
Chains we bound ourselves to in order to fit in to school , or work , or a community .
To be a free thinker means forever seeking relief from assumptions , whether it ’s those we ’ve made or have been given to us , and to work towards beliefs and ideas of our own choosing .
Freedom of thought means a perennial willingness to discover better ideas , smarter opinions , more worthy faiths , more honest feelings , a willingness not only to abandon ideas you ’ve held dearly , but to actively seek moments of discovery , moments when you learn a closest held belief has been held for the wrong reasons .
The first time I ate Ethiopian food I had to ask three times “ Are you sure it ’s ok to eat with my hands ? ”
Never having thought before that a ) they are my hands b) it is my mouth , c ) I ’m paying for the food , and I should be able to do whatever I damn well please with all three .
For all of America ’s wonders of freedom , we are still tyrannized by the burdens of silverware .
Then of course I went to India , and was scolded for eating with my left hand .
I ’m always wrong at meals it seems .
Travel makes clear how arbitrary many rules and customs we defend truly are .
The first challenge is the fear of being wrong
Ready ?
You are wrong .
You are wrong much of the time .
I ’m wrong too and some of what I write in this essay will be wrong ( except for this sentence ) .
Even if you are brilliant , successful , happy and loved , you are wrong and ignorant more than you realize .
This is not your fault .
None of our theories about the world are entirely true and this is good .
If we had perfect answers for things progress would be impossible , as to believe in the idea of progress requires belief in the many ignorances of the present .
Look back in time 100 , 50 , or even 5 years , and consider how misguided the wisest , smartest people of those days were compared with what you know now .
Governments , religions , cultures and traditions all change , despite what they say , and there is not a one of them still standing that is exactly the same as it was when it started .
The traditions that have remained may have value , but ask yourself : who decided what to keep and what to throw away ?
And why did they decide what they decided ?
Without knowing the answers to the questions , how can you know exactly what it is you are right and wrong about in what you believe ?
Especially if these traditions have been changing for 100s or 1000s of years ?
It ’s ok to be wrong if you learn something and grow from it .
In fact often there ’s no way to learn without making mistakes .
In many ways you are a wiser , smarter more experienced person than you were in the past .
If you believe any progress in your own thinking and understanding , especially regarding your own life and what it means to you , you must admit that the same kind of progress is possible for you in the future .
And that progress is accelerated only by freeing yourself from the obligation to always be right .
Instead of allegiance to a specific idea , put your faith in your ability to grow and learn .
The former is a chain held in place by your own hand .
The latter is a door you can hold open , a door to a better self .
The second challenge is other people
Children survive only through conformity .
It ’s by recognizing the behavior of adults and adjusting to it , fitting in , that they ’re able to survive .
If babies did n’t learn which kind of cries got them fed , or what kinds of smiles got them attention , they would not live long .
We are designed from birth for survival more than freedom .
Consider how absurd most advice from gurus sounds if directed at a 5 year old .
Start with Buddha ’s excellent advice :
“ Believe nothing , no matter where you read it , or who has said it , even if I have said it , unless it agrees with your reason and your own common sense . ”
This is the opposite of what children are told by every adult in their lives .
Schools teach them specific answers , teachers test and judge them on their ability to memorize and internalize those answers , and parents define rules that control children ’s lives in spite of the child ’s clear desires .
We treat children as if they have no common sense , and for good reason .
Often they have no sense at all , common or otherwise .
But the question remains : at what point do we teach our children to think for themselves ?
And how can we be certain they ’ve unlearned the lessons we worked so hard to teach them until that day ?
There are no required college courses called “ undoing the damage of the last 18 years of your life ” or “ how to escape the evil tyranny of your corrupted youth ” .
We are , perhaps as it always has been or always should be , on our own to figure out what freedom means .
But there is no starting gun , no wake up call , for when to become free , much less how to go about doing it given how much of our lives function on our being unfree .
Joining a “ Free thinking ” group can be nothing of the kind , especially if everyone in the group shares the same brand of atheism , deism , or anything - ism .
Freedom grows best in diversity .
The more ideas you hear , understand and compare , the greater the odds you ’ll think freely about all of them .
This ca n’t happen if you mostly spend time “ philosophizing ” with people who share 97 % of your philosophy .
Instead you ’re likely just sharpening your prejudices .
Sharpening prejudices can be fun .
I do it all the time .
But it ’s not thinking , free or otherwise , and it ’s not good philosophy either .
The third challenge is to be alone
Many of history ’s great spiritual leaders chose to step away from their cultures and their worlds for a time .
Jesus , Buddha , Moses and Muhammad all took long retreats away from everything they knew , freeing themselves from conventions and commitments of normal life .
Only then were the able to discover , to transform , to learn and understand themselves in ways that changed the world .
They had to separate from the chains and bonds before they could be free , and only then , with new perspective and priorities , did they choose to return .
For anyone who knew them , I doubt this choice was popular .
Their children , friends , landlords , and tennis partners were less than thrilled about the prospect of them wandering off the face of the earth for 40 days , or 6 months , or however long they chose .
They say the fish is the last to see the water .
But what if the fish could step out of the tank now and then ?
You are not a fish .
You can take that step whenever you like .
This begs the question , when was the last time you were free from others ?
The last day you spent alone and let all the thoughts you bury and hide in everyday life rise in your mind ?
Travel , meditation , long baths , a run in the woods , are all ways to give ourselves a taste of the solitude needed to think freely .
Needed to understand ourselves and feel who we actually are .
How can you know how much of what you think you want , and think you need is really coming from you ?
It may be that our truest , freest voice , the voice we call our heart of hearts , is always talking , but it ’s quiet and timid and ca n’t be heard over the chatter of everyday life .
Unless we make quiet time to learn how to hear it .
And of course , we ’re still free to ignore that voice , but at least we ’ve given ourselves a chance to listen .
Only then is it possible to sort through our lives to strengthen the connections with others who truly share our feelings and thoughts about life .
Being free has never been easy , which explains why so few , despite what they say , truly are themselves .

Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour is a careful man .
Ever since his right arm was blown off in Iran 's Damascus embassy in the early 1980's , he has become more careful about where he goes , and whom with .
Some Iranians believe that the beautiful book on Shiite Islam which contained the bomb was sent by the Israelis to Iran 's embassy in Damascus , where he had been working .
According to Mohtashamipour , he is lucky that he placed the book on the table first , and opened it sideways .
Had he opened it in front of his face , his head would have been ripped off from the explosion .
Although it cannot be confirmed , there is reason to believe the accusations suggesting Israel 's involvement .
Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour is , after all , the Iranian who established Hezbollah in Lebanon .
The first man who tried and failed was Mostafa Chamran .
The U.S. - educated Chamran had a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California , Berkeley .
He was then hired as a senior research staff scientist at Bell Laboratories and NASA .
However , once the Islamic opposition against the Shah grew , the religious Chamran found his calling back in Iran amongst his fellow revolutionaries .
A fervent Islamist who later became Iran 's Defense Minister , he tried at the beginning of 1980 to establish a pro-Iranian group amongst Lebanon 's Shiites .
His main target was the Amal movement , which back then was the main representative of the Shiites in Lebanon 's political arena .
However , he found that he was unable to convince them to accept Iran 's Velayat-e Faqih ( Guardianship of the Jurists ) system , whereby Iran 's Supreme Leader would be accepted by them as God 's representative on earth to all the Shiites .
Chamran was killed on the battlefront during the war against Iraq in 1981 .
In 1982 , Mohtashamipour succeeded where Chamran had failed by convincing the new Hezbollah movement to accept Ayatollah Khomeini 's religious authority .
The rest , as they say , is history .
You would be forgiven for thinking that Mohtashamipour is treated like a hero in Iran , but the reality is quite different .
Many conservatives hate him ; despite the fact that he created what many believe is Islamic Iran 's most successful political and military ally in the Middle East .
The reason is simple : he is a reformist .
On many occasions , security guards have had to ward off physical attacks against him by neo-conservative students and Basijis who have no problem declaring their undying love and appreciation for Hezbollah .
Yet they can't stand Mohtashamipour , because he wants reform within the system .
On one occasion in the mid-90's , when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the governor of the Ardebil province , Mohtashamipour had to be pulled away from a mob of ultra-religious students by the the future Iranian president .
Mohtashamipour took refuge at Ahmadinejad 's house until the next day , when he was able to return to Tehran .
The recent unrest in Iran has made life more difficult for Mohtashamipour .
During a recent visit to Damascus , he was shadowed and harassed .
Not by the Mossad or the CIA , but by allies of Ahmadinejad .
He was not left alone , even when he visited the Sayyida Zeinab shrine .
At one point he was even told " you would n't dare return to Iran " by the operatives shadowing him around the city .
The treatment of Mohtashamipour provides the West with a strong indication of the roots of Iran 's current erratic behavior .
When the Iranian founder of Hezbollah is treated this way because he disagrees with Ahmadinejad and Khamenei , others who stand in their way have much more to worry about .
One factor that helped Khamenei deal with the West throughout the years was the presence of well educated , pragmatic reformists in key positions .
Even after Ahmadinejad won his first term , people like former nuclear negotiator Hassan Rowhani , Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and moderate conservatives such as Ali Larijani had a say in the formulation of policy presented to the Supreme Leader .
But Larijani resigned as Iran 's top nuclear negotiator because he could no longer stomach working with Ahmadinejad .
And after Ahmadinejad 's controversial reelection , people like Velayati and Rowhani were sidelined .
Those who surround Khamenei these days are almost exclusively all neo-conservatives .
Despite their lack of experience , they have another important quality : loyalty .
Iran 's Supreme Leader has one goal in mind , and that 's to build a bomb -- be it a physical device or the " breakout capacity " to build one on demand .
Until then , he has no time , patience or sympathy for those who may question him , no matter how knowledgeable or skilled they may be .
This is why he is allowing President Ahmadinejad , his loyalist soldier , and his foreign policy - ignorant allies to spearhead important policy bodies such as the Supreme National Security Council ( SNSC ) .
And for those who want to see a pragmatic Iran , this will likely be the case for the foreseeable future .
Financial companies with more than 10 billion dollars in assets will have to pay for rivals ’ failures or rescues under draft legislation released by the US Treasury and lawmakers .
The plan to address systemic risk in the financial sector will wind down failing institutions and end “ too big to fail ” bailouts that have been borne by taxpayers , the Treasury and the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee said .

The proposed Financial Stability Improvement
Act “ provides for the orderly wind - down of failing firms and ends ‘ too big to fail ’ to ensure that industry and shareholders absorb the risks and costs of failure , not taxpayers , ” they said in a statement .
The measure would be a cornerstone of President Barack Obama ’s commitment to reform financial regulation and avert costly taxpayer bailouts of banks and other financial firms .
“ The Financial Services Committee and the Obama administration are committed to ensuring that the taxpayers are never again called upon to take responsibility for Wall Street ?s business decisions , ” the sponsors said .
The 253 - page draft legislation would create a federal resource fund to deal with failures or rescues that would recover expended funds that had not been recouped by imposing assessments on firms with more than 100 billion dollars in assets .
The bill would set up an interagency council to monitor and oversee stability of the financial system and address threats to that stability .

It also would give the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies greater authority to “ regulate for financial stability purposes ” and quickly address potential problems .
Among its other provisions , the bill would subject thrift holding companies to Fed supervision and give the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which insures bank deposits , the ability to unwind a failing firm .
“ Costs to resolve a failing firm will be repaid first from the assets of the failed firm at the expense of shareholders and creditors , and to the extent of any shortfall , from assessments on all large financial firms .
In this instance we follow the ‘ polluter pays ’ model where the financial industry has to pay for their mistakes — not taxpayers . ”

“ It is reasonable to conclude ... that a full replacement of energy currently derived from fossil fuels with energy from alternative sources is probably impossible over the short term ; it may be unrealistic to expect it even over longer time frames , ” explains Searching for a Miracle : Net Energy Limits & the Fate of Industrial Society .
The report was published by the International Forum on Globalization with content provided by the Post Carbon Institute .
It is the first major analysis to use the new research tools of full lifecycle assessment and net energy ratios to compare future scenarios for how industrial society can face its long term future .
The report analyses 18 power alternatives , from traditional fossil fuels and nuclear , through renewable energies such as wind , solar , wave , geothermal and biomass , to identify their net energy ratios ( amount of energy that must be invested in them versus the amount of energy they will be able to produce , as well as their environmental , social and geopolitical impacts ) .
Certain energy production systems suffer from low or negative net energy gain , including most biofuels and biomass , as well as hydrogen systems , oil shale and tar sands , some of which also present unacceptable environmental problems , the report explains .
The best prospects for large - scale production and net - energy performance remain wind energy and certain forms of solar , although these renewable energies face important limitations due to intermittency , remoteness of good resources , materials needed for large - scale deployment , and scale potential .
The cost to install one kilowatt of new capacity ranges from US $ 500 to US $ 1500 for natural gas , US $ 1900 - 5800 for coal , and US $ 4500 - 7500 for nuclear , to the renewable energies wtih US $ 1300 - 2500 for wind , US $ 2600 -3500 for geothermal , US$ 3000 - 5000 for solar thermal and US $ 3900 - 9000 for solar photovoltaic ( PV ) .
The current cost to generate existing power is US$ 0.01 / kWh for hydropower , US$ 0.02-0.04 for coal , US $ 0.029 for nuclear , US$ 0.04 -0.07 for natural gas .
For renewable energies , it is US$ 0.04-0.09 for biomass power , US$ 0.045-0.10 for wind , US$ 0.06 -0.15 for solar thermal , US$ 0.10 for geothermal , US$ 0.10 for tidal , US$ 0.12 for wave and US$ 0.21 to US$ .83 for solar PV .
“ Can any combination of known energy sources successfully supply society ’s energy needs at least up to the year 2100 ? , ” the report asks .
“ In the end , we are left with the disturbing conclusion that all known energy sources are subject to strict limits of one kind or another . ”
Conventional energy sources such as oil , gas , coal and nuclear , “ are either at or nearing the limits of their ability to grow in annual supply , and will dwindle as the decades proceed but , in any case , they are unacceptably hazardous to the environment , ” it explains .
“ Contrary to the hopes of many , there is no clear practical scenario by which we can replace the energy from today ’s conventional sources with sufficient energy from alternative sources to sustain industrial society at its present scale of operations .
To achieve such a transition would require a vast financial investment beyond society ’s practical abilities , a very long time - too long in practical terms - for build - out , and significant sacrifices in terms of energy quality and reliability . ”
“ To say that our current energy regime is unsustainable means that it cannot continue and must therefore be replaced with something else , ” it states .
“ If the transition from current energy sources to alternatives is wrongly managed , the consequences could be severe . ”
“ While it is possible to point to innumerable successful alternative energy production installations within modern societies ( ranging from small homescale photovoltaic systems to large farms of 3 MW wind turbines ) , it is not possible to point to more than a very few examples of an entire modern industrial nation obtaining the bulk of its energy from sources other than oil , coal , and natural gas , ” the report adds .
“ Thus , for most of the world , a meaningful energy transition is still more theory than reality . ”
“ The longer the transition to alternative energy sources is delayed , the more difficult that transition will be unless some practical mix of alternative energy systems can be identified that will have superior economic and environmental characteristics , ” it concludes .
It excludes biofuels ( ethanol and biodiesel ) from future energy supply and downplays the potential for nuclear , hydro , passive solar and biomass .
That leaves 6 renewable energy possibilities : wind , solar PV , concentrating solar thermal , geothermal , wave and tidal , all of which have challenges such as intermittency or limited growth potential .
“ There is no single silver - bullet energy source capable of replacing conventional fossil fuels directly ( at least until the problem of intermittency can be overcome ) though several of the sources discussed already serve , or are capable of serving , as secondary energy sources . ”
“ This means that as fossil fuels deplete , and as society reduces reliance on them in order to avert catastrophic climate impacts , we will have to use every available alternative energy source strategically , ” it concludes .
“ Instead of a silver bullet , we have in our arsenal only BBs , each with a unique profile of strengths and weaknesses that must be taken into account . ”

A Conservative government would consider privatising the Met Office , shadow defence secretary Liam Fox has suggested to the BBC .
The Tories are committed to reducing Ministry of Defence costs by a quarter and this could include selling assets such as the Met Office .
Mr Fox told BBC One 's Andrew Marr
Show there was a " very strong case " for looking at offloading MoD assets .
He disputed suggestions that 22,000 MoD jobs could go as costs are cut .
Mr Fox said the Conservatives ' policy had to be " about giving things to the front line " , adding : " We ca n't afford to have 16 % of the whole civil service in the MoD . "
' Do these deliver ? '
Asked how a Tory government would make savings , he said : " It 's also big structures like the fact the MoD owns the Met Office , with all the costs , salaries , pensions . "
Questioned about privatising the Met Office , Mr Fox said : " There 's a very strong case to look at the assets of the MoD and say do these deliver anything for the front line ? "
The Conservatives have asked civil servants to draw up plans to cut MoD costs by 25 % without reducing front - line troops .
I 'm very happy to have any extra help , any extra advice that leads us to better decision - making
Liam Fox , Conservatives Mr
Fox told the party 's conference earlier this month : " Some things will have to change and , believe me , they will . "
The MoD has 85,000 civil servants .
The Tories have pledged to cut overall Whitehall budgets by a third .
The Liberal Democrats have also pledged to axe 10,000 " desk jobs " at the MoD to fund a salary rise for junior armed forces personnel .
But Labour ministers have accused the Conservatives of undermining the morale of troops in Afghanistan by raising questions about funding .
The Met Office , which provides the UK's weather forecasts , was established in 1854 as a small department within the Board of Trade and later became part of the MoD.
' Bit of training ' Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show , Mr Fox played down the significance of the appointment of the former head of the Army , General Sir Richard Dannatt , as a military adviser to the Conservatives , saying : " Advisers advise , politicians decide " .
Gen Dannatt has said he was recruited because party leader David Cameron felt his defence team " lacked expert understanding " .
But Mr
Fox said : " It takes a bit of training to be a politician . "
He insisted Gen Dannatt had agreed only to be an adviser and " no ministerial role has been either offered or accepted " .
He said : " I 'm very happy to have any extra help , any extra advice that leads us to better decision - making . "
Last week Lord Turnbull , a former head of the Civil Service , said the appointment of General Dannatt was a " major error of judgment " and warned that it would call into question the impartiality of other military chiefs .

Posted by John , September 30th , 2009 - under Teachers .
Tags : Canberra , Canberra Labor
Canberra teachers have accepted a 6.1 pay increase over two years under a new deal with the Stanhope Labor Government .
This is a defeat for teachers and the wider union movement in Canberra .
How so ?
Headline inflation last quarter was 1.5 percent .
Core inflation – the figure the Reserve Bank pays particular attention to – was 3.9 percent .
Any pay increase less than 4 percent is a real pay cut .
The pay rates mean that ACT teachers will fall further behind their New South Wales counterparts .
Canberra teachers used to be industrially strong and prepared to exercise their muscle .
This time they have capitulated without a whisper of a fight .
82 percent voted for the agreement to make their profession less competitive and less monetarily rewarding .
They did so because the ALP Chief Minister and his left - wing Deputy both claimed the global financial crisis meant the Labor Government did n’t have enough money to pay real wage increases .
Teachers accepted the idea of wage restraint .
Compare this to recently retired heads of major Australian companies like Alan Moss from Macquarie Bank who got $ 30 million after 29 days work this financial year , or Geoff Dixon from Qantas who got $ 11 million for a few months work .
Both companies have lost incredible amounts of their market value under this leadership .
The people who caused the crisis get millions .
We get a pittance .
The fact that the once strong education union in Canberra and its savvy members can accept that they have to bear the burden for the crisis of capitalism highlights the backwardness of the thinking of major sections of the working class in Australia today .
It will not always be so but socialists have to deal with and understand the reality on the ground now .
The timing of this pay cut is ironic .
Just as the capitalist economy in Australia appears to be recovering ( a weak recovery insufficient to stop unemployment and underemployment increasing markedly ) teachers have accepted the lies of the Labor Left and gone for a few scraps from the table rather than demanding that they join the feast .
The teachers ’ wage deal will become the standard from which other public sector unions will bargain down .
The ACT Public Service is about to enter into negotiations with the Community and Public Sector Union over a new wages agreement for the 10,000 Canberra public servants .
Given the ‘ lead ’ teachers have shown them , it is likely that other Canberra workers will accept something much less than 3 percent .
And most workers will do so willingly , concerned about the crisis and its impact on their jobs .
Yet this local Labor Government has flagged future staff cuts to help balance the Budget , and , following John Howard and Kevin Rudd at the Federal level , efficiency dividends to cut programs and costs .
So wage cuts wo n’t save jobs .
Let ’s join the fight for real wage increases and real job security .
It ’s their crisis , make them pay .
Express Outrage Over Oklahoma's Law that Posts Personal Abortion Data Online !
by : Center for Reproductive Rights
recipient : Senator Todd Lamb
Oklahoma recently passed a law requiring that abortion providers fill out a 10 - page questionnaire for each procedure , and that details of abortions be posted on a public Web site !
This extensive questionnaire - which includes the reason the procedure was sought - is not only an affront to women 's rights , its detailed nature may allow women in small towns to be identified , violating their privacy and potentially jeopardizing their life and livelihood .
The law is being challenged as unconstitutional in court .
In December , a temporary restraining order was placed on the law to keep it from going into effect until February 2010 .
Over the next several weeks , we must send a strong message that we wo n't let Oklahoma serve as a testing ground for extreme anti-choice legislation nationwide !
Sign the petition letter to the law 's author , Senator Todd Lamb , and stand up for women 's right to reproductive choice .
read petition letter ▾
I am writing you today to express my outrage over Oklahoma 's law requiring " anonymous " public sharing of abortion patients ' personal data online .
In every respect , this law is immoral , unjust and nonsensical .
[ Your comments here ]
As someone who is running for lieutenant governor in 2010 , you should understand that a women 's right to safe , legal and confidential abortion must not be compromised .
The law you authored does not " ... move Oklahoma forward in the 21st century , " like you purport other public policies do .
In fact , it is a step backward for women 's rights .
The real aim of this law is to persuade doctors to stop performing abortions by placing new burdens on their practice , to intimidate and shame women , and to stigmatize a legal medical procedure that one in three women have at some point in their lives .
Simply put , the law is dangerous and an affront to women 's rights .
I stand with the women of Oklahoma - and with women across the country - when I say that the pro-choice majority will not let Oklahoma serve as a testing ground for extreme anti-choice legislation nationwide !

UKAEA
Ltd helps decommission plants in the UK and overseas
The government has announced the sale of the commercial arm of the UK's Atomic Energy Agency , UKAEA Limited , for £ 50 m to Babcock International .
UKAEA
Ltd provides services such as waste management and decommissioning of old nuclear power plants , as well as supporting the building of new plants .
The government announced plans for the sale earlier this year .
It had said it would consider retaining a stake in UKAEA but Babcock is to take 100 % ownership of the firm .
Business secretary Lord Mandelson said the sale would allow UKAEA to " continue its development and take advantage of new opportunities in the nuclear industry " .
It also generated good value for the tax payer , he added .
Babcock already supplies engineering and support services to the nuclear industry in the UK , and also has interests in Australia , Canada and Africa .
European influence
UKAEA , which employs 230 people , is handling decommissioning work for the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency at Dounreay in Scotland , Winfrith in Dorset , and Harwell in Oxfordshire .
It also has offices in Warrington and Cumbria .
The sell - off has attracted criticism from some - including the Conservatives , who suggested it was motivated by a need to boost public finances .
European power companies have been preparing themselves to bid to build new nuclear plants around Britain .
The French energy group GDF Suez and Spain 's Iberdrola have created a partnership to build new plants .
White House snubs Fox -- again
" Fox News Sunday " host Chris Wallace says the White House continues to snub his show .
He said the White House was asked for someone to appear on his show Sunday to talk about the harsh administration rhetoric about Fox News , but the White House refused to book any aide on that subject -- or any others .
Wallace settled instead for a debate between former top Bush White House aide Karl Rove and former Democratic National Chairman Terry McAuliffe , who said he spoke with the White House before appearing on the show to defend its strategy .
McAuliffe said several times that Obama would come on Fox again .
White House Communications Director Anita Dunn opened a new front on the Democratic war with Fox News last week by calling it a " wing of the Republican Party . "
" This is an administration that is getting very arrogant and slippery in its dealings with people and if you dare to oppose them , they will come hard at you and cut your legs off , " Rove said .
" The administration is making a mistake for itself , " Rove continued .
" But more importantly , it is demeaning the office of the president by taking the president and moving him from a person who wants to be talking to everybody and communicating through every available channel the same , if you oppose me , you question me , if you are too tough on me , by gosh , me and my people are not going to come on , we are going to penalize you .
That is just wrong , fundamentally wrong . "
It should be noted that the Bush White House was also known for freezing out its critics in the media .

Every time Apple brings out a new version of OS X , we compile a list of our favourite Terminal commands for enabling hidden features and changing hidden settings ( here are the lists for Tiger and Leopard ) .
For those who are new to Terminal Commands , here 's a quick run down of how to use them .
Do n't worry , it 's really easy .
Start by opening up Terminal , located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder .
In the window that appears , paste in one of the lines provided below , and then hit Return .
For the changes to take effect , you need to restart the application concerned .
For applications like the Dock or Finder , it is easiest to just type killall Dock or killall Finder into the Terminal to restart them .
To reverse the changes , you just need to change the last word of the command and run it again .
If the last word is YES , change it to NO , change 1 to 0 , and change TRUE to FALSE and vice versa for all .
1. Folder previews in Quick Look
This is my favourite hidden feature in Snow Leopard .
When enabled , using Quick Look ( hit the space bar ) on a folder will show you a preview of the folder 's contents inside a translucent folder icon .
The previews of the files inside the folder also cycle through so you can see all of them .
Just use the following command :
< code > defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableXRayFolders 1</code >
You will need to restart the Finder , either by typing killall Finder into the Terminal or by Control - Option - clicking on the Finder in the Dock and choosing Relaunch .
2. Globally enable Text Substitutions
You may have realised that the new text substitutions feature in Snow Leopard is n't enabled in all applications by default , most noticeably in Safari .
To enable it , you need to right - click on a text box and choose Substitutions then Show Substitutions .
To globally enable text substitutions , use the following three commands one at a time .
The first one will enable substitutions , while the second will enable dash replacement and the third will enable spell checking .
defaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled - bool true defaults write -g WebAutomaticDashSubstitutionEnabled - bool true defaults write -g WebContinuousSpellCheckingEnabled - bool true
If you decide there are some specific applications where you want to disable these again , you can do it in the normal way .
As always you will need to restart each application for the changes to take effect .
3. Bring back AppleScript Studio palette
As of Snow Leopard , AppleScript Studio has be deprecated in favour of AppleScriptObjC .
You can still work on AppleScript Studio projects , but you can't create new ones , and the AppleScript Studio palette in Interface Builder is gone .
To bring it back , use the following command :
defaults write com.apple.InterfaceBuilder3 IBEnableAppleScriptStudioSupport - bool YES
4. Disable " focus follows mouse " in Terminal
In Leopard there was a Terminal command to make the Terminal 's window focus change with mouse movement .
If you had previously enabled this , you will find things do n't work quite right in Snow Leopard when you use Command - Tab to switch between applications in different spaces .
To fix this , you will need to disable the focus follows mouse behaviour using the following command :
defaults write com.apple .
Terminal FocusFollowsMouse - string NO
5. Force Dictionary to only use one window
If you are n't a fan of using Command - Control - D to quickly look up definitions , you might use the " Look up in Dictionary " contextual menu item or Services menu item .
In Snow Leopard , each word you look up using these methods opens in a new Dictionary window , which gets a bit annoying .
To make each word you look up open in the same window , just use the following command :
defaults write com.apple.Dictionary ProhibitNewWindowForRequest - bool TRUE
6 . Change the behaviour of the green zoom button in iTunes
With the release of iTunes 9 , Apple messed around a bit with the behaviour of the green zoom button in iTunes .
Things are back to normal as of iTunes 9.01 , but briefly the green button maximised the window instead of switching to the mini-player .
If you liked the temporary change , you can bring it back using the following command :
defaults write com.apple .iTunes zoom - to - window - bool YES
Of course , you can always get the alternative behaviour by holding the Option key and clicking in the green button .
7. Debug menu in Address Book
The debug menu has been available in Address Book for some time , but there are some new additions in Snow Leopard .
If you do n't already have it enabled , the command is :
defaults write com.apple.AddressBook ABShowDebugMenu - bool true
Restart Address Book , and then click Debug in the menu bar to see the new options .
You can enable reflections under contacts pictures , get to the " People Picker Panel " and enable a debug panel called " Ye Olde Debug Settings ” .
8. Autoplay movies in QuickTime X
One of the weird things about the new version of QuickTime is that it has no Preferences .
Luckily you can still change things using the Terminal .
To make a movie automatically start playing when you open it , use the following command :
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGPlayMovieOnOpen
1
9. Keep QuickTime in full screen when switching applications
If you are watching a movie in full screen in QuickTime and you use Command - Tab to switch to another application then the movie will automatically exit full screen .
To make it stay full screen in the background , use the following command :
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGFullScreenExitOnAppSwitch 0
10 . Disable Rounded corners in QuickTime
If the slightly rounded corners of movies in QuickTime bug you , use the following command to disable them :
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGCinematicWindowDebugForceNoRoundedCorners
1
11 . Always or Never show titlebar and Controller in QuickTime
The following two commands either permanently enable or disable the titlebar and controller that pop up when you mouse over a movie in QuickTime :
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGUIVisibilityNeverAutoshow 1 defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGUIVisibilityNeverAutohide 1
12 . Automatically show closed captioning and subtitles on opening
This turns on subtitles and closed captioning automatically when you open a movie that supports them .
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGEnableCCAndSubtitlesOnOpen
1
13 .
Make list view stacks work like grid view Stacks
This command slightly changes the behaviour in Stacks in list view .
Once enabled , they act more like grid view Stacks , but with a single list of files and icons on the left .
The main difference is when " drilling - down " through folders within the Stack .
defaults write com.apple.dock use-new- list- stack - bool YES
You will need to restart the Dock for changes to take effect .
The easiest way is to use killall Dock in the Terminal .
14 . Enable mouseover highlight in stacks
If you want items in grid view stacks to highlight when you move the mouse over them , use the following command .
It 's slightly different from the equivalent in Leopard .
Also , note that you can get the highlight behaviour in Snow Leopard without using this command by using the arrow keys to select items in a stack , or by clicking and holding on a stack before dragging the mouse up onto the grid .
defaults write com.apple.dock mouse-over-hilite - stack - boolean YES
You will need to restart the Dock for changes to take effect .
The easiest way is to use killall Dock in the Terminal .
15 .
Set a precise screensaver password delay
A useful new feature of Snow Leopard is the ability to set how long your Mac is asleep or how long the screen saver is on before it requires a password to wake up again .
You can access this from the Security section of System Preferences .
However , you have to choose a time period from a drop - down menu , and you can't enter your own custom time period .
To do this , use the following command .
The number at the end is the time in seconds .
For example 1800 is 30 minutes , which bizarrely is n't an option in the drop - down menu .
As most of you know , Cracked.com is actually my night job .
My real job is , and has been for the last several years , Chief Editor in Chief at O'Brien & " Sons " Erotic Fiction Publishing House , where I 've been overseeing the publishing and distribution of thousands of the most successful Erotic Fiction novels to hit the stands .
If you picked up an Erotic Fiction Novel ( EroFicNov ) over the last decade , chances are it carried the O'Brien & " Sons " label .
As you can imagine , a ton of Erotic Fiction Manuscripts ( EroFicMan ) have come across my desk over the years , some of it great , some of it not so great .
To answer some of the questions I get regularly , and to make my job easier , I 'm going to list all the important steps to writing great Erotic Fiction , everything that separates the un-publishable from the publishable .
Follow these instructions and , in no time , you 'll write something so great it'll make The Way of a Man with a Maid look like The Lustful Turk !
Be Original , People !
I can't tell you how many times I 've rejected the same , stale Erotic Fiction premises ( EroFicPre ) .
A pizza delivery guy enters and seduces with a housewife .
A rich prince sweeps a poor , delicate woman off of her feet and into his bed .
A painter is so overcome with the beauty of his model that he abruptly stops his work and romances her / masturbates in front of her .
A vampire and the twins from that Harry Potter movie fuck in a cave , somewhere .
A stale premise wo n't get your foot in the door , which is why originality is the single most important part of Erotic Fiction .
The Erotic Fiction Community ( EroFicCom ) is overrun with these premises .
Surprise us !
Show us something we have n't seen before , or your Erotic Fiction will live at the bottom of the bargain bucket with the rest of the literary world 's excrement .
It 's easy and lazy to say that all of the good premises have been taken .
True , the remaining premises do n't immediately lend themselves to Erotic Fiction , but with some creativity , I 'm confident that you can make anything sexy !
At the zoo !
An interdisciplinary team of researchers at IBM have presented at paper at the SC09 supercomputing conference describing a milestone in cognitive computing : the group 's massively parallel cortical simulator , C2 , now has the ability to simulate a brain with about 4.5 percent the cerebral cortex capacity of a human brain , and significantly more brain capacity than a cat .
No , this is n't yet another example of Kurzweil - style guesstimating about how many " terabytes " of storage a human brain has .
Rather , the authors quantify brain capacity in terms of numbers of neurons and synapses .
The simulator , which runs on the Dawn Blue Gene / P supercomputer with 147,456 CPUs and 144TB of main memory , simulates the activity of 1.617 billion neurons connected in a network of 8.87 trillion synapses .
The model does n't yet run at real time , but it does simulate a number of aspects of real - world neuronal interactions , and the neurons are organized with the same kinds of groupings and specializations as a mammalian cortex .
In other words , this is a virtual mammalian brain ( or at least part of one ) inside a computer , and the simulation is good enough that the team is already starting to bump up against some of the philosophical issues raised about such models by cognitive scientists over the past decades .
In a nutshell , when a simulation of a complex phenomenon ( brains , weather systems ) reaches a certain level of fidelity , it becomes just as difficult to figure out what 's actually going on in the model — how it 's organized , or how it will respond to a set of inputs — as it is to answer the same questions about a live version of the phenomenon that the simulation is modeling .
So building a highly accurate simulation of a complex , nondeterministic system does n't mean that you 'll immediately understand how that system works — it just means that instead of having one thing you do n't understand ( at whatever level of abstraction ) , you now have two things you do n't understand : the real system , and a simulation of the system that has all of the complexities of the original plus an additional layer of complexity associated with the models implementation in hardware and software .
The more faithful the simulation gets , the bigger an issue this becomes .
The researchers allude to it in section 3.2.2 of the paper , when they describe a measurement tool they call the " BrainCam . "
" When combined with the mammalian - scale models now possible with C2 , " they write , " the flood of data can be overwhelming from a computational ( for example , the total amount of data can be many terabytes ) and human perspective ( the visualization of the data can be too large or too detailed ) . "
The problem described above does n't mean that accurate simulations are worthless , however .
You can poke , prod , and dissect a brain simulation without any of the ethical or logistical challenges that arise from doing similar work on a real brain .
The IBM researchers endowed the model with checkpoint - based state - saving capabilities , so that the simulation can be rewound to certain states and then moved forward again under different conditions .
They also have the facility for generating MPG movies of different aspects of the virtual brain in operation , movies that you could also generate by measuring an animal 's brain but at much lower resolutions .
There 's even a virtual EKG , which lets the researchers validate the model by comparing it to EKGs from real brains .
In the end , C2 is like having a ( sorta ) real cortex that you do n't fully understand , but that you can rewind , snap pictures of , and generally measure under different conditions so that you can do experiments on it that would n't be possible ( or ethical ) with real brains .
Scaling and the singularity
One of the major results from the paper is that C2 exhibits " weak scaling . "
In other words , as the total amount of memory in the model scales , the number of neurons and synapses that can be simulated scales roughly linearly , also .
This is important , because it means that a future version of Blue Gene with two or three orders of magnitude more memory ( and associated bandwidth and processing power ) will be able to simulate an entire human brain .
The model also exhibits " strong scaling , " which means that increases in the amount of memory per CPU enable them to run the model faster , so that it will eventually be able to simulate a cortex in real time .
The opening line of an Intel press release out Thursday morning just about says it all :
Intel Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices today announced a comprehensive agreement to end all outstanding legal disputes between the companies , including antitrust litigation and patent cross license disputes .
Wowza .
Color us surprised .

Versus plans to televise an NHL doubleheader Thursday .
First up is Washington , with reigning player of the year Alexander Ovechkin , against Boston at 4 p.m. PDT .
Next is San Jose and Colorado at 7 , featuring a retirement ceremony for Colorado ’s Joe Sakic .
But an estimated 18 million DirecTV subscribers wo n’t be able to watch unless the contract dispute that caused the satellite provider to pull Versus off its menu Sept. 1 is resolved .
Besides the NHL , the network televises college football , Indy Racing League auto racing , cycling and bull riding .
DirecTV spokesman Robert Mercer said negotiations are ongoing .
“ We ’re open to putting the games up for our customers while we continue to negotiate , ” he said .
“ The puck is at their end of the rink . ”
Jamie Davis , president of Versus , said that is n’t the case .

“ They ’re the ones who pulled our signal off the air on Sept. 1 , ” Davis said .
“ We were having fruitful negotiations .
They were the ones who put up a slate background and insulted our programming and clouded the issues by saying it ’s all about price .
“ We are still negotiating but they are still unwilling to budge off of insisting on re-tiering our network and taking it away from 6 million subscribers . ”
Three sources with knowledge of the negotiations , who are unable to speak for attribution because of the sensitive nature of the talks , said that Comcast , which owns Versus , wants to increase the cost per subscriber from about 21 cents to about 26 cents .
Davis said this dispute is n’t mainly about money , though .

“ DirecTV wants to put us on a tier that reaches fewer subscribers , ” Davis said .
Mercer said cost is an issue .
“ A lot of fans understand why we ’re doing it .
We want to hold down programming costs .
Also , understand that Versus is owned by Comcast , our largest competitor . ”
Since Sept. 1 , DirecTV subscribers have missed a couple of college football upsets , Sept. 19 when Florida State beat Brigham Young , and last week when Arizona won at Oregon State .

Duane Lindberg , the Pacific 10 associate commissioner for electronic services , said he understood that a large number of DirecTV customers in Arizona were unhappy .
The conference is in the third year of a five - year deal with Versus .
“ We are getting feedback , no question , ” he said .
“ From our standpoint we want as much distribution as possible . ”
On the NHL website is an open letter : “ As a DirecTV subscriber we encourage you to tell DirecTV that you want Versus back so that you do n’t miss any NHL games this season . ”
During a Washington Capitals team event last weekend , NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said to those in attendance , “ Call DirecTV and tell them you ’re not happy . ”

Davis said that as long as DirecTV continues to be “ un - budged from their position , ” there may be no quick fix .
“ I ’m afraid it could be some time , ” Davis said .

Social conservatives are working to ensure that federal funding for sex change operations will be banned in the health reform bill .
Conservatives shop sex ops ban
The federal government would be banned from funding sex change operations and other services for transgender individuals if social conservative activists get their way .
There ’s no sponsor yet for an amendment to the health care overhaul – and it may remain in the dustbin of unrealized wedge issues – but culture warriors are shopping the proposal to Republican senators .
Advertisement
The language is written : “ None of the funds authorized or appropriated under this act ( or an amendment made by this Act ) shall be used to cover any part or portion of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of ” any sex or gender reassignment procedure , surgery related to such a sex change , hormone therapy for a sex change or pre- and post - operation treatments for a sex change .
A senior aide to a Republican senator said that a public insurance plan could easily end up covering sex - change procedures if that ’s not specifically banned in the bill .
“ It 's not that hard to imagine that a new federal health plan crafted and implemented by this administration would cover sex - change surgeries .
Anything not explicitly prohibited in the bill is effectively on the table .
Most Americans probably would prefer that their tax dollars not pay for or subsidize transgender surgery , ” the aide said .
Advocates for transgender people note that it is often difficult for them to obtain insurance that covers medical needs related to their transition and say that sometimes basic medical care has been unfairly denied .
“ Unfortunately , some insurance companies broadly interpret language excluding transgender - related care and services to deny coverage for non-transition - related procedures for transgender individuals .
Insurers justify these exclusions by stating that your current medical problem is somehow related to your transition , ” the Transgender Law Center wrote in a fact sheet posted on its Website .
The ironclad language of the funding - ban amendment suggests the type of prohibition conservatives want to see on coverage of abortion if a new health care exchange includes a government - backed insurance option .
House Democrats say they have a plan that would segregate federal funds to prevent taxpayer support for abortion services , but abortion critics say the proposed firewall would not fully shield taxpayers from footing the bill for the practice .
In its first iteration , the House version of the health care bill did n’t mention the word abortion – though it carried significant implications for the availability of insurance coverage for the procedure .
Several Democratic aides – and Sen Roland Burris ( D - Ill. ) – declined to comment on the proposal .
( CNN ) -- Police arrested another teen Thursday , the sixth suspect jailed in connection with the gang rape of a 15 - year - old girl on a northern California high school campus .
Jose Carlos Montano , 18 , was arrested on charges of felony rape , rape in concert with force , and penetration with a foreign object , said Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan .
Montano was arrested Thursday evening in San Pablo , California , a small town about two miles from the city of Richmond , where the crime took place .
Montano , who was held in lieu of $ 1.3 million bail , is accused of taking part in what police said was a 2 ½ - hour assault on the Richmond High School campus .
Police said as many as 10 people were involved in the rape in a dimly lit back alley at the school , while another 10 people watched without calling 911 .
The victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition , but was released Wednesday .
Four other teenage suspects were arraigned Thursday on charges connected to the rape .
Cody Ray Smith , described by the court as older than 14 , pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force .
Two other juveniles , Ari Abdallah Morales and Marcelles James Peter , appeared with Smith at the Contra Costa County Superior Court , but did not enter a plea .
The court described Morales as younger than 16 , and did not give an age for Peter .
All three juveniles , who wore bulletproof vests at the hearing , were charged as adults .
A fourth person , Manuel Ortega , 19 , appeared separately without an attorney and did not enter a plea .
He did not wear a protective vest .
Another person , Salvador Rodriguez , 21 , was arrested Tuesday night , but he was not in court Thursday .
Not since AT&T gobbled up Cingular and rebranded as at&t with that ugly Death Star - like logo has a company erred so far from sensibility .
The new AOL brand , Aol. , is coming soon to frighten you .
AOL 's attempt to be hip is anything but .
Not that AOL , distributor of a billion CD coasters , was ever cool .
The service may have been the biggest online community of the 1990s , but it was never hip .
Nor will the lame rebranding make it so .
AOL previewed the new brand identity overnight ahead of its unveiling on December 10th , for the company 's spin - off from Time Warner .
By measure of big tech sites and Twitter , the rebranding is a total fail before even being officially launched .
Giga OM's Om Malik opined : " The new logo fails to capture what is going to be a smaller , nimbler AOL , one that is represented by a collection of smaller , iconic brands such as Engadget and Joystiq .
AOL should ask for its money back ! "

NBC Washington 's Jim Iovino blogged : " Give those image consultants a year 's worth of dial - up and a few thousand AOL CDs packed away in the Dulles campus boiler room .
And yes , they 're officially calling the logo ' aol - dot ' .
Dot - what you ask ?
Good question .
We 'd suggest ' dot - lame , ' but whatever . "
Designer Daily blogger Mirko Humbert likes the basic lower - case logo and period , but still gives it a fail : " Unfortunately , there are many chances that you wo n't even notice the nice changes to the logo since it also features some horrible background images . "
The logo was a big topic on Twitter today , too .
Some random tweets :
Web designer Will Ayers : " AOL 's new branding + identity is nothing short of a complete disaster .
Wow .
Speechless . "
FASTforward blogger Paula Thornton : " And in lower case it is now subjected to pronunciation .
How would YOU pronounce aol ? : ) "
Business Insider writer Alaska Miller : " Iterate , get trolled , re-iterate .
Ad nauseum .
Maybe now AOL can finally compete .
Good on them .
TS on the shareholders , though . "
Web developer Bruce Clark : " AOL , the world is crying for you .
How in the world did you ever seriously consider this ... much less make it real ? "
Marketer Doug Chavez : " Does anyone else think the new Aol logo looks like it was designed by a 5th grader ? "
The branding announcement comes at a strange juxtaposition .
AOL execs are on the road trying to woo investors to next month 's public offering , while also looking to lop 2,500 heads from the 6,000 payroll .
You 've got to wonder who would want to leave a company right before a spinoff .
I lived in Washington , D.C. , when an earlier incarnation of AOL went public and turned even the lowliest of employees into instant millionaires .
Surely this past is n't lost on the AOLers looking at the big exit sign .
AOL is giving employees some untoward exit options .
Last week , All Things Digital 's Kara Swisher blogged :
AOL is offering those who ' volunteer ' to leave the company now a departure package that ranges from three to nine months of pay , compared to one to four months for employees laid off in the first quarter of next year .
It 's a depressing rock - and - a - hard - place choice .
An AOL spokesperson confirmed the offer .
Say , AOLers , if the new brand is any indication of things to come , maybe you should take the money now and run .
But use that rebranding as bargaining chip for 12 months pay with benefits and a bunch of cheap AOL shares .
You can look for reemployment at leisure instead of going down with the good ship Aol. , which can't be all that good for you .
How cruel is it to take voluntary departures until December 4th , only to trot out the big public offering days later ?
The point : AOL 's execution problem is much bigger than just the rebranding .
Wait .
Now when is that public offering again ?
Officially , it 's December 9th .
But according to Silicon Alley Insider 's Nicholas Carlson , AOL stock could start trading as early as tomorrow under " when issued " trading rules .
Sure enough , there 's an 8 - K filing dated November 20th explaining AOL 's plans .

I sraelis talk often and loudly about their desires for peace .
But its never been clear precisely what peace concept it is they desire .
In particular , Israeli notions of peace have never gone so far as to grant the Palestinians the same national rights that Israelis claim for themselves .
Well , according to a new poll by Israeli National News ( disclaimer : its a right - wing rag , sample size " more than 6,400 ″ ) , a majority of Israelis are clear about what kind of " peace " they desire .
53.2 % of surveyed Israelis say the " solution " to the conflict was the ethnic cleansing ( " transfer " ) of Palestinians out of occupied Palestine and into other neighboring Arab countries .
This was the most popular option among all alternatives , including the two state solution , Jordanian citizenship in the West Bank , status quo , etc .
For comparative purposes , only 30.8 % of Israelis support the " two - states for two peoples " framework for peace .
Keep this information in mind next to you hear Israeli hasbara about " partners for peace " or when someone tries to claim that the two - state solution is the only " realistic " solution to the conflict .
If only those Palestinians would " recognize Israel�s right to exist " , then everything would be SO much better .
In America , it is n’t hard to answer the question in the headline “ yes . ”
The oft recited , “ Our employees are our greatest asset ” is pure Orwellian prattle ; most companies treat employees as liabilities , doing everything they can to minimize labor costs , getting rid of workers whenever possible .
And this now extends well up into the management ranks , with most people who are still on the corporate meal ticket assigned responsibilities that would have constituted 1.5 to two jobs a decade ago .
And before readers argue that this is a necessary response to globalization , the evidence does not support that view .
If companies were simply responding to tougher competition ( in this case , lower cost suppliers from overseas ) , you ’d expect to pressure on wages AND profits .
Instead , we ’ve seen wage stagnation ( save at the very top ) with ( pre bust ) record profits .
If you look at past post - war expansion periods , the vast majority of GDP growth went to labor , in the form of increased hiring and higher wages .
The post war average ( pre the last upturn ) was close to 60 % ; the low was 55 % .
The jobless recovery lived up to its billing , with under 30 % of GDP gains going to workers .
By contrast , the portion of GDP growth that went to profits was an all - time record .
Similarly , as any properly - trained MBA will tell you , companies can compete on other axes besides cost : convenience , product features , speed of delivery , other types of service .
And US businesses have a huge advantage : physical proximity to the biggest consumer market .
Offshoring and outsourcing create considerable rigidity and risk ( more coordination required , which increases the odds of snafus )
Some evidence supports the idea that outsourcing is a fad that US companies embraced whether or not it fully made sense .
Most companies find outsourcing to be overrated as a cost saver .
A former senior executive at Ethan Allen told me there was not reason for the US to cede anywhere close to as much furniture manufacturing as it did , particularly given the cost of shipping ( often two ways , since much of the raw materials come from North America ) .
But in Ethan Allen ’s case , Wall Street wanted to hear they were manufacturing overseas , and they complied .
Moreover , other countries , equally exposed to globalization , have not seen a squeezing down on workers to the benefit of the top 1 % to anywhere the degree the US has , nor is the international pattern consistent with globalization ( or other common culprits ) being the driver .
The Luxembourg Income Study ( LIS ) group put out a working paper by Andrea Brandolini and Timothy Smeeding with some international comparisons on income inequality , titled “ Inequality Patterns in Western - Type Democracies : Cross- Country Differences and Time Changes ” :
National experiences vary during the last four decades and there is no one overarching common story .
There was some tendency for the disposable income distribution to narrow until the mid-1970s .
Then , income inequality rose sharply in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s ( and still continuing ) , but more moderately in Canada , Sweden , Finland and West Germany in the 1990s .
Moreover , the timing and magnitude of the increase differed widely across nations .
Inequality did not show any persistent tendency to rise in the Netherlands , France and Italy .
Commonality seems to be greater for market income inequality : in five of the six countries for which we have data , we observe an increase in the 1980s and early 1990s and a substantial stability afterwards .
Changing public monetary redistribution appears to be an important determinant of the time pattern of the inequality of disposable incomes .
Changes in inequality do not exhibit clear trajectories , but rather irregular movements , with more substantial changes often concentrated in rather short lapses of time .
Together with the lack of a common international pattern , this suggests to look at explanations based on the joint working of multiple factors which sometimes balance out , sometimes reinforce each other , rather than to focus on explanations centered on a single cause like deindustrialization , skill - biased technological progress , or globalization .
Identifying and characterizing episodes and turning points in the dynamics of inequality may reveal more fruitful than searching for overarching general tendencies .
Other factors are that changes in policy have reduced the bargaining power of workers , and to a much greater degree than most realize .
For instance , MIT economists Frank Levy and Peter Temin argued that , “ Institutions and norms affect the distribution of economic rewards . ”
The paper combines some novel analyses with a Depression - to - present - day narrative of evolving labor - business - government relationships ( one nice touch is a comparison of starting salaries at Cravath versus that of average graduate degree holders to illustrate the rise of “ winner take all ” inequalities ) .
Government also gave signals through tax structures and other mechanisms of their view of the appropriate level of labor compensation .
For example , when Kennedy implemented tax cuts , the Council of Economic Advisers announced wage and price guidelines that indicated that labor should share pro rata .
The paper describes other ways that the government let businesses know that it expected productivity gains to be shared with workers .
Again , these measures took the form of guidance rather than intervention , but also reflected prevailing ideas of fairness .
By contrast , a piece today in Firedoglake ( hat tip reader John D ) illustrates how much values have changed , first with a graphic , and some scathing commentary :
Friday , a group of Trade Associations ran a full - page ad in the New York Times demonstrating their loathing for the employees of their members : Expensive new mandates on businesses will result in lost jobs , lower wages , less flexibility and higher health care costs .
Let me translate that from scary talk to plain English .
Business will dump every last cent of the costs of health care on employees .
No business will give up a single penny of its profits to keep its workers healthy .
Anyone who wants health care has to pay for it at whatever price the insurance companies want to charge , and business will cooperate in shifting costs to workers .
And there is nothing you can do about it .
The profits we suck out of your labor belongs to us , and you do n’t get any .
Sound a bit like class warfare ?
It ’s not a surprising reaction when one party keeps cutting itself the an overly large slice of the pie , and then adding insult to injury through spurious rationalizations .
The CEOs of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers , the two investment banks that collapsed during last year ’s financial meltdown , walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation even as the company ’s shareholders lost everything , says a new report from Harvard Law School .
The top five executives at Bear Stearns made a total of $ 1.4 billion from bonuses and equity sales between 2000 and 2008 , while the top five executives at Lehman Brothers made around $ 1 billion during that same period — the period during which the companies ran up the bad investments that would see them collapse in 2008 , according to “ The Wages of Failure ” ( PDF ) , a report from Harvard Law School ’s Program on Corporate Governance .

“ The people who invested in these companies should feel betrayed , ” Nell Minow , a compensation expert at the Corporate Library , told NBC ’s Lisa Myers .
“ The whole idea of capitalism is that the people provide the capital and the executives take care of it for us .
In this case , the people provided the capital , and the executives took it . ”
Bear Stearns CEO
James
Cayne personally made $ 388 million in the eight - year period leading up to the bank ’s collapse , while Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld made $ 541 million .
Boomberg news service notes that “ shareholders who held their shares throughout the period analyzed in the report lost most of their initial investment . ”
NBC ’s Myers points out that both Cayne and Fuld are being sued by shareholders .
CNBC business anchor Jim Cramer told NBC ’s Matt Lauer that the corporate culture that led to the huge bonuses and financial collapse is n’t going away .
“ What happened to these people ?
Nothing , ” Cramer said .
“ They got the money , they left . …
They got away with it , so why should n’t the next guy try ? ”

When I was pregnant , a friend gave me a book called Great Lies to Tell Small Kids .
In it are gems like “ wine makes mommy charming ” and “ men do n’t go bald naturally , they like getting their hair cut that way . ”
Now , if you ’re filled with horror at the notion of pulling a toddler ’s leg like that , a new study in the Journal of Moral Education shows that parents regularly use deception to influence their kids .
We can all recall lies our parents told us to get us to do something , or to stop doing something .
“ If you cross your eyes they could stay that way ” comes to mind .
But in the current study , researchers found that these parental fibs are hardly few and far between .
And that even parents who preach to their kids about the importance of being honest admit to lying to them as well .
The researchers plan to extend their studies to see whether all this lying undermines children ’s trust .
Until then , well , keep telling junior that if he spins around really fast , then stops , his face will skid around to the back of his head .
It could keep him busy while mommy becomes even more charming .

Not only was Scientology founded by a scifi writer , but its greatest enemy - the Anonymous group - models itself after a comic book character .
Now members of the alien - loving religion are on trial in Australia for torture and baby - killing .

In New South Wales , Australia , members of the local Church of Scientology are being investigated by a Senate group for allegedly shunting unpopular members into labor camps :
NSW police are now looking into the shocking allegations , which include the use of labour camps known as the Rehabilitation Project Force , for church members who rated poorly on tests using a device known as the electropsychometer , or E- meter .
Ex-Scientologist Peta O'Brien told [ senator Nick ]
Xenophon , in a letter tabled in the Senate , that she was forced to spend five hours a day breakingrocks with crow bars to help build a road and carparking area at the church 's Dundas base , in Sydney 's west .
O'Brien alleged Scientologists in the RPF were not allowed to speak until spoken to , were banned from listening to music or driving , and were not given any medical or dental assistance .

Another ex-Scientologist says that pregnant women in Scientology were pressured to have abortions , sometimes to the pont of being locked up if they refused .
Another former member of the church says both his young daughters died under suspicious circumstances :
Paul David Schofield claims in his letter tabled in parliament his toddler daughter Lauren died while being babysat in the Sydney church , when she was " allowed to wander the stairs by herself and fell " .
Church officials not only discouraged him and his wife from seeking compensation , he alleges , but encouraged him to request that no inquest be held .
Schofield wrote that his second daughter , Kirsty , died after ingesting potassium chloride kept at his house .
" I covered up that this substance was widely used in both the Sydney church 's `purification ' programs and a similar program at the church 's drug rehab organisation , " he wrote .
" I perjured myself . . .
I did not tell the whole truth either to police or the court ( to my shame ) but omitted details which would have `embarrassed ' the church .
I knew if I did n't do this I would be heavily penalised by the church for getting it into trouble . "
Schofield wrote that most Scientologists did not trust non-believers - referred to as wogs - and thought that " wog justice just made people worse " .

The Church has responded that the children 's deaths were investigated by police at the time .
They say their freedom of religion is being threatened .
Senator Xenophon replied :
Religious freedom did not mean the Catholic or Anglican churches were not held accountable for crimes and abuses committed by their priests , nuns and officials , albeit belatedly .
In Australia there are not limits on what you can believe but there are limits on how you can behave .
It 's called the law , and no one is above it .

To me there are two types of shooters , one with human opponents and one with aliens , monsters , robots and the like .
The look and feel of these opponents often make or break the game , and the differences and preferences to one over the other can have a huge impact on whether or not I will buy the game .
To me nothing beats the human element , and here ’s why .
In a first - person shooter , the main character is often the enemies rather than the floating gun you control .
The character design , animation , artificial intelligence and sound design are all incredibly important , and if a game masters one of those elements , people will forgive shortcomings in the others — just look at F.E.A.R..
I however — being a picky and stubborn bastard — require more .
To me character design and animation rise far above the others in importance .
You see it ’s the character design and animations that allow me the most to associate with the enemies I ’m horrifically murdering .
Call me sadistic but I enjoy watching a soldier stumble down a pair of stairs after I ’ve shot his knee cap out .
Because I know — or can at the very least imagine how painful that must be — that magical bliss is something I will never gain from doing the same thing to a 3 foot pink alien from Halo .
I ’m not a doctor , and my knowledge of the human anatomy is n’t complete , but I can still associate far more easily with your standard fare foot soldier than the twisted chimera of Resistance 2 .
That ’s not to say that sound design and AI is n’t important .
Far from it .
While character design and animations contribute the most to the enjoyable presentation and immersion of the game , few things are as crucial to the gameplay quality as AI .
If an enemy is crouched up behind a piece of cover and blind firing to keep you at bay , what do you do ?
Well if the game allows it you take aim and shoot his weapon out of his hand , and while he fumbles around on the ground to pick the weapon back up — you charge up and shot the poor bastard in the back .
Or if the game does n’t allow that you fling a grenade his way and watch him run for his life while you spray him down with a shower of bullets .
Both of these events are designed to give you a feeling of satisfaction unrivalled in non-shooting games , and there only made possible by smart AI .
While good sound design gives you audio clues as to what you need to do to progress , or where the next enemy will pop out .
Sound design also plays a large part to the satisfaction and presentation associated with defeating an enemy , in the above mentioned scenario where a soldier stumbles down a pair of stairs after he ’s had his knee cap shot — that experience would be mute without sound .
It would n’t leave an impression and the impact of the action would be lost .
So while sound design might not be the most important piece of the puzzle it is still an essential one .
In third - person shooter games , this is all slightly irrelevant as the main character really is the main character , and that character is almost always human .
But here ’s a nice way to illustrate my point .
In a TPS game there is one thing almost all gamers will eventually do ; blow themselves up , just to see what it looks like .
And most of the time I end up doing it multiple times just for the heck of it…its fun .
Why is it fun ?
Because I enjoy watching my characters body “ realistically ” fly through the air and crash onto the ground in an awkward pose that undoubtedly would hurt like hell .
I challenge anyone to play GTA4 and resist the urge to do this themselves if they do n’t believe me .
But let ’s get back to the point .
To me aliens or monsters or robots or whatever just do n’t provide the same satisfaction .
They might have extra strange limbs that my imagination can’t account for , but for the most part it ’s just the fact that I do n’t know how their bodies work .
I have no idea how an alien feels when he loses a limb , or how his corpse should animate as it falls to the ground .
Using non-human opponents does open up many doors though , and gives the developers a lot of freedom with game design which is why so many choose that route .
If all the opponents in a game are aliens , then it ’s suddenly not important that one enemy takes ten hits to the “ chest ” without dying .
After all , who ’s to say that ’s where his vital organs are being kept , or that his skin is n’t dense enough to withstand your bullets .
It also lets you play around with the games weapons and gives you the advantage of having really innovative and fun ways of dispatching foes , Resistance is a good example of this .
And with aliens as enemies you can go to a wide range of exotic locales like spaces stations or foreign planets .
So clearly having non-human opponents has its advantages as well , one big economic reason for developers to go this route is the game rating .
The lower the rating a game has often directly affects sales , and having non-human characters often plays a big part in deciding the games rating .
To me however , all this still does n’t beat having human opponents and everything that follows .
With human opponents it ’s more likely that the game will feature realistic guns that are at the very least based on current technology ( Killzone ) .
It also means that the game for the most part will take place in realistic environments , where you can actually understand what the purpose of most objects are .
For example , if you see a contraption on an alien spaceship , you usually have no idea what that ’s for unless it ’s somehow part of the mission objective .
But if you see a contraption in an office complex you probably know exactly what that ’s for , and that knowledge is invaluable for adding to the immersion of the game .
And lastly , in a game with human opponents it would n’t make sense to have to shoot a guy ten times in the chest before he goes down , this makes some games easier … but the really great games have ways of compensating for that .
To me , all these things make the games more fun and immersive .
That does n’t mean that I do n’t enjoy games like Halo and Resistance , it just means that I enjoy other games more .
So in short ; nothing beats the human element .

By any standard , Ishamuddin Khan is a man of remarkable talents .
Back in 1995 , this traditional Indian magician or madari , completed the first successful outdoor performance of a trick that had been whispered about for centuries but that no one before had mastered .
When , before an amazed audience on the southern edge of Delhi , Ishamuddin managed a convincing rendition of the legendary Indian rope trick , it made headlines around the world that ought to have secured his place in the history of magic and won him lasting recognition at home .
Yet that has not happened .
Almost 15 years after he performed a trick that many experts believed to be impossible – in 1934 the Magic Circle in London offered a prize of 500 guineas to anyone who could do it – Ishamuddin is struggling , not only for recognition but simply to get by .
While he has toured Britain , Europe and Japan to display his mesmerising skills , he says that India is increasingly turning its back on traditional performers such as himself in its race to become all things modern .
To supplement his job devising magic tricks to encourage school children to learn science , he sometimes works as a conjurer at McDonald's .
" Every capital city around the world that I have been in has an area for street performers , " said the 42 - year - old , who lives in a crowded cluster of tiny homes in west Delhi known as the Kathputli – or puppeteers ' – colony : an area rich with the skills of performers , musicians and craftsmen but sorely lacking in facilities .
" But rich people in India are offended if you talk about street performing .
They are only interested in computers or software .
I am poor but I am suffering not so much from poverty as I am from the attitude of the Indian government .
I am happy in my poverty but I would like people to respect me as I am .
I would like recognition . "

For centuries , stories have been told in India and beyond about a magic trick in which an ordinary rope is made to rise upwards before a young boy climbs up and disappears into the sky .
The spellbinding story may have been partly inspired by the fairy tales of King Bhoja , who throws a thread into the sky and then ascends .
Ibn Battuta , a 14th - century Moroccan explorer and scholar , also wrote of seeing such a trick performed in China , while mention of the deed in India was made by the 17th - century Indian emperor Jahangir , whose memoirs were first translated in 1829 .
In the version of the rope - trick story most commonly told , after the young boy ascends the rope , the magician calls after the boy and , receiving no response , angrily climbs the rope himself .
After he too vanishes , pieces of severed limb fall to the floor .
The magician then climbs down the rope , places the flesh into his basket , puts on the lid and – after a moment 's pause for maximum dramatic effect – the young boy climbs out , unharmed .
Yet the evidence of the trick ever being performed was almost certainly fabricated .
In his book , The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick : How a Spectacular Hoax Became History , Dr Peter Lamont , himself a magician , reveals that stories of the trick started receiving international attention only after 1890 when a report appeared in the Chicago Tribune by a reporter who claimed to have seen the trick performed .
The story was entirely invented and , several months later , the newspaper printed a retraction .
But by then it was too late : the trick had gained a life of its own .
" There are lots of very old stories from all over the world [ about such a trick ] , " said Dr Lamont , a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh , " but we say that the modern legend came to be because of the article in the Chicago Tribune . "
Ishamuddin said that when he was a boy he heard stories about the rope trick but that no one knew how to do it .
While he learned from his father how to master favourites such as the Indian basket trick ( in which a boy disappears and then reappears in a basket ) , the mango tree ( in which a mango seed turns into a small fruit tree ) and sleight - of - hand tricks , it was clear that the rope trick was not part of the traditional repertoire .
Ishamuddin said his interest in mastering the trick was sparked in the late 1980s by one of several visits to the Kathputli colony by US academic Lee Siegel who was researching a book on Indian magic .
Mr Siegel , of the University of Honolulu , disputes that he told the young man that rewards were still available for anyone who mastered the rope trick , but either way the street magician decided to try to crack the mystery .
At that point , while some magicians had managed the trick on a stage ( with the assumed assistance of hanging wires or some other help ) no one had done it outdoors .
" I decided I would do the trick to get the money , " said Ishamuddin , who has six children .
" I spent six years to figure out how to do it .
I read the books , I spoke to the elders , and then in 1995 I did it for the first time . "

While his performance in 1995 outside Qutub Minar , a 12th - century minaret in south Delhi , may have been significant , a repeat of the trick two years later on the coast at Udupi in southern India became famous .
Video recordings of the event are posted on the internet .
Dr Lamont , who was among the 30,000 spectators that saw it , said : " Ishamuddin has a version of this trick and it's a good version .
He did more than anyone had done before .
It 's the best version and I am happy to say that I do n't know how he does it . "
Another Indian magician , Tejaswi Shankar , whose father , also a performer , organised the 1997 event , lamented that the skills of Ishamuddin and others who performed at Udupi had not been better recognised .
With events such as the Commonwealth Games to be hosted next year in Delhi , some have wondered why India has not done more to promote its traditional performers .
No rewards have ever been paid to Ishamuddin , despite him being generally recognised as the first performer of the rope trick .
" I saw him in 1997 , " said Mr Shankar , who goes by the name Shankar Junior .
" There are many other performers but Ishamuddin is the closest you can ever get to the legendary Indian rope trick . "
At his small but spotless home amid the narrow , dank alleyways , Ishamuddin took a video from a metal cupboard and pushed it into the player .
As his wife served cups of hot milky tea and a plate of raisins , Ishamuddin narrated over the performance of himself conjuring the rope from a basket and watching it rise 20ft into the air .
On the video he then helps a young boy grip the rope and the boy climbs , maybe to a height of about eight or nine feet .
The boy then climbs down and the rope , wondrously , loses its stiffness and falls to the floor .
Understandably , the magician would give no clue as to how he performed the trick , and for a repeat performance he asks for four days ' preparation time and 50,000 Indian rupees ( about £ 650 ) .
He was happy , however , to allow his magic rope – or at least one of them – to be inspected .
To the inexpert eye it offered no clues .
Ishamuddin said that , just as he did , his sons were learning the traditional tricks , while his daughters were studying in school .
His eldest son , 14 - year - old Altmash , has even accompanied him on a tour of Japan .
" I like all of the tricks .
If I can do magic I will do , but I also want to be an engineer , " said the teenager , keeping his options open .
" When I was in Japan I saw lots of engineers . "
For my next trick ...
A history of magic
* Murals on the walls of crypts in the village of Beni Hassan , outside Cairo , appear to show a conjuror bamboozling a spectator with a demonstration of balls vanishing from underneath cups .
A similar trick was described by Seneca the Younger in the first century AD .
* Another trick of equal age involves the decapitation of birds and animals , which a magician called Dedi performed before Cheops , the builder of the pyramid of Giza , around 2600 BC .
He " severed the head of a goose , duck and ox , " according to a magic website called Miracle Factory , " subsequently restoring the slaughtered beasts to their living states , none the worse for wear " .
* Other ancient tricks include the feats of escapology perfected by Harry Houdini , the Pepper 's Ghost illusion , which used mirrors and projection to conjure a ghost , mind - reading and the old favourite – a variant of the decapitation trick enjoyed by Cheops – in which a magician saws his assistant in half .
One year after California 's Proposition 8 struck down gay marriage in the largest state in the Union , Maine has become the latest battleground in the debate over the definition of marriage .
As Maine goes , so goes gay marriage
Maine could become the first state to endorse gay marriage by popular referendum Tuesday , as voters head to the polls to decide whether to repeal a recently passed law legalizing unions between people of the same gender .
One year after California 's Proposition 8 struck down gay marriage in the largest state in the Union , this sparsely populated New England state has become the latest battleground in the debate over the definition of marriage , offering supporters of same - sex marriage the chance for a political breakthrough and giving opponents an opening to thwart gay rights advances in the heart of the deep - blue Northeast .

Maine became the fifth New England state to enact gay marriage last May , when Democratic Gov. John Baldacci signed a bill passed by Democratic majorities in both chambers of the Legislature .
Voters could repeal that law by supporting Question 1 on Tuesday , making Maine the latest in a long string of states to reject gay unions when the issue is put to a popular vote .
Recent polls have shown Mainers split down the middle between the " yes " and " no " positions on the ballot measure .
A Public Policy Polling automated survey released Monday showed the initiative striking down gay marriage leading by 4 points , 51 percent to 47 percent , but two polls last week contradicted that finding by reporting opponents of the measure ahead by 4 and 11 points .
Turnout , say operatives on both sides of the issue , is the wild card in the contest .
Advocates of same - sex marriage are optimistic that ballot box history wo n't repeat itself in Maine .
Having learned the lessons of their loss in California , they say , the No on One campaign could break their seemingly endless series of defeats in popular elections .
" We walked into this fight in a much better position than we have in other parts of the country .
This is something that I think the people of Maine have had the opportunity to get used to — all of their neighboring states have had marriage equality for a while now , " said Joe Solomonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign , a gay rights advocacy group .
In California , gay - marriage supporters were surprised by the intensity of organized support for Proposition 8 and underestimated the impact of television ads warning voters that legalizing gay unions could change the way children are taught about marriage in schools .
This year , Maine - based activists focused their efforts early on making an emotional pitch with ads and speeches featuring gay families talking about what marriage means to them .
One spot featured a Lewiston grandmother with her son , his partner and their child , saying : " I 've been a Catholic all my life .
...
Marriage , to me , is a great institution that works and it's what I want for my children , too . "
" They did a very good job of humanizing the issue , " said state Sen .
Peter Mills , a Republican who voted for the marriage equality law and opposes Question One .
" They had gay couples inviting themselves into the Rotary Club and talking about what it 's like to live in a world where it 's possible to discriminate against somebody just because they 're a same - sex couple . "
Mills , who ran for governor in 2006 and is campaigning again for the position in 2010 , said the message that had worked for opponents of gay marriage on the West Coast had n't translated well to Maine .
" The only message they seemed to have was this idea of scaring you into thinking that the kids in school are going to be taught about same - sex marriage , " Mills said .
" A lot of people shrugged their shoulders and said , ' Yeah ?
What 's the big deal , now ? ' "
Supporters of the proposed gay marriage ban remain optimistic that Maine — which has a mixed record on gay rights referendums — will hand social conservatives at least a narrow victory .
And Tom McClusky , vice president for government relations at the Family Research Council , said Maine 's traditionalists had thrown themselves headlong into the fight over Question 1 .
" From everything I 've seen , they 're very fired up , " said McClusky .
" I think the mobilization of the churches is key , and I think they understand how this can affect their liberties . "
But , he said , gay marriage supporters had benefited from focusing their efforts on a small state with inexpensive media and a track record of quirky , independent politics .
The same electorate that sends the nation 's two most liberal GOP senators to Washington , and that rejected both parties to give an independent governor two terms in the 1990s , made an appealing target for advocates looking to make history .
" I think that 's why they chose it very carefully .
California , many people think it 's liberal , but it 's a very big state and you can't classify it that easily , " McClusky explained .
" But it 's very easy to turn a Legislature in New Hampshire or throw a couple of bucks the right way in Maine and get what you want . "
Marc Mutty , the chairman of Stand for Marriage Maine , a group backing the ballot initiative , said the message that had worked for anti-gay - marriage organizations in California was working in parts of Maine that remain conservative , rural or devoutly Roman Catholic .
" Our campaign has talked incessantly about how this is going to be taught in schools , or would be taught in schools , " Mutty said .
" You 'd have teachers talking about marriage being between any two individuals , " he added .
" For those that believe it is between a man and a woman , who hold those values from a very deeply held place , religious or otherwise , you 're looking at some real cultural clashes there . "
Still , Mainers of both parties say there 's a tradition of libertarian , live - and - let - live politics in the state that makes its electorate even more receptive to a socially liberal agenda than neighboring New Hampshire , which also passed a gay marriage law through the Legislature earlier this year .
" Even in the conservative areas , they do n't like the government telling them what to do and making choices for them , " said former Defense Secretary William Cohen , who served as a Republican senator from Maine and has not taken a position on Question 1 .
" Maine people in particular are very open to change , even though it 's a moderate - to - conservative state overall . "
Steve Rowe , a former state attorney general running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2010 , agreed .
" It 's about respect .
It 's about equality and it 's about fairness .
And I think those are things that Maine people understand , " Rowe said .
" My expectation is that there will be a ' no ' vote , that the law will go into effect and Maine people will move on . "
The national groups on both sides of the marriage issue will keep fighting , whatever the outcome .
Solomonese told POLITICO that legislative battles over same - sex marriage in New York and New Jersey would be his group 's next targets .
For McClusky , state legislative elections in 2010 provide an opportunity to campaign for repealing gay marriage laws in Iowa , Vermont and New Hampshire .
" A loss would be bad , but we would just have to concentrate more on the other states , " McClusky said .
From the opposite side of the fight , Solomonese echoed that sentiment : " What 's next on the docket ?
New York and New Jersey .
Win or loss is n't going to influence them one way or the other in New York and New Jersey . "
A media minder for Federal Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull has reportedly quit his job after being linked to an online bout of Liberal factional warfare .
The video parodies Liberal MP Alex Hawke by portraying him as an enraged Adolf Hitler , echoing a YouTube trend of subtitling Hitler biopic Downfall with fake translations .
Sydney Morning - Herald reporters say they have seen a chain of emails where Turnbull staffer Thomas Tudehope and Charles Perrottet , who works for Liberal MP David Clarke , admit they are connected to the video .
Mr Tudehope told the newspaper he was not involved in producing or disseminating the video .
But Mr Turnbull said today that his staffer had quit amid the controversy .
The clip , posted just over a week ago , makes reference to a factional split in the Liberal party 's right wing .
" With Dutton gone and Turnbull on the way out I was suppossed [ sic ] to become the youngest ever PM ! " one Hitler subtitle reads .
The split made headlines last month when Mr Hawke called police to attend a Young Liberals meeting , saying 40 people had tried to force their way into his office .
Mr Tudehope 's resignation comes after it was revealed this week that the 26 - year - old minder , employed in the Opposition Leader 's office as an assistant for online media , had been writing posts on Twitter for the @turnbullmalcolm account .
Today is a most glorious day , for it has been revealed that the conservative values preaching former Miss California Carrie Prejean has dropped her lawsuit against the Miss California USA organization because an graphic sex tape of her has allegedly surfaced .
Hallelujah .
From TMZ.com :
“ They showed her the X - Rated version of Home Alone , starring Carrie herself .
“ When the video started playing , Carrie ’s first reaction was ‘ that ’s disgusting ’ and Carrie denied it was her .
“ Then , the camera angle changed and panned up to her face .
She was caught red -handed , so to speak .
“ Carrie was rendered speechless and immediately began talking with her lawyer .
We ’re told it took about 15 seconds for Carrie to drop her $ 1 million demand . ”
Bwahahahahahahahahahahahaha .
It was bound to happen : Every idiot who wants to be famous knows a sex tape can help take a pseudo - celebrity ’s D - list status up a couple of notches .
Groups like the National Organization for Marriage defended Prejean when scandalous photos surfaced .
I wonder if Maggie Gallagher , president of NOM , and other conservative leaders will come to her rescue now .
Family values indeed .
Last Thursday , several of the state 's prominent pot lawyers filed a motion to void a recent Colorado Board of Health decision to strike from its rules what it means to be a marijuana caregiver -- a move that upended the burgeoning medical marijuana industry .
Starting at 8:30 a.m. , Judge Larry Naves in Courtroom Six in Denver District Court considered the motion , hearing arguments from both sides -- the applicants and the Attorney General 's Office .
We were at the hearing , filing live dispatches .
The most recent posts are at the top .
To get the complete story , read from the bottom up .
10:50 a.m. : Judge Naves has returned .
He only rules on the claimants ' first claim of relief , which is that the Board of Appeals violated a court order two years ago that agencies considering marijuana rule changes would first notify people impacted by the rule changes .
" By the evidence presented here today , I find that the defendants have violated the court order when , in November , there was a meeting without notice that complied with the law and the parties changed the rules , " says Naves .
" I find that there was no emergency .
The justification for an emergency was a Court of Appeals decision that was not even final .
And the Court of Appeals could not use the [ Board of Appeals rule in question ] ...
" It appears from the transcripts from the meeting on November 3rd [ that they ] did not understand how Court of Appeals decision even worked , even though it was suggested here that the explanation was given off the record ...
" Even though the Court of Appeals had an opportunity to say in the ruling that this new rule was in conflict with this decision , they did not do that ...
" [ I had a concern ] two years ago , and it appears that the board did the exact same thing they promised not to do .
One of the reasons they violated the rules is that they seem to forget the plaintiffs in this case .
In the transcript , there is n't any mention of the plaintiffs in the case ...
These people have , without dispute , serious problems for which they have prescriptions for medical marijuana ...
There was no mention of the impact of this change on these people ...
There is no consideration of how plaintiffs and others who need medical marijuana would obtain it ...
" So , again , I find that the board in their November 3rd meeting violated the law .
Therefore the rule change they enacted is invalid and void ....
" The defendants are enjoined from enforcing that modification until a meeting in compliance with the court order and open meeting act can be held . "
Judge Naves also awards reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiffs for enforcing the 2007 court order .
Court is in recess .
The marijuana advocates have won .
10:30 a.m. : So what 's at stake in Judge Naves ' upcoming ruling ?
The temporary stability of the state 's burgeoning medical - marijuana industry .
Last week , the Board of Health nixed from its rules a definition suggesting that anyone who provided marijuana to a patient could be considered a caregiver .
That rule , passed last July , has helped the dispensary industry flourish .
By removing it and not replacing it with a new rule , the Board of Appeals left dispensary businesses up in the air .
Several marijuana lawyers are arguing today that the Board of Appeals did not respect open meeting laws and other rules when it made the change last week .
If Naves agrees , the pivotal rule will likely put back in place , meaning the dispensaries would remain on surer footing .
For now .
10:25 a.m. :
There are three TV cameras in the courtroom .
Looks like pot will once again make the afternoon news .
10:17 a.m. : Reporters crowd around Corry during the recess .
Corry explains that Judge Naves , during the hearing so far , appeared to suggest that the Court of Appeals decision in the Clendenin case , which said caregivers should provide more for their patients than just pot , does not apply to patient - caregiver relationships statewide .
Of course , since Corry says he 'll be appealing the Clendenin decision to the Supreme Court ( the Court of Appeals ruled against his client in the case ) , there 's always a chance the Supreme Court will decide that the Clendenin decision DOES apply to many more situations .
Corry says that 's a risk he 's willing to take : " I do n't think we should hold off and wait for a perfect case .
This case is impacting someone 's life . "
10:09 a.m. : Judge Naves is taking a ten - minute recess before he rules .
10:05 a.m. : Holton concludes her arguments for the Attorney General 's Office .
Corry gets up and addresses a few of her points .
" I do n't know much , but I do know the Clendenin decision quite well , " he says -- which is why he believes he should have been allowed to address the Board of Health about it last week .
10:02 a.m. : Judge Naves states that the Court of Appeals ' Clendenin decision last month , which noted that a caregiver had to do more to provide for the well - being of a patient than just provide pot , did not apply to the Board of Health 's ruling in July that a caregiver COULD just be someone who provides marijuana , because of the timing of the ruling .
That seems to poke a huge hole in the Board of Health 's argument that they had to have an emergency meeting , without public input , to nix that caregiver definition , as they did last week .
9:55 a.m. :
The cameras are clicking as the judge hammers home the question about why the Board of Health would change rules without considering the impacts of patients on the medical - marijuana registry .
Sounds like he 'll be earning a few fans in the medical - marijuana community today .
" You took it up in July , and now you throw it out the window and say they can't get the medicine to let them live the healthiest life they can have .
Let them wait until December , " says the judge .
The Board of Health is set to consider new marijuana - caregiver rules on December 16 .
Holton notes that yesterday , the marijuana registry received more than 1,000 pieces of mail .
Even though that included the marijuana applications received over the weekend , that 's a lot of letters .
Judge Naves referenced the 2007 District Court decision that overturned the Board of Health 's attempt to limited caregivers to five patients .
He 's saying he has the same concerns today he had then -- that the Board of Health did not seek needed public input before making these rules .
9:45 a.m. : Holton is addressing the spotty transcript .
She notes the conference call was " extremely difficult . "
There were only 125 lines allowed in , which quickly filled , and board members could n't get in .
A second line was set up , but those listeners could be heard in the board room .
It was " not done adequately , " she says .
The transcript , she says , is missing a key introductory section in which officials addressed whether or not the new Court of Appeals decision was in conflict with health rules .
Now Naves wants to know why Corry , the lawyer who represented Stacey Clendenin , the woman who triggered the Court of Appeals decision , was not allowed to weigh in at the hearing .
" What 's the emergency ? "
Naves asks again .
" We all follow the Court of Appeals , but it 's not even final today .
What 's the emergency to consider something that 's not yet a law ?
" Why do they have to act in one day , and not give notice to the plaintiffs here ?
What justified having to meet without giving people impacted by the decision ability to comment ? "
9:32 a.m. : Judge Naves seems fired up .
He 's pressing Holton over why the Board of Health was so concerned over a Colorado Court of Appeals decision that did not appear to weigh in on the board 's ruling in July to allow caregivers to just provide pot and no other health services .
Why did the board overturn its new ruling right after the Court of Appeals decision , then ? , he wonders -- something he 's never heard of before .
He wants to know where , in the ( admittedly spotty ) transcript , the board discussed whether or not the Court of Appeals decision was in conflict with the Board of Health 's new rule .
He jokes that maybe he missed it last night while watching the Broncos game .
9:26 a.m. : Anne Holton , for the Attorney General 's office , now gets up .
She explains that the ruling did not require additional notice or public comment .
Several of the applicants ' claims , she says , should n't be considered today , since they are n't relevant to the case being considered .
Holton notes that the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment needs to hold a public meeting to discuss changes to medical marijuana rules when its required by the open meeting law and other acts .
But this meeting was considered an emergency because of changes to state law by the recent Court of Appeals decision .
Now Judge Naves steps in .
He references Corry 's argument that the Clendenin decision would not consider the Board of Health July rule change .
" After a valid hearing on the rules in July ... people appearing for hours and hours and hours , you came up with rule .
Then you have an emergency hearing over a ruling that would n't even consider the rule .
How is that a direct conflict ? "
9:20 a.m. : Brian Vicente , of Sensible Colorado , is now speaking for the applicants .
He notes that the lack of notice of the Board of Health hearing showed willful violation of the 2007 order that required public feedback to medical - marijuana rule changes .
Judge Naves wants to know why notifying four judges is n't enough notice .
Corry gets back up and said he could provide hundreds of marijuana patients who were n't notified .
9:15 a.m. : Judge Naves asks about the transcript of the teleconference last week .
He wants to know who recorded it and whether it was an official recording .
As Westword reported yesterday , the transcript , most of which was indiscernible , reads like Cheech and Chong go to Washington .
Corry responds , " This is what happens when the government moves hastily . "
9:10 a.m. : Corry continues .
He mentions a " straight - up open meetings act " concern .
The open meeting act has no exception whatsoever for emergency meetings , he says .
While a few additional people have arrived to watch the proceedings , everyone is subdued .
There are no hollers of " Shut up about your fucking mango , " like during the Board of Health 's teleconference hearing .
9:05 a.m. : Corry begins his argument .
He notes that prior legal negotiations agreed to allow public comment to changes in the medical - marijuana regulations .
He also argues that in the Court of Appeals ' Clendenin decision that began the controversy several weeks ago , the judge suggested his ruling was not applicable to the new Board of Health ruling this past July .
" There could not have been an emergency , " he points out , that would have required the divisive , last - minute meeting last week by the Board of Health .
He adds that under regulations , the board erred by not considering a petition Corry submitted during the hearing last week .
8:54 a.m. : The hearing begins at 8:48 a.m. Rob Corry , lead attorney for the applicants , is late -- which lets Judge Naves to start things off with some fun .
When Corry walks in , the judge announces , " ... and that 's my ruling ! "
Hee hee hee .
8:40 a.m. : The hearing has yet to begin .
There are just over a dozen members of the public here .
As Brian Vicente , one of lawyers who filed the motion , said yesterday , they did n't send out a call for a massive activist crowd like at other hearings .
Maybe this one will be quieter .
FIRST , “ Saturday Night Live ” parodies President Obama ’s “ achievements . ”
Then Mr. Obama wins the Nobel Peace Prize , bringing yet more head - scratching .
Clearly , the nation ’s attention is focused squarely on a question few presidents want to answer just nine months into their term :
What has your administration accomplished ?
I ’ll leave foreign and military affairs to the Oslo Five and concentrate on domestic economics .
The president ’s critics complain that his only real accomplishment is the $ 787 billion stimulus bill  which they deride , somewhat contradictorily , as either budget - busting , ineffective or both .
But is that all there is ?
I think not .
STOPPING THE SLIDE
Let ’s remember that the new president was dealt a dreadful hand on Inauguration Day  including a shattered financial system and a national economy teetering on the brink of disaster .
The administration ’s chief accomplishment to date surely is devising and executing  with huge assists from the Federal Reserve  a comprehensive program to pull us back from the abyss .
The stimulus was just one component .
With the unemployment rate near 10 percent , it is difficult , inappropriate and premature to stand up and cheer about the state of the economy .
But the improvement should not be belittled .
Growth of the gross domestic product in the second half of 2009 is likely to exceed 3 percent , a vastly better outlook than just six months ago , when the consensus forecast was 1 percent .
Thus Job No. 1  stopping the train wreck  appears to have been done rather well .

A licence is not required to watch catch - up TV services Businesses are being warned they could be breaking the law if staff watch live TV on their computers when the firm does not have a TV licence .
Shops , offices and other workplaces could be fined up to £ 1,000 , the TV Licensing authority says .
The law covers live transmissions online and does not apply to catch - up services such as those on the iPlayer .
If watching via mobiles and laptops that are battery operated , they will be covered by the owner 's home TV licence .
The situation changes if equipment is plugged in - as it usually is in offices .
" At that point , you need a licence , " says Ian Fannon from TV Licensing .
Advice ' confusing '
It has become an issue because there are more and more ways to watch television , he says .
" People can now watch on a PC or laptop , or even on some mobile phones and PDAs , " he says , " and it 's the responsibility of the business to make sure staff are obeying the law . "
WHEN IS A LICENCE REQUIRED ?
If you are watching : A programme as it is being broadcast ( rather than on a catch - up service )
This includes programmes being watched on computers and mobiles as well as TV
Q&A : When do I need a TV licence ?
Paul Wells , who owns two shops in Bognor Regis , has received a couple of letters from the authority warning him he could need a licence if his computer was connected to the internet .
He contacted BBC News to say he had found the rules confusing and had found it difficult to get clear information .
" We do a lot of work online for our internet business , but we do n't have time during the day to watch TV , " says Mr Wells .
That should put him in the clear , but he is still wondering if he should get a licence to be on the safe side .
He is particularly worried about customers who come into the shop with mobile phones and is no clearer after ringing the TV Licence helpline .
" I was told that if people were to enter my premises with a mobile phone , they'd be covered by their own licence at home , but the information on the website says that business premises need to have a licence if any devices are accessing live TV , " he says .
' Simple rules ' Ian Fannon told BBC News that the rules were quite simple .
" You need a licence if you are watching programmes as they are broadcast .
At a business , the same rules apply . "
He says Mr Wells ' customers will be covered by their own licences if they are using mobiles .
He only needs to worry about devices like office computers which are plugged into the mains , making them " legally installed " .
So will businesses be left alone if they insist their staff never watch television at work ?
Not necessarily , Mr Fannon says .
Employers who state they do not need a licence could be inspected without warning at any time : " We have prosecuted people for watching on a computer . "

WASHINGTON  The Wall Street giants that received a financial lifeline from Washington may have no compunction about paying big bonuses to their dealmakers and traders .
But their willingness to deliver “ thank you ” gifts to President Obama and the Democrats is another question altogether .
Mr. Obama will fly to New York on Tuesday for a lavish Democratic Party fund - raising dinner at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel for about 200 big donors .
Each donor is paying the legal maximum of $ 30,400 and is allowed to take a date .
Four of the seven “ co- chairs ” listed on the invitation work in finance , and Democratic Party organizers say they expect that about a third of the attendees will come from the industry .
But from the financial giants like Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that received federal bailout money  and whose bankers raised millions of dollars for Mr. Obama ’s election  only a half - dozen or fewer are expected to attend ( estimated total contribution : $ 91,200 ) .
Part of the reason , several Democratic fund - raisers and executives said , is a fear of getting caught in the public rage over the perception that Wall Street titans profiting from their government bailout may use their winnings to give back to Washington in return .
And the timing of the event , as the industry lobbies against proposals for tighter regulations to address the underlying causes of last year ’s meltdown on Wall Street , has only added to the worry over public appearances .

Protesters at an event in Austin , TX yesterday just took the vile rhetoric we 've seen on display this August one extra step :
" the protesters had Larry Kilgore , a “ Christian activist ” and candidate for governor who has endorsed executions for homosexuals ; Debra Medina , a Ron Paul Republican and a slightly - less long - shot candidate for governor ; and Melissa Pehle - Hill , yet another fringe candidate and a member of a self - appointed “ citizens grand jury ” investigating Barack Hussein Obama , aka Barry Soetoro . "
Kilgore captured the sentiment of the mob .
( video here ) “ I hate that flag up there , ” Kilgore said pointing to the American flag flying over the Capitol .
“ I hate the United States government . …
They ’re an evil , corrupt government .
They need to go .
Sovereignty is not good enough .
Secession is what we need ! ” “ We hate the United States ! "
Just a lone nut , I guess .
Except the Governor of Texas , Rick Perry , flirted with the secessionists a few months ago .
He did n't attend this protest , which I guess is a positive step .
But this has increasingly become the Republican base .
A group of people who feel completely justified in chanting " We hate the United States ! "
I seem to remember being told that I hated America and I was " on the other side " and " in league with the terrorists " because I did n't agree with an unnecessary , illegal and ultimately disastrous war .
I do n't have tape of myself from every day in that time , but you can trust me that I never chanted " We hate the United States " in front of a state capitol building .
Note , too , the lady who used the phrase , " the tree of freedom is occasionally watered with the blood of tyrants and patriots , " a quote from Thomas Jefferson , often misappropriated by extremists and the Patriot movement .
Timothy McVeigh was wearing a T - shirt that bore this inscription when he was arrested for murdering 168 people in Oklahoma City .
What the report reflects is a reality that law enforcement trying to deal with domestic terrorism in America must confront :
Their subjects are thoroughly American ; many of the people drawn into these movements are , if anything , " hyper- normal . "
Their version of " patriotism , " for instance , is so extreme that they actually hate not just their government but their fellow citizens -- in essence , their country : because , you see , it has been " perverted " from its original purposes .
The hyper - normality is a kind of intentional camouflage .
The Patriot movement , and militias in particular , were a very specific and intentional strategy adopted in the 1990s by the white supremacists and radical tax protesters of the American far right -- and the whole purpose of the strategy was to mainstream their belief systems and their agendas .
The tactic was to adopt the appearance of normal , " red- blooded " Americanism as a way of pushing out the idea that their radical beliefs are " normal " too .
In the process , they often adopted time - worn " patriotic " sayings and symbols , such as the " Do n't Tread On Me " flag Beck wears , as their own -- though with a much more menacing meaning .
If you 've seen that flag at an Aryan Nations compound , as I have , you never quite look at it the same .
This is why the meaning of Thomas Jefferson 's quote above is quite different for them than it is for you and me .
To all outward appearances , it is just an expression of avid patriotism .
But to a Patriot movement follower , it means something potentially deadly .
Patriots who use the symbols of American history while claiming overtly to hate America .
This would be something good to ask Dave Neiwert about on Tuesday night in LA .
Bigotry is not a natural instinct , it is taught .
Homosexuality is as natural as the sun in the sky , but ignorant , hateful people will never accept that fact .
The suspension of this high school teacher in Piasa , Illinois is a perfect example of how this hatred and ignorance infests the minds of our children :
Yesterday , Mr. Delong , a 10th and 12th grade Honors English teacher in Piasa , IL was suspended for assigning an article about homosexuality in the animal kingdom to his students .
Should teachers ask their students to read about controversial topics ?
Should we allow parents veto power over the curriculum
Mr. Delong is reportedly a married , heterosexual teacher who identifies as an ally of the GLBTQ community and clearly has the respect and admiration of his students .
This is just one of many examples of how teachers are taught to be conservative and non-controversial and why GLBTQ youth do n't feel safe in schools .
If a school district considers teaching with a scientific article written by a professor at Stanford University and published in a popular science magazine as controversial and worthy of suspension - then how can we convince other educators to stand up and teach critically ?
In order to help students learn to become critical thinkers and active citizens in a participatory democracy , it is essential to have teachers encourage students to question normative thinking and learn to critically evaluate information for themselves -- particulary with respect to sex , gender , and sexuality .
I applaud Mr. Delong for attempting to teach his students the art of critical thinking and to open their minds to facts .
There is a Facebook page supporting Mr. Delong , stop by and show your support if you like .
Warner Brothers Pictures
Someday , as the movie and television series predicts , the Terminator robots will become powerful enough to reduce the world to a pile of scrap metal and ash .
But for now , they just need new owners .
Variety reported that the Halcyon Company , which owns the rights to the “ Terminator ” movies and related assets , plans to sell the franchise at an auction in January as it goes through bankruptcy .
When Halcyon purchased the “ Terminator ” property for $ 30 million in 2007 , it became the latest in a series of owners that previously included the producer Gale Anne Hurd and the now - defunct production company Carolco .
Though the latest entry in the film series , “ Terminator : Salvation , ” grossed $ 369 million worldwide on budget of $ 200 million , Halcyon filed suit in August against a hedge fund that had provided the money to buy the series rights , saying that a backer at the fund engaged in fraudulent dealings , and filed for Chapter 11 in September .
The company ’s founders , Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek , told a bankruptcy court that the “ Terminator ” franchise was worth $ 70 million .
In a satirical blog post , Joss Whedon , the creator of “ Buffy the Vampire Slayer , ” said he would pay $ 10,000 for the series , proposing such new ideas as a “ Terminator of the Rings ” fantasy film and a “ Terminator ” musical .
On Monday , William Fitzgerald , deputy assistant secretary of state , met with Captain Camara for two hours .
He said he insisted , in strong language , that Captain Camara was responsible for the violence , despite the military strongman ’s repeated denials .
Mr. Fitzgerald said he also repeated that Captain Camara should not run in the elections , a key opposition demand .
“ The message is , what happened on Sept. 28 is totally unacceptable , from every way you look at it  the killings , the gender violence , ” Mr. Fitzgerald said in an interview at the United States Embassy here Tuesday .
“ I said , ‘ Mr. President , whether you like it or not , it ’s tied to you .
You are responsible for Sept. 28 .
The buck stops with you . ’ ”
The response from the captain was noncommittal , he said .
American pressure is limited in French - speaking West Africa , a region to which it has typically paid scant attention .
But Mr. Fitzgerald ’s meeting with Captain Camara is seen as significant by Africa experts as an example of President Obama ’s push for good governance and human rights on the continent  the focus of a speech he gave in Ghana in July that is still widely commented on .
A month later , Mrs. Clinton traveled to eastern Congo to speak out against the systematic rape of girls and young women amid the sectarian strife there .
She has made the fight against mass rape a major theme in a foreign policy that focuses on the plight of women in the developing world .
Mr. Fitzgerald ’s visit comes after a week of international expressions of disgust over the violence at the Stade du 28 Septembre here .
The stadium is named for the day in 1958 when Guineans voted against an offer of partnership from their colonial master , France , setting the stage for independence days later .
Guinea was the first country in French - speaking Africa to declare independence .
Compilation .
One of the odd things about Avvy is that only the code was compiled , not the data .
The data was a significant part of the whole , and these days I would have created it in some easy - to - edit format and compiled it .
But in those days , with a few exceptions , I first designed the binary format in which it would ship , and then wrote an editor for it .
So I think , in order to make it at all useful , one of the things I 'm going to have to write is a decompiler for all the data formats , so you can read them as XML or something .
How the images got included .
This actually extended to having to write a general image editor " hiz " for Avaricius , because I did n't have any information on the save file format of any image editors I had access to .
But for Avalot I wrote a screenshot program and my brother used Dr Genius to edit the images ( he drew almost all the images in Avalot , which is good , because the images I drew in Avaricius rather sucked ) .
Why EGA ?
The game required EGA ( and used sixteen colours ) because we did n't have VGA when coding started .
By release time we had VGA , but the only concession to it was to use its ability to redefine colours to make change " bright magenta " to be more Caucasian - flesh - coloured .
Codename .
Avalot was codenamed " Project Minstrel " during development .
Dogfood .
One of the jokes that was so laboured that I never explained it : the minstrel who plays games against you was briefly called " Winalot " , because almost all the characters ' names ended in - alot ; " Winalot " is a brand of dogfood , so he was soon renamed " Dogfood " .
Cameos .
Dogfood , Spludwick , and Baron du Lustie were cameo appearances by the development team .
Beta testing .
We had different beta testers complain that both the Dogfood and Jacques puzzles were both incredibly difficult and ridiculously easy .
Scroll drivers .
You could embed ASCII control codes in what was effectively standard output ( the " scroll drivers " ) , which would otherwise have gone into dialogue boxes on the screen , and affect lots of things about the game .
Much of the moment - to - moment control of the game happened in this way .
Wordwrap .
The scroll drivers in Avaricius did n't do wordwrap , so I had to do all the wordwrap by hand .
Big mistake , rectified in Avalot .
Bootloaders .
" avalot.exe " was merely a bootloader that allocated a few kilobytes of empty memory and ran " avalot9.exe " , which was the real program .
It pointed one of the user interrupts to the empty memory , and by manipulating this memory the child processes could instruct the bootloader either to load a given other child process after they quit , or to quit itself .
This meant that a lot of the cut scenes could be implemented in separate executables .
There was also space in the empty memory to store the current game state , so that you could seamlessly return to the game .
One of the possible subprocesses was command.com , so that you could shell out to DOS and not have Avvy resident in memory , so there was actually space enough to do something .
Edna .
The save - game format ( " edna " ) had generalised header information which meant that if you attempted to load a file from any other Avvy game , the correct game could be loaded to handle it .
Chunk .
Each room had a set of associated sub-pictures in a format called " chunk " which could be set to display at set intervals , meaning that animations could be put together without changing the code .
Also .
There was a resources format called " also " which allowed you to define things about each room such as where the doors connected to the next room and what direction you'd be walking in when you got there , and it had a set of opcodes which could be made to run a given cut scene , put up a given piece of boilerplate text , etc , when you walked into a given area or touched a line between two given points .
Strangely , I never unified these opcodes with the scroll driver control characters .
Skellern .
There was the usual routine which hooked the clock interrupt to slow the game down .
Around the time I was writing it I heard a song called Slow Down by Peter Skellern , and the whole subsystem is littered with references to that song .
In particular , the slowdown routine could n't be enabled during debugging , and therefore was disabled during development in general , so there was a standalone terminate - stay - resident utility called " skellern " which stood in for the real thing .
The onion puzzle .
This is the puzzle I 'm most proud of .
People were still asking how to solve it almost a decade later on Usenet .
Avalanche .
The whole magic opcodes system was going to be generalised in the third game " Avaroid " into an architecture for a virtual machine called " avalanche " .
I had no idea about virtual machines ; I pretty much made up the idea .
But the third game never shipped because I went to university .
Z-machine .
I 've occasionally thought of doing a Z - machine port , as a plain - text adventure .
I 've never actually started it , though .
I think it would be ineligible for the IFcomp .
My brother Andrew knows where the disks are and will find them when he comes home for Christmas vacation
My brother Mark is one of the copyright holders so we have to clear it with him as well , so there 's no knowing what 'll happen until he decides .
I am going to contact my parents tomorrow and ask for the source code of Avaricius and Avalot so that I can release them as free software .
( It was written in Turbo Pascal . )
This may mean finding a way to read 5 ½ " floppies .
I wonder if I can just buy a very cheap very old computer and hook it up with a serial cable .
Some of the nifty things about Avaricius and Avalot , just from memory : I am wondering what else I 'll discover when I finally find the source .
I just phoned my parents :
More news as we get it .
After decades of feminism , equal rights and " women - only " support networks , a lower , deeper voice is attempting to make itself heard at some of Britain 's leading universities .
Male students are " manning - up " , setting up men's groups to celebrate and explore the concept of masculinity amid accusations of sexism and gender stereotyping .
Manchester University has created the first official MENS Society – Masculinity Exploring Networking and Support – despite outrage from critics who claim the existence of such a group undermines women 's ability to speak out for equality .
Meanwhile , at Oxford University the formation of Man Collective – Oxford ( MC - O ) , launched " as a response to the current state of masculinity " has been branded " reactionary and ridiculous " .
Detractors allege they are just a front for macho activities and beer - drinking marathons , but supporters insist they are essential as young men struggle to cope with the pressures of being a man in the modern world .
Alex Linsley , 20 , founder of MC - O , said : " There is so much conflicting information for men .
There is massive confusion as to what being a man means , and how to be a good man .
Should you be the sensitive all - caring , perhaps the ' feminised ' man ?
Or should you be the hard , take no crap from anybody kind of figure ?
" Neither of those are particularly useful paradigms .
But there 's perhaps things we could learn from both perspectives " .
Men , who could feel pressured to " man-up " in a mixed gender environment , might feel less vulnerable discussing such issues in a male - only setting .
The Merton college student admits launching his organisation with the testosterone - fuelled invitation – " Have you got balls ?
Literally .
If you have how does that make you feel ? " – has drawn stinging criticism .
Given that men already dominate political and economic life , British society did n't need " much more celebration of masculinity , " claimed one critic .
Kat Wall , the Oxford University 's student union vice president for women , accused him of gender stereotyping but welcomed the debate and hoped he would work with the women 's campaign to " facilitate a discussion forum on the issue of masculinity " .
But Linsley , an economics and management student who started MC - O after being struck by the number of 18 - to 25 - year - old males committing suicide in Oxford , has also received positive feedback .
While self - improvement among women was common with magazines bursting with advice , there was little for men , was the message .
" Do you expect men to mysteriously find their own way alone ? " questioned one supporter on the Cherwell university newspaper website .
" I want to create this forum for men , so men can learn from each other and discuss these issues and make a positive step forward , " said Linsley .
In Manchester , the MENS Society , which despite its name has women among its 306 members , claims it highlights not just masculinity issues , but also raises funds and awareness for men's mental health , testicular and prostate cancer as well as male rape and domestic violence issues .
Its campaign for official ratification from the student union 's societies committee has provoked furious debate .
Originally called the Men's Society , it has now agreed to the MENS compromise .
Founder Ben Wild , 21 , a politics and modern history student , said he was " relieved that the societies committee has acknowledged the importance and promising benefits of this new society , the first of it's kind in a UK university " .
" Why have one ?
Because so little was being done on raising awareness on issues specific to men , such as male depression , which occurs because they can't live up to this very idealised traditional masculine role , " he said .
Such arguments hold little sway with opponents , however .
Olivia Bailey , NUS national women 's officer , said : " Discrimination against men on the basis of gender is so unusual as to be non-existent , so what exactly will a men's society do ? "
" To suggest that men need a specific space to be ' men ' is ludicrous , when everywhere you turn you will find male - dominated spaces , " she added .
Caitriona Rylance , chair of Manchester Communist Students , said that while the society now claimed to be about " self - betterment " it 's original aims were " Top Gear shows , gadget fairs , beer - drinking marathons and Iron Man competitions " .
Wild responded : " There has been so much false information peddled .
I 'm teetotal , and our first event was a sober pub crawl .
And we 've compromised on our beard - growing contests to make it more inclusive . "
Professor Marilyn Davidson , an expert in diversity and equality at the Manchester Business School said : " It is interesting that this is happening .
And there is an obvious need .
One of the problems men have is that they do n't have the support networks when they are under stress that women do .
" If we were talking about business and all - male clubs , they were the gatekeepers who were stopping women entering .
But I do n't think these groups are doing that .
It 's not us against them .
It 's just about supporting each other . "
Patrick Leman , from Royal Holloway University of London , said : " In some senses it is to be welcomed , because it is good that young men reflect on who they are and what they should be doing .
That sort of reflected self - awareness is not something that is particularly associated with men .
But I went to Oxford , and it could , of course , just turn into another awful drinking society . "
However , Martin Daubney , 39 , editor of the lads ' magazine Loaded , was contemptuous .
" I do n't think men are remotely confused about what it takes to be a man .
They just get on and do it .
My generation would not sit round and build a website about being confused .
It 's complete navel - gazing bullshit . "
After working as an insurance defense lawyer for many years , I established The Law Office of Michael J. Joshi in 1996 .
From my primary office in Lenexa , I serve clients throughout Kansas City , Johnson County , and the surrounding areas of Missouri and Kansas .
I began practicing law in 1989 , and have extensive experience in civil law courts throughout Kansas and Missouri .
My current practice is 100 percent devoted to plaintiff representation against employers and insurance companies of all sizes .
“ My mind is always on 20 different things , ” Mr. Lawlor said .
“ What do I need to get done ?
How much will it cost ?
Is it necessary ?
Can I do it cheaper if I do it myself ?
Can I make the earlier commute home ?
Rush , rush , rush , and then suddenly someone makes the wrong comment and I become uncorked . ”
A Different Kind of Provider
As a captain for ExpressJet in calmer times , Mr. Lawlor commuted across the country to Los Angeles , his home base , for each three - or four - day trip .
Now , as a first officer , his base is Newark , a far shorter commute from the Lawlor home in this Richmond suburb .
So he is home more .
He spends that time caring for the two youngest children , Shayne and Jackson , 16 months , while his wife takes the two oldest , Zachary , 7 , and Kelley , 10 , with her to the elementary school where she teaches and they are enrolled as students .
“ A lot of my friends say their husbands would not stay home with the kids on their days off , even to save money , ” Mrs. Lawlor said , “ but Bryan feels that if he is going to be home more that is what he should do , and he is doing it . ”
Mrs. Lawlor praises her husband ’s adeptness in the routines of child care .
But money also drives him .
Each day that Jackson and Shayne are not delivered to the home of the baby sitter is $ 50 that can be spent elsewhere .
That was n’t a priority while Mr. Lawlor was captain .
In the 14 months that he held that rank , his $ 68,000 in pay and Tracy ’s $ 40,000 as a fourth - grade teacher were enough , as Mr. Lawlor put it , for the family  for the first time  to spend freely and still save money .
He purchased a white gold 10th anniversary band for his wife and a bright yellow Harley - Davidson motorcycle for himself , imagining that he would take it for spins on his days off , the wind blowing in his hair as he raced along the sparsely populated roads in Richmond ’s semi-rural suburbs .
“ It was a present to myself when I upgraded to captain , ” he said .
The $ 10,000 Harley sat for months in the garage before it finally sold , with only 175 miles on the odometer .
Mr. Lawlor had never ridden it much .
His wife objected that he would exclude the family unless , as she pointedly put it , he could “ find some way to strap the kids on the motorcycle . ”
Now the desire to ride the eye - catching hog is gone .
If he ever makes another vanity purchase , Mr. Lawlor says , it will be something the family can use .
His mother , Patricia Lawlor , anguishes over this scaling back of his exuberance and the psychological effect of the pay cut .
Description :
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates generally to magnetic tape storage media , and more specifically to magnetic tape storage media having integral radio frequency identification ( RFID ) transponders and methods for their manufacture and use .
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Magnetic tape storage media ( i.e. , cassette tapes , video cassette tapes ( VCR ) , micro - cassette tapes , computer backup tapes , etc. ) provide high density , digital or analog storage of information and data in data storage , video , and audio applications .
Such magnetic tape storage media are often utilized in a library or rental environment ( i.e. , a public library , corporate library , video rental store , etc. ) where it is desirable to easily and efficiently track their loan or rental to patrons or customers and to maintain an accurate inventory of the number of and types of media possessed .
In such applications , the media are typically prerecorded with information ( i.e. , movies , music , computer programs , games , etc. ) which may be proprietary or which may be subject to copyright protection .
Consequently , such media , when rented or loaned , may be subject to theft or unauthorized copying or counterfeiting .
Further , in such environments , personnel must be employed to check - out media to patrons or customers , check - in media returned by patrons and customers , return the media to their storage locations ( i.e. , re-shelve the media ) , and maintain an accurate inventory of the media ( including notifying patrons or customers when media is overdue , locating missing or stolen media , etc. ) .
For these reasons , operation of media library or rental facilities is presently somewhat labor intensive and costly .
Consequently , it would be advantageous to provide magnetic tape storage media ( i.e. , cassette tapes , video cassette tapes ( VCR ) , computer backup tapes , etc. ) which utilize radio frequency identification ( RFID ) for identification and tracking functions and for providing authentication of the media for prevention of theft or counterfeiting .
It is also desirable to provide improved rental or loan systems and methods utilizing the media .
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Accordingly , the present invention is directed to a novel magnetic tape storage media .
The magnetic tape storage media includes a housing having a reel for holding a length of magnetic tape ( e.g. , a metallized polyester tape having a magnetic coating disposed thereon for storing magnetically encoded information ) and an integral radio frequency identification ( RFID ) transponder .
The RFID transponder includes a radio frequency identification integrated circuit ( RFID IC ) having memory for storing information coupled to an antenna .
The RFID transponder may be utilized by an external system to provide functions such as , automated sale , rental , or loan of the media , authentication of the media , indexing of information recorded to the media , enablement / disablement of playback of the media , recording of the number of times the media has been played , inventory management , and the like .
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention claimed .
The accompanying drawings , which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification , illustrate an embodiment of the invention and together with the general description , serve to explain the principles of the invention .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Reference will now be made in detail to the presently preferred embodiment of the invention , examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings .
Referring now to FIGS .
1 through 7 , exemplary magnetic tape storage media in accordance with the present invention are shown .
The magnetic tape information storage media 100 include a generally rectangular housing 112 having at least one reel 114 & 116 for holding a length of magnetic tape 118 .
Magnetic tape 118 utilized by such media 100 typically comprises a thin strip of polyester film having a metallized coating ( i.e. , ferric oxide or the like ) disposed thereon for storing magnetically encoded information .
An integral radio frequency identification ( RFID ) transponder 120 is preferably contained within the housing 112 of the media 100 .
The RFID transponder 120 includes a radio frequency identification integrated circuit ( RFID IC ) 122 coupled to an antenna 124 for communicating with the an external RFID system ( see FIGS. 8 through 14 ) .
As shown in FIGS .
1 through 7 , the magnetic tape information storage media 100 may , for example , be a conventional video cassette tape 126 complying with established formats or standards including , but not limited to , VHS ( Video Home System ) , S - VHS ( Super Video Home System ) , VHS -C ( Video Home System Compact ) , S - VHS - C ( Super Video Home System Compact ) , DV ( Digital Video ) , Betacam , 8 mm , or Hi8 ) .
Such video cassette tapes 126 typically include a pair of spools or reels 114 & 116 for holding the magnetic tape 118 .
The spools 114 & 116 rotatably mounted within a chamber 128 formed in the housing 112 .
Preferably , the spools 114 & 116 ( which are engaged and rotated by a drive mechanism within the video cassette recorder / player ( VCR ) , camcorder , etc. , not shown ) alternatively serve as supply and take - up spools as the magnetic tape 118 is played ( or recorded ) and rewound .
The housing 112 may further include a pivoting door 130 which allows access to the magnetic tape 118 for maintenance of the tape 118 .
Tape guides 132 & 134 and rollers 136 & 138 guide the tape 118 from the supply spool ( e.g. , spool 114 ) over the playing and / or recording heads of the VCR , camcorder , etc. ( not shown ) and onto the take - up spool ( e.g. , spool 116 ) .
Alternatively , the magnetic tape information storage media 100 may be an audio cassette tape , computer data storage tape cartridge , micro cassette tape , etc. ( not shown ) .
Like video cassette tapes 126 , such media are typically manufactured according to well established standards and formats and thus are well known to the art .
As a result , it should be appreciated that substitution of such magnetic tape storage media for the media shown and described herein ( i.e. , video cassette tapes 126 ) by one of ordinary skill in the art would not depart from the scope and spirit of the invention .
In an exemplary embodiment , the RFID transponder 120 comprises a low power radio frequency identification integrated circuit ( RFID IC ) 122 including a signal processing section and an RF processing section ( typically referred to as a front end ) interconnected to an antenna 124 .
The front end includes interface circuitry which provides the facility to direct and accommodate the interrogation field energy for powering purposes in passive transponders and triggering of the transponder response .
The front end can be any known front end design used with an antenna .
Examples of front ends are well known .
See , for example , the Hewlett Packard " Communications Components GaAs & Silicon Products Designer 's Catalog " ( i.e. , page 2 - 15 ) which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .
A typical front end is also described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/790,639 to Duan , et al. filed Jan. 29 , 1997 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .
The signal processing section may comprise control and processing circuitry and memory .
Typical memory may include , for example , read - only memory ( ROM ) , random access memory ( RAM ) , and non-volatile programmable memory for data storage .
Read only memory ( ROM ) may be used to accommodate security data and the transponder operating system instructions which , in conjunction with the processing circuitry provides functions such as response delay timing , data flow control and power supply switching .
Random access memory ( RAM ) may be used to facilitate temporary data storage during transponder interrogation and response .
Non-volatile programmable memory may be used to store transponder data so the data is retained when the transponder 120 is in a quiescent or power - saving " sleep " state .
Data buffers may be provided to temporarily hold incoming data following demodulation and outgoing data for modulation and interface with the antenna 124 .
The RFID transponder 120 may be field powered ( e.g. , passive ) .
Field powered transponders collect power from the RF field generated by the interrogator or base station and convert the collected power to a dc voltage which is stored in a capacitor to provide power for operating the transponder 's other circuitry .
Alternatively , the RFID transponder 120 may utilize a power source ( i.e. , a battery ) interconnected to the RFID IC 122 .
The RFID IC 122 may be coupled to an antenna 124 which provides a means by which the transponder 120 senses the interrogating field ( and / or , where appropriate , a programming field ) .
The antenna 124 also serves as the means of transmitting the transponder response to interrogation .
The RFID transponder 120 is preferably inserted within the housing 112 of the media 100 .
This prevents removal of the RFID transponder 120 without physically altering ( e.g. , causing damage to ) the housing 112 or magnetic tape 118 ( i.e. , opening the housing 112 , cracking or breaking the housing 112 , cutting and splicing the magnetic tape 118 , etc. ) .
Typically , such physical alteration will be observable upon inspection ( i.e. , a seal on the housing 112 will be broken , etc. ) or will render the media 100 unusable ( e.g. , unplayable ) .
Referring now to FIGS .
1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , the RFID transponder 120 may be preassembled and positioned within the housing 112 .
For example , the RFID IC 122 may be mounted to a substrate 140 and bonded to the antenna 124 .
Typical substrate materials include polyester , polyimide , ceramics , FR - 4 circuit board material , etc .
The RFID IC 122 and antenna leads 142 may be coated with an encapsulant , such as a " glob - top " epoxy , or the like and or laminated with a laminate to protect the circuit 122 ( and bonds between the antenna 124 and circuit 122 ) from damage due to environmental contaminants or handling .
Alternatively , the RFID IC 122 may be encapsulated within a conventional plastic - molded package ( not shown ) such as a single in - line package ( SIP ) , dual in - line package ( DIP ) , or flat pack .
Such packages are well known to the art and typically include a plurality of external leads or pins which interconnect the RFID IC 122 to the antenna 124 ( and other circuits or elements mounted to the substrate 140 ) .
The antenna 124 may be integrally formed on the substrate 140 .
Preferably , the antenna 124 consists of a thin pattern ( typically 18 to 35 micron thick ) formed of a conductive metal such as copper .
This pattern may be formed by plating or adhering or screening a thin layer of copper ( or other conductive metal ) onto to the substrate 140 .
The layer is then be etched to form the specific geometric configuration of the antenna 124 ( a dipole antenna is shown in FIG .
2 ; however , any antenna configuration , i.e. , dipole , folded dipole , loop , coil , spiral , meander , patch , etc. , may be formed ) .
Similarly , one or more impedance adjustment elements 144 may be integrally formed on the substrate 140 to modify the impedance of the antenna 124 .
The impedance adjustment elements 144 may be lumped circuit elements , distributed microwave circuit elements , or parasitic elements that are electromagnetically coupled to the antenna ( i.e. , not electrically connected ) .
The antenna 124 may further include a conductive ground plane ( not shown ) if required ( note the dipole antenna shown in FIG .
2 typically does not require a ground plane ) .
The conductive ground plane may comprise a layer of a conductive metal ( e.g. , copper ) formed ( i.e. , by plating , adhering or screening , etc. ) on the side of the substrate 140 opposite the pattern .
Optimum positioning of the RFID transponder 120 within the housing 112 will vary according to the type of antenna 124 used .
For example , for RFID transponders 120 having certain types of antennas 124 , such as the dipole or meander dipole antennas shown in FIGS .
1 through 4 , it may be desirable to place the RFID transponder 120 within housing 112 so that it is positioned as far away from the magnetic tape 118 and any metallic parts of the cassette 126 as possible .
This is possible in part because the RFID transponder 120 may have an extremely small form factor ( i.e. , the RFID transponder may have nominal dimensions on the order of : 0.25 mm ( thickness ) × 7 mm ( width ) ×28 mm ( length ) ) .
The antenna 124 of the RFID transponder 120 may be tuned to achieve an optimum read / write range or distance .
Alternatively , for RFID transponders 120 having antennas 124 such as patch antennas , dipole over ground plane antennas ( DOG ) , etc. , it may be desirable to position the RFID transponder 124 near the magnetic tape 118 so the tape may function as a ground plane , reflecting surface , loading element , or the like .
As shown in FIGS .
1 and 2 , the RFID transponder 130 may be fastened to an interior surface 146 of the housing 112 .
Suitable fasteners include adhesive , rivets , screws , and the like .
Alternatively , as shown in FIGS .
3 and 4 , the RFID transponder 120 may be embedded within a wall 148 of the housing 112 .
For example , a slot 150 may be formed in the rear wall of the housing 112 when the housing 112 is molded .
The preassembled RFID transponder 120 may then be inserted within the slot 150 as the cassette 126 is assembled .
Preferably , the RFID transponder 120 is sealed within the slot 150 by a suitable encapsulant , so that it may not be removed without physically altering the housing 112 .
Similarly , the RFID transponder 120 may be injection molded within housing 112 when the housing 112 is formed .
Turning now to FIGS .
5 , 6 , and 7 , the RFID transponder 120 may be at least partially formed on the magnetic tape 118 .
Preferably , the RFID transponder 120 is formed on the side of the tape 118 opposite the metallized coating ( e.g. , opposite the side of the tape 118 which contacts the playback and / or recording heads cassette player / recorder , camcorder , etc. ) so it does not interfere with playback or recording functions .
The antenna 124 ( and impedance adjustment elements 144 ) may consist of a thin pattern ( typically 18 to 35 micron thick ) formed of a conductive metal such as copper .
This pattern may be formed by plating or adhering or screening a thin layer of copper ( or other conductive metal ) onto to the tape 118 .
The layer is then etched to form the specific geometric configuration of the antenna 124 and impedance adjustment elements 144 ( a meander dipole antenna is shown in FIG .
5 while a patch antenna is shown in FIGS .
6 and 7 ; however , any antenna configuration , i.e. , dipole , folded dipole , loop , coil , spiral , meander , patch , etc. , may be formed ) .
As shown in FIGS .
5 and 6 , the RFID IC 122 may be mounted to the tape 118 utilizing a suitable adhesive and bonded to the antenna 124 .
The RFID IC 122 and antenna leads 142 may be coated with an encapsulant , such as a " glob - top " epoxy , or the like and or laminated to protect the RFID IC 122 and bonds between the RFID IC 122 and antenna 124 or impedance adjustment elements 144 ( e.g. , impedance matching circuits ) from damage due to environmental contaminants or handling .
The magnetic tape 118 may include blank sections commonly referred to as " leaders " 152 spliced to one end or both of its ends 154 ( e.g. , attaching the magnetic tape 118 to each spool 114 & 116 ) .
Typically , such leaders 152 lack the metallized layer ( e.g. , ferric oxide or the like ) formed on the remainder of the magnetic tape 118 .
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention , shown in FIG .
5 , an RFID transponder 120 may be integrally formed on each ( or alternatively only one ) leader 152 .
The leader 152 thus functions as a substrate for holding the components of the transponder 120 ( e.g. , RFID IC 122 , antenna 124 , impedance adjustment elements 140 , etc. ) .
Alternately , as shown in FIG .
6 , the RFID transponder 120 may be at least partially formed on the metallized section of the magnetic tape 118 .
In this manner , the metallized magnetic coating of the tape 118 may form the conducting ground plane of the antenna 124 ( such as the patch antenna shown in FIG .
6 ) .
As shown in FIG .
7 , the RFID IC 122 may alternatively be mounted to a spool 114 and bonded to the antenna 124 .
A small recess 156 may be formed on the surface of the spool 114 .
The RFID IC 122 is mounted within the recess 156 so that it is substantially flush with the surface of the spool 112 .
Preferably , the RFID IC 122 is bonded to the antenna 124 integrally formed on the tape 118 via a circuit 158 .
In this manner , the RFID IC 122 does not cause a bump to be formed in the magnetic tape 118 as it is wound onto the spool 114 .
Such bumps may wear or damage the tape 118 after extended use .
It should be appreciated that wherein RFID transponders 120 are formed on or near each leader 152 or end of the magnetic tape 118 , as shown in FIGS .
5 , 6 and 7 , and the magnetic tape 118 is fully wound onto one spool ( e.g. , either spool 114 or spool 116 ) , one RFID transponder 120 will be fully covered by the bulk of the magnetic tape 118 while the other RFID transponder 120 will be fully exposed within the chamber 128 ( e.g. , uncovered ) .
As a result , the RF performance of one RFID transponder 120 may be significantly degraded ( because it is covered by the magnetic tape 118 ) while the RF performance of the other will remain relatively unaffected ( because it is uncovered ) .
An external system ( see for example FIG .
9 ) may attempt to interrogate each RFID transponder 120 to determine if the tape 118 has been rewound based on the characteristics of the return signal received ( or not received ) from each transponder 120 .
For example , if a normal return signal is received from a first of the RFID transponders 120 and a degraded or no return signal is received from the other ( not shown ) , the external system will determine that the tape 118 has been rewound ( shown ) .
However , if degraded return signals are received from both RFID transponders , or a degraded return signal is received from the first transponder 120 and a normal return signal is received from the second transponder ( not shown ) , the external system will determine that the tape 118 has not been rewound .
This information may then be used by the external system to automatically cause the cassette tape to be rewound ( and possibly cause the customer to be billed for rewinding the tape 118 ) .
Turning now to FIGS .
8 , 9 and 10 , an automated system for renting or loaning media ( i.e. , videos , games , music , etc. ) in accordance with the present invention is shown .
The system 200 employs radio frequency identification ( RFID ) to improve service quality , reduce the operation cost , and increase patron or customer satisfaction in library or rental environments ( i.e. , a public library , corporate library , video rental store , etc. ) .
The system 200 also facilitates efficient tracking of loan or rental of the media 100 to patrons or customers [ hereinafter customer (s ) ] and maintenance of an accurate inventory of the number of and types of media 100 possessed .
An exemplary automated media rental facility 212 is illustrated in FIG .
8 ( and FIG. 10 ) .
Preferably , the media rental facility 212 comprises a selection area 214 and a checkout area 216 .
The selection area 214 may include a conventional display comprising a plurality of cards or slips [ hereinafter media cards ] 218 which correspond to the various media possessed by the facility 212 for rental .
The media cards 218 may be arrayed according to subject matter ( i.e. , the cards 218 may be arranged alphabetically by title , author , subject category , etc. ) .
Duplicate media cards 218 may be provided for each copy of a particular subject possessed .
Preferably , each media card 218 is imprinted with a graphic 220 advertising and / or describing the subject matter contained by the corresponding media 100 ( i.e. , movies , music , video games , computer software , etc. ) .
Each media card 218 may further be provided with a machine readable device such as an RFID transponder 222 ( or , alternatively , a bar code 224 ) which is interrogated by the system 200 to automatically retrieve the selected media 100 .
A customer may select media 100 to be rented or borrowed by removing the card or cards 218 imprinted with the graphic 220 corresponding to his or her choice from its holder in the selection area 214 and taking the card to the checkout area 216 .
The checkout area 216 may include a media card reader 226 for reading the media cards 218 selected by the customer , a display 228 for displaying information about the rental or loan transaction , a printer 230 for printing a customer receipt , a slot 232 through which the selected media 100 is supplied to the customer , and a magnetic card reader 234 for reading membership cards , debit or credit cards , etc .
After selecting one or media cards 218 from the selection area 214 , the customer must identify himself to the system 200 .
This may be accomplished by inserting a membership card ( not shown ) into the magnetic card reader 234 , or , alternatively by entering a personal identification code via a keypad or keyboard ( not shown ) .
The customer may then insert the media cards 218 he or she has selected into the media card reader 226 .
An RFID interrogator ( or alternatively a bar code reader ) 236 may interrogate the RFID transponder 222 ( or read the bar code 224 ) attached to ( or printed on ) each inserted media card 218 to identify the specific media 100 selected by the customer .
Preferably , the media cards 218 are collected within the card reader 226 to be disposed of at a later time or re-stocked when the selected media 100 is returned .
The display 228 may display information such as a listing of the media 100 ( preferably , including title , cost , return date , etc. ) selected by the customer , the customer 's account status , and the like .
Further , the display 228 may include a touch sensitive overlay 238 and / or a plurality of perimeter keys 240 so the customer may , for example , confirm his or her selections , choose a method of payment , or enter requested information by selecting messages displayed on the display 228 .
Upon completion of the rental or loan transaction , the selected media 100 is provided to the customer via slot 232 and a customer receipt is printed by the printer 230 .
An exemplary automated media return station 250 of the system 200 is illustrated in FIG .
9 ( and FIG. 10 ) .
The media return station 250 includes a receptacle 252 for receiving returned media , a display 254 for displaying information to the customer , a keypad 256 for accepting information from the customer , a magnetic card reader 258 allowing the media rental to be paid for via debit or charge card , and a printer 260 for printing receipts .
A customer may return rented or borrowed media 100 by inserting or dropping the media into the receptacle 252 .
The media 100 may be stored in a container within the media return station 250 until removed and re-shelved or , alternatively automatically re-shelved via a robotic shelving apparatus ( see FIG. 10 ) .
An interrogator 262 disposed within the receptacle 252 interrogates RFID transponders within the media 100 ( see FIGS. 1 through 7 ) to determine information such as the identification ( title , reference number , etc. ) of the media 100 , the customer to whom the media 100 was rented , the date the media 100 was to be returned , and additional charges due ( i.e. , late fees ) , whether the media 's magnetic tape has been rewound ( see discussion of FIGS .
5 , 6 and 7 , supra ) , and the like .
This information may then be displayed to the customer via the display 254 to be confirmed .
Further , the display 254 may include a touch sensitive overlay 264 and / or a plurality of perimeter keys 266 which allow the customer to , for example , confirm his or her selections , choose a method of payment , or enter requested information by selecting messages displayed on the display 254 .
The customer may also enter information via the keypad 256 .
Upon completion of the transaction , the printer 260 may print a customer receipt .
The system 200 may include robotic selecting and shelving apparatus to minimize manual operations during media selection and re-shelving operations .
An exemplary embodiment of such an apparatus 300 is illustrated in FIG .
10 .
As shown , the robotic selecting and shelving apparatus 300 may transport media selected by a customer to one or more media checkout areas 216 ( see also FIG .
8 ) , and receive and re-shelve media returned via one or more media return stations 250 ( see also FIG . 9 ) .
In an exemplary embodiment , the selecting and shelving apparatus 300 may include one or more media carriages 312 , a media transport system 314 , and a controller such as CPU 316 .
As shown in FIG .
10 , each media carriage 312 may comprise a rotatable drum having a plurality of slots 318 for holding media 100 ( i.e. , video cassette tapes , audio cassette tapes , etc. ) .
Alternatively , the media carriages 312 may comprise vertical shelves or the like .
RFID interrogators 320 are positioned adjacent to each media carriage 312 .
The RFID interrogators 320 identify media 100 stored on the media carriage 312 by interrogating RFID transponders integrated within the media 100 ( see FIGS. 1 through 7 ) .
A media retrieval / return mechanism 322 such as a robotic arm or the like may retrieve media 100 from the media carriage 312 and place the media 100 in the transport system 314 to be delivered to a checkout area 216 .
Similarly , the mechanism 322 may receive media 100 from the media return station 250 via the transport system 314 and return the media 100 to the media carriage 312 .
The controller or CPU 316 is preferably interconnected to the media checkout area 216 and media return station 250 so that it may control and integrate operation of the system 200 .
The CPU 316 may , for example , receive a request for selected media 100 entered by the customer at the checkout area 216 .
Selected media 100 is then located on the media carriages 312 via the RFID interrogators 320 and retrieved via the media retrieval / return mechanism 322 .
The media 100 is placed in the transport system 314 where it is delivered to the customer at the checkout area 216 .
Similarly , the CPU 316 may control return of media 100 to the media carriages 312 .
Preferably , the CPU 316 may store information about the media 100 such as rental status of the media 100 , date media 100 is to be returned , customer media to which media 100 is rented , charges owed by that customer , etc. to a database .
This database may provide inventory and status information for all media 100 possessed within the system 200 .
FIGS . 8 , 9 and 10 illustrate an exemplary embodiment of the system 200 configured for the rental of prerecorded video cassette tapes ( e.g. , in a video rental store ) .
It should be appreciated that modification of the system 200 for other environments ( i.e. , library , video sales , computer game rental or sales , computer software rental or sales , etc. ) or use of only parts of the system 200 by one skilled in the art is anticipated and would not depart from the scope or spirit of the invention .
For example , instead of a display as shown in FIG .
8 , one or more computer terminals may be provided ( not shown ) .
This would reduce the amount of space required by the media rental facility and would improve access to the media by customers having handicaps .
Preferably , the computer terminals would display a list of media available rental or loan .
The computer terminal could also display information and advertising for each media ( i.e. , names of artists , short clips of movies or music , etc. ) .
Rental or loan transactions would be accomplished electronically at the end of the selection process .
Similarly , customers could select media 100 using their own computer via the Internet , a network service , or the like .
Selected media could then be prepared for pickup by the customer or delivered to the customer at the customer 's home .
Referring now to FIGS .
11 , 12 , and 13 , an exemplary RFID system utilizing magnetic tape storage media in accordance with the present invention is shown .
The RFID system 400 includes a hand - held interrogator or reader 402 ( the interrogator may be part of a hand - held data terminal , portable computer , etc. ) for interrogating the RFID transponder 130 contained within the media 100 .
The interrogator 402 may , for example , communicate a request for data contained within the transponder 's memory .
Preferably , the RFID transponder 130 responds to the transmitted request by communicating the requested information .
The information may then be decoded by the interrogator 402 to provide functions desired by the user ( i.e. , video cassette tape rental and sales functions including inventory , rental checkout and return , screening for counterfeit or stolen tapes , etc. ) .
As shown in FIG .
11 , the RFID system 400 may be used in point - of - sale applications .
Inventory information stored in the memory of the RFID transponder 130 may be read by the interrogator 402 and used during sale , rental or loan transactions to a customer or patron .
The information may , for example , be used to automate the transaction and / or provided to a central computer system to update inventory information .
As shown in FIGS .
12 and 13 , the RFID system 400 may be used in a retail , rental , or library environments .
The RFID transponder 130 of each media 100 may be programmed with inventory information identifying the media 100 ( i.e. , content , serial number , inventory number , price , etc. ) .
The interrogator 402 may interrogate each tape 's transponder 130 to retrieve this information .
In this manner , the media 100 may be inventoried without being physically handled ( e.g. , removed from the shelf 404 as shown in FIG .
12 or unpacked from a shipping crate 406 as shown in FIG. 13 ) .
The inventory information may similarly be utilized to locate a particular video cassette tape from a group of tapes .
The interrogator 402 may also be capable of writing or programming information to the memory of the RFID transponder 130 .
For example , the RFID transponder 130 may be preprogrammed with a code which would disable playback of the media 100 when played by a VCR ( audio cassette player , computer tape drive , etc. ) .
The interrogator 402 may , at the time of sale , erase this code from the RFID transponder 130 so that the customer may play the media 100 after purchase or rental .
Alternatively , the interrogator 402 may write a code to the RFID transponder 130 which would allow playback of the media 100 .
In this manner , theft or counterfeiting of RFID equipped media 100 would be deterred since the stolen or copied discs could not be played .
Referring now to FIG .
14 , an RFID system 500 may be capable of automatically sorting crates or packages 502 containing magnetic tape storage media such as video cassette tapes of the present invention .
The RFID system 500 may also automatically verify the contents of each crate 502 , enable / disable the RFID transponders of each tape contained within the crate 502 , etc. , by reading information from ( and / or writing or programming information to ) the RFID transponder of the tapes contained within the crate 502 .
The RFID system 500 includes a controller or base station 504 comprising an RF transceiver 506 coupled to one or more RF antennas 508 .
The base station 504 may interrogate RFID transponders embedded within labels 510 adhered to the crates 502 as they are carried along the system 's primary conveyor mechanism 512 past the antennas 508 .
Memory contained by such RFID transponders may be programmed with destination and routing information for the crate 510 to which it is attached .
The base station 504 may process this information so that the crate 510 may be automatically sorted and routed to the appropriate destination .
This may be accomplished , in an exemplary embodiment , by temporarily closing a gate 514 across the primary conveyor mechanism 512 .
The gate 514 causes the crate 502 to be diverted onto a secondary conveyor mechanism 516 corresponding to the destination and routing information contained within the RFID transponder of the label 510 .
Similarly , the base station 504 may also interrogate and / or program the RFID transponders of each tape contained within the crate 502 ( see FIG. 13 ) .
The tapes ' RFID transponders may , for example , be programmed with information identifying the tape ( i.e. , title , author , content , serial number , inventory number , price , etc. ) .
The base station 504 may interrogate each tape 's transponder to retrieve this information without physically handling the tape ( e.g. , removing it from the shipping crate 502 ) .
The base station 504 may then use the information to verify whether each crate contains the proper number and type of tapes .
The base station 504 may also be capable of writing or programming information to the memory of the RFID transponder of each tape within the crate 502 .
For example , the base station 504 may program the transponder with inventory information for use by customers ( i.e. , serial number , title , index information , etc. ) .
Similarly , the base station 504 could program the transponder with a code , password , etc. which would enable playback of the tape when played by an RFID equipped VCR or audio cassette player .
Stolen or counterfeited tapes would lack this coded information and thus could not be played .
It is believed that the present invention and many of its attendant advantages will be understood by the foregoing description , and it will be apparent that various changes may be made in the form , construction and arrangement of the components thereof without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention or without sacrificing all of its material advantages .
The form herein before described being merely an explanatory embodiment thereof , it is the intention of the following claims to encompass and include such changes .
White House senior economic adviser Lawrence Summers says ' Time has come ' for deep change for banks .
" Financial institutions that have benefited from government support can , should and must use this moment to think about what they can do for their country -- by accepting the necessary regulation to protect the American people , " Summers said in remarks prepared for delivery at the Economist 's Buttonwood Gathering in New York .
" There is no financial institution that exists today that is not the direct or indirect beneficiary of trillions of dollars of taxpayer support for the financial system . "
In calling for financial - services companies to accept new regulations , Summers said bank executives and other financial - industry managers should consider the recent financial crisis within the context of a broader set of crises that have occurred in recent years , including the Latin American debt crisis , the 1987 stock - market crash , the savings - and - loan debacle , the Mexican financial crisis , the Asian financial crisis , the collapse of Long Term Capital Management and the bursting of the dot - com bubble .
" [ We have ] one crisis every three years , " Summers said .
" Surely a system that produces this many accidents and accidents this severe is a system that is in very much need of reform . "
98 % Exempt From Oversight
Bowing to political pressure from community bankers , the House Financial Services Committee approved an exemption on Thursday for more than 98 percent of the nation ’s banks from oversight by a new agency created to protect consumers from abusive or deceptive credit cards , mortgages and other loans .
The carve - out in legislation overhauling the regulatory system would prevent the new consumer financial protection agency from conducting annual examinations of the lending practices at more than 8,000 of the nation ’s 8,200 banks , leaving only the largest banks and other lenders subject to the agency ’s examiners .
Earlier in the day , the committee completed its work on a different contentious provision of the legislation when , on a nearly straight party - line vote of 43 to 26 , it approved tougher regulations over the derivatives market .
That provision , too , contained exemptions for many businesses .
Under the Miller - Moore amendment , the new agency would have the authority to write rules for all banks and other lenders , including lenders that have never faced significant regulation .
But the banks with assets of less than $ 10 billion and credit unions smaller than $ 1.5 billion would not face regular exams by the agency .
While the administration quickly embraced the derivatives legislation , a top regulator appointed by President Obama indicated that compromises made to win the support of moderate Democrats led to problematic loopholes .
The regulator , Gary G. Gensler , chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , vowed to try to strengthen the measure when it is considered by a second House committee next week .
Robert G. Pickel , the chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association , a trade group , said the legislation would “ force people to trade a certain way , which ultimately means parties would have less flexibility to effectively manage their risks . ”
But Ed Mierzwinski , consumer program director at the United States Public Interest Research Group , said the legislation had “ broad exceptions that swallow any rule it creates . ”

Sweating is your body ’s mechanism to cool down .
Sweat has no odor ; the familiar unpleasant odor is caused by bacteria that live on our skin .
These bacteria metabolize the proteins and fatty acids from our sweat , causing body odor .
Deodorants deal with the smell by neutralizing it and by killing the bacteria that metabolize the proteins and fatty acids .
Antiperspirants on the other hand , try to prevent sweating by blocking the pores using aluminum .
Without sweat , the bacteria cannot metabolize proteins and fatty acids that cause body odor .
The Semantics of Deodorants and Antiperspirants
Antiperspirants are products that try to prevent sweating by using aluminum .
However , most antiperspirants also have a deodorizing component .
It might be for this reason that ‘ deodorant ’ and ‘ antiperspirant ’ are used interchangeably .
For clarity , this article will consider deodorants to be products that mask , suppress or neutralize odors .
There are deodorants available that do not have the harmful ingredients , but only have safe natural ingredients .
These deodorants will be referred to as ‘ natural deodorants ’
Antiperspirants – The Over - The - Counter Drug
It might be a surprise to learn that the antiperspirant you use daily is in fact an over - the - counter ( OTC ) drug .
As mentioned , antiperspirants work by clogging , closing , or blocking the pores with aluminum salts in order to prevent the release of sweat .
Antiperspirants are considered to be drugs because they affect the physiology of the body .
Because antiperspirants are drugs , they are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
Consequently , every antiperspirant sold in the US has a Drug Identification Number ( DIN ) , which you can find on the label .
Deodorants and Antiperspirants are Considered to be Safe
Both antiperspirants and deodorants are considered to be safe by the FDA , the American Cancer Society , the National Cancer Institute and the Mayo Clinic .
However , FDA regulation does not mean that a drug is without danger .
Like prescription drugs , the FDA oversees OTC drugs to ensure that they are properly labeled and that their benefits outweigh their risks .
Often , the FDA does not consider the evidence of danger to consumer ’s health strong enough to take action .
Aluminum chloride , aluminum chlorohydrate , and aluminum - zirconium compounds , most notably aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex gly , are the most widely used in antiperspirants .
Most of these materials are supplied as powders , and they are typically used at levels of 8 - 25 % based on the weight of the finished product .
We are continually exposed to aluminum due to its many uses .
It is often used in cooking utensils , containers , appliances , and building materials .
It is also used in paints and fireworks ; to produce glass , rubber , and ceramics ; and in consumer products such as antacids , astringents , buffered aspirin , food additives , and antiperspirants .
Another use for aluminum is in water purification , and it can therefore occur in your drinking water .
Humans absorb aluminum through the skin : a 2001 study showed that aluminum was still present in blood samples 15 days after one application of aluminum to the armpit .
Consequently , applying aluminum to the skin is a very effective way to get aluminum in your system , and in your brain .
Aluminum was first recognized as a human neurotoxin in 1886 , before being used as an antiperspirant .
A neurotoxin is a substance that causes damage to nerves or nerve tissue .
Aluminum as a Neurotoxin : linked to Alzheimer and other neurological diseases
Post - mortem analysis of Alzheimer ’s infected brains has shown increased levels of aluminum compared to people that did not die from Alzheimer’s .
It has been well established that the accumulation of aluminum in the brain can cause neurological disorders .
To prevent aluminum accumulation , reduced use of aluminum is of crucial importance .
Awareness of aluminum is the primary factor in preventing aluminum induced toxicity .
The short term symptoms of aluminum toxicity include memory loss , learning difficulty , loss of coordination , disorientation , mental confusion , colic , heartburn , flatulence , and headaches .
Alzheimer ’s is one of the possible long term effects of chronic aluminum exposure .
Studies have found that aluminum absorbs better through the skin than orally .
When using antiperspirants , one only applies very little aluminum to the skin .
However , daily use results in chronic exposure to aluminum .
One study has asserted that the use of aluminum based antiperspirants increases the risk of Alzheimer ’s disease by 60 % .
Aluminum in Antiperspirants linked to Breast Cancer
The data from one study indicate that the degree of antiperspirant / deodorant usage and axillary shaving is associated with an earlier age of breast cancer diagnosis .
The series of events that eventually cause breast cancer can start many years before the symptoms become noticeable .
Studies indicate that the chance of developing breast cancer increases when women are exposed to cancer causing agents at a young age .
Consequently , young girls that use antiperspirants / deodorants are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life .
The Role of Antiperspirants in Causing Cancer
Two steps are needed to cause cancer :
DNA has to be damaged , resulting in damaged cells and
Growth promotion of these damaged cells .
There are several ways that DNA could be damaged as a result of using antiperspirants .
According to one theory , it is caused by accumulating sweat through the use of antiperspirants .
Your body normally exposes of waste products through sweat , the accumulation of these toxic waste products in the armpit can cause damage to the adjacent breast cells .
Another mechanism that can help cause DNA damage is through the aluminum and zirconium salts .
It has been shown that aluminum can bind to DNA and change it , resulting in damaged breast cells .
The majority of breast cancers occur in the part of the breast that is the closest to the armpit called the upper outer quadrant ( UOQ ) , where we apply antiperspirants and deodorants
The proportion of breast cancer in the UOQ has been rising steadily with the increased use of antiperspirants and deodorants .
In 1926 , 31 % of breast cancers occurred in the UOQ , in 1947 - 1967 this percentage increased to 43 - 48 % .
Currently the majority of breast cancers occurs in the part of the breast that is the closest to the armpit : 60.7 % in 1994 .
Furthermore , the majority of UOQ breast cancer cases concern the left breast .
One theory is that this is due to the vast majority of right handed people applying more antiperspirant to their left armpit .

Using libraries is easy but getting all the right ones onto your system can be a pain .
Many languages solve the problem with repositories that host the libraries + metadata and tools that make it easy to pull the right versions of the libraries .
In the Ruby space the solution is Ruby Gems , both a tool and packaging format ; a default repository hosted at Rubyforge ( Gems hosting will soon move to the GemCutter system , which offers more flexibility ) makes it єasy to publish and consume Gems .
In the Java space , Maven is a popular solution .
Clojars is a new repository that aims to make it easy to share and consume Clojure libraries .
A Clojure specific build tool called Leiningen , created by Phil Hagelberg , makes it easy for producers to bundle and push Clojure libraries to Clojars , and for consumers to pull them and make sure they 're in the right default place for Clojure programs .
InfoQ talked to Alex Osborne , creator of Clojars , about the motivation behind Clojars , the implementation and tooling .
InfoQ : How does Clojars use Maven ?
If I install something from Clojars , what do I get ?
A Maven install of the library ?
Something else ?
Clojars itself is just a repository , so all it really uses Maven for is putting jars and metadata in the structure that most build tools expect .
What " installing " something means depends entirely on your build tool .
If you use Leiningen or Maven you 'll get an install to your local Maven repository .
Leingingen just treats the local Maven repository basically as a cache and copies all the dependencies to a " lib " directory under your project where other tools like swank - clojure can find them .
It also means you can just set your classpath without any tools or magic , you can just do :
java - cp ' src:classes:lib/*' myproject.main
I quite like the way Ruby 's gems can install executables that you can use from the command - line ( common examples being " rails " and " rake " ) .
I think we should adopt something like this as well , but I do n't have any concrete plans yet .
For now though Leiningen plugins cover the basic use - cases for this .
InfoQ : If I want to push a lib to Clojars , what metadata do I have to create and what 's the best way to do that ?
Clojars just expects a minimal Maven - style pom.xml file .
At the bare minimum you will at least need to specify an artifact Id , group Id , version and dependencies .
It 's also preferred to fill in some of the metadata fields such as description , url and license so that the Clojars site will be able to index and search on them , but I 'm not going to enforce this .
At the moment the search functionality is really basic but I hope to improve it and add a search command to Leiningen so you do n't even have to leave your terminal .
The POM syntax is very tedious to type and usually full of XML namespace and schema goop , so unless you 're using some IDE plugin that generates it for you I suggest using Leiningen 's format , which looks like this :
( defproject myproject " 0.1.0 " : description " An example project . " : dependencies [ [org.clojure/clojure " 1.1.0- alpha-SNAPSHOT
" ] [org.clojure/clojure-contrib " 1.0 - SNAPSHOT " ] [ compojure " 0.3. 1 " ] ] )
You can ask Leiningen to export a POM with :
lein pom
Then push it to Clojars with :
scp pom.xml myproject-0.1.0.jar clojars@clojars.org :
The lein - clojars plugin simplifies these two commands to just " lein push " , but as you can see there 's actually not all that much to simplify . ;-)
I 've actually occasionally found myself using " lein pom " to create a template POM for Java projects .
You 're supposed to use Maven 's archetypes for this but I can never remember the huge long command you have to type in order to use them .
InfoQ :
What do you say to people who wake up screaming from nightmares about Maven ?
* laughs *
You 're not the only ones !
But building simple projects should be simple and I hope Clojars and Leiningen go some way to helping you sleep better .
InfoQ :
You 're using a Clojure web framework , Compojure , to build the web frontend for Clojars ; what 's is your experience with Compojure ?
I 'm used to using Sinatra and Haml with Ruby so Compojure was a natural fit .
So far it 's worked fine for me .
I 'm a big fan of minimalist tools that do * just enough * to make common things easy without becoming complex and difficult to troubleshoot .
InfoQ : Where 's Clojars hosted and where do the repositories live ?
At the moment it 's all on a teeny - tiny Linode.com VPS and the repository just lives as flat files on disk ( they 're just statically served with lighttpd ) .
The web part runs in Jetty and uses an SQLite database for the metadata , search and such .
For pushing , I actually just use Nailgun to connect incoming SSH connections to the running app .
I implemented an scp server in Clojure ( it 's a really trivial protocol ) which checks that the uploaded POM and jar look okay and if they do has Maven deploy them to the repository .
If the repository grows substantially in size I 'll probably move the actual jar files to Amazon S3 but I do n't expect to need anything beefier for the website and metadata .
InfoQ : You mention Clojars is supposed to look like Gemcutter ; how do you approach things like reserving library names , forking , etc ?
Is it just first come , first serve ?
That 's a tricky question and I 've gone back and forth on it a couple of times and I do n't think there 's a perfect answer .
Fortunately unlike gems , POMs already have a namespacing mechanism ( the group Id ) so we have a few more options open here .
I find that with Maven , most of the time groupIds just get in the way .
I just want to use the official version of " compojure " --
I do n't want to have to think about who wrote it or where it 's hosted .
You often see Maven libraries where up until version 0.3 they might have been hosted on GitHub , so the older versions have a group Id like " com.github.weavejester.compojure " but then they got their own domain so suddenly it changes to " org.compojure " .
Then you pick the wrong one by mistake and 2 months later realise you 've written your project against some ancient version of the library and that explains why the documentation does n't seem to match .
Surely I 'm not the only one who does this all the time ?
There 's been a sort of de facto standard for the canonical version of a library where the group Id is set to the same value as the artifact Id .
Phil Hagelberg decided to adopt this for Leiningen , so when you just say " compojure " it 's a shorthand " compojure / compojure " and I 'm doing the same for Clojars .
I know the Maven guys frown on this but I think they 're being a bit idealistic .
I think CPAN , PyPI and RubyGems have shown us that in practice it's not such a big deal , especially when you have a central repository of some sort .
Sure there 's the occasional problem , but namespacing everything with domains just makes things complex all the time for * library users * , instead of it just being a problem for the * library author * and only when there 's actually a name collision .
But on the other hand maybe sometimes I need to tweak it a bit .
Maybe the official version of Compojure depends on Jetty and I want to change it to work with Server X , but upstream do n't agree and reject my patches .
Or perhaps I want to use a library that someone else has written , but they have n't put it in Clojars or Maven Central and I do n't want to squat on their name .
For these sorts of situations it 's really useful to have some sort of namespacing mechanism .
So for this kind of usage I 'm recommending pushing your jar with a group Id of the form " org.clojars.username " .
I toyed with the idea of making it just username / project instead of org.clojars.username/ project , but I think the ugliness of including the full domain is actually a benefit here .
It shows that this is clearly not the official version and encourages using the short form for official releases .
Currently the first time you push a jar with a particular group
Id you become the sole owner of it and nobody else can push to it .
You can add additional members to a group through the website .
So yes first come , first serve .
The Clojure community is pretty friendly and mature so I do n't expect there to be many problems , but if a dispute does arise and nobody is clearly in the right I 'll probably step in and just mark the canonical group name reserved until they sort it out .
I think dealing with problems when they occur is better than having some sort of central approvals process which just wastes everyones time and causes submitters and approvers to get antsy with each other .
InfoQ : What tools do you need to interact with Clojars ?
I really like what Phil 's doing with Leiningen .
It 's got that same sort of feeling I mentioned before about Compojure and Sinatra , it does " just enough " and does n't get in your way .
But it also just uses Maven - style repositories so you do n't have to go and repackage all the Java libraries you want to use in your Clojure programs .
So I 'll be recommending Leiningen , but really you 'll be able to use Clojars with any dependency tool that can download from a Maven repository and most of the Java ones can .
For pushing you do n't actually need Leiningen or Maven or anything other than scp , which is installed on virtually every unix system and many Windows developers likely have it installed alongside PuTTY or MSys Git or Cygwin .
So if you really want to just manage your dependencies manually and build and push your library with a shell script by all means go ahead .
The waste product of my document scanning project is a slag heap of extracted staples :
The other day I made a discovery :
If you grab one of the discarded staples and lift it , the whole ball of tangled , mangled metal comes along , leaving behind only a few stragglers in the bottom of the bowl .
When I noticed this , my first thought was “ Hmm , that ’s funny . ”
My second thought was “ Oh , of course : Erdős - Rényi . ”
And my third thought–well , I ’m still working on my third thought , as well as thoughts four , five and six .
Erdős and Rényi are Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi , who wrote a big paper on “ The Evolution of Random Graphs ” 50 years ago ( Publications of the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences , 1960 , 5:17–61 ) .
Their paper was n’t quite the debut appearance of random graphs in the mathematical literature , but it ’s usually cited as the theory ’s point of origin .
In one version of the Erdős - Rényi process , you start with a set of n isolated vertices and then add random edges one at a time ; specifically , at each stage you choose two vertices at random from among all pairs that are not already connected , then you draw an edge between them .
It turns out there ’s a dramatic change in the nature of the graph when the number of edges reaches n/ 2 .
Below this threshold , the graph consists of many small , isolated components ; above n/2 , the fragments coalesce into one giant component that includes almost all the vertices .
“ The Birth of the Giant Component ” was later described in greater detail in an even bigger paper–it filled an entire issue of Random Structures and Algorithms ( 1993 , 4:233–358 ) –by Svante Janson , Donald E. Knuth , Tomasz Luczak and Boris Pittel .
What made me think of a connection between Erdős - Rényi graphs and my hairball of staples ?
What I had in mind was something like this :
The long , straight , middle part of a staple corresponds to an edge of a graph , and the bent end pieces , which can grab on to each other , are the vertices .
Thus a single staple is a graph consisting of two vertices connected by one edge .
When two staples hook up , two of their vertices merge and we ’re left with a connected graph of three vertices and two edges .
Since each staple contributes one edge and at most two vertices to the graph , the number of edges must be at least half the number of vertices .
Thus the graph is always over the threshold for forming a giant component , according to Erdős and Rényi .
The counting part of this analysis seems okay , but I ’m afraid the rest of it does n’t hold up very well .
Whatever is going on in the staple ball , the evolution of the system is not well modeled by the Erdős - Rényi process of adding edges to a fixed set of vertices .
Instead , each staple brings both an edge and two vertices .
The crucial event that makes the cluster hang together is the merging of vertices when staples link hands ; this merging has no counterpart in the Erdős - Rényi process .
The underlying problem here is that Erdős - Rényi graphs are purely topological –there ’s no concept of distance , and any two vertices are equally likely to have an edge joining them .
But the staple graph has important geometric constraints .
Two vertices can be joined by an edge only if the distance between them is approximately equal to the length of a staple .
The geometric structure suggests trying a different kind of model–perhaps the kind that describes the molecular structure of liquids and solids .
Water molecules , for example , are linked together by a network of hydrogen bonds ; each hydrogen atom in one molecule can bond to the oxygen atom in another molecule .
But the bonds cannot extend over arbitrary distances ; they reach only between neighboring molecules .
In the resulting three - dimensional structure the basic motif is a tetrahedron with an oxygen atom at its center and hydrogen atoms at the four corners .
( There ’s also a schematic two - dimensional model known as square ice . )
We might imagine something similar going on with the staples , where the two bent ends can form hydrogen - bond - like links to other nearby staples .
But there ’s a problem with such chemical models as well .
Atoms have a fixed valence ( more or less–let ’s not quibble ) ; in water , for example , each hydrogen atom can form a hydrogen bond with only one oxygen atom .
But we have no reason to suppose that the hooked ends of a staple can attach to only one other staple .
As a matter of fact , if such a restriction were enforced , then the staples could form only chains and rings , not dense clusters .
In a close look at the actual clusters , it ’s easy to find places where three or more staples are all hooked together at the same point .
By carefully teasing apart the cluster , I have spotted vertices that appear to have a degree of at least six .
Yet another physical process that might provide a model for the staple graph is diffusion - limited aggregation .
This is the mechanism responsible for the filigree pattern in the banner at the top of the bit - player web page .
It is generated by sticky particles that drift at random until they wander onto the substrate or touch another particle that is already in contact ( directly or indirectly ) with the substrate .
For staples , I suppose the drifters would be tumbling dumbbells with sticky ends–somewhat harder to simulate .
Another factor to keep in mind is that spatial dimensions are surely important here .
For one thing , there ’s just more room to maneuver in three dimensions , with more opportunities to glom onto a neighbor .
But in the specific case of staples , there ’s another reason : Confined to a plane , they have a hard time linking up :
Dispersed on a flat plate , they refuse to coagulate even when swirled vigorously .
The reason , presumably , is that secure links form only when the staples can turn 90 degrees and interlock .
In this connection it would seem significant that these are used staples , somewhat varied in shape , with hooked ends that had been bent approximately 180 degrees in the process of stapling and that mostly retained an angle greater than 90 degrees after being pried out the papers .
I wondered how shiny new staples would behave , and so I tried the experiment .
( Materials and methods : 630 Stanley Bostitch chisel - point staples , model SBS191 / 4CP , freshly dispensed from an open - jaw Swingline stapler . )
I was mildly surprised at the result .
Although the aggregation was somewhat looser and more delicate , it really was n’t that much different .
Again we witness the birth of a giant component .
“ That was the happiest day of my life , ” said the young Palestinian , “ I was freed that day . ”
“ Come on , ” I laughed as we walked down the dusty Gazan street , the Mediterranean sun beating down hard on our faces , “ it could n’t have been that bad .
I mean , we all dislike school to some degree , but it has its nice things too . ”
His grave eyes looked wholly unconvinced , “ the day I graduated from university was the best day of my life , ” he firmly repeated .
And then he added , more to himself than to me , “ I wish I could erase all my memories of my time in school . ”
*****
By 1991 the first Intifada ( Palestinian Uprising ) was coming to an end .
The streets of Gaza slowly emptied of the Israeli soldiers and tanks .
The bodies of martyred Palestinians were less often carried to neighborhood graveyards .
And in Beit Hanoun , a northern town of Gaza , six - year - old Ahmad began his first day of school .
He enjoyed school .
He worked hard and was always the first in his year .
Life , one could say , was becoming rather normal in Gaza .
And upon finishing middle school in 2000 , as a reward for his scholastic achievement , Ahmad received the gift of a lifetime .
He , along with 19 other students from Gaza , was selected by the Ministry of Education to join a Seeds of Peace summer camp in the US .
He had a wonderful time in America .
What an adventure for the 14 - year - old boy !
He improved his English .
He made new friends .
He experienced a whole knew world in that beautiful state of Maine .
A world that told him life was open and free and full of opportunity .
So he returned to Gaza , after this month - long excursion , full of hope .
But Ahmad was branded a Palestinian at birth .
He would now learn to pay that price .
The second Intifada irrupted only two months after he returned home from America , at the start of his first year of high school .
“ The week before the Intifada started we were in Jerusalem , in Al - Aqsa Mosque .
We were praying , ” he said , recalling how close he was to being caught amid the initial Jerusalem massacre .
The Israeli onslaught quickly spread throughout all the West Bank and Gaza , leaving no Palestinian in peace .
“ There was no space , ” he told me , trying to explain how the Israeli offensive effected every aspect of personal life for the Palestinian individual .
Student life was only one such casualty .
It became dangerous to go to school .
It became impossible to have a normal education .
In his three years of high school , Ahmad ‘s school was shelled by Israeli tanks six times , twice while students were inside .
“ Each day we would have demonstrations against the attacks in Gaza and the West Bank because we had so many martyrs …
No school .
Just demonstrations …
You had to go and demonstrate against the horrible attacks against these children and kids everywhere . ”
Still , despite all the madness , or perhaps in spite of it all , the students clung as much as they could to their vocation .
They would loyally go to school , as much as circumstance allowed .
But even this effort was frequently quashed .
Too often the students would trek to school only to find it closed .
They would ask the reasons for the closures .
The answers became the soul - grating refrain of their lives .
Why ?
Because Israeli tanks are getting close to the school and there is no school today .
Why ?
Because people in our city have been martyred and there are demonstrations so there will be no school today .
Why ?
Because the tanks have closed off Beit Hanoun and the teachers cannot come from outside .
So we ’ll have no school today .
It was in this environment that Ahmad and his classmates ( the ones that were not killed ) came to their 3rd and final year of high school in 2003 .
Called Tawjihi , the entire future educational and career life of the student hinges on these end - of - the - year cumulative exams .
“ Tawjihi , ” Ahmad aptly described , “ is like a stage between life . ”
Tawjihi year began normal enough .
Normal in the Palestinian sense of the word .
Normal attacks .
Normal shootings .
Normal curfews .
But the last two months before the exams began the Israeli army laid siege on Beit Hanoun .
No one could enter .
No one could leave .
Everyday there were attacks and explosions .
Everyday there were injuries and martyrs .
“ We did n’t study , actually , ” said Ahmad , “ nothing .
You cannot study and people are dying , ” he explained , as if that needed explaining to me , a girl who had never once even seen a dead body .
And all the while their exams were approaching .
The first day of examination was the 9th of June 2003 .
And the Israeli army was still in Beit Hanoun .
“ What do we do ? ” said Ahmad , “ we need to take our exams .
So we decided to go to school even though the Israeli tanks were at the doors outside the school . ”
So they went .
Despite the fact that they had n’t prepared at all due to the siege and the killings .
Examinations went on for a month .
Everyday the students went .
And everyday the Israeli tanks were at the doors of the school .
It was the worst month , Ahmad told me .
All your time in high school you wait to prepare and do well on these final examinations , only , in the last moments , to be prevented from studying because your city is under attack .
The soldiers left after 67 days of siege .
And then their exam results came in .
“ I passed , ” said Ahmad , “ my average was 83.5 .
So very good . ”
So that was his high school story .
I asked how he felt during those years , as I was unable to comprehend how one could live through such a horror and move on .
“ It ’s mixed feelings , ” he said .
“ Sometimes you do n’t know what you are doing or what ’s going on around you .
Sometimes it ’s fear because you are afraid to lose more friends and more people .
And because you are afraid about your family .
And you are afraid about your future .
“ You do n’t know what is going on .
You just go and study for a life you ’ve been dreaming about .
But then you find you ca n’t have it because of obstacles put up by enemies .
And these are horrible obstacles .
They ’re not just any kind of obstacles that anyone could pass .
“ It ’s war everywhere .
And people are dying everywhere .
And you just do n’t know .
Maybe it ’s your turn .
I mean , we believe in God , and we know everyone is going to die .
But when it goes on so continuously , everyday there is attacks , you just keep worrying about it .
So the feeling was , what should I be doing ?
Should I go fight and resist ?
Should I go study as a way to resist , as a better way of resistance ?
Should I just stay afraid , doing nothing , with my family ? ”
“ I started to believe that maybe the power of this education that I will have in the future will be more than the power of a stone against a tank .
I asked myself a million times , if I should do the same [ and take up throwing stones at the Israeli tanks like some of the Palestinian youth ] .
Even if it was a little thing .
“ Some people say it ’s stupid , a stone against a tank .
But it ’s their will and determination [ that counts ] .
It comes from deep inside .
That you are not afraid from anything , whatever it may be .
You just want to fight , resist , for your rights .
Even if it takes your life , takes everything : [ None of that matters because ] I believe that its my right and I have to do it . ”
That is one way to resist .
But Ahmad decided to resist through his education .
“ I had to take care of my family .
Reach what my parents wanted of me .
They wanted us to be educated , get a good life , good jobs , have a good place in the community .
They wanted us to help them and help people .
So that was the final , or not the final , but a decision that I made .
“ You are feeling many things , but you have to go on , to keep going .
The only way is to just keep fighting , through your education , and your dreams , and your beliefs .
That was the feeling .
“ But I never felt like I have to give up .
I did n’t find a way that told me ‘ you just need to give up now . ’
And every time a bad thing happened , or a disaster happened , it gave me more power to continue .
“ Because this became the normal life for us .
The abnormal life for other people became the normal life for us .
So we had to figure out another way of life for us .
It ’s our reality .
We had to face reality , however it was .
So it helped us to figure out that life , in spite of all this .
“ And all the challenges that we are facing , and all the power that is fighting and destroying everything here in Gaza , we still need to keep going .
It ’s not going to stop us .
Because if we stop , it wont help us .
[ The Israelis ] will keep going .
Whether or not we stop , they will try to get what they want .
So why give them more chance to get what they want ?
We need also to continue . ”
He paused at the end of this grand soliloquy , “ How difficult it was , ” he said softly .
But the difficulty continued as he moved on to get his BA in information technology at a university in Gaza .
“ I faced troubles when I was in high school because of the Intifada but the troubles increased in university , ” Ahmad explained , “ Beit Hanoun is the most violent area in Gaza Strip because it is very close to the [ Israeli ] border so there were usual attacks .
Every day we had events .
People killed .
People injured .
Homes destroyed .
Lands demolished .
My father ’s farm was bulldozed 4 or 5 times .
Most of my relatives ’ homes were targeted .
“ Most of the semesters I could n’t attend many lectures because of the usual attacks on my city .
There were weekly attacks , sometimes daily attacks so I could not leave home , it was not safe to leave .
And I ’d also have to stay home when there were other attacks around the city , or around the university . ”
Many times he was even able to attend final exams .
“ I ’d just keep studying throughout the semester and when time for exams come , attacks happen in Beit Hanoun and friends and relatives are killed , [ so I ‘d miss the exams ] .
I was supposed graduate in 2008 , but I graduated in 2009 , one year late because of these attacks .
Attacks which have never stopped .
Even now .
Especially in my city . ”
Ahmad was finally set to graduate in December 2008 .
But he was reminded once again that a Palestinian who dared pursue a good life had heavy taxes to pay .
“ The end of December turned out to be the beginning of a war , not the beginning of final exams .
It was a big , I do n’t know how to describe it , ” he said , searching for words to describe the deep personal affront he felt , “ it was like , ‘ here is a gift for graduation :
You wont graduate .
Just keep waiting for death . ’ ”
His month of exams was exchanged for a month of terror .
“ It was 23 days , ” he said , “ but you can say 23 weeks .
23 months . 23 years . 23 centuries .
It never ends .
You keep waiting , moment by moment .
And you know nothing .
You can only feel the darkness .
There is no light , for any kind of hope , or safety , or human rights , or whatever .
Just 23 days full of darkness .
Full of horror .
Full of victims .
Massacres .
Everything bad .
I can not remember words to describe it . ”
But those days did pass .
And he found enough strength to pick himself up out of the rubble and finish the mission he began .
He graduated , at last , this past spring .
But not , I cannot help but acknowledge , not without sacrifice and loss that no one should ever have to endure .
“ These five years in university , I said and will keep saying forever , ” Ahmad concluded , “ these five years were the most horrible years of my life .
Even though they ’re supposed to be the best years , the nice years .
The time to go out and discover life .
But it was n’t discovering life .
It was discovering disasters , actually , here in Gaza . ”

One of EFF 's goals is to give you a basic roadmap to the legal issues you may confront as a blogger to let you know you have rights and to encourage you to blog freely with the knowledge that your legitimate speech is protected .
To that end we have created the Legal Guide for Bloggers a collection of blogger - specific FAQs addressing everything from fair use to defamation law to workplace whistle - blowing .
In addition EFF continues to battle for bloggers ' rights in the courtroom :
Bloggers can be journalists ( and journalists can be bloggers ) .
We 're battling for legal and institutional recognition that if you engage in journalism you 're a journalist with all of the attendant rights privileges and protections .
( See Apple v. Does . )
Bloggers are entitled to free speech .
We 're working to shield you from frivolous or abusive threats and lawsuits .
Internet bullies should n't use copyright libel or other claims to chill your legitimate speech .
( See OPG v. Diebold . )
Bloggers have the right to political speech .
We 're working with a number of other public - interest organizations to ensure that the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) does n't gag bloggers ' election - related speech .
We argue that the FEC should adopt a presumption against the regulation of election - related speech by individuals on the Internet and interpret the existing media exemption to apply to online media outlets that provide news reporting and commentary regarding an election -- including blogs .
( See our joint comments to the FEC [ PDF 332K ] . )
Bloggers have the right to stay anonymous .
We 're continuing our battle to protect and preserve your constitutional right to anonymous speech online including providing a guide to help you with strategies for keeping your identity private when you blog .
( See How to Blog Safely ( About Work or Anything Else ) . )
Bloggers have freedom from liability for hosting speech the same way other web hosts do .
We 're working to strengthen Section 230 liability protections under the Communications Decency Act ( CDA ) while spreading the word that bloggers are entitled to them .
( See Barrett v. Rosenthal . )

This is , to say the least , strange .
Crazy enough that Hatch inserted it , odder still that Ted Kennedy and John Kerry supported it .
But if passed , this will open the floodgates to every fringe group out there :
Reporting from Washington - Backed by some of the most powerful members of the Senate , a little - noticed provision in the healthcare overhaul bill would require insurers to consider covering Christian Science prayer treatments as medical expenses .
The provision was inserted by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( R - Utah ) with the support of Democratic Sens. John F. Kerry and the late Edward M. Kennedy , both of Massachusetts , home to the headquarters of the Church of Christ , Scientist .
The measure would put Christian Science prayer treatments -- which substitute for or supplement medical treatments -- on the same footing as clinical medicine .
While not mentioning the church by name , it would prohibit discrimination against " religious and spiritual healthcare . "
It would have a minor effect on the overall cost of the bill -- Christian Science is a small church , and the prayer treatments can cost as little as $ 20 a day .
But it has nevertheless stirred an intense controversy over the constitutional separation of church and state , and the possibility that other churches might seek reimbursements for so - called spiritual healing .
Can you say " Scientology " ?
I knew you could !
Phil Davis , a senior Christian Science Church official , said prayer treatment was an effective alternative to conventional healthcare .
" We are making the case for this , believing there is a connection between healthcare and spirituality , " said Davis , who distributed 11,000 letters last week to Senate officials urging support for the measure .
Do n't get me wrong , I happen to believe this myself .
But I would n't dream of asking other people to pay for my spiritual beliefs without their full knowledge and consent .
And since many Christian fundamentalists consider Christian Science to be a cult , I suspect the uproar will get this pulled out of the bill .

A YEAR late and a trillion dollars short , Barack Obama is calling a jobs summit next month to try to come to grips with rising unemployment .
Jobs should have been at the top of Obama 's agenda even before he took office .
It did n't take a Ph.D. in economics to realize that the financial panic of 2008 was going to result in a big -- and long - term -- rise in unemployment .
But Obama rushed to aid bankers first , putting the government on the hook for as much as $ 11.6 trillion in bailouts and loan guarantees .
After Wall Street came the Pentagon , which got $ 663.8 billion for fiscal 2010 to fund two wars and more high - tech weaponry that can already destroy the world several times over .
Obama 's $ 787 stimulus package passed early this year was touted as a means to save or create jobs .
But even the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , Christina Romer , wanted stimulus spending of at least twice as much , according to the New Yorker magazine .
Plus , to appease Republicans , the stimulus plan included hundreds of billions in tax cuts , rather than direct job - creation measures , and gave only limited aid to state governments that have slashed jobs in the wake of falling tax revenues .
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , the state budget cuts will drain $ 470 billion out of the economy between 2010 and 2012 , effectively cutting the stimulus in half .
It was only after the national jobless rate surged to 10.2 percent last month -- and the number of workers underemployed or forced out of the labor market to 17.5 percent -- that Obama felt the pressure to give job creation the political spotlight .
But after two years of slump , the enormous suffering that occurs in every recession has turned into a full - fledged catastrophe for tens of millions of people .
As New York Times columnist Bob Herbert put it :
Nobody wants to talk seriously about class in America , but the elites are smiling and perusing their stock portfolios while the checklist of Americans locked in depression - like circumstances just grows and grows : construction and manufacturing workers , young men without college degrees ( especially young Black and Hispanic men ) , teenagers , and those who were already poor when the recession began .
Workers who should be at their peak earning years in their 40s and 50s face long stretches of joblessness or short - term work with few benefits .
The resulting loss of critical skills , along with age discrimination in hiring , will put millions of workers at risk of slipping below the poverty line in their retirement years .
At the same time , young people entering the workforce in the worst labor market since 1983 will find it difficult to reach what economists call a " wage ladder " -- steady employment with solid benefits that raises their standard of living over time .
Heather Boushey , a labor economist at the Center for American Progress , summed up the grim jobs picture :
Nearly a million workers have left the labor force over the past year ; two - thirds of those unemployed are out of work because they lost their prior job , dwarfing new and returning labor market entrants ; 9.3 million workers are employed part - time even though they would prefer a full - time jobs ; the share of the population with a job has fallen to 58.5 percent , lower than at any point since 1983 ; adult men's employment rates fell to 66.7 percent , hitting another all - time low ( going back to 1948 ) ; and teens are seeing their worst labor market ever -- unemployment among 16 - to 19 - year - olds is a record 27.6 percent .
LIBERAL ECONOMISTS are seizing the moment to call for aggressive jobs - creation programs .
Nouriel Roubini , the New York University economist who anticipated the financial crash , forecasts persistent high rates of joblessness of 10 to 11 percent despite a nascent economic recovery .
" There 's really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around : a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus with another round of labor - intensive , shovel - ready infrastructure projects , helps fiscally strapped state and local governments and provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers , " Roubini wrote .
Other economists propose wage subsidies , in which government funds from unemployment insurance make up for lost wages for workers on shorter hours .
Such programs already exist in 17 states , and their advocates are calling for a federal version of the plan .
Germany has used this approach to keep unemployment in check .
" Germany 's jobs miracle has n't received much attention in this country -- but it 's real , it 's striking , and it raises serious questions about whether the U.S. government is doing the right things to fight unemployment , " economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote .
Economist Robert Kuttner also backs the German - style proposal , but argues for a much bolder approach :
The Roosevelt administration , in an era before computers , got a lot of public works spending going in less than a year .
There are massive unmet needs in public infrastructure .
The Obama administration needs a short - term and a long - term strategy .
Projects such as school repair and expansion , which can get underway in a few months , should get fast - tracked funding commitments right away .
Longer term needs , such as smart electrical grids and modernization of water and sewer systems , expanded mass transit , and green energy , should be targeted for funding in 2011 , so that plans can get on the drawing boards now .
What should be added is that Roosevelt 's main jobs program , the Works Progress Administration , was created in 1935 , just months after general strikes rocked Minneapolis , Toledo and San Francisco .
That pressure from below was essential in forcing Roosevelt to shift from his almost exclusively pro-business orientation during the early months of his administration .
So far , there 's been almost no grassroots pressure on Obama to deal with the jobs crisis .
And rather than use the rising unemployment numbers to build support for a second , more aggressive stimulus program to create jobs , the White House is bowing to fiscal conservatives in the face of budget deficits of $ 1.2 trillion .
Thus , the administration has announced that it will use untapped funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) to replenish government coffers .
IN FACT , there 's plenty of money available to both narrow the deficit and fund the creation of jobs and other social programs .
What 's lacking is the political will from Obama and the Democrats .
Whenever the right screams about Obama 's " socialism , " remember that the top tax rate for the rich under the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s was 90 percent , compared to 35 percent today .
Surely , raising taxes on the wealthy could put a dent in the deficit while funding jobs creation .
But no one in the liberal establishment would even consider such a move , given the Democrats ' courtship of Wall Street .
Another quick source of funds for job creation would be an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a radical cut in defense spending .
But even Obama 's liberal critics would reject such a proposal as politically unfeasible .
But accepting political " realism " today means accepting a country in which the already superrich come out of the crisis unscathed , while tens of millions of people see their lives destroyed by unemployment .
When Obama and his advisers urge the people who voted for " change " to be patient , what they 're saying is that we have to stand by and watch joblessness drive a majority of African American kids under the poverty line , while the generals get an endless supply of guns and money in the service of U.S. imperialism .
The time for waiting for " change " is over .
We need an economic policy that puts the needs of working people at the forefront , not the banks .
Working people have to begin to organize in their communities and -- if they have them -- their unions to push for the jobs program we so urgently need .

Since the launch of Google Latitude earlier this year , we 've been getting a lot of feature requests .
One of the most popular ideas was for Latitude to keep track of location history , allowing you ( but not your friends ) to see where you 've been at any point in time .
Another popular idea was to notify you when you 're near your Latitude friends so you can easily meet up or grab lunch .
Today , we 're happy to introduce both Google Location History and Google Location Alerts ( beta ) to let you do even more with Latitude .
Google Location History
Whether you 're taking a road trip across the country , backpacking across Europe , or just going out for a night on the town , it 's fascinating to look back at where you went , and for how long you stayed .
Enable Google Location
History to store , view , and manage your past Latitude locations .
You can visualize your history on Google Maps and Earth or play back a recent trip in order .
Of course , you can always delete selected history or your entire location history at any time .
While working on Location History , I found myself going back in time to discover things that would have otherwise been impossible .
For example , I stopped at an awesome BBQ place on my way back from Lake Tahoe this summer , but I could n't remember the name when my friend was asking about it a few months later .
I pulled up my location history for that weekend , found where I was stationary on the drive home , and the restaurant name showed up in Google Maps : Drooling Dog Bar BQ .
Check it out below :
Google Location Alerts ( beta )
People also want to know when their friends were nearby , but it 's not always convenient to keep checking Latitude to see if a friend has recently shown up near you .
After working on this for a while , we realized it was n't as straightforward as sending a notification every time Latitude friends were near each other .
Imagine that you 're Latitude friends with your roommate or co-workers .
It would get pretty annoying to get a text message every single time you walked in the door at home or pulled into work .
To avoid this , we decided to make Location Alerts smarter by requiring that you also enable Location History .
Using your past location history , Location Alerts can recognize your regular , routine locations and not create alerts when you 're at places like home or work .
Alerts will only be sent to you and any nearby friends when you 're either at an unusual place or at a routine place at an unusual time .
Keep in mind that it may take up to a week to learn your " unusual " locations and start sending alerts .
To enable these features , go to google .com / latitude / apps .
You must first be an existing Google Latitude user ; if you 're not already , sign up here .
You must explicitly enable each feature , and of course , you can disable it at any time .

What can a cloud - native virtual machine help you do ?

BBC News , Dalnerechensk , Russia
Russia sends huge quantities of timber to China ( EIA picture )
Wagons brimming with logs accumulate in the Siberian railway station of Dalnerechensk , more than 8,000 km ( 4,971 miles ) east of Moscow .
They are waiting to cross the nearby Chinese border .
Once in China , they will be processed and used for construction or turned into garden furniture and other products to be sold in European and US shops .
More than a third of all Russian logs are smuggled by mafias , a practice that doubled between 2005 and 2007 , according to official figures .
It is a huge business .
China imports nearly six out of 10 logs produced in the world , after banning logging in its own territory following devastating floods a decade ago .
In total , 10 m cubic metres of wood , equivalent to nearly a third of all logging in the Amazon , is harvested every year from Russian soil .
This fuels a massive illegal business that threatens to destroy the largest forest on the planet in 20 to 30 years , according to Forest Trends , an international consortium of industry and conservation groups .
My boss has a guy who shuts up anyone creating problems or speaking too much
" Yevgeni " , illegal logger Small logging brigades of some four men , with the help of trucks , are behind most illegal felling .
The head of one of these brigades , a burly young former policeman calling himself Yevgeni , agreed to tell me how the system operated from the inside , on condition his identity was not revealed .
" Quick , jump in the car !
I 'll be shot if I 'm seen with a journalist , " he orders as I arrive in a forest clearing .
" My boss has a guy who shuts up anyone creating problems or speaking too much , " he explains later .
Corruption Illegal loggers usually carry guns , says Yevgeni , have sophisticated saws that cannot be heard beyond a dozen metres and place watchmen with satellite phones to warn of intruders .
Environmental activists say valuable tree species are being taken ( Picture by Roman Fadeev , BROC )
Once they deliver the logs to the sawmills , according to Yevgeni , the mafia " legalises " them by bribing officials .
" Most are corrupt - inspectors , policemen , they all protect each other , " he says .
Nowhere are the effects of their activities more evident than in the remote mountain villages in the heart of Primorsky region , the last refuge of Siberian tigers .
Anatoly Lebedev , an ex-KGB agent who is now a prominent environmental activist , accompanies me to one of these places .
" In northern Siberia loggers leave a trail of destruction , " he says .
" Here , the forests seem fine , but they 're actually dead .
They 're taking the most valuable species like Korean pine , oak and linden , which are key to maintaining the ecosystem .
It 's a disgrace , " he says .
On the way to the village , he jumps up and shouts : " Look !
There goes one . "
Mr Lebedev points to a truck laden with logs emerging from a small path in the forest .
Dry rivers
Hours later we arrive in the tiny village of Limolniki , a collection of wooden tin-roofed houses .
Nicolai Lizun , a 76 - year - old retired civil servant wearing military fatigues , explains that during the Soviet period , the state logging company prevented any illegal activities .
" Now it 's all out of control .
Illegal loggers working for outside companies come here , destroy everything and leave .
It 's barbaric . "
Anatoly Kabaniets ( left ) and Alexander Samoilenko have both suffered for their work as forestry inspectors Next to him , Vitali Tereshchuk , 21 , says : " We used to collect strawberries , mushrooms and ginseng .
We went hunting , but now the hills are logged , the rivers are dry and soon there will be nothing left . "
The powerful Russian mafia barons behind this booming illegal business lavish their money on flashy mansions in the region 's capital , Dalnerechensk .
But Alexander von Bismarck , from the Environmental Investigation Agency ( EIA ) , a non-governmental organisation or NGO , says the main beneficiaries are Chinese mafiosi and businessmen .
" There 's pressure on forests in north - western Russia , touching Scandinavia , but the main problem is in far - eastern Siberia where the mafia is particularly violent , " Mr Bismarck told me .
" We went to a dozen Chinese wood - processing companies across the border and most told us that they export all over Europe . "
Russian forest inspectors I spoke to said there was little they could do against such well - funded and organised gangs .
Their situation is made worse by the firing of thousands of their colleagues when the then president , now prime minister , Vladimir Putin scrapped the Forest Service in 2001 .
Deadly risk Alexander Vitrik , a local senior inspector , says that in the few cases where someone is arrested , pressure to stop trials is huge from the top levels of government .
" I can't give names , but they 're protected by very influential people , " he says .
Mr Vitrik admits that corruption among inspectors is rife , but declines to go into detail .
Despite these problems , some inspectors vow to keep on fighting .
Alexander Samoilenko , 57 , whom I find in an off - road vehicle donated by a Western NGO , is dressed in military fatigues and armed with a rifle and camera to record evidence against any offender .
" Since March , I 've only been given 600 litres of gas to patrol seven million hectares , " he says .
Mr Samoilenko says those behind the illegal logging set fire to his car and then tried to burn down his parents ' house , but failed .
His colleague Anatoly Kabaniets , sitting in the driver 's seat , smiles when hearing this : " All this small stuff does n't perturb us .
My son worked as an inspector and was murdered , but we 'll never give up . "

Whether it ’s seen as a clever little gadget to help a woman keep a secret or a devilish deception that threatens Islam , the Artificial Virginity Hymen Kit is not welcome in Egypt .
The kit allows a bride who is not a virgin to pretend that she is .
A pouch inserted into the vagina on her wedding night ruptures and leaks a blood - like liquid designed to trick a new husband into believing that his wife is chaste .
It ’s a wink of ingenuity to soothe a man ’s ego and keep the dowry intact .
Egyptian conservatives condemn the device as technology that will promote promiscuity in a culture that forbids premarital sex .
Their protests are arising in a nation that over the last 40 years has gone from miniskirts and secularism to hijabs and religious devotion .
But seldom have conservatives faced such brazen advertising .
“ No more worry about losing your virginity .
With this product , you can have your first night back any time , ” states the website of Gigimo , a Chinese mail - order company that sells the kit and other sexual products , including sex dolls and bondage toys , worldwide .
“ Add in a few moans and groans , you will pass through undetectable . ”
Advertisement
Members of the Muslim Brotherhood , which controls 20 % of the seats in Egypt ’s parliament , have called for banning the kit and arresting anyone selling it on the black market .
Cleric Abdul Moeti Bayoumi has issued a fatwa urging that peddlers of the $ 29.90 device be charged with banditry and punished for spreading immorality and sin .
“ Egyptian girls are normally afraid to lose their virginity before marriage , ” Sayed Askar , a lawmaker and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , recently told parliament .
“ A product like that can make it easier and tempting for girls who do n’t have strong wills to commit such a sin .
It will be a crying shame and a blot on the government if they allow the selling of this product in our markets . ”
Lina Samaan , an accountant , said the furor raises disturbing questions about her country and the double standards that often apply to women :
“ I think it ’s a shame that we are discussing a product like this .
If most girls do n’t have sex prior to marriage only because they want to keep virginity , then there is something wrong with the way we think , ” she said .
“ Sex is a right for every woman but unfortunately we started turning to products like these because men -- even non-religious ones who have sex before marriage -- would n’t marry a girl if she ’s not virgin . ”

The emotion over the kit speaks to a traditional society that is increasingly pious , whether it ’s rich professionals seeking moderate Islam on websites of progressive imams or poor and middle - class families adopting strict religion as a buttress to the influence of Western media and a loss of confidence in a state that has failed to provide prosperity .
The government of President Hosni Mubarak is troubled by ultraconservative Islam imported from Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf .
Egypt ’s leading Muslim cleric , Mohammed Sayed Tantawi , is considering forbidding the niqab , or face veil , at the university and schools run by Al Azhar , Sunni Islam ’s top educational institution .
A similar edict barring nurses from wearing niqabs has been loosely enforced .
The Egyptian media quoted Tantawi telling a student that the “ niqab has nothing to do with Islam .
. . .
I know about religion better than you and your parents . ”
Many parents , however , did not grow up with the economic and social problems that their children face .
Single women have traditionally lived with their families until they found a husband .
But today ’s inflation , joblessness and poverty are forcing many couples to delay marriage until money is saved and dowries are accumulated .
With men and women single longer , dating , breakups and natural impulses challenge religion and tradition .

“ Having something like the virginity kit can cause complete mayhem within the Egyptian social life , ” said Farid Ismael , a member of parliament ’s health committee .
“ It can lead to the spreading of vice and the loss of all the good morals and values we had and that totally contradicts with our Islamic beliefs . ”
The kit -- like surgical repairs to the hymen that Middle Eastern women have relied upon for years -- is marketed to offer a sleight of hand .
Such secrets keep prospective brides in the graces of their families and avoid what in rare cases are honor killings of women accused of promiscuity .
Choosing to have “ sex or not is something every girl and woman should decide regardless of the society ’s perspective toward her , ” said Samaan , the accountant .
“ Even if she is religious then she should n’t do it because of her religious belief and not in fear of other people or fear that she will not get married if she ’s not a virgin . ”
“ If a girl decided to have sex before marriage , ” she added , “ then God already knows it and she should n’t hide it from anyone else . ”

Presenter , The Candidates , BBC Radio 4
The most important day for determining who will become an MP in the next Westminster Parliament is the day of the general election , right ?
Wrong .
In most places , the most important day is the one where whichever party is dominant locally picks its candidate .
Mr Brown was the successful candidate at the Dudley North selection Even in 1997 , the last election to transform the political landscape , the majority of constituencies did not change hands .
So it is selection day , rather than election day , which really counts .
As I have been finding out over the last few months , for a documentary to be broadcast on BBC Radio Four on Sunday lunchtime , party selection contests are unpredictable .
Stand - off Local members make the choice , a power they jealously guard .
Hence the difficulties faced by Conservative leader David Cameron as he tries to get more women selected , and the nasty stand - off between Tories in South West Norfolk and their candidate Elizabeth Truss .
Whether she is to be deselected will be decided next week .
One of the selections I 've followed is that of the Conservative candidate in Dudley North - a seat held by Labour at the moment but vulnerable .
Local Tories had already begun their selection earlier in the year , so activists were not best pleased to be ordered by party headquarters to start again .
Although the Conservatives are ahead in the polls they , like the other parties , are struggling to recreate the mass political movement of old
But that was good news for hopeful candidate Graeme Brown .
He had only made the reserve list ; but by the time the selection was re-started , one of the other hopefuls had dropped out , so he was added to the shortlist of four .
This obeyed a new rule the Conservatives have introduced : A requirement that local associations shortlist the same number of women as men .
Mr Cameron hopes this will maximise the prospects of more women getting selected .
It did not work in Dudley .
Two women were interviewed , one a social worker who lives in the town .
Shortlist controversy
But the association opted for Mr Brown , who is now enduring some flak from the local newspapers because he works in London .
For me , though , more revealing was the size of the " selectorate " : Just 21 local Tories voted .
Although the Conservatives are ahead in the polls they , like the other parties , are struggling to recreate the mass political movement of old .
In Scunthorpe , there were probably three times as many selectors occupying the stalls at the Plowright Theatre on the Saturday morning of Halloween , when Labour chose its candidate .
Labour 's Nic Dakin after his selection in Scunthorpe
This is one of that majority of constituencies which rarely changes hands .
No surprise , then , that 32 hopefuls applied .
Labour , too , has rules for drawing up shortlists .
Scunthorpe was not required to make it all female ( a practice which remains controversial within the party more than a decade after it was introduced - I am told one seat in the north of England , with a woman MP who is retiring , successfully resisted efforts to impose an all - woman shortlist ) but the final four had to include at least one woman , and one candidate from an ethnic minority .
That was Saj Malik , a taxi - driver and councillor from Oxford , who as soon as he made the shortlist , upped sticks and moved into a room over a pub in Scunthorpe , the better to wage his campaign of wooing the selectorate .
Costs rack up
Tough on his family , but not untypical of the sacrifices made by would - be MPs ; and as many pointed out to me , something they pay for themselves .
If you apply for several seats , the costs can rack up .
Yet the local party went for the local man , Nic Dakin who runs the college in Scunthorpe and used to lead the council .
In a normal year , he could start looking now for that second home in London .
Next year 's election could see the largest turnover of MPs in 60 years
But the expenses scandal has strewn unexpected obstacles on the road to Westminster .
There probably would have been no new candidate here at all , had not the sitting MP Elliott Morley been barred from standing again because he had claimed for a mortgage that had already been paid off .
Next year 's election could see the largest turnover of MPs in 60 years .
Yet , despite a few seats where the Conservatives have allowed non-party members to take part in selections , the majority of the eventual winners in the Westminster Class of 2010 will have been chosen by a relatively small number of party activists .
If you live in a safe seat and want a say in who represents you after 2115 , your influence will be greater if you attend the selection meeting of the dominant political party than if you make it to the polling station on election day .
The Candidates will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 1330 GMT on Sunday 15 November .

Citing increasing concerns about the rising cost of the Afghan War , a group of House Democrats led by Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey ( D - WI ) have proposed a new tax on personal income .
Rep. Obey ( D - WI )
The tax is being pressed forward as part of the “ Share the Sacrifice Act of 2010 , ” which Rep .
Obey and others say will ensure that all Americans share the onerous burden of continuing the seemingly endless conflict in Afghanistan .
The tax would be graduated into three stages , one level for those earning less than $ 150,000 a year , another for those earning $ 150,000 - $ 250,000 , and then one for $ 250,000 + earners .
The goal is to increase taxes on the first group by 1 % and increase each of the other two to whatever level the President decides will be needed for the war in any given year .
Members of the US military would be exempt from the tax hike .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was among the high profile co-signers of the bill , and said there was serious concern in the Democratic Caucus about how to afford the war , which Rep .
Obey estimates could cost another $ 1 trillion over the next ten years .
Senator Carl Levin ( D - MI ) has proposed a similar idea , and momentum for the plan seems to be growing with President Obama ’s upcoming escalation announcement next week .
While the Afghan War is shaping up to rival Vietnam for the longest war in American history , most war - based tax hikes endure long after the conflict has died down .
An 1898 tax on telephone service pushed forward to pay for the Spanish American War stayed on the books until late 2006 , over a century after the war ended .
She sleeps in safe houses , with a rotating squad of bodyguards securing the doors .
She goes out only in a billowing burqa .
Even her wedding was held in secret .
Elected the youngest member of the Afghan parliament – and suspended for her outspoken criticism of the country 's top officials – Malalai Joya has been labelled the bravest woman in Afghanistan .
Small , soft - spoken and now 31 , she has survived at least four assassination attempts and is angry at the oppressive life she is forced to lead , dodging enemies she has denounced as bloody - handed warlords and drug kingpins .
As Afghan President Hamid Karzai is inaugurated Thursday for another four years in office after a fiercely disputed election , she says his term is already tainted by the corruption , criminality and violence of those around him .
" ( Prime Minister ) Stephen Harper says this election was a success , " she said .
" But Karzai has not only insulted , but betrayed the Afghan people . "
Karzai has vowed to launch anti-corruption investigations under pressure from Washington .
But , Joya insists , Canada is wasting blood and treasure on keeping his government in power .
" Canada should pull its troops out now , " she said in Toronto on Wednesday , where she was promoting her book A Woman Among Warlords , co-written with Canadian peace activist Derrick O'Keefe .
And , she says , U.S. President Barack Obama , who is considering a surge in troop levels to battle Al Qaeda and the Taliban , should think again .
" The United States should go , too .
As long as foreign troops are in the country we will be fighting two enemies instead of one . "
Yes , she says , there is a risk of civil war , as happened when the Soviet Union gave up the fight against U.S. - backed Afghan Islamists 20 years ago .
But it would still be better than " night raids , torture and aerial bombardment " that killed hundreds of Afghan civilians while the Taliban made steady gains .
" Liberation was just a big lie . "
Joya believes
Afghans are now better prepared to battle the Taliban alone – if the warlords are disarmed , and the international community helps build a society that can push back against extremism .
It is a tall order , she admits .
But " resistance has increased , and people are becoming more aware of democracy and human rights .
They need humanitarian and educational support . "
But not , she adds , at the point of a gun .
Joya has firsthand experience with the Taliban , as well as the brutal warlords who forced her family into refugee camps after the exit of the Soviets in 1989 .
As a teacher in the secret schools that educated girls – strictly banned by the Taliban – she walked around western Afghanistan at the end of the 1990s with books hidden beneath the enveloping burqa .
" Once we were stopped and searched but the burqa saved me , " she recalled in her book .
" They ordered me to stretch out my arms but because they did not pat me down they never found the school books . "
But after the Taliban 's violent repression of women , Joya says , Karzai's Afghanistan has done little to ease their plight .
Religious extremism is rife , and even a 25 per cent quota for women in parliament has produced few female politicians who are willing to fight for women 's rights .
That is what makes Joya an inspiration for those who greet her tearfully on her heavily guarded visits to clinics , community groups and an orphanage she supports .
It has also made her a target for radicals , as well as the warlord factions she denounces .
Since she called for the prosecution of highly placed warlords and drug smugglers in a landmark 2003 meeting on the country 's constitution , the threats have not stopped .
When Joya returns to Afghanistan this month , she will resume her perilous career as a rallying point for the country 's downtrodden and disenchanted – and hope she will live to see genuine change .
" It will be a long struggle , " she wrote .
" A river is made drop by drop ... you can kill me , but you can never kill my spirit . "

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : jhc 0.7.1
Hi , I am happy to announce the jhc optimizing haskell compiler version 0.7.1 .
Information on installing jhc is here : http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/building.shtml
And the Main page is here : http://repetae.net/computer/jhc
There have been a lot of changes since the last public release , Some notable ones are : * The use of a general compiler cache by default rather than object files .
This means work done by jhc is shared between projects , jhc uses cryptographic hashes internally to never compile the same piece of code more than once .
This has numerous benefits , a notable one being speed .
* Reworked library support .
Jhc libraries are now much more general , when linking only the bits needed are loaded from the hl file , libraries are allowed to re-export modules from other libraries , making versioning or providing multiple interfaces to the same functionality a lot simpler .
Library conflicts are ' lazy ' , like ambiguity errors now .
* Updated Manual , clearer build instructions * Support for writing pure C libraries in Haskell .
* numerous library updates , filled out many IO routines that were stubs before * Smart progress meters when compiler for a better user experience * performs all typechecking before compilation , for a faster edit - compile loop when writing code with jhc .
* various bug fixes * Cross Compilation improvements , for instance you can compile for windows transparently on a linux box .
Or for an embedded target that is independent of the host .
* Better Mac OSX Support , as both a host and target .
If you are wondering about the large version number bump since the last release , It is because several versions were released only internally to the jhc list for testing .
If you are interested in jhc , join the list at : http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/jhc

ITHACA , N.Y . --
Nearly half of all Americans surveyed said they think the US government should restrict the civil liberties of Muslim Americans , according to a nationwide poll .
The survey conducted by Cornell University also found that Republicans and people who described themselves as highly religious were more apt to support curtailing Muslims ' civil liberties than Democrats or people who are less religious .
Researchers also found that respondents who paid more attention to television news were more likely to fear terrorist attacks and support limiting the rights of Muslim Americans .
" It 's sad news ; it 's disturbing news .
But it 's not unpredictable , " said Mahdi Bray , executive director of the Muslim American Society .
" The nation is at war , even if it 's not a traditional war .
We just have to remain vigilant and continue to interface . "
The survey indicated that 44 percent of those surveyed said they favored at least some restrictions on the civil liberties of Muslim Americans .
Forty - eight percent said liberties should not be restricted .
The survey indicated that 27 percent of the respondents said they supported requiring all Muslim Americans to register their home address with the federal government .
Twenty - two percent said they favored racial profiling to identify potential terrorist threats .
And 29 percent said they thought undercover agents should infiltrate Muslim civic and volunteer organizations to keep tabs on their activities and fund - raising .
Student researchers from Cornell questioned 715 people in the nationwide telephone poll conducted this fall .
The margin of error was 3.6 percentage points .
James Shanahan , an associate professor of communications who helped organize the survey , said the results indicate that " the need for continued dialogue about issues of civil liberties " in a time of war .
While researchers said they were not surprised by the level of support for curtailing civil liberties , they were startled by the correlation with religion and exposure to television news .
" We need to explore why these two very important channels of discourse may nurture fear rather than understanding , " Shanahan said .
According to the survey , 37 percent of respondents said they think a terrorist attack in the United States is likely within the next 12 months .
In a similar poll conducted by Cornell in November 2002 , the figure was 90 percent .

Miley Cyrus Crew Bus Kills One , Injures Nine Others
A week after rumors of Miley Cyrus dying in an automobile crash , one of the tour buses of the teen icon carrying crew members crashed on an embankment leaving the driver dead .
The driver Bill Douglas died on the spot .
Nine of the passengers suffered injuries .
The bus flipped in Interstate 85 near Richmond , Virginia on its way to a Cyrus show in Greensboro , North Carolina scheduled Sunday .
The Disney star was not aboard the bus when the incident happened as the vehicle is one of the four bus entourage .
Miley and family issued an official statement from the star ’s website .
“ We are deeply saddened by the loss of Bill ‘ Uncle Bill ’ Douglas .
Members of our tour are like members of our family .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family in the midst of this tragedy .
He will truly be missed , ” the statement said .
Investigation on why the bus flipped is still ongoing as of this time .
Every year since 1952 , the Book Review has asked a panel of judges to select 10 books from among the several thousand children ’s books published that year .
The judges this time around were Adam Gopnik , who writes regularly for The New Yorker and is the author of two novels for children , “ The King in the Window ” and the forthcoming “ Steps Across the Water ” ; Jillian Tamaki , a teacher at the School of Visual Arts and the recipient of a Society of Illustrators gold medal ; and Lisa Von Drasek , the children ’s librarian of the Bank Street College of Education .
The art of teaching your child to ride a bike has n't changed in ... well , ever , really .
You get a running start , swallow your heart , and let go .
Soon they wreck , you wipe up the tears , and start again .
Hopefully , soon , the wipeouts become less frequent , and away they go .
Daniella Reichstetter , the CEO of Gyrobike , wants to sell you a better way .
With a powerful gyro , your child never has to eat pavement again .
" The majority of children learn to ride their first two - wheeler with training wheels , which incidentally , simply do n't ' train ' a rider to do anything , " she told Ars .
" At best , training wheels keep a rider from tipping over .
At worst they cause nasty spills .
Training wheels also teach bad riding habits that are counter - effective to correct riding technique . "
She points out that once the wheels are removed , children then have to unlearn those bad habits , often with even more accidents .
The gyrowheel is , at its heart , a simple idea .
Create a wheel for children 's bicycles that contains another rapidly spinning wheel , and as any physics students will tell you , the gyro effect will keep the wheel upright .
That means that even first - time bike riders will be able to stay upright once one of the battery - powered wheel is attached to their bike .
The technology was actually created as a tool to ride a unicycle .
" We quickly realized however that there was a much more needed application — a way to make learning to ride a bicycle safer , easier and in the process more fun , " Reichstetter said .
The idea may be simple , but the creation of the product was anything but , with two years spent in product development and testing .
" Our challenge was not only to develop a front bike wheel with a disk that could do this , but also to find a way to get the disk to spin fast enough to create enough force ( gyroscopic precession ) that would help stabilize the bike at a low speed so that a rider could benefit from the stabilizing effect , " she told Ars .
They balanced safety , form , and function ... not to mention trying to make the product interesting for children .
" We fully enclosed the disk to keep small fingers safe .
We enclosed rechargeable batteries and motorized the disk .
Ultimately , we created a ' cool ' design that allows kids ( and adults ) to see the ' magic ' disk in action . "
The wheel includes a built - in rechargeable battery , and can be set to three stability settings , or be turned off altogether .
As the young bikers learn how to ride , the power can be turned down accordingly until they 're finally biking on their own .
The battery can't be replaced by the user , but we 're told that wo n't be a problem .
" The batteries ( NiMH ) can be recharged at least 200 times .
That ’s about 200 days , or more than a season , of learning to ride one ’s first bicycle . "
The catch , and the future
Of course , this is n't an inexpensive product .
The 12 " wheel will sell for around $ 100 , and there is not yet solid pricing information on the 16 " wheel .
The timing ?
" The launch of our 12 - inch Gyrowheel is just around the corner [ on December 1 ] and 16 - inch Gyrowheels will launch this spring , " we 're told .
" We also plan to offer 12 - inch and 16 - inch bikes with Gyrobike technology in 2010 . "
Adult bikes with the technology , which for now will only be sold through the website , could be good for senior citizens who would like a safe way to continue biking , and Reichstetter also said there is much interest in the original unicycle design .
As for what configurations we 'll see in the next few years , she would only say that they 're working on a number of products .
It 's an interesting idea , but are parents willing to pay $ 100 or more for a single wheel ?
The product has enjoyed quite the positive reception so far , and Reichstetter is nothing if not enthusiastic .
" I knew Gyrowheel was going to be a hit when I first saw the proof - of - concept prototype in action back in 2006 .
It ’s one of those products that makes you think , ' Why has n’t this been done already ? ' " she told Ars .
" The excitement has only continued to build from there .
With thousands of consumer requests for Gyrowheel , along with positive reactions from the media , we are confident and excited about changing the way people ride bicycles . "
Virtually any photo manager out there lets you perform mundane tasks like adjusting contrast , adding a watermark , or applying effects to your photos .
But even the most powerful applications like digiKam or F - Spot ca n’t really help you when you need to perform the same action ( or a sequence of actions ) on dozens or hundreds of photos .
For those tasks you need a batch processing utility like Phatch .
This nifty tool can perform no less than 35 different actions on your photos , and its user - friendly graphical interface makes it easy to create advanced multi-step batch rules ( or action lists in Phatch ’s parlance ) .
If you are using Ubuntu , installing Phatch is as easy as downloading its .deb package and double - clicking on it .
If you want to be able to view EXIF and IPTC data , you should also install the python - pyexiv2 package , and for a “ cool nautilus integration ” Phatch ’s Web site recommends installing the python - nautilus package .
Unlike conventional image editing applications ,
Phatch does n’t allow you to edit photos directly — instead , you use it to set up actions .
An action in Phatch is a single operation that the application performs on the photos that are fed into it .
Each action offers a number of options : for example , the Scale action allows you to specify the width and height , resolution , and resampling algorithm .
You can add as many actions as you like , and the project ’s wiki ( http://photobatch.wikidot.com/actions) provides a list of all actions supported by the Phatch .
To add an action to Phatch , press the Add Action button and select the desired action from the list .
You can narrow the list to a specific action type by selecting a category from the Select drop - down list .
Alternatively , you can use the Search feature to search for a particular action .
In this case , choose the Scale action and press the Add button .
This adds the selected action to the main window , and you can use the available options to tweak the action .
For the Scale action , for example , you can choose to scale down the photo by a specified percentage value or to a predefined size measured in pixels .
If you wish to change the image resolution or resampling algorithm , you can do so by adjusting the appropriate options .
Once you are satisfied with the settings , you can add the next action and specify its options .
In a similar manner , you can add other desired actions .
Finally , you have to add the mandatory Save action : without it , Phatch would n’t know where to save the processed photos .
Besides options such as output format and quality , the Save action also offers a set of variables that you can use to specify a destination for the processed photos .
For example , using the default < folder > _phatch /< subfolder > variable , Phatch saves the processed images in a separate folder inside the source directory .
The < root >/ phatch / < year >/< month > /< day > variable , in turn , creates a directory structure based on the current date .
By the way , you can rearrange the actions in the list using drag - and - drop .
This , of course , does n’t apply to the Save action that must always be the last action on the list .
To process photos using the created action list , press the Execute button , choose the directory containing the photos you want to process , and press the Batch button .
You should then see the processed photos in the destination directory .
While using the Execute command every time you want to run photos through Phatch is not that difficult , the application offers another nifty feature that makes the batch process even more straightforward .
Choose View ->
Droplet , and Phatch turns into a floating icon .
Drag photos onto it , and Phatch processes them using the currently opened action list .
Although Phatch is first and foremost a GUI tool , you can run it from the command line , so you can automate the batch execution and put Phatch to some interesting uses .
For example , you can turn your computer into a batch photo processing server , and you can find a more detailed description of how this can be done at Phatch ’s wiki .

Anyone who considers themselves to be a pop-culture enthusiast has , at one point , spent some time speculating on the sexual orientation of fictional characters .
For instance , who has n’t engaged in a lively debate as to whether Sesame Street ’s Bert and Ernie are really gay , or , for that matter , had their minds blown by Quentin Tarantino ’s hilarious theory in Sleep With Me that Top Gun is really about one man ’s struggle with his homosexuality ?
And now , faster than you can say Dumbledore , comes a theory from Movieline ’s Kyle Buchanan that Milhouse on The Simpsons just might be gay .
His main piece of evidence comes directly from the best source one could possibly know of , none other than Simpsons creator Matt Groening himself .
At a party in Los Angeles last night for the Shepard Fairey Equality Project , Groening autographed a poster advocating gay marriage with a postscript that reads “ Your fan , Matt Groening , Creator of Milhouse . ”
Now , anyone who watches the show knows that Milhouse has long fancied Lisa Simpson , so perhaps there ’s a chance that he ’s actually bi ?
This assertion seems to be backed up by the site Wikisimpsons , who list Milhouse on their page of LBGT characters under the classification of “ Being hinted at being Bisexual . ”
Either way , this should make for a good Friday - afternoon conversation topic for you , the loyal Vulture readership .
Do you agree ?
Do you have another interpretation of what Matt Groening might have meant with this inscription ?
And what about Martin Prince ?
Is Milhouse a Secret Gay on The Simpsons ?

The president described the flight as a ' unique experience '
Indian President Pratibha Patil has flown in a fighter jet , becoming the country 's first woman to fly in a combat plane .
Mrs Patil , 74 , described her 30 - minute flight in a two - seater Sukhoi jet as " a wonderful and unique experience " .
The president was a co-passenger in the jet that flew above an air force base near the city of Pune in western India .
She also set a world record by becoming the oldest woman to be airborne in a combat jet , Indian officials claim .
" I was familiarised with the manoeuvring of the aircraft which has a very sophisticated way of handling it .
I had the opportunity to fly in the most technically advanced aircraft , " Mrs Patil told a press conference in Pune city after her flight .
Symbolic
" I am reassured that our pilots and the defence forces have the required skills and expertise .
I am reassured that we have the expertise and strength to protect our borders , " she said .
Earlier , a confident - looking president sat in the co-pilot 's seat in the cockpit and waved to people gathered at the airbase .
Mrs Patil , who always appears in public in traditional Indian saris , wore a special khaki green " G - suit " worn by fighter pilots to counter gravitational effect due to any high - speed air manoeuvres .
She is the second Indian president after APJ Abdul Kalam to fly in a Sukhoi .
India 's presidents have largely symbolic duties , including official command of the country 's military .
i Phone users who have jailbroken their handset to install third - party apps have fallen victim to a virus created by an Australian hacker that alters the phone 's wallpaper to a picture of singer Rick Astley .
The hacker , Ashley Towns , a 21 - year - old from Wollongong , south of Sydney , claimed the virus was a " harmless " practical joke .
Hacker Ashley Towns , 21 , on his MySpace , and , inset , a picture of Rick Astley , the singer Towns placed on people 's iPhones .
The virus relied on the iPhone user leaving a default password unchanged after installing the software that allows them to run third - party apps .
It scanned the IP address range an iPhone was on and then a " random " 20 IP ranges from the American Registry for Internet Numbers ( ARIN ) , Towns said .
The virus had spread to hundreds of iPhones nationwide by early yesterday and has since gone global .
It followed a similar virus where a hacker demanded users pay a fee of five dollars for its removal .
But Towns was not demanding money from his version .
i Phone users flooded online forums including Whirlpool reporting the virus as early as Friday .
" I woke up this morning to find that the wallpaper on my jailbroken [ iPhone ] 3GS had been changed to a picture of Rick Astley ( some 80's singer ? ) with the words ' ikee is never going to give you up ' , " wrote Whirlpool internet forum user sierralpha .
" Same thing is happening to me , " wrote another Whirlpool user jmaust72 .
Creator Towns said he " was n't intending " the virus to spread as far as it did .
Towns , who goes by the alias of " ikee " and other variants , said he hacked the iPhones to " have fun " .
He hoped affected users would also see the " fun " side .
" I guess the immature side of me kicked in at first , " Towns said .
" And Rick - rolling is always a way for a cheap laugh .
" I wanted to have fun , and I did . "
Privacy breached
But some Whirlpool users failed to see the funny side .
" This is a bit of a jerk move , " wrote Whirlpool user adamiam .
" Like , yes his justification for doing this was that it will prompt people to secure their iPhone , but it 's still quite annoying " .
Some users had private photos - which had previously been set as their wallpaper - sent to other user 's iPhones .
And other affected users claimed the virus had resulted in excess data usage bills .
Towns admitted pictures of loved ones - in one case an iPhone user 's child - had been sent to other iPhones infected by the virus .
" That was a flaw in the first variant [ and I ] did n't quite think things over too much , " said Towns .
" I hope no one got anything too private " .
Towns also conceded he had " never thought " about whether the virus would cost users in excess download fees - and in turn higher bills .
" It would be weird if it ... started on the 6th [ of November ] because ... my billing cycle ends on the 6th and I checked my bill today and I am $ 200 over my cap , which I think is impossible , " alleged one Whirlpool user , JoshuaSpence .
" Worried " about legal fallout
At first Towns claimed he was " aware " of the legal implications of creating the virus but was " not concerned " by them .
He later said on Twitter that the media coverage had gotten him " worried " .
Towns said his own iPhone had infected over 100 iPhones .
But he could n't say how many iPhones had been infected by other iPhones .
Towns also said he originally intended to have a user 's ringtone changed to singer Rick Astley 's 1980s hit Never Gonna Give You Up .
He said , at the last minute , he could n't find an audio converter that made that possible .
Apple 's caution
Hacks like this have seen Apple respond by cautioning users against installing software that jailbreaks the iPhone 's operating system .
" Customers who have installed software that makes these modifications have encountered numerous problems in the operation of their hacked iPhone or iPod touch , " states Apple 's website .
Apple recently posted a job listing on its website for an " iPhone OS Platform Security Manager " to oversee a team " focused on the platform security of iPhone OS " and ensuring " secure booting and installation of the OS " .
It was believed the job was to secure the iPhone from being jailbroken .
The wave disc engine , a new implementation of wave rotor technology , was earlier developed by the Michigan State group in collaboration with researchers from the Warsaw Institute of Technology .
About the size of a large cooking pot , the novel , hyper - efficient engine could replace current engine / generator technologies for plug - in hybrid electric vehicles .
Researchers from Michigan State University have been awarded $ 2.5 million from the Department of Energy ’s ARPA - E program ( earlier post ) to complete its prototype development of a new gasoline - fueled wave disc engine and electricity generator that promises to be five times more efficient than traditional auto engines in electricity production , 20 % lighter , and 30 % cheaper to manufacture .
The award will allow a team of MSU engineers and scientists , led by Norbert Müller , an associate professor of mechanical engineering , to begin working toward producing a vehicle - size wave disc engine / generator during the next two years , building on existing modeling , analysis and lab experimentation they have already completed .
Our goal is to enable hyper - efficient hybrid vehicles to meet consumer needs for a 500 - mile driving range , lower vehicle prices , full - size utility , improved highway performance and very low operating costs .
The WDG also can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 95 percent in comparison to modern internal combustion vehicle engines .

The Wave Disc Engine .
The wave disc engine is a new implementation of wave rotor technology ( also called Pressure Wave Machines or Pressure Exchangers ) .
Wave rotors are unsteady - flow devices that utilize shock waves to transfer energy directly between a high - energy fluid to a low - energy fluid , thereby increasing both temperature and pressure of the low - energy fluid .
Wave rotor technology has shown a significant potential for performance improvement of thermodynamic cycles .

Wave rotor technology has been explored since 1906 , although its first significant application was in 1940 by Brown Boveri Company ( BBC , today ABB ) which used it as a high pressure stage for a gas turbine locomotive engine .
In 1986 , Mazda introduced the Mazda 626 Cappela model , which had a 2 - liter diesel engine equipped with a Comprex wave rotor ( from BBC ) used as a supercharger .
Mazda produced 150,000 Comprex diesel cars .
Other car manufacturers including Opel , Mercedes , Peugeot and Ferrari used the Comprex .
Swissauto Wenko AG of Switzerland produces a modern version of the Comprex — the Hyprex — designed for small gasoline engines .
Earlier wave rotor implementation were mainly axial flow .
In axial - flow configurations , noted Müller and co-authors in a 2004 paper , pure scavenging is a challenging task .
Although it is possible to achieve a full scavenging process for both through and reverse - flow configurations , the solutions lead to more complex configurations .
The wave disc technology , however , uses a radial and circumferential flow .
This can substantially improve the scavenging process by using centrifugal forces ... Compared with straight channels , curved channels provide a greater length for the same disc diameter , which can be important to obtain certain wave travel times for tuning .
With curved channels also the angle against the radius can be changed freely .
This allows modulating of the inflow direction acting accelerating component of the centrifugal force and also to choose the inlet and outlet angle independently .
The latter enables independent matching with the flow direction through the stationary inlet and outlet ports or the use of a freely chosen incidence angle for a self - driving configuration .
Furthermore , curved channels may be more effective for self - propelling and work extraction in the case of a wave turbine or work input for additional compression , analogous to the principle of turbomachines .
— Piechna et al. ( 2004 )
The earlier MSU investigations of wave rotor and radial wave rotor technology were exploring gas turbine applications in addition to supercharging or refrigeration .
In a gas turbine application , the team noted , positioning the combustion process internally in the wave rotor could simplify porting between the turbo - compressor and the wave disc “ enormously ” .
This led to a proposed concept of a Radial Internal Combustion Wave Rotor — the precursor to the wave disc engine .
Early concept of an internal combustion wave disc engine .
The fuel supplies ( green ) are located at the inner inlet port .
The mixture in the channel is ignited either by a stationary igniter acting through holes in the channel ( yellow ) or by rotating electrical igniters activated only in a certain angular position of the mixture - filled channel .
The air - fuel mixture can be radially stratified .
Combustion starts in the central part of the channel , where the fuel / air mixture is rich and flame propagates to inner and outer end of the cell .
Since heat release increases pressure inside the channel , opening the outer channel end generates an outflow of the exhaust gases .
For curved channels , torque is given to the disc during the flow scavenging .
This can be used for self - driven rotation or for external work extraction through a shaft or a generator .
The outflow of the burned gases can induce an inflow of air and air - fuel mixture into the channels , refilling and cooling the cell before the cycle starts again .

According to TV Guide , Firestorm as he appears on the cartoon Batman : The Brave and the Bold will be a merger of Jason Rusch and Ronnie Raymond .
Jason will be in control of the body with Ronnie ’s consciousness along for the ride .
Given Firestorm ’s current situation in the comic book series Blackest Night , is it possible that the cartoon Batman : The Brave and the Bold is reflecting what will ultimately happen to Firestorm in the comics ?
Seems possible .
Here is part of the TV Guide article :
Firestorm Ignites The Brave and the Bold by Rich Sands Batman : The Brave and the Bold may be aimed at kids , but the Cartoon Network series has given fanboys ( and girls ) plenty to geek out about .
With appearances by heroes both iconic ( Green Arrow ) and obscure ( B’wana Beast , anyone ? ! ) , the show has tapped into DC Comics ’ rich archives for a colorful cast of friends and foes for the Caped Crusader .
The series returns with new episodes on January 1 , bringing Batman a new batch of super friends .
Among this winter ’s guests stars is Firestorm , a longtime second - tier character with a strong cult following who uses nuclear energy to change the atomic structure of inorganic objects .
These powers were gained when two men were caught in the middle of a nuclear accident , which merged them into one flame - haired crimefighter .
Everybody Hates Chris star Tyler James Williams provides the voice for Jason Rusch , who hosts the dual personality in his body , while SpongeBob SquarePants ’ Bill Fagerbakke plays ex-jock Ronnie Raymond , whose consciousness is along for the ride .
( In the comics , Ronnie was the original Firestorm , paired with brainy physicist Martin Stein . )
“ When they combine it ’s basically the smart kid has the body and he ’s got this dumb guy in his head telling him stuff , ” says producer James Tucker .
“ It ’s like the flip side of mentoring .
Usually you have the rebellious kid and the older stable guy trying to tell him what to do .
This time the kid is stable and the older guy is telling him to lighten up . ”
The episode ’s main villain is Doctor Double X , a little known character who first appeared in the 1950s , and Tucker advises to “ look for lots of cameos of obscure Batman villains .
This is definitely a fanboy ’s freeze - frame episode . “

1895 : The North Road Cycling Club in London holds what is widely regarded as the first bicycle time trial .
Britain's National Cyclist Union had , earlier in the 1890s , banned cyclists from racing on the road because of a mishap between a woman , her horse and a group of cyclists .
For safety 's sake , the union wanted all future bicycle races to be held on the track .
Disagreeing , a group of cyclists started a rival group , the North Road Cycling Club .
The club held a race in North London 114 years ago today .
The cyclists left the start line one at a time , separated by a couple of minutes .
An act intended as a way to improve safety without forsaking the road launched what has become an integral part of modern road racing .
The time trial is now the single most grueling event in professional cycling .
It 's just you , your bicycle and a piece of open road .
Sure , it 's an impressive feat to leave everyone in your wake as you climb like a goat to the top of Mont Ventoux or Alpe d’Huez in the Tour de France .
Or breaking out of a pack and bumping elbows with the sprinters at 35 - plus miles an hour to win the final stage on the Champs - Élysées in a glorious moment .
But it is the individual time trial that separates the men from the boys .
With no teammates to hide behind and no real advantage for any particular body type , " The Race of Truth , " as it 's known , is the gauge by which all pros measure their individual fitness .
When the opponent is time – constant and unforgiving – the only thing a cyclist can do is put his head down and try to pick the perfect balance between the burning in his legs and the burning in his lungs .
To have a shot at winning the Tour de France today , cyclists must excel at the time - trial portion of the race , because it 's often a game changer .
In 1989 's Tour de France , Greg LeMond eliminated a 50 - second deficit on the final stage , an individual time trial , to beat the great Laurent Fignon by a mere 8 seconds .
You can relive this impressive feat in the video below .

Sensitive CIA operations overseas will face new scrutiny from the nation ’s intelligence director under a plan approved by the White House and outlined in a memo to the espionage workforce last week .
The move marks an attempt by Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair to assert greater authority over clandestine operations at a time of mounting bureaucratic frictions between the CIA and Blair ’s office .
Among the activities that could be evaluated are the CIA ’s campaign of Predator missile strikes against militant targets in Pakistan , as well as secret paramilitary and spying operations in other countries .
In a memo to subordinates Friday , Blair cited new guidance from the White House that his responsibilities “ include assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of sensitive operations . ”
The majority of those , he said , “ are conducted by the CIA . ”

But in a sign of ongoing skirmishing in the intelligence community , other officials dismissed Blair ’s memo and said the CIA ’s covert-action authorities remain intact .
“ Covert action is ordered by the president and carried out by the CIA , ” said a U.S. intelligence official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ That relationship , which involves a single , direct line of command and communication between the White House and the agency , is n’t changing . ”
Indeed , officials said Blair had sought to change the chain of command , putting his office more directly in charge of clandestine operations , but the White House rejected the proposal .
As a fallback , officials said , Blair was asserting the right to review CIA missions .
Blair ’s memo appeared to be in response to news last week that he had lost a long - running bureaucratic battle with CIA Director Leon E. Panetta over who has the authority to pick the top U.S. spy representative in other countries .

After months of wrangling , and the intervention of Vice President Joe Biden , the White House opted to preserve an arrangement in which those overseas positions are all held by CIA officers .
In his memo , Blair contended that media reports about the decision were “ incomplete and in places incorrect , ” even while acknowledging that the White House had ruled in the CIA ’s favor .
The CIA has come under severe criticism , including by President Obama , for operations in recent years including its network of secret prisons and the use of waterboarding and other controversial interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects .
Oversight by the director of national intelligence could help ensure that CIA activities are effective and serving U.S. interests , said Mark Lowenthal , a former senior CIA official .
“ The potential problem is if it ’s done heavy - handed , and [ Blair ] starts using this as a way to run operations , ” he said .
“ Then you ’re going to just have another food fight , and the DNI is probably going to lose . ”
Advertisement
Others were more critical of Blair ’s plan .
A congressional official briefed on the matter said it risks “ getting into the weeds when the DNI should be looking at over - arching management issues . ”
The DNI was created five years ago as part of an intelligence reform effort to do away with an arrangement in which the CIA director was responsible for coordinating all of the nation ’s spy services while managing the agency ’s own operations .
“ It seems like the DNI is getting involved in the same things that led the [ CIA director ] to lose focus , ” said the congressional official , who was not authorized to speak officially on the matter .
“ He wants to be the intelligence briefer , wants to go to all the meetings , wants to run chiefs of station and wants to manage covert action . ”

What drives someone to go all out decorating their car ?
Sometimes it ’s a special occasion , sometimes it ’s marketing and sometimes it ’s just for the attention .
We ’re not talking paint jobs and new rims … some folks cover their vehicles with cameras , old tires and even fur .
Check out 13 of the most insanely decorated cars and vehicles .
The Camera Van
Google ai n’t the only ones who can take a picture from any angle while driving down the street .
In fact , The Camera Van did it first .
The Camera Van does n’t have a fancy 360 degree camera mounted to the top , but instead over 2700 cameras all over it .
Photographer Harrod Blank started the project back in 1995 covering his van in dozens of working cameras which eventually became thousands .
The cameras are n’t just about unique camera angles , but pieces of car art that form a cool pattern over the surface of the van , including the top which suitably spells out “ smile . ”

The Phone Car
Transforming a car is n’t always about smiles and fun projects — it ’s about what makes the world go ’round : advertising .
Howard Davis , owner of his phone company Datel Communications , created the phone car to go along with his alter ego / marketing persona Teleman ( who instead of fighting crime combats the injustice of expensive long distance bills ) .
This unrecognizable 1975 Beetle is ( believe it or not ) street legal .
The tinted windshield which looks like a number pad from the outside allows the driver to see clearly .
And of course you ca n’t decorate a car to look like a phone without modding the horn to sound like a telephone ring .
Source
Tirezilla
No one would ever dare cut you off while driving this beast of a car .
Tirezilla , covered with a whole junkyard full of tire scraps makes you feel like the apocalypse is already here when you catch a glimpse of it in your rearview .
Its vicious teeth , deadly spikes and pointy tail really make it look and feel like a living monster that will eat any car that gets in its way .
Tirezilla , designed by art students at University of Kansas scared the judges into submission at the Art Car Show in Nebraska last year .

Bunny Car
They could have slapped some silly pink bunny ears on top of a car and called it a day , but the designers behind the Bunny Car may have actually used some kind of genetic splicing to achieve this hairy automobile .
The Bunny Car is completely covered in fur ( including the windshield wipers and hubcaps ) , has big floppy ears on top and even has whiskers where the grill would be .
If we did n’t know any better we ’d expect this thing to hop down the road .

Post - it Note Car
This may not classify as “ decoration ” per say as it ’s more suitably placed under the “ prank ” category .
The Post - it Note Car was once the boss ’s Jaguar and became an office memo when employees covered with hundreds of colored post - it notes ( presumably on their lunch break ) .
What exactly did Walt do to deserve this ?
Maybe he Jell - O ’d someone ’s stapler .

Peacock Car
If you ca n’t afford the Lamborghini you ’re going to have to come up with another way to get attention on the road .
And if we ’ve learned anything from watching Animal Planet we all know that the Peacock is the animal kingdom ’s biggest attention whore .
The Peacock Car shows off your true colors with tons of colorful feathers , a massive peacock head hood ornament ( compensating much ? ) and huge expanding tail feathers that make sure all eyes are on you .
Source
Moss Car
Unless this car is actually made of moss and runs on hopes and dreams it ’s not as “ green ” as it looks .
Of course being a Beatle it ’s more fuel efficient than a lot of the giant gas guzzlers we see on the road .
And it certainly makes you think about what a beautiful green planet we could have if we all made smarter decisions .
Or maybe it ’s just another crazy looking car that you ’ll forget about by the time you get down to the Shark Truck .
Source
Shark Pick Up Truck
If you do n’t have a pickup because you need to lug around lumber and equipment , then you have one because they ’re badass and manly .
That being the case , why not take it to the next step and decorate your truck like the most menacing animal you can think of ?
Making its way inland to scare pedestrians rather than swimmers , the Shark Pick Up Truck designed by artist Patrick Amiot is the most cold - blooded vehicle since the Hummer .

Great Sphinx Bus
Truly a monument to behold , the Great Sphinx Bus demands attention like no other decorated vehicle .
Modeled after the noseless Great Sphinx of Giza this bus stands out on the road in much the same way the giant monolith must stand out in the middle of the desert .
Why anyone would need such an elaborate bus could only be answered by the ancient Egyptians .
Source
Beach Station Wagon
Forget ordinary wood paneling .
This beach themed Station Wagon is decorated with actual drift wood from the beach … not to mention sand , seashells and other fishy stuff .
Even the back windows get a oceanic update and were replaced with nautical netting .
Good thing it was n’t modeled after the Jersey Shore or else we ’d also be seeing syringes and broken glass all over this car .
Source
Snake Car
If the slicked back hair , high - collared suit and Jersey accent were n’t enough to portray what a slimy guy you are then maybe you should be driving the Snake Car .
If a car covered in snake skin from roof to rims with a matching snakeskin interior was n’t enough for you then Wait !
There ’s more !
The Snake Car is covered in snakes ( all fake we think ? ) and comes with $ 3500 in camera equipment … so you can finally record that commercial for your car dealership / loan shark business .
Source
Political Message Van
A few bumper stickers lets the world know that you ’re opinionated , but if you ’re at the point where you ’re erecting banners on top of your car then no one is listening to your crazy .
From what we can manage to read this pushy political message van is n’t pushing hot button issues like capital punishment ( there ’s another car out there with an electric chair strapped to the top for that topic ) .
This car insists that you know that “ Smoking is healthier than fascism ! ”

Guitar Motorcycle
The Guitarbike can bring a tear to the eye of anyone dreaming to become a traveling musician with a love for the open road .
Possibly the first guitar shaped vehicle , Ray Nelson started it in his garage in San Jose back in 1981 and has since appeared on the Discovery Channel , The Country Music Awards and Ripley ’s Believe it or Not .
He claims that it ’s the only guitar that ’s been driven across the good ol ’ US of A. Source

WASHINGTON  Democratic leaders in the Senate on Wednesday unveiled their proposal for overhauling the health care system , outlining legislation that they said would cover most of the uninsured while reducing the federal budget deficit .
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , said at an evening news conference that the legislation , embodying President Obama ’s signature domestic initiative , would impose new regulations on insurers , extend coverage to 31 million people who currently do not have any and add new benefits to Medicare .
Mr. Reid said the bill , despite a price tag of $ 848 billion over 10 years , would reduce projected budget deficits by $ 130 billion over a decade because the costs would be more than offset by new taxes and fees and by reductions in the growth of Medicare .
Democrats expressed confidence that they would have the votes needed to move forward when the legislation hits its first test in the Senate , probably later this week .
To get past that first procedural hurdle , Mr. Reid will need the votes of all 58 Democratic senators and the two independents aligned with them .

The commercial milk industry is planning to initiate a nationwide marketing campaign on Monday designed to keep chocolate milk in schools .
Soda , candy , and other junk foods have been undergoing criticism recently for contributing to childhood obesity , leading the milk lobby to campaign for support of its sugary milk product , despite limited nutritional benefits .
Touting fears over kids choosing juice or water instead of plain milk when faced with no sweetened milk options , the developers of the " Got Milk ? " campaign plan to appeal to the public to sign a petition in favor of keeping chocolate milk in schools .
This is based on the idea that kids need more milk in order to assure their dietary supply of calcium .
Supporters of chocolate milk 's removal from schools claim that the sugar added to chocolate milk promotes diabetes and obesity , while those that oppose its removal allege that more harm than good will be done by depriving children of a sweetened milk option .
Despite claims that children would begin to boycott beverages in general if they were unable to drink chocolate milk , the Boulder Valley School District in Boulder , Colorado has experienced widespread acceptance of plain milk among children .
The district 's director of nutrition services has been working tirelessly for years to promote better nutrition in schools and lauds the removal of chocolate milk from her district .
Various nutritionists and obesity experts , on the other hand , say that many children are choosing other available sweet beverages anyway and that , at least with chocolate milk , the children are able to receive nutrients found only in milk .
The nutrition profile of commercially processed milk is another issue coming under fire .
Pasteurized , homogenized processed milk is being increasingly recognized as a harmful , toxic substance that serves no practical purpose in benefitting the body .
Raw , whole milk from clean , pasture - raised cows is far different from the dead , milky substance available on most store shelves .
When pasteurized , the beneficial enzymes that aid in digestion are destroyed , as are a great majority of the nutrients , vitamins , and minerals that industry representatives claim are present in their product .
Processed milk is also a contributor to lactose intolerance , allergies , and other diseases , supporting the case for the removal of all processed milk from schools , especially the sweetened kind .
Clever marketing that entices children will not change the fact that processed chocolate milk is unhealthy for children , nor will it change the fact that processed milk in general is bad for children 's health .
Children should be encouraged to choose healthy , whole foods and drinks and to limit their refined sugar intake as much as possible .

Astronaut Randolph Bresnik is a new dad again , after launching into space and taking a spacewalk , all for the first time .
He announced the birth of his daughter , Abigail , on Sunday morning on NASA 's airwaves .
Enlarge NASA via Reuters Spacewalkers Mike Foreman , left , and Randy Bresnik , right , undertook the second spacewalk of Atlantis ' visit to the International Space Station .
U.S. astronaut on spacewalk while child is born CAPE CANAVERAL  Atlantis astronauts have delivered more than 14 tons of spare parts and supplies to the International Space Station over the past week , but this shuttle mission may be best remembered for a 6 - pound , 13 - ounce bundle delivered back on Earth .
After two days of anticipation , shuttle astronaut Randy Bresnik 's wife , Rebecca , gave birth to Abigail Mae Bresnik at 11:04 p.m. Saturday in Houston .
" Momma and baby are doing very well , " Bresnik , a 42 - year - old Marine test pilot and mission specialist , radioed Sunday morning to NASA 's Mission Control Center .
" On behalf of the planet Earth ground team , please accept our heartfelt congratulations , " replied Stan Love , an astronaut communicating with the crew from Houston .
Bresnik is scheduled to conduct a six - hour spacewalk today , his second in three days and the last planned during Atlantis ' 11 - day mission .
He kept tabs on Rebecca 's labor after his first spacewalk Saturday , and she gave him the good news by phone after he awoke early Sunday .
The morning song played for the crew , selected by family members , also delivered the message .
MISSION : Astronauts step out on first spacewalk " There 's two things I know for sure :
She was sent here from heaven and she 's daddy 's little girl , " began the lyrics to singer Bob Carlisle 's Butterfly Kisses .
Bresnik became the second U.S. astronaut to be in orbit for the birth of a child .
Space station flight engineer Mike Fincke was the first in 2004 .
A videoconference and photos uplinked Sunday provided the proud father his first opportunity to see Abigail , while orbiting 220 miles above Earth .
In a video shot by crewmates , Bresnik said he was " amazed and awed " by the views his first spacewalk afforded , which were second only to seeing his wife for the first time .
" I think once I get to see the pictures today of our new daughter , ( spacewalking ) is going to have to take third place , " he said .
Atlantis crewmates Leland Melvin and Bobby Satcher , who is Bresnik 's spacewalking partner today , offered celebratory fist bumps .
The baby 's birth combined with the 11 - day shuttle mission cap a whirlwind year for the family .
This time a year ago , they were adopting son Wyatt , now 3 , from Ukraine .
" We 've witnessed the miracle of adoption and the miracle of childbirth all in one year , " the astronaut said in a pre-launch NASA interview broadcast Sunday .
" We 're just amazingly blessed . "
Doctors had told Rebecca Bresnik , a NASA lawyer , that she likely would not be able to have children .
Rebecca and Randy Bresnik said the mission 's timing was unfortunate but out of their control .
Many military families face the same challenge , they said .
" I 'm just really excited for him and excited for us , " Rebecca Bresnik said .
Atlantis and six astronauts blasted off from Kennedy Space Center a week ago today , starting an 11 - day voyage to the International Space Station .
The Atlantis crew will install 27,000 pounds of spare parts including two steering gyroscopes , a group of tanks and pumps for the station 's cooling system and a hand for a robotic arm .
Atlantis is scheduled to return to Florida on Friday .
Randy Bresnik said he hopes Atlantis commander Charlie " Scorch " Hobaugh guides the shuttle to a safe landing so he can return home " as soon as possible . "
" I will look forward to that landing , and Scorch making it nice and safe , probably more than anybody has in the history of the space shuttle program , " he said .

ANNOUNCE : parallel -2.0.0.0
I 've just uploaded parallel - 2.0.0.0 to Hackage .
If you 're using Strategies at all , I 'd advise updating to this version of the parallel package .
It 's not completely API compatible , but if you 're just using the supplied Strategies such as parList , the changes should be relatively minor .
The Haddock docs include a full description of the changes , reproduced below .
Haddock docs are also here , until Hackage catches up : http://www.haskell.org/~simonmar/parallel/index.html
The Strategy - using programs I 've tried so far go faster .
Enjoy !
Cheers , Simon
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.x
The original Strategies design is described in < http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~dsg/gph/papers/html/Strategies/strategies.html> and the code was written by Phil Trinder , Hans - Wolfgang Loidl , Kevin Hammond et al. Version 2.x
Later , during work on the shared - memory implementation of parallelism in GHC , we discovered that the original formulation of Strategies had some problems , in particular it lead to space leaks and difficulties expressing speculative parallelism .
Details are in the paper \ " Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell \ " < http://www.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/multicore-ghc.pdf>.
This module has been rewritten in version 2 .
The main change is to the ' Strategy a ' type synonym , which was previously @a ->
Done@ and is now @a -> a at .
This change helps to fix the space leak described in \ " Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell\ " .
The problem is that the runtime will currently retain the memory referenced by all sparks , until they are evaluated .
Hence , we must arrange to evaluate all the sparks eventually , just in case they are n't evaluated in parallel , so that they do n't cause a space leak .
This is why we must return a \ " new\ " value after applying a ' Strategy ' , so that the application can evaluate each spark created by the ' Strategy ' .
The simple rule is this : you / must / use the result of applying a ' Strategy ' if the strategy creates parallel sparks , and you should probably discard the the original value .
If you do n't do this , currently it may result in a space leak .
In the future ( GHC 6.14 ) , it will probably result in lost parallelism instead , as we plan to change GHC so that unreferenced sparks are discarded rather than retained ( we can't make this change until most code is switched over to this new version of Strategies , because code using the old verison of Strategies would be broken by the change in policy ) .
The other changes in version 2.x are : * Strategies can now be defined using a convenient Applicative type Eval .
e.g. parList s = unEval $ traverse ( Par . s ) * ' parList ' has been generalised to ' parTraverse ' , which works on any ' Traversable ' type .
* ' parList ' and ' parBuffer ' have versions specialised to ' rwhnf ' , and there are transformation rules that automatically translate e.g. @parList rwnhf@ into a call to the optimised version .
* ' NFData ' is deprecated ; please use the @DeepSeq@ class in the @deepseq@ package instead .
Note that since the ' Strategy ' type changed , ' rnf ' is no longer a ' Strategy ' : use ' rdeepseq ' instead .
Louisa Watts , pictured with son Derek , has lived in the home for four years
The family of a 106 - year - old woman has lost its campaign to keep her in a Wolverhampton care home , which the council wanted to close to save money .
Louisa Watts 's family had been fighting to keep Underhill House open and took out an injunction against Wolverhampton City Council to prevent its closure .
She moved into the home four years ago and previously said she was happy there and would be very upset to leave .
The injunction was overturned earlier by the Court of Appeal .
' No harm '
The council said work would resume immediately to close the home and it was working with the remaining nine residents to help them make alternative arrangements .
Mrs Watts 's son Derek said he was " angry " and " disappointed " .
If there were any firm findings that moving Mrs Watts would shorten her life the decision would be quite different .
Lord Justice Sedley
When his mother first moved in she socialised with other residents and went to bingo and fish and chip suppers , but had increasingly become more infirm and deaf , he said .
In passing judgement Lord Justice Sedley said provided the move from Bushbury , Wolverhampton , was properly managed it should " not do her any appreciable harm . "
He added : " If there were any firm findings that moving Mrs Watts would shorten her life the decision would be quite different . "
He told the family 's solicitor Yvonne Hossack there were no grounds for an appeal , although he recognised that Mrs Watts was " entitled to the full benefit of every day that still remains to her . "
' Doing well '
Mrs Watts , a retired hospital cleaner and widow , moved to the home when her daughter Jean Bolas died aged 78 .
The council took the decision in April to close the 40 - year - old home , which it said required £ 2 m investment to help it meet current care standards .
It said the uncertainty caused by the legal action had been " unsettling " for residents and staff and it hoped the Court Of Appeal 's decision would help everyone move forward .
Sarah Norman , Wolverhampton City Council 's director for adults and community said : " We have already helped nine residents to move out of Underhill House and they are doing well in their new accommodation . "

Why has the Great War of 1914 - 18 remained so central to our lives ?
The Second World War produced its crops of names , easy to remember , like punctuation marks : Dunkirk , the fall of France , the Battle of Britain , el - Alamein , Stalingrad , Normandy , Dresden , Hiroshima .
But somehow those earlier 1914 - 18 slaughters , their geographical location so scarred into our historical conscience , are wounds that will not close .
Or wounds whose terrible consequences cannot be erased .
Ypres , Verdun , the Somme have a doom - like quality that have fully retained their semantic origins .
The very name of the Somme has an assonance which still fills us with despair .
Just as Passchendaele seems to include the very word " passion " in English and French , the Somme is like " sombre " , the funereal mood of the graveyard .
Here , for example , is Frederic Manning 's truly sinister account of British troops moving up to the Somme at night , marching through a tiny French village , to the sadness and consternation of the few French men and women still awake :
Doors suddenly opened and light fell through the doorways , and voices asked the soldiers where they were going .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Somme ! Somme ! " they shouted , as though it were a challenge .
" Ah , no bon ! " came the kindly , pitying voices in reply ...
And that was an enemy to them , that little touch of gentleness and kindliness ; it struck them with a hand harsher than death's , and they sang louder , seeing only the white road before them .
Somme .
Somme .
The name speaks of sacrifice on a monstrous , epic scale , the destruction of youth .
Even today , semantics and linguistics have maintained the relationship of these men with us .
Their language , their expressions , their horror – the metaphors they use – are contemporary .
They are as if of now .
They are our people , yours and mine .
The soldier - poet Edmund Blunden , writing 96 years ago , sounds equally contemporary :
One morning , dark and liquid and wild , Colonel Harrison and a number of us went off in a lorry to reconnoitre in Ypres proper , and to visit the trenches we were to hold .
The sad Salient lay under a heavy silence , broken here and there by the ponderous muffled thump of trench mortar shells round the line .
We passed big houses , one or two , glimmering whitely , life in death ; we found light come by the time that we passed the famous Asylum , a red ruin with some buildings and ornaments still surviving over its doorway ...
There was in the town itself the same strange silence , and the staring pallor of the streets in that daybreak was unlike anything I had known .
The Middle Ages had here contrived to lurk , and this was their torture at last .
We all felt this , as the tattered picture swung by like accidents of vision ; and when we got out of the lorry by the Menin Gate ( that unlovely hiatus ) we scarcely seemed awake and aware .
Note how Blunden almost tricks us into understanding .
The " sad Salient " , the ruined houses " glimmering whitely " – like the " white road " stretching out before the doomed British soldiers in Manning 's book – the " staring pallor " of the streets , the " accidents of vision " , the " unlovely hiatus " .
This is literature sharpened by fear and weariness .
It seems extraordinary today that a woman also wrote from the Western Front – under fire .
Margot Asquith , wife of British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith , received permission to visit the Ypres front line in 1914 .
Few even realise that a woman did record events there at this time .
But here is her sad and painful description of the graves cluttering the Ypres cemetery and of the German bombardment of the city :
The Ypres cemetery will haunt me forever .
No hospital of wounded or dying men could have given me a greater insight into the waste of War than that dripping gaunt and crowded churchyard .
There were broken bits of wood stuck in the grass at the head of hundreds of huddled graves , with English names scrawled upon them in pencil .
Where the names had been washed off , forage - caps were hanging , and they were all placed one against the other as closely as possible .
I saw a Tommy digging , and said : " Who is that grave for ? "
He answered without stopping or looking at me : " For the next . " ...
Thin white lines of smoke , like poplars in a row , stood out against the horizon and I saw the flash of every German gun .
My companions said that if the shells had been coming our way they would have gone over our heads ; the German troops , he explained , must have come on unknown to them in the night , and he added he did not think that either the Belgians , the British , or the French knew at all what they were up to .
So far as I can discover , this passage is the first indication in prose during the Great War – the very first hint – that chaos rather than order might decide the coming bloodbath .
And it was a non-military writer – a woman – who understood the significance of this .
But again , we have that wonderful metaphor – from the heart of literary tradition of the shell explosions standing " like poplars in a row " .
Interestingly , Guillaume Apollinaire , the French poet and Great War " poilu " , found a strangely similar metaphor when he described shellfire near Nîmes four months later , in January of 1915 :

Et puis mon souvenir s'eteindrait comme meurt
Un obus eclatent sur le front de l'armee
Un bel obus semblable aux mimosas en fleur
( And then my memory would fade
As a shell blooms , bursting over the front line , .........
Magnificent , like mimosa in bloom . )
Yet I find , with the passing years , that the poetry of the Great War no longer seizes hold of me in the same way as the prose .
Perhaps we have overused the poetry of Rupert Brooke and Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen .
Perhaps , like the first notes of Beethoven 's Fifth or Handel 's Water Music , I have read too many times of the corner of a foreign field that is forever England , of how " Everyone suddenly burst out singing " , of the gas victim with the " froth - corrupted lungs " .
It is as if the poetry has been used up , to await another generation which might read it with freshness .
I say " might " read it .
I could say the same of the prose .
My father , Bill Fisk – much older than my mother – was himself a soldier in the Great War .
Every year , he would take me around the battlefields of that war , to the Somme , to Ypres and Verdun .
He first brought me to Ypres in 1956 , when I was just 10 years old .
He was filled with patriotism mixed with a kind of bleak but soldierly sorrow when he toured the cemeteries .
In later years , when Bill understood the mendacity of General Haig and read in silence the growing number of books about those soldiers who had been put before the firing squad , his mood changed .
Once , when he was very old and recovering from a cancer operation , I asked him the question that historians have still not been able to answer .
What on earth was the Great War about ?
" All it was , Fellah , " he replied to me , " was just one great waste . "
The very words of Margot Asquith .
I understood him .
As a Middle East Correspondent , I have covered many wars .
One of them was the eight - year war between Iran and Iraq , a titanic conflict of First World War proportions , its battles fought not only in the deserts beneath a sun that burned like a sword – an expression used by Lawrence of Arabia – but amid the glutinous muck of water and earth which I once described in a dispatch as " Somme - like mud " .
Almost a million and a half men died there .
Looking back now , I see how even my own reports from that awful war reflect the language of the Great War , albeit I could never reach the passion of language – and thankfully never share the terror and pain – of those soldiers .
And when I look back as a journalist at my own reports of those terrible battles , the influence of the 1914 - 18 war obviously infected my own language .
In the summer of 1985 , the Iranian army and Revolutionary Guards had stormed across the Shatt al - Arab river – once seized by British troops in 1915 and then again in 2003 – and captured the Iraqi peninsula of Fao .
They had inflicted great slaughter on the Iraqis whose dead soldiers lay in the mud , newly killed , around us :
I see another body in a gun pit , a young man in the foetal position curled up like a child , already blackening with death but with a wedding ring on his finger .
I am mesmerised by the ring .
On this hot , golden morning , it glitters and sparkles with freshness and life .
He has black hair and is around 25 years old .
Or should that be " was " ?
Do we stop the clock when death surprises us ?
Do we say , as Binyon wrote , that " they shall grow not old , as we that are left grow old " ?
Age may not weary them nor the years condemn , but their humanity is quickly taken from their remains by the swiftness of corruption and the jolly old sun .
I look again at the ring .
An arranged marriage or a love match ?
Where was he from , this soldier - corpse ? ...
And his wife ?
He could not be more than three days dead .
Somewhere to the north of us , his wife is waking the children , making breakfast , glancing at her husband 's photograph on the wall , unaware that she is already a widow and that her husband 's wedding ring , so bright with love for her on this glorious morning , embraces a dead finger .
It 's not just the quotation from Binyon 's famous spiritual resurrection for the dead that crept into my report more than two decades ago The " jolly old sun " , I suspect , was a memory – out there in the desert in 1985 – of Wilfred Owen 's poem Futility .
" Move him into the sun , " Owen writes of a dead soldier 's corpse .
" If anything might raise him now / The kind old sun will know . "
This was the language of the soldiers of the Great War touching my own report , albeit unconsciously at the time , a reporter trying to chronicle another Great War .
No wonder my father called his conflict " just one great waste " .
Which was answer of a kind .
Yet even Wyndham Lewis , the master of Vorticist art who became a soldier at Ypres , found it difficult to explain what the Great War represented for him , albeit that his attempts to do so were of a remarkable eloquence .
The war , he said , was " such a tremendous landmark that locally it imposes itself upon our computations of time like the birth of Christ .
We say ' pre - war ' and ' post - war ' , rather as we say BC or AD . "
His autobiography , he wrote , was :
... about a little group of people crossing a bridge .
The bridge is red , the people are red , the sky is red .
Of course the bridge is symbolic .
The bridge stands for something else .
The bridge , you see , is the war .
Upon one side of the bridge is a quite different landscape to what meets the eye upon the other side , as if the stream spanned by the bridge separated a tropic from a polar landscape .
And the principal figure among those crossing this little bridge – that is me – does not know that he is crossing anything , from one world into another .
Indeed , everybody else seems to know it except him .
He does not see the cold stream .
He scarcely sees his companions .
Yet he is not a sleepwalker : he has his eye fixed upon a small red bird , upon a red bough , within a large red tree .
Rather pretty , is n't it ?
When he comes to reflect upon the war afterwards , few would disagree with Lewis ' conclusions :
The war went on far too long , or too long for a " totalitarian " ( sic ) war , as it would now be called .
It was too vast for its meaning , like a giant with the brain of a midge .
Its epic proportions were grotesquely out of scale , seeing what it was fought to settle .
It was far too indecisive .
It settled nothing , as it meant nothing .
Indeed , it was impossible to escape the feeling that it was not meant to settle anything – that could have any meaning , or be of any advantage , to the general run of men .
Here , I think , we face the truth which Bill Fisk tried to confront ; that the war in which he fought was , finally , for him , devoid of meaning .
He was lucky to have served on the Western Front for only three - and - a - half months – he had been delayed by soldiering in Ireland following the 1916 Rising , an episode which may well have saved his life ( and thus , in a way , my own ) – but he keenly felt the lack of human purpose which the Great War represented .
In his 50s , when I was still a small boy , he would patiently explain to me that he had gone to fight for " little Belgium " – little Catholic Belgium which had been so cruelly overrun in 1914 ( all but the tiny bit around Ypres , of course ) by the men he collectively referred to as " the Hun " or – in his postcards home to his parents in Birkenhead – " the Bosche " ( sic ) .
He talked of German atrocities in the villages around Louvain and in the city itself ; war crimes which we now know the Germans actually did commit in 1914 .
My father , needless to say , regarded the Irish whom he was sent to suppress as cowards and traitors , while the Irish patriots who fought against the British in Dublin later came to see their own brothers who were fighting in British uniform at Ypres and on the Somme as traitors of a worse kind .
The nationalist tragedies and civil conflicts set off by the Great War – not least in Germany itself – were to reverberate for decades to come .
In all , 35,000 Irishmen are estimated to have been killed in the 1914 - 18 war .
Almost 30 years ago , I travelled to Ypres with a young Irishwoman and she stood with me beneath the Menin Gate and stared in puzzlement at the 54,896 names of men who fought in my father 's uniform but whose bodies were never found .
Looking at all these names , the young woman was moved by how many of them were Irish .
" Why , in God 's name , " she asked , " was a boy from the Station House , Tralee , dying here in the mud of Flanders ? "
After a few minutes , an elderly man approached , holding a visitor 's book .
He asked if she would like to sign it .
This was long before Ireland became a self - confident nation within the European Union , able to face up to the sacrifice its pre-independence soldiers made in British uniform .
So my friend looked at the British army 's insignia on the memorial book with considerable distaste .
The Crown glimmered on the cover in the evening light .
They were about to play " The Last Post " .
There was not much time to decide .
But my friend could not forget the young man from Tralee .
She was facing history , which was not as easy and comforting and comprehensible for her as it can be for those of us who always consider ourselves the winners of wars .
In the end , she wrote in the book , in Irish " do thiorta beaga " – which means : " for little countries " .
How carefully she eased the dead Irish soldier 's desire to help little Belgium – my father 's reason for going to war – into the memory of the tragedy of another little country , how she was able to conflate Ireland into Flanders without losing the integrity of her own feelings .
After the Great War , German veterans responded in far more disturbing ways than Wyndham Lewis .
Here , for instance , is Ernst Jünger 's voice at the end of his First World War epic The Storm of Steel :
Today we cannot understand the martyrs who threw themselves into the arena in a transport that lifted them even before their deaths beyond humanity , beyond every phase of pain and fear .
Their faith no longer exercises a compelling force .
When once it is no longer possible to understand how a man gives his life to a country – and the time will come – then all is over with that faith also , and the idea of the Fatherland is dead ; and then , perhaps , we shall be envied , as we envy the saints their inward and irresistible strength .
This , I should add , is the same Jünger who deified the Free Corps massacres of Communists and Sparticists in Munich in 1919 by identifying each member of the Free Corps as " the New Man , the storm soldier , the elite of Mitteleuropa , a completely new race , cunning , strong and purposeful .
New forms must be moulded with blood , and power must be seized with a hard fist . "
Thus the Great War , in the words of its veterans , either gave their lives a sense of hopelessness , a vacuum of meaning , an experience that would forever encourage them to avoid war ; or , in the case of men like Jünger , a new kind of purpose , forged in blood and pain , that would necessitate yet another war in order to prove its worth .
No wonder that in 1919 , a great French leader , Clemenceau , predicted that the Versailles Treaty was merely a 20 - year ceasefire .
His timing was absolutely correct .
Bill Fisk refused to carry out an order to execute a fellow soldier , charged with desertion and murder .
But he had less time for those who simply refused to fight or serve in the war : conscientious objectors – my father used to call them " conchies " .
After all , after dozens of postcards from his old Birkenhead school pals – all of which I have , all of whom were killed in the 1914 - 18 War – Bill headed off to Ireland and then to do his duty in the Third Battle of the Somme .
He was n't interested in men who would n't fight for their country .
He gave me A E W Mason 's The Four Feathers in which the hero leaves his regiment before the Sudanese campaign and receives three white feathers from his friends and one from his fiancée .
Bill Fisk was n't trying to teach me lessons about cowardice .
He just did n't want his son to be a D H Lawrence , writing poetry while his compatriots died in the mud for his privilege to do so .
" Tell me , Fellah , " Bill would say to me .
" If the Nazis were coming for your Mum and Dad , would n't you fight for them ? "
Wyndham Lewis , reflecting on his desire to remain with his fellow soldiers at the front , found himself " less inclined to immolate himself in defence of Mayfair " , being " only concerned with the idea of deserting my companions in misfortune . "
He recalled Lytton Strachey before one of the conscientious objection tribunal 's judges , a man whose words prefigured my father 's own argument :
" What , " sternly asked one of the judges , " would you do Mr Strachey , if you discovered a German preparing to outrage your sister ? " ... the " bloomsberries " all exempted themselves , in one way or another .
Yet they had money and we had n't ultimately it was to keep them fat and prosperous ... that other people were to risk their lives .
Then there were the tales of how a certain famous artist , of military age and militant bearing , would sit in the Café Royal and , addressing an admiring group back from the Front , would exclaim : " We are the civilisation for which you are fighting ! "
Yet who could disagree – after the Great War , if not during its immense sacrifice – that the " rules of war " are largely a nonsense , an invention to transform mass murder into mass sacrifice .
Tolstoy 's devastating critique of Napoleon 's invasion of Russia must be invoked here , because he wrote that :
War began , that is , an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature .
Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes , frauds , treacheries , thefts incendiarisms and murders , as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world , but which those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes .
Again , through translation , Tolstoy too speaks our language .
But what is happening to our language ?
Our generation – those of us , like the soldiers of the Great War , who lived in the age of handwriting and typewriters – maintained the semantics of those who lived before us .
For us , those soldiers of the First World War still speak to us as we might speak .
Cast back in time , we might still visit the Ypres of 1915 or 1917 and walk up to those soldiers and chat to them and understand every word they say to us .
We understand , through instinct , the meaning of Blunden 's " houses whitely glimmering " , Apollinaire 's metaphor of " mimosa in bloom " , Asquith 's " poplars in a row " .
But I fear that we are permitting our wondrous technology , our computers , to change our language .
Ironically , I worry that the words of those who cry out to us from the first war of industrial technology will be erased from our comprehension by the industrial technology of the email , the SMS , the blog , Twitter .
I use none of these .
But I do notice , when I am sent hard copies of emails – even when they are quoting poetry or citing passages of prose – that they are almost always ungrammatical , misspelled , abbreviated .
There has been no revision .
Owen and Sassoon were constantly revising their work .
All authors should do the same .
But speed and brevity have overtaken the precision and discipline of writing .
In a world where even the names of our towns can lose their apostrophes , how can we preserve our contact with the past ?
True , the distortion of language is not a solely English sin .
In the largely immigrant suburbs of Paris , there has come into existence an " argot " in which words are inverted , spelled backwards in a conscious rejection of French culture .
Yet this is a code , as simple to unscramble as an artillery coordinate on the Western Front , or a directive to a 1940 Battle of Britain pilot to vector on enemy aircraft at " Angels Five " ( 5,000 ft ) .
And yes , I can see how the British soldier 's mis-transliteration of " Wipers " for Ypres , of " Charley Roy " for Charleroi , might be given an SMS context .
But this was surely out of weird affection rather than error .
It is the sheer , almost wilful failure to " manage " language rather than to " control " it , which is what we are allowing our mobile phones and blackberries to do .
We all faced school examinations which demanded answers " in not more than 400 words " .
But when told how many characters – how many alphabetical letters – we may use in a tweet , we are losing our freedom of expression .
Increasingly , for example , I am being sent hard - copy messages from which most verbs have been deleted .
And I am reminded of a lunch I enjoyed in Dublin 30 years ago with John Dillon , an opposition pro-British member of the Irish parliament , who opposed Ireland 's policy of neutrality in the Second World War but who – long before the war – had supported the Irish equivalent of the Nazi Brownshirts , led by a former police commissioner called Eoin O'Duffy .
Dillon described to me the moment he realised that O'Duffy was a dangerous man :
One day in West Cork , I was standing behind him on a balcony when he addressed a rally of several thousand young Blueshirts .
He was speaking very rapidly .
It dawned on me that they were hanging on his words in a kind of obsessed way and I suddenly realised that he was speaking without verbs .
It had no discernable meaning ... I remembered Hitler .
The German Great War veteran Jünger , I think , might have approved of this verb - less world , for it cuts us off not only from reality but from our shared past .
How in future will we interpret the glorious , fearful description of Ypres that Blunden wrote after the Great War ? :
Over the sepulchral city , aeroplanes flew and fought in the cold winter sun .
Sentries blew their whistles from broken archways ; the brass shell - cases used for gas gongs gleamed with a meaning beside them ; and all of a sudden flights of shells came sliding into the town .
Those words will have to struggle for their place in a world where libraries of books have been abandoned for what our education authorities call " language tools " , screens rather than pages , " surfing " rather than deep reading .
Will we , in another generation , have to " translate " Blunden and Graves into a new computerised language , just as today most of us need translations to understand Chaucer 's Middle English ?
Are the words of the Great War soldiers going to sound like Beowolf in Old English , an epic of war which now needs interpretation ?
Those dead battalions will have to fight to be heard .
Will we let them ?
Can they remain as imperishable as we would wish , or is their language to be as tattered as the paper upon which it was once written ?
Years ago , I found in Belfast a sad memento of the Somme , the work of a Northern Ireland Protestant railwayman who fought in the Ulster Division and spent some of his time in the trenches of the Western Front sticking newspaper clippings into his old railway notebook , patriotic poetry and photographs of guns and armies and political cartoons of a brutal Kaiser threatening the virgin Belgium .
His old book is falling to pieces now , its cover flaking off from the damp of those trenches long ago , its pages as fragile as old bone .
But one article this distant soldier scissored from the paper stands out .
It 's a report on the execution of Nurse Edith Cavell , shot by a German firing squad in Brussels on 12 October 1915 , for helping up to 200 Allied soldiers escape from occupied Belgium .
The report – the anonymous Belfast soldier left no indication of the newspaper in which it was printed – is remarkable for its lack of emotion , and records Cavell 's last words , as they were recorded at the time by the Rev H S T Gahan , the British chaplain in Brussels .
We all know the four words chiselled onto Cavell 's monument near Trafalgar Square in London : " Patriotism is not enough . "
But these are merely a soundbite , an apparently pugnacious response to her killers , the SMS version of the truth .
So here , according to the report in this old soldier 's book from the trenches , is what she really said , in full and in context :
I have no fear nor shrinking .
I have seen death so often that it is not strange or fearful to me .
I thank God for this 10 weeks ' quiet .
Life has always been hurried and full of difficulty .
This time of rest has been a great mercy .
They have all been very kind to me here .
But this I would say , standing in view of God and eternity , I realise that patriotism is not enough .
I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone .
It 's the death of an American icon , a working - class woman who stood up for her rights and unionized her workplace .
And would n't you know it ?
She fought the mills , but she could n't make her insurance company do the decent thing until it was too late :
The woman whose life inspired the 1979 film Norma Rae has died of cancer after struggling with her health insurance company , which had delayed her treatment .
Crystal Lee Sutton was 68 .
She had struggled for several years with meningioma , a form of brain cancer .
She became a hero to the labor movement in the 1970s , when she took on her employer , a North Carolina textile plant , and unionized the factory floor .
Her story became famous nationwide in 1975 after New York Times reporter Hank Leiferman wrote Crystal Lee : A Woman of Inheritance .
In 1979 , her story was turned into the movie Norma Rae , a thinly - veiled fictional adaptation of Sutton ’s struggle to unionize the J.P. Stevens plant in Roanoke Rapids , North Carolina .
Sally Field won an Oscar for her portrayal of the character inspired by Sutton .
As Daily Kos blogger hissyspit points out , last year Sutton gave an interview to the press where she described a struggle with her health insurer over treatment .
The Times - News in Burlington , North Carolina , wrote in 2008 :
[ Sutton ] went two months without possible life - saving medications because her insurance would n’t cover it , another example of abusing the working poor , she said .
“ How in the world can it take so long to find out ( whether they would cover the medicine or not ) when it could be a matter of life or death , ” she said .
“ It is almost like , in a way , committing murder . ”
She eventually received the medication , but the cancer is taking a toll on her strong will and solid frame .
In 2008 , the North Carolina branch of the AFL - CIO urged supporters to donate money to Sutton ’s medical fund .
On its Web site , the union had stated that “ after initially being denied coverage by her insurance company for life saving treatment , Sutton is now on drug and chemo therapies and has undergone two surgeries . ”
In its obituary the Greensboro News - Record describes her now - legendary struggle to unionize the J.P. Stevens plant :
Britain's role in the torture of its own citizens in Pakistan is condemned today by one of the world 's leading human rights organisations as being cruel , counter - productive and in clear breach of international law .
In a damning report , published after an investigation spanning more than a year , Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) says the government finds itself in a " legally , morally and politically invidious position " through complicity in torture , and warns its moral legitimacy could be undermined .
The report by the New York - based NGO – entitled Cruel Britannia : British Complicity in the Torture and Ill - treatment of Terror Suspects in Pakistan – corroborates many of the findings of the Guardian 's own investigation into the mistreatment of people held during British - led counter - terrorism operations .
Furthermore , researchers from HRW have spoken to Pakistani intelligence agents involved in torture who say their British counterparts knew how they were mistreating young British terrorism suspects .
These agents said British officials were " breathing down their necks for information " while they were torturing one young medical student from London ; and that British intelligence officers were " grateful " they were " using all means possible " to extract information from a man from Luton who was being beaten , whipped , deprived of sleep and threatened with an electric drill .
The report adds that British involvement in the unlawful activities of Pakistani intelligence agents has interfered with attempts to prosecute terrorism suspects in UK courts .
It quotes a British intelligence source as saying one of the alleged masterminds of the 2006 airline plot , Rashid Rauf , was badly tortured in Pakistan , and that this had been a disaster that made any successful prosecution in Britain most unlikely .
HRW says that under international law the British government has no option but to investigate , prosecute and punish those who have been complicit in torture , as well as those responsible higher up the chain of command .
" The Convention against Torture requires states to reinforce the prohibition against torture through legislative , administrative , judicial and other measures , " the report says .
" States are to ensure that all acts of torture are offenses under its criminal law , including complicity or participation in torture .
International law places an obligation on states to prevent , investigate , prosecute and punish torture and other ill - treatment .
The obligation to prosecute torture includes those who are complicit as well as to those who directly participate in torture , as well as those responsible in the chain of command .
A state is obligated to take necessary measures to establish its jurisdiction over acts of torture when the alleged offender is a national of that state or when the victim is a national and the state considers it appropriate . "
Failure to do this , it adds , means the government 's core values are being " undermined by the official whitewash surrounding the complicity of UK intelligence and security agencies in torture in Pakistan , with ministers repeatedly rejecting calls for an independent judicial inquiry from cross-party parliamentary committees and human rights non-governmental organizations alike " .
The Guardian reported earlier this year that an official policy , devised to govern British intelligence officers while interrogating people held overseas , resulted in people being tortured , and that Tony Blair , when prime minister , was aware of the existence of this policy .
The Guardian has repeatedly asked Blair about any role he played in approving the policy , whether he knew it led to people being tortured , whether he personally authorised interrogations that took place in Guantánamo and Afghanistan as well as Pakistan , and whether he made any effort to change the policy .
Blair 's spokesman responded by saying : " It is completely untrue that Mr Blair has ever authorised the use of torture .
He is opposed to it in all circumstances .
Neither has he ever been complicit in the use of torture . "
When the Guardian pointed out to Blair that it had not suggested he had authorised the use of torture – as opposed to asking him whether he had authorised a policy that led to people being tortured – and that his spokesman had not answered the questions asked , his spokesman replied : " Tony Blair does not condone torture , has never authorised it nor colluded in it .
He continues to think our security services have done and continue to do a crucial and very good job . "
In today 's report , HRW asserts that " UK complicity is clear " because :
• It is inconceivable that the UK government was unaware of the systematic use of torture in Pakistan .
• UK officials engaged in acts that virtually required they knew about the use of torture in specific cases .
• UK officials supplied questions and lines of inquiry to Pakistan intelligence sources in cases in which detainees were tortured .
Officials from two Pakistani intelligence agencies , Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and the Intelligence Bureau ( IB ) , k told HRW that British officials were well aware of how they had mistreated British terrorism suspects .
An IB official involved in the interrogation in Karachi in August 2005 of the medical student from London is quoted as saying : " I do not know if the British knew we had given him a good thrashing and ' the treatment ' .
But they know perfectly well we do not garland terrorism suspects nor honour them .
We do what we do and it 's not pretty .
And with them breathing down our necks for information from Runnymede [ the British Deputy High Commission in Karachi is known as Runnymede Estate ] and the ISI eager to take over our turf and our suspect , we would naturally be keen to produce results .
Results are not produced by having chats with the suspect . "
This man was questioned by British intelligence officers after being tortured .
He was eventually released without charge and is now practising medicine in the south of England .
He remains deeply traumatised .
A Pakistani official involved in the torture of Zeeshan Siddiqui , also from London , told HRW that an account Siddiqui gave of being beaten , drugged and forcibly catheterised before being questioned by British intelligence officers – while still in a traumatised state – was " essentially accurate " and part of " standard practices " .
The official said Siddiqui was detained at the request of MI6 , whose officers were aware that he was being processed in the " traditional way " .
He said the British were effectively interrogating Siddiqui while the IB processed him .
He added that British emotions were running high at the time .
Siddiqui was also released without charge and subjected to a control order on his return to the UK .
He has since absconded .
Officials from a number of Pakistani agencies involved in the detention and torture of Rangzieb Ahmed , from Rochdale , in 2006 , have confirmed to HRW the overall authenticity of his claims .
Ahmed says he was beaten and whipped , and three fingernails were ripped from his left hand after MI5 and Greater Manchester police drew up questions that were put to him by his torturers .
HRW reports that Pakistani officials say British intelligence services were aware of his detention and treatment at all times .
HRW says Pakistani intelligence officers also confirmed the account of torture given by Salahuddin Amin , from Luton , who says he was beaten , whipped , deprived of sleep and threatened with an electric drill .
He was questioned 11 times by MI5 officers during 10 months in ISI custody .
On deportation to the UK , an Old Bailey judge ruled that Amin 's mistreatment had been physically oppressive but fell short of torture .
However , Pakistani intelligence officers told Human Rights Watch Amin 's account was essentially accurate .
The report says : " These sources said that Amin 's was a ' high pressure ' case and that the UK and US governments ' desire for information from him was ' insatiable ' .
The sources added that both governments ' agents who were ' party ' to Amin 's detention were ' perfectly aware that we were using all means possible to extract information from him and were grateful that we were doing so ' " .
Ahmed and Amin were both prosecuted for terrorism offences after being deported to the UK and are both now serving life .
Last month Jonathan Evans , the director - general of MI5 , defended the organisation 's co-operation with intelligence agencies known to use torture , saying it had helped thwart many terrorist attacks after 9/11 and had saved British lives .
He said in a speech : " In my view we would have been derelict in our duty if we had not worked , circumspectly , with overseas liaisons who were in a position to provide intelligence that could safeguard this country from attack .
Were we to refuse to deal with them , accepting that in so doing we would be cutting off a potentially vital source of information that would prevent attacks in the west ? "
The HRW report says that as long as the government asserts its duty to act upon intelligence extracted under torture if to do so may save lives , it must proactively and strenuously intervene to prevent mistreatment by friendly intelligence agencies .
" In countries like Pakistan where there is a high likelihood of torture taking place , the UK should take special steps to prevent torture and to avoid being placed in the legally , morally and politically invidious position the UK government now finds itself . "
A Foreign Office spokesperson said : " The government rejects in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that a policy of complicity in torture has been in place .
The report 's allegations are not new and we have responded to them in parliament .
We have taken a leading role in international efforts to eradicate torture .
There is no truth in suggestions that the Security and Intelligence Services operate without control or oversight .
There is no truth in the more serious suggestion that it is our policy to collude in , solicit , or even directly participate in abuses of prisoners .
Nor is it true that alleged wrong - doing is covered up . "
The spokesperson also maintained that some of the cases detailed by HRW had been considered and rejected by the UK courts .
HRW 's recommendations
The British government should :
• Order a full and independent public inquiry with subpoena powers to establish whether British security services have been complicit in torture or other ill - treatment in Pakistan and elsewhere .
• Adopt measures to address the criticism of the government 's counter - terrorism policy , including in reports by the parliamentary joint human rights committee and the House of Commons Foreign affairs committee , so as to ensure that British policy and practices on counterterrorism meet the UK 's international obligations regarding torture or other ill - treatment .
• Investigate allegations of complicity by the British security services in the torture and ill - treatment of terrorism suspects in Pakistan .
Where sufficient evidence of wrongdoing exists , prosecute those responsible , regardless of position or rank .
• Publish without delay current and past guidance to the intelligence services on the interrogation of suspects overseas .
• While cooperating with Pakistan on counter - terror and law enforcement activities , take all necessary measures to ensure that torture and ill - treatment of suspects or others is not used , and act to stop it should it occur .

A bottle of Löwenbräu lager that survived the 1937 Hindenburg airship crash has just sold at auction for £ 11,000 , proving that beer and gas have always had an explosive relationship .
And the same tension exists today : a new wave of British microbrewers is producing handcrafted lager on a small scale , against dogged opposition from both the real ale lobby - owing to the brewers ' use of CO 2 to dispense the beer - and the Great British Public .
' British lager ' has been almost oxymoronic for the better part of a century .
Anti-German sentiment during the first world war destroyed the optimistically united Anglo - Bavarian Brewery , while pale continental pilsners were expensive and unpatriotic through interwar recession and the fight against Nazism .
So almost all lager drunk in this country ( today accounting for around 70 % of total beer ) has a foreign accent : the reassuringly expensive Belgians , heat - drenched Aussie blokes , the Stetsons , girls and stratocasters of Bud , even the late , lamented exhortation to ' follow the bear ' from the Bavarian forest .
When , in 2000 , brewing giant Whitbread launched GB , an overtly British lager , it flopped spectacularly .
Lager - louts seemingly like it big , boozy and with foreign branding : Stella Artois , the market leader , weighs in at 5.2 % .
More challenging still , in September this year , the Campaign for Real Ale ( Camra ) banned Freedom Brewery , one of the most notable lager pioneers , from exhibiting at the Summer Beer Festival in Burton - on - Trent .
Freedom 's use of gas to serve its beer contravenes Camra policy .
Mike Knight , who set up Lagers of the British Isles ( LOBI ) in response to this snub , is stoic .
' We do n't have a lot to do with Camra , though we 'd like to , ' he says .
' We find that the people we talk to there at ground level are behind what we 're doing , but those at the top say : ' You 're producing the L - word - and we represent the ale lobby ' .
I 'd like them to recognise us , though , and our door is open . '
Iain Loe , national spokesman for Camra , does n't mince his words :
" We appreciate high - quality products , and we wish good luck to these brewers .
But if you want to build relationships , do n't come to us and say ' We started producing beer in the last five minutes and now you have to change everything you believe in ' - it 's a mixture of naivety and arrogance . "
But despite the challenges faced by the new British wave , customers seem delighted .
Sales of Cotswold lager are up 55 % on last year , and Freedom by 40 % .
Some lagers are truly delicious :
West , Harviestoun and Mitchell Krause are making exquisite beers , some cask - aged , with nutty caramels or sweetness and light .
The beer blogger Mark Dredge has praised Harviestoun 's ' fruity - floral bitterness and full , smooth body ' .
Harviestoun is of course Scottish , and as a Scotsman myself I can vouch for its clean , citrus tones - a world away from the inimitably ghastly , ubiquitous Tennent's .
It seems obvious that customers should be given every opportunity to enjoy these distinctive and interesting beers , brewed for unique flavour and complex notes , instead of the generic , minimally offensive styles of the famous brands .
But I 'm keen to hear your thoughts .
Are you a devoted real ale drinker , who sees the appearance of these lagers as a sad regression ?
Or do you prefer the clean , neutral taste of the classic lager brands ?
Let 's get the debate fizzing .
A crucially important conflict , woefully under - reported in the west , has now come to a head in the Middle East .
In response to an ongoing fight that could spill out beyond the Arabian peninsula , Saudi Arabia has entered into direct war with the Houthi rebels in northern Yemen .
Saudi military intervention marks the first time in the kingdom's history that its army has crossed its borders without an ally .
Previously , the kingdom engaged only in proxy wars .
The Saudis used royalist Yemenis to fight Nasser 's Egypt in the 1960s , Iraq 's Saddam Hussein to fight Iran in the 1980s , and the US to fight Iraq in the 1990s .
Indeed , Saudi Arabia has fought every " ism " that has sought to dominate the Middle East , including Nasser 's pan-Arabism , communism , and today 's Islamism of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas , the terrorism of al - Qaida and the Shi'ism of Iran .
The tools it relied upon were oil money and Wahhabi Islam .
During the 1980s , Saudi Arabia spent more than $ 75bn on the propagation of Wahhabi doctrine , funding schools , mosques , and charities across the Islamic world in an effort to bolster its influence .
A large share of these resources was reserved for its back garden , Yemen .
Thousands of schools were established , covering every city and village in Yemen .
Saudi Arabia created in Yemen a strong Wahhabi current that was politically and ideologically loyal to the ruling al - Saud .
Indeed , Yemen 's president , Ali Abdullah Saleh , used imported Wahhabism to defeat his domestic opponents – first the communists , then the Houthis – despite being a Zaidi Shia .
But now this policy has backfired , with the Houthis openly rebelling against Wahhabi encroachment on their religious ideology , while themselves encroaching on neighbouring Saudi territory as they fight the government .
After four months of fighting , Saleh 's domestic forces had failed to contain the revolt .
So , unable to prosecute the war on his own , Saleh turned a domestic rebellion into a sectarian and security threat to the entire Arabian peninsula , thereby manoeuvring the Saudis – eager from the outset to help Saleh , whom they view as their proxy – into providing military backing .
The Saudis ' justification for intervening is that their national territory is under threat .
But that argument is weak , and there is no national support for this war in either country .
Rather , Saudi military intervention reflects the kingdom's wariness toward a hostile Shia region on its southern border , especially given that the same tribes and sects that populate northern Yemen dominate the southern Saudi regions of Jizan and Najran .
The Saudi state doubts the loyalty of its own Ismaili and Zaidi populations , whose natural sympathies are suspected to lie with the Houthis .
Southern Saudi Arabia and northern Yemen have thus become a microcosm of the broader civil war playing out in the Muslim world .
But Saudi Arabia 's intervention in the conflict has also turned what had been a cold war – a war of position and influence within the region – into a hot war with international repercussions .
The principal conflict is between the Saudis and Iran , which has established powerful political bridgeheads in Syria , Lebanon , Iraq , and Gaza .
Saleh played a key role in reinforcing Saudi perceptions of a dangerous Iranian security threat , thereby helping to turn the Houthi rebellion into a geopolitical conflict .
Both the Saudi and Yemeni governments have also claimed that there are strong links between the Houthis and al - Qaida , thereby gaining American support .
But the Houthis are not terrorists .
Abdul Malik al - Houthi , a leader of the insurgency in Yemen 's Sa'dah region , said this month that the Houthis , who are Zaidi Shia , are ideologically and strategically antithetical to Wahhabi Sunni al - Qaida .
At the same time , al - Qaida has benefited from the conflict , as the chaos on the rugged and mountainous 1,500 km border allows it to smuggle arms and fighters into Saudi Arabia in an attempt to destabilise the kingdom .
Sunni areas of Yemen – a weak state , if not a failed one – have become a safe haven for al - Qaida .
But the Saudis are unlikely to succeed militarily in Yemen .
Yemen 's army of 700,000 could not suppress the Houthi rebellion , despite five attempts since 2004 .
Now they are leaving Saudi Arabia 's untested army of 200,000 men to do the job for them .
And , while the Saudis are currently relying on their air force , a full - scale land battle will have to follow – on the same harsh terrain that helped defeated Nasser 's battle - hardened troops in the 1960s .
The Houthis , for their part , lack aircraft and armoured vehicles , but have tactical advantages owing to their numbers , experience of the terrain , and skilful use of land mines .
They also benefit from disciplined training , reminiscent of Hezbollah 's activities in Lebanon .
Saleh has declared that there is no end to this war , but a peaceful solution at this stage would put the Houthis in a stronger position to win their demands , which primarily concern the preservation of culture and identity .
For example , the Houthis want a Zaidi university .
Is there a way out ?
Qatar acted as a mediator last year , and persuaded the Yemeni government to accept a ceasefire .
Syria , which enjoys good relations with Yemen , has also offered to mediate .
Each of these offers was unacceptable to the Saudi rulers , who fear that submitting the conflict to outside mediation would diminish the kingdom 's regional power .
For this reason , Iran 's offer to mediate was seen as the ultimate provocation .
So the war continues , with no immediate possibility of a peaceful solution – and with the policy failure of Saudi Arabia 's military intervention eroding its position in the Arab world .
The dilemma for the Saudis is that now the damage will be much greater if they do not crush the Houthis , as this would embolden al - Qaida .
This is the biggest threat facing Saudi Arabia , but its rulers ' ill - considered war strategy has only brought that threat closer .
On my 18th birthday , the marketing department of the Gillette Company sent me a surprise gift : a SensorExcel razor .
Back then , in the mesozoic era of razor blade development ( circa 1995 ) , the SensorExcel was the latest in state - of - the - art swizziness , with its five " soft , flexible microfins " which stretched the skin and caused the beard hairs to perk up like so many unwary soldiers poking their heads over the parapet , all the easier to be mown down by the two spring - mounted blades following fast behind .
These days , the SensorExcel is a quaint museum piece , having been superseded by razors with first three , then four and now five blades , not to mention all the other add - ons : lubricating strips , pivoting heads , low - friction blade coatings , battery - powered vibrations , trimmers and even microchips .
The three - bladed Gillette Mach3 was introduced in 1998 ; Wilkinson Sword ( Schick in the US ) upped the ante with the four - bladed Quattro in 2003 .
In February 2004 , the satirical online newspaper the Onion ran a spoof article , supposedly by the CEO of Gillette , under the headline Fuck Everything , We 're Doing Five Blades .
Sure enough , a couple of years later , they did : the Fusion .
The Economist , a magazine not normally inclined to scoff at those cornerstones of market capitalism , innovation and growth , took a leaf out of the Onion 's book and ran a semi- humorous article suggesting that , if current trends continue , " blade hyperdrive will be reached in the next few years " .
A pseudoscientific graph showed the number of blades shooting hyperbolically off the chart before 2020 .
But just what is it about adding blades that makes a razor better ?
And is it simply a question of adding blades ?
If so , how hard can it be ?
Do the companies already have six - , seven - , eight - , nine - and 10 - bladed razors ready and waiting to be rolled off the production line whenever they feel they 're slipping behind in the arms race ?
Shaving is serious business : in the UK alone , men spend more than a quarter of a billion pounds a year on razors and blades .
That market is dominated by Gillette , which claims a 79.8 % value share .
That 's 79.8 % of the money , rather than of the number of razors : one reason for the disparity is that Fusion blades cost twice as much as Quattro refills .
Neither Gillette nor Wilkinson Sword would reveal the size of their annual research and development budget .
But in 2005 , Peter Hoffman , then the president of Gillette 's blades and razors division , told BusinessWeek that the development of the Fusion cost slightly less than the $ 680 m they 'd spent on creating the Mach3 a decade earlier .
Whether this is a lot more than , a lot less than or about the same as Procter & Gamble spend on developing a new line of Always sanitary towels or Olay face creams is a secret they 're keeping to themselves .
The company was founded by the American entrepreneur King Camp Gillette in 1901 to mass - produce the disposable - blade safety razors he'd invented , for which he obtained a patent in 1904 .
Gillette is often credited as the inventor of the safety razor , though it had actually been around in various forms since the mid-19th century .
His real innovation was the " razor and blades business model " , also less politely known as " freebie marketing " : give away the durable handles , flog the disposable blades ( or " cartridges " , as the modern multibladed razor heads are called in the trade ) .
The company still relies on the model , as evidenced by my 18th birthday present .
It 's highly effective , and seems almost insultingly simple .
The catch is that it also depends on technical innovation : freebie marketing would n't have worked for King Gillette if he had n't come up with an affordable way to manufacture the blades .
Since the days of its founder , Gillette 's headquarters have been in Boston , Massachusetts .
In 2005 , the company was bought for $ 57bn by Procter & Gamble , the consumer goods behemoth based in Cincinnati , Ohio .
( Wilkinson Sword gets passed around a bit , too : in 2003 , the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer sold it to the battery manufacturer Energizer Holdings . )
The Gillette Technology Centre , however , is tucked away on an industrial estate between the A33 and the Old Basingstoke Road in Reading , Berkshire .
It 's an overcast morning in late summer when I pull into the visitors ' car park , opposite the dozen or so spaces reserved for " shave test panellists " , for a tour .
" I 'm going to challenge you as you walk around , " says the friendly , enthusiastic and clean - shaven lab director , Kevin Powell , " to find the group that is actually tasked with adding blades . "
He laughs .
" That 's the first question I normally get when I go to a cocktail party .
Ho ho ho .
Did you add some more blades today ? "
He shows me a patent from the 30s for an unwieldy , five - bladed razor that looks as if it would n't have been out of place in a medieval torture chamber .
" It must have been excruciatingly uncomfortable , " he says .
" Just adding blades most certainly does n't do it . "
He prefers to talk about the shaving " surface " , a term Gillette trademarked , though it 's hard not to see that as a semantic dodge to flummox the cocktail - party piss - takers .
The surface does , after all , consist of a ( growing ) number of blades .
Anne Stewart , the centre 's director for science , explains the thinking behind multiblade razors .
It 's all down to " a phenomenon we refer to as hysteresis " .
According to the Chambers Dictionary , hysteresis is " the retardation or lagging of an effect behind the cause of the effect " , or " the influence of earlier treatment of a body on its subsequent reaction " .
In shaving terms , this means that when a razor blade encounters a hair , it does n't only cut through it , it also pulls it a little way out of its follicle .
So if there 's another blade following close behind , it will slice into the hair lower down the shaft , before it has had time to retract into the follicle .
" You 've actually shaved below the skin level , " Stewart says .
" Can you ever get a closer shave with a single - edge cut - throat razor ?
In a stroke , no . "
Wilkinson Sword agree that the benefit of several blades is " closeness - in the case of Quattro with no compromise on safety " .
In the high - speed filming lab , I watch magnified , slow - motion footage of a five - bladed Fusion cartridge sliding down a few millimetres of anonymous cheek .
The first blade strikes a hair , slices into it , tugs it out ; the second blade hits , slices again , drags the hair out even farther ; the third blade strikes , then the fourth , then the fifth , each nicking off a chunk of the hair , though a smaller fraction each time .
Adding blades , then , does lead to a closer shave , if with diminishing returns .
But it 's not simply a question of how many blades you have in your cartridge .
" The spacing between the blades is critically important , " Stewart says .
Too close together and you could get two blades in the hair at the same time , which would apply too much force to the hair and be painful .
There also would n't be enough room between the blades for the debris to be rinsed through and the cartridge would get clogged .
Too far apart and the hair will have retracted into the follicle before the second blade gets its chance to bite .
There 's also the danger that the skin will fold into too big a bulge between the blades :
" And that causes skin discomfort and irritation as you come through . "
Finally , the larger the surface , the greater the drag , which again leads to discomfort .
So the challenge was to fit five sharp enough , strong enough blades , with enough space between them , into a small enough area , to give a noticeably closer , more comfortable shave .
" In terms of pushing the technology , " Stewart says , " being able to weld the blades on the small blade supports was a real key enabler . "
The prototypical five - bladed surface - codename : Surf - was " tested on literally thousands of men , " Powell says .
" Did that surface wow them ?
Unequivocally , yes . "
There 's more to the Fusion , however , than the five - bladed shaving surfaceTM .
On the back of the cartridge there 's a sixth blade , a single " precision trimmer " , for doing trickier areas , such as under the nose , and to get nice , straight edges on your sideburns or goatee .
The Wilkinson Sword Quattro Titanium , a jazzed - up version of the Quattro introduced last year , in part , no doubt , as a response to Gillette 's Fusion , has an edging blade on the back , too .
With the Mach3 , " there was a very low level consumer complaint " , Stewart says , " with a high level of frustration , about being able to trim . "
This is the downside of adding blades and creating surfaces : it 's hard to cut a straight line with a plane rather than an edge .
And once they 've experienced the simple joys of an unpivoted single blade - ironically enough , the same principle as the cheapest kind of disposable razor - there 's no going back for Gillette 's guinea pigs .
When making a prototype , Powell says , " sometimes it 's easier for us to try to do it without putting a trimmer on the back .
It 's a revolt .
They go : ' I can't do that ! ' "
" They " are the shave test panellists , the 80 men who go to the technology centre five mornings a week , 50 weeks a year , to have their daily shave with one of Gillette 's experimental prototypes .
The " consumer testing facility " is in a separate building from the research and development labs .
As we walk from one to the other , Powell says , " We are very much on lockdown because , let 's face it , there 's a huge amount of commercial potential locked up in there . "
He pointed back at the main building .
" But a lot of these ideas , although clearly we prosecute for patents - you know , we apply for patents - but nonetheless a lot of those things have n't even started yet .
So there 's a complete lockdown . "
The Fusion system has more than 70 patents registered on it ; the Wilkinson Sword Quattro range has more than 100 .
The consumer testing facility smells strongly of shaving foam .
When the panellists arrive , they have to check in - there 's a " pin verification system " to exclude interlopers - then each is given his " shave box " with the day 's razor in it and a barcode that has to be scanned , to make sure everyone gets the right box .
" The one thing you want absolutely to ensure is there 's never an opportunity for somebody to shave somebody else 's razor , from a cross-contamination point of view . "
( Powell talks about " shaving a razor " , rather than " shaving with a razor " , so that , grammatically speaking , the direct object of the verb is the razor , not the face .
Though it probably would n't be fair to read too much into the idiom . )
The panellists are closely observed as they shave and afterwards fill out questionnaires .
I ask if they 're paid .
" Yes , they are , " Stewart says .
" Incentivised , " interjects Jennie Larby , who 's in charge of the facility .
They do n't tell me the size of the incentives .
One of the panellists has volunteered to give a shaving demonstration .
I watch him through a two - way mirror , video cameras trained on him over my shoulders .
It 's a strange , unsettling experience to look into a mirror and see another man shaving .
He leans in close , turns his face this way , then that , stretches the skin of his cheek with his left hand while scraping at it with the razor in his right , pulls clownish expressions to tighten the muscles , seems to be peering intently into my eyes .
I want to look away , but I can't .
I make a joke about putting the videos on YouTube .
Powell laughs politely , and says they take the panellists ' privacy very seriously .
" It was only when I came here that I realised I 'd been married to my husband for so long and I 'd never watched him shaving , " says Kristina Vanoosthuyze , one of Gillette 's senior scientists .
" I stood next to him .
' How are you shaving exactly ? ' "
Stewart , too , takes a professional interest in her other half 's grooming habits : " After a while , he says , ' Do you know what ?
Can I just shave without you asking ? ' " Vanoosthuyze 's husband eventually told her to " Go away and leave me alone ! " she jokes .
Powell brings the conversation back to the matter in hand .
" You can never spend too much time with consumers , " he says .
" It 's amazing what you will learn from them . "
Down the hall from the high - speed video lab is the room where they do three - dimensional motion analysis using infrared cameras : " It 's the same system they use in some of the latest blockbusters , like Spider - Man or Lord Of The Rings . "
The changing positions of markers that reflect infrared light are triangulated by the cameras , so the movements of the razor and the shaver 's arm can be recreated in a virtual 3D space on a computer .
" The way in which you hold that handle and you rotate that handle , if you watch men do it , it 's quite amazing .
You think they could all be cheerleaders , " Stewart says .
High - speed infrared cameras , running at around 2,000 frames a second , are also used to measure skin deformation and strain .
A similar technique is used in the car and aeroplane industries , though Gillette have patented it for shaving research .
Next door , sensors in a specially adapted razor measure the forces different men put on it while shaving .
Analysis of all the data from all the different studies gives the researchers an idea of where there might be room for improvement , so the next stage is to build a new prototype the panellists can try out to see if it 's any better .
The razors are built virtually at first , using computer - aided design .
These models are then turned into physical ones downstairs in the rapid prototyping area .
The models are made by building up very , very thin layers of plastic , one on top of another .
Dom Piff points to the work going on in one of his machines .
" That 's a very large part for us , " he says .
" It 's like trying to cut Wembley football turf with an eight - inch blade . "
His fastest machine is the 3D printer , " which is kind of like precision bombing " .
Eight printheads , with 97 nozzles on each , pass from left to right , spitting out a liquid polymer that is instantly solidified by the ultraviolet light following behind .
It makes a noise like a desktop computer printer , only louder .
Piff gives me a souvenir : a blown - up plastic model of a Fusion cartridge with my name engraved on it .
The machines that cut the metal parts in the working prototypes are accurate to within plus or minus 1.5 microns ( thousandths of a millimetre ) .
" This is levels of accuracy greater than the watch - making industry , " Stewart shouts over the noise of the equipment .
" More in among the medical industry . "
The incredible levels of precision have been emphasised all the way round the facility .
Presumably that 's the subtext of using Roger Federer , Tiger Woods and Thierry Henry in the Fusion ad campaign : here 's a combination of more precision and accuracy than you know what to do with .
" If you take away only the one thing , " Powell says , " that 's precision .
And the consumer .
That 's it . "
You could be forgiven for thinking magnification was a major theme , too .
Using a device called a micro-watcher , I was able to inspect my chin at 200 times lifesize .
I had n't shaved for a couple of days .
The hairs looked revolting , the black ones like great greasy sticks of liquorice , the pale ones like shards of dirty glass .
In the electron microscope area , there are pictures on the wall of various blade edges enlarged thousands of times : kitchen scissors , a kitchen knife , a surgical scalpel , a Fusion blade .
Guess which is the sharpest .
" To be fair , the surgical scalpel is being asked to do a different task , " Powell says .
Each blade in a Fusion cartridge consists of a stainless steel core , coated with very thin layers of diamond - like carbon , for strength , and a Teflon - like polymer to reduce friction .
I ask about planned obsolescence : a razor blade that never went blunt would be bad news for the industry .
Stewart 's answer implies that the idea of an unbluntable razor is a fantasy .
" You clearly do n't want something that 's fantastic but lasts one shave , because clearly that 's not great for the shaver . "
I think this means you can't have both maximum sharpness and maximum durability , so you need to find a compromise .
" The only reason anything ever is in that razor is because it delights guys , " Powell says .
" There is not one thing more in there than is needed to delight them .
There are no gimmicks , no funny things , it 's all about performance , " he adds , though , when pressed , he does admit " there 's a cool toy factor built into it " .
According to Gillette 's own research , two out of three men prefer the Fusion to the Mach3 .
" It 's what guys seek , " Powell says .
They give me a Fusion Power Stealth to take home - more freebie marketing ; I 'd never have bought one - and I have to admit it is nicer to shave with , and gives a smoother result , than my old Mach3 ( I reluctantly traded up from the SensorExcel a few years ago because Sainsbury 's did n't have replacement blades ) .
The single blade on the back is particularly handy .
I can't say the friction - reducing vibrations do much for me - around the mouth , they feel as if you 're having your teeth scaled and polished .
The electric beard - trimmer on the end of the Wilkinson Sword Quattro Titanium Precision makes more sense ( or would , if I had a beard that needed trimming ) .
The point of the microchip in the Power models , incidentally , is threefold : to control the electrical discharge from the battery , so vibration levels are constant across the battery 's life , rather than gradually weakening as it drains ; to switch the motor off after eight minutes , in the event that it has been switched on accidentally ; and to control the low - battery indicator light .
It also allows the researchers to " do things in terms of learning things about the consumer , " Powell says , hastily adding : " In our prototypes , clearly not in the product , in our research . "
Both firms are unsurprisingly cagey about where that research is taking them .
I ask Wilkinson Sword if they have a six - bladed successor in the pipeline .
" RD&E [ research , development and engineering ] is working consistently on upgrading our products , " they say , " and is evaluating all opportunities that our technologies are offering us . "
That 's a resounding " maybe " , then .
I was more than persuaded by both firms that the technology is n't some kind of con : the researchers I met were all gifted , dedicated people , responding with infectious enthusiasm and flair to the real technical and intellectual problems with which they were presented .
So , yes , the business is about fulfilling the consumers ' desire for a better shave .
But it 's also about creating that desire : if the two out of three men who prefer the Fusion to the Mach3 had never been offered the Fusion , they 'd never have known what they were missing .
Still , that 's capitalism for you .
If you wanted an allegorical portrait of modern western capitalist society , you could do a lot worse than a man alone at a shaving mirror , intent on his own reflection , while from the other side of the glass a vast global corporation is watching , recording and planning what to sell him next .
Sarah Palin is a political gift that keeps on giving .
That ’s the view from David Plouffe , who managed the presidential campaign for Barack Obama .
In a television interview on Sunday , Mr. Plouffe said Ms. Palin , the former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate , became a blessing for Democrats last year and could be again .
“ I think we should thank John McCain for picking her in terms of how it helped us win in 2008 , ” Mr. Plouffe said .
“ But I think we should doubly thank him now . ”
One year after Mr. Obama was elected the nation ’s 44th president , Mr. Plouffe is out with his take of the improbable campaign with his book , “ The Audacity to Win . ”
He offered a preview on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” saying Mr. Obama had given thought to selecting Hillary Rodham Clinton as his running mate , but was worried about the role that former President Bill Clinton would play in such an arrangement .
“ There was a mythology during the campaign that President Obama did not take Hillary Clinton very seriously as VP .
The truth is he did , ” Mr. Plouffe said .
“ The fact that he chose her as Secretary of State reflects on how strongly he believes in her leadership quality and her skill . ”
One of the most surprising moments of the race , he said , came when Senator John McCain announced that Ms. Palin was joining his ticket .
Today , he said , she remains a force among Republicans that has made the party inhospitable to moderates .
( The latest example , he said , came in a New York Congressional race , where Ms. Palin endorsed a Conservative Party candidate over the Republican nominee , leading the Republican to drop out . )
“ She ’s kind of playing the role of pied - piper in the Republican Party , ” Mr. Plouffe said , “ which is something I ’m quite comfortable with . ”
In his 352 - page book , Mr. Plouffe divulges few major secrets or previously unknown facts about the campaign .
He did not join the Obama administration , but remains a close personal adviser and friend to the president .
Last week , he flew aboard Air Force One with Mr. Obama to give him a copy of the book .
In his television interview on Sunday , Mr. Plouffe said implementing the kind of change that Mr. Obama campaigned on was difficult .
But he warned against reading too much into the weakened standing of Democrats as the mid-term election year approaches .
“ Everyone in Washington wants to predict what ’s going to happen next fall .
This thing ’s got about 20 lifetimes , ” Mr. Plouffe said .
“ I think the long - term political picture is this :
You ’ve got a Republican Party with historically low favorable ratings – moderates and centrists leaving the party . ”
The book , for which Mr. Plouffe received a seven - figure advance , goes on sale Tuesday .
Over the past month in Afghanistan it became clear that a Presidential runoff vote between President Hamid Karzai and challenger Abdullah Abdullah would need to take place .
The Obama administration continued to deliberate on whether to commit further troops to the conflict , and at least 46 U.S. service members were killed , including 14 in two separate helicopter crashes today .
A recent U.N. report recorded 1,500 Afghan civilian deaths in the first six months of 2009 alone , describing this as the deadliest year for civilians in Afghanistan since the start of the U.S. - led war against Taliban eight years ago .
Collected here are some images of the country and conflict over the past month , part of an ongoing monthly series on Afghanistan .

Fish vision discovery makes waves in natural selection

Emory University researchers have identified the first fish known to have switched from ultraviolet vision to violet vision , or the ability to see blue light .
The discovery is also the first example of an animal deleting a molecule to change its visual spectrum .
Their findings on scabbardfish , linking molecular evolution to functional changes and the possible environmental factors driving them , were published Oct. 13 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" This multi-dimensional approach strengthens the case for the importance of adaptive evolution , " says evolutionary geneticist Shozo Yokoyama , who led the study .
" Building on this framework will take studies of natural selection to the next level . "
The research team included Takashi Tada , a post - doctoral fellow in biology , and Ahmet Altun , a post - doctoral fellow in biology and computational chemistry .
Vision ' like a painting '
For two decades , Yokoyama has done groundbreaking work on the adaptive evolution of vision in vertebrates .
Vision serves as a good study model , since it is the simplest of the sensory systems .
For example , only four genes are involved in human vision .
" It 's amazing , but you can mix together this small number of genes and detect a whole color spectrum , " Yokoyama says .
" It 's just like a painting . "
The common vertebrate ancestor possessed UV vision .
However , many species , including humans , have switched from UV to violet vision , or the ability to sense the blue color spectrum .
From the ocean depths
Fish provide clues for how environmental factors can lead to such vision changes , since the available light at various ocean depths is well quantified .
All fish previously studied have retained UV vision , but the Emory researchers found that the scabbardfish has not .
To tease out the molecular basis for this difference , they used genetic engineering , quantum chemistry and theoretical computation to compare vision proteins and pigments from scabbardfish and another species , lampfish .
The results indicated that scabbardfish shifted from UV to violet vision by deleting the molecule at site 86 in the chain of amino acids in the opsin protein .
" Normally , amino acid changes cause small structure changes , but in this case , a critical amino acid was deleted , " Yokoyama says .
More examples likely
" The finding implies that we can find more examples of a similar switch to violet vision in different fish lineages , " he adds .
" Comparing violet and UV pigments in fish living in different habitats will open an unprecedented opportunity to clarify the molecular basis of phenotypic adaptations , along with the genetics of UV and violet vision . "
Scabbardfish spend much of their life at depths of 25 to 100 meters , where UV light is less intense than violet light , which could explain why they made the vision shift , Yokoyama theorizes .
Lampfish also spend much of their time in deep water .
But they may have retained UV vision because they feed near the surface at twilight on tiny , translucent crustaceans that are easier to see in UV light .
A framework for evolutionary biology
Last year , Yokoyama and collaborators completed a comprehensive project to track changes in the dim - light vision protein opsin in nine fish species , chameleons , dolphins and elephants , as the animals spread into new environments and diversified over time .
The researchers found that adaptive changes occur by a small number of amino acid substitutions , but most substitutions do not lead to functional changes .
Their results provided a reference framework for further research , and helped bring to light the limitations of studies that rely on statistical analysis of gene sequences alone to identify adaptive mutations in proteins .
" Evolutionary biology is filled with arguments that are misleading , at best , " Yokoyama says .
" To make a strong case for the mechanisms of natural selection , you have to connect changes in specific molecules with changes in phenotypes , and then you have to connect these changes to the living environment . "
The sound of who ?
Never heard of it .

The list is but a single compilation , and hence may be incomplete .
Readers are invited to communicate with the author in regard to items that should or should not be in this list .
The Laws that follow are offered to define the term " sustainability . "
In some cases these statements are accompanied by corollaries that are identified by capital letters .
They all apply for populations and rates of consumption of goods and resources of the sizes and scales found in the world in 2005 , and may not be applicable for small numbers of people or to groups in primitive tribal situations .
At the Denver ASPO conference , I had the good fortune to meet Dr. Albert Bartlett .
Afterward , Dr. Bartlett e-mailed me some material he had written over the years .
The " Laws of Sustainability " were included in this material .
They are part of Al Bartlett 's contribution to the anthology The Future of Sustainability by Marco Keiner , published in 2006 .
The document by Dr. Bartlett from which these were excerpted can be found here .
A ) A population growth rate less than or equal to zero and declining rates of consumption of resources are a necessary , but not a sufficient , condition for a sustainable society .
B ) Unsustainability will be the certain result of any program of " development , " that does not plan the achievement of zero ( or a period of negative ) growth of populations and of rates of consumption of resources .
This is true even if the program is said to be “ sustainable . ”
C )
The research and regulation programs of governmental agencies that are charged with protecting the environment and promoting " sustainability " are , in the long run , irrelevant , unless these programs address vigorously and quantitatively the concept of carrying capacities and unless the programs study in depth the demographic causes and consequences of environmental problems .
D ) Societies , or sectors of a society , that depend on population growth or growth in their rates of consumption of resources , are unsustainable .
E ) Persons who advocate population growth and / or growth in the rates of consumption of resources are advocating unsustainability .
F )
Persons who suggest that sustainability can be achieved without stopping population growth are misleading themselves and others .
G ) Persons whose actions directly or indirectly cause increases in population or in the rates of consumption of resources are moving society away from sustainability .
H)
The term " Sustainable Growth " is an oxymoron .
I) In terms of population sizes and rates of resource consumption , “ The only smart growth is no growth . ” ( Hammond , 1999 )
Second Law :
In a society with a growing population and / or growing rates of consumption of resources , the larger the population , and / or the larger the rates of consumption of resources , the more difficult it will be to transform the society to the condition of sustainability .
Third Law :
The response time of populations to changes in the human fertility rate is the average length of a human life , or approximately 70 years .
( Bartlett and Lytwak 1995 ) [ This is called " population momentum . " ]
A ) A nation can achieve zero population growth if :
a ) the fertility rate is maintained at the replacement level for 70 years , and
b ) there is no net migration during the 70 years .
During the 70 years the population continues to grow , but at declining rates until the growth finally stops after approximately 70 years .
B )
If we want to make changes in the total fertility rates so as to stabilize the population by the mid - to late 21st century , we must make the necessary changes now .
C )
The time horizon of political leaders is of the order of two to eight years .
D )
It will be difficult to convince political leaders to act now to change course , when the full results of the change may not become apparent in the lifetimes of those leaders .
Fourth Law :
The size of population that can be sustained ( the carrying capacity ) and the sustainable average standard of living of the population are inversely related to one another .
( This must be true even though Cohen asserts that the numerical size of the carrying capacity of the Earth cannot be determined , ( Cohen 1995 ) )
A ) The higher the standard of living one wishes to sustain , the more urgent it is to stop population growth .
B ) Reductions in the rates of consumption of resources and reductions in the rates of production of pollution can shift the carrying capacity in the direction of sustaining a larger population .
Fifth Law :
One cannot sustain a world in which some regions have high standards of living while others have low standards of living .
Sixth Law :
All countries cannot simultaneously be net importers of carrying capacity .
A ) World trade involves the exportation and importation of carrying capacity .
Seventh Law : A society that has to import people to do its daily work ( “ We ca n’t find locals who will do the work , ” ) is not sustainable .
Eighth Law : Sustainability requires that the size of the population be less than or equal to the carrying capacity of the ecosystem for the desired standard of living .
A ) Sustainability requires an equilibrium between human society and dynamic but stable ecosystems .
B ) Destruction of ecosystems tends to reduce the carrying capacity and / or the sustainable standard of living .
C )
The rate of destruction of ecosystems increases as the rate of growth of the population increases .
D ) Affluent countries , through world trade , destroy the ecosystems of less developed countries .
E ) Population growth rates less than or equal to zero are necessary , but are not sufficient , conditions for halting the destruction of the environment .
This is true locally and globally .
Ninth Law : ( The lesson of " The Tragedy of the Commons " ) ( Hardin 1968 ) :
The benefits of population growth and of growth in the rates of consumption of resources accrue to a few ; the costs of population growth and growth in the rates of consumption of resources are borne by all of society .
A ) Individuals who benefit from growth will continue to exert strong pressures supporting and encouraging both population growth and growth in rates of consumption of resources .
B ) The individuals who promote growth are motivated by the recognition that growth is good for them .
In order to gain public support for their goals , they must convince people that population growth and growth in the rates of consumption of resources , are also good for society .
[ This is the Charles Wilson argument : if it is good for General Motors , it is good for the United States . ]
( Yates 1983 )
Tenth Law : Growth in the rate of consumption of a non-renewable resource , such as a fossil fuel , causes a dramatic decrease in the life - expectancy of the resource .
A ) In a world of growing rates of consumption of resources , it is seriously misleading to state the life - expectancy of a non-renewable resource " at present rates of consumption , " i.e. , with no growth .
More relevant than the life - expectancy of a resource is the expected date of the peak production of the resource , i.e. the peak of the Hubbert curve .
( Hubbert 1972 ) B )
It is intellectually dishonest to advocate growth in the rate of consumption of non-renewable resources while , at the same time , reassuring people about how long the resources will last " at present rates of consumption . ” ( zero growth )
Eleventh Law :
The time of expiration of non-renewable resources can be postponed , possibly for a very long time , by :
i ) technological improvements in the efficiency with which the resources are recovered and used ii ) using the resources in accord with a program of " Sustained Availability , " ( Bartlett 1986 ) iii ) recycling iv ) the use of substitute resources .
Twelfth Law :
When large efforts are made to improve the efficiency with which resources are used , the resulting savings are easily and completely wiped out by the added resources that are consumed as a consequence of modest increases in population .
A ) When the efficiency of resource use is increased , the consequence often is that the " saved " resources are not put aside for the use of future generations , but instead are used immediately to encourage and support larger populations .
B ) Humans have an enormous compulsion to find an immediate use for all available resources .
Thirteenth Law :
The benefits of large efforts to preserve the environment are easily canceled by the added demands on the environment that result from small increases in human population .
Fourteenth Law : ( Second Law of Thermodynamics )
When rates of pollution exceed the natural cleansing capacity of the environment , it is easier to pollute than it is to clean up the environment .
Fifteenth Law : ( Eric Sevareid's Law ) ;
The chief cause of problems is solutions .
( Sevareid 1970 )
A ) This law should be a central part of higher education , especially in engineering .
Sixteenth Law : Humans will always be dependent on agriculture .
( This is the first of Malthus ’ two postulata . )
A ) Supermarkets alone are not sufficient .
B ) The central task in sustainable agriculture is to preserve agricultural land .
The agricultural land must be protected from losses due to things such as : i ) Urbanization and development ii ) Erosion iii )
Poisoning by chemicals
Seventeenth Law :
If , for whatever reason , humans fail to stop population growth and growth in the rates of consumption of resources , Nature will stop these growths .
A ) By contemporary western standards , Nature 's method of stopping growth is cruel and inhumane .
B ) Glimpses of Nature 's method of dealing with populations that have exceeded the carrying capacity of their lands can be seen each night on the television news reports from places where large populations are experiencing starvation and misery .
Eighteenth Law :
In local situations within the U.S. , creating jobs increases the number of people locally who are out of work .
A ) Newly created jobs in a community temporarily lowers the unemployment rate ( say from 5 % to 4 % ) , but then people move into the community to restore the unemployment rate to its earlier higher value ( of 5 % ) , but this is 5 % of the larger population , so more individuals are out of work than before .
Nineteenth Law : Starving people do n't care about sustainability .
A ) If sustainability is to be achieved , the necessary leadership and resources must be supplied by people who are not starving .
Twentieth Law :
The addition of the word " sustainable " to our vocabulary , to our reports , programs , and papers , to the names of our academic institutes and research programs , and to our community initiatives , is not sufficient to ensure that our society becomes sustainable .
Twenty - First Law : Extinction is forever .
SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE ?
The challenge of making the transition to a sustainable society is enormous , in part because of a major global effort to keep people from recognizing the centrality of population growth to the enormous problems of the U.S. and the world .
• On the global scale , we need to support family planning throughout the world , and we should generally restrict our foreign aid to those countries that make continued demonstrated progress in reducing population growth rates and sizes .
• The immediate task is to restore numeracy to the population programs in the local , national and global agendas .
• On the national scale , we can work for the selection of leaders who will recognize that population growth is the major problem in the U.S. and who will initiate a national dialog on the problem .
With a lot of work at the grassroots , our system of representative government will respond .
• On the local and national levels , we must focus serious attention and large fiscal resources on the development of renewable energy sources .
• On the local and national levels , we need to work to improve social justice and equity .
• On the community level in the U.S. , we should work to make growth pay for itself .

The attack victim tracked his assailant through Facebook
A clubber who attacked a man with a bottle has been jailed after his victim tracked him down using the Facebook social networking site .
Fouad Hamodu needed 50 stitches to his jaw and neck after the attack at Club 8 bar in Guildhall Walk , Portsmouth .
Mr Hamodu recognised his attacker and managed to find out his name before tracking him down on the website .
Vincent Collymore , 33 , of Shaftesbury Road , Southsea , was jailed for 15 months after admitting wounding .
' Facebook pivotal '
A Hampshire police spokesman said Mr Hamodu remembered his attacker as a regular at R 'n ' B nights in the city and had heard his name mentioned .
He then started searching the Facebook website and found photographs of Collymore , which he showed to police who then arrested him .
Collymore was sentenced at Portsmouth Crown Court last month .
Det Con Pete Spake said : " Although it is unusual for victims of crime to provide photographs of their assailants , in this case the social networking site Facebook was pivotal in identifying the offender , Mr Collymore .
" It is already known that social networking sites have been used to bring offenders to justice .
This is just another example of this .
" I am very pleased with the outcome of this investigation . "
Chimps Mourn Passing of One of Their Own Photo of grieving chimps is a powerful reminder of animals ' emotional capacity .
Oct. 28 , 2009  --
If you ever doubted that animals feel sorrow , this photograph will make you believe .
Featured in the November issue of National Geographic Magazine , the touching photo captures more than a dozen chimpanzees gazing on as the body of one of their own is wheeled away .
The photograph was taken in September 2008 , after Dorothy , a female chimp in her late 40s died of congestive heart failure at Cameroon 's Sanaga - Yong Chimpanzee Rescue Center .
Monica Szcupider , the photographer , submitted the photo to " Your Photo " a National Geographic feature that solicits pictures readers have taken .
She told the magazine that she had been a volunteer at the rescue center where Dorothy had lived for eight years .
Before arriving at the center , Dorothy had been a " mascot " at an amusement park in Cameroon .
For 25 years , she was confined , teased , taught to drink beer and smoke cigarettes , National Geographic reported .
The mistreatment took its toll and , by the time she was rescued by the center in 2000 , she was obese and in poor health .
But as she recovered , she grew very close to the other chimps at the refuge .
All Great Apes Feel Sorrow
" Her presence , and loss , was palpable , and resonated throughout the group .
The management at Sanaga - Yong opted to let Dorothy 's chimpanzee family witness her burial , so that perhaps they would understand , in their own capacity , that Dorothy would not return , " Szcupider said .
" Some chimps displayed aggression while others barked in frustration , but perhaps the most stunning reaction was a recurring , almost tangible silence .
If one knows chimpanzees , then one knows that [ they ] are not [ usually ] silent creatures . "
Patti Ragan , director of the Center for Great Apes in Wauchula , Fla. , told ABCNews.com that when she first saw the photograph she was touched , but not surprised , by the chimps ' reaction .
" All great apes feel sorrow when they lose someone in their family , " she said , adding that human and ape DNA sequences are 99 percent similar .
Animals ' Emotional Reactions Cannot Be Generalized
" There are many cases where older animals have died or sick animals have died , and the keeper will allow the rest of the family to mourn , " she said .
" Animals will come up and touch the body and sit with it . "
A few years ago , she said , a male chimp at her center named Charlie had a heart attack and died while he was with his daughter and his mate of many years .
" They were crying and very distressed , " Ragan said .
Charlie 's mate , Oopsie , was so stricken with grief that she refused food and would n't leave her nest for 2 or 3 days .
Other species , such as elephants , parrots and other house pets , also mourn the passing of loved ones , she said .
And , like humans , animals ' reactions can't be generalized .
" It 's individual , " Ragan said .
" Some people cope in a certain way , some can 't . "
We like to encourage debate in hot topics in tech policy and law .
This week , we 're focusing on Selectable Output Control , which Hollywood and the cable industry are both pushing hard for at the FCC .
We invited Kyle McSlarrow , head of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association ( cable 's trade and lobbying group in Washington ) to take his best shot at convincing Ars readers of the virtue , wonder , and necessity of SOC .
Ars will be publishing its own response from our resident SOC expert , Matt Lasar , tomorrow .
SOC lets content owners exert fine - grained control over the outputs on your A/V gear in order to better protect their " high - value " content .
But McSlarrow says that 's not as terrifying as it sounds — it 's just technological progress in action , and the end result is good for everyone .
Convinced , or still skeptical ?
Let us hear your thoughts in the discussion thread .
How could anyone object to such awesomeness ?
A competitive marketplace with a growing list of video providers all vying for consumer attention — cable , satellite , telco , broadband , mobile , Netflix , etc. —has also brought creative thinking about new ways to bring consumers more content when and where they want it .
Kyle McSlarrow
From our vantage point , delivering the latest hit movies to consumers ' homes — far earlier than they can watch those movies at home today — is one of the obvious next steps .
Why should n't you be able to watch the latest movie in the comfort of your own living room ( and on your own schedule ) months before you can now buy it on DVD or watch it through conventional Video - on - Demand ( VOD ) ?
Consumers , content companies and distributors all benefit if more content is out in the marketplace sooner .
Sounds like a slam dunk to me , but surprisingly , some object ... and strongly .
The debate about delivering first - run movies to consumer homes earlier than currently available is really quite simple — delivering high - value content has to be done properly in order to protect the security of the material .
If movie studios are n’t convinced that their movies , which often represent years of expensive investment , can be protected from unauthorized copying and distribution , consumers wo n’t get that content ... or not as soon as we in the cable industry would like them to .
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) has set up a process — called the Selectable Output Control ( SOC ) rule — that would enable us to provide that protection so content owners have the confidence they need to distribute their high - value content sooner .
In 2008 , and again recently , the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) has asked the FCC to support SOC .
NCTA has also met with Commission officials to express our support .
SOC does not break your TV
Opposition to SOC from some in the public interest community — led by the group Public Knowledge ( PK ) — has involved a series of incorrect accusations in letters ( here , here , here , and here ) and videos urging consumers to “ Tell the FCC to Say ‘ No ’ to the Cable Kill Switch . ”
In this video , PK Legal Director Harold Feld argues that SOC " breaks 25 million television sets , " and causes your personal devices — such as your TiVo or Slingbox — to no longer function .
Feld says that movie studios , as well as cable operators and satellite providers , would “ like to be able to remotely turn off your Slingbox , turn off your DVR , turn off anything that ’s coming out of the TV set that [ they ] do n’t directly control . ”
A recent post in Ars Technica agreed with PK , suggesting that the " output changes [ MPAA ] wants could , in fact , hobble some home video systems . "
If that were the case , I could certainly understand the opposition .
But it simply is n’t true .
SOC does n’t break anything , a topic both we and MPAA have addressed repeatedly , including in our Reply Comments last summer .
We noted in those comments that existing devices are not harmed by the use of SOC — if you have a TV set that does n’t support SOC , then you simply would n't be able to order these new movies at all .
But nothing in the use of SOC prevents your existing TV from doing all the things it can do now .
The situation is analogous to any early adopter who acquires new equipment which , with the passage of time , cannot access as easily ( or at all ) new services coming down the road .
From computers to cell phones to televisions , that has been and likely always will be the case — something Ars readers probably know more about than most .
The important point is that nothing is being taken away from those early adopters , and other consumers with more capable devices will simply have more viewing options .
Indeed , there can be no public interest justification for denying new choices to a majority of consumers simply because a small minority cannot avail themselves of those choices .
Critics have also argued that the MPAA ’s bid for selectable output control could force some consumers to buy new home theater equipment .
But both MPAA and NCTA have demonstrated that an SOC waiver simply means that a consumer 's current gear without protected connectors will work exactly the same way it does today , and newer devices with protected connectors ( including millions of devices in homes today ) will be able to take advantage of the earlier release of movies to cable and satellite customers using SOC .
Should we go back to the original iPod ?
When Apple introduced the “ Classic ” iPod with the ability to rent movies , earlier generation iPods still functioned well , played music , and ( for 5G iPods ) played video , but they did n’t play rentals .
Apple ’s release did n’t suddenly render your older version useless , but you needed to purchase the Classic to get access to the video rental library .
So while your “ older ” device may not have all of the features of the latest model , it certainly still works as intended when you bought it and is n’t “ screwed up ” ( another PK reference ) .
But if you buy into the anti-SOC argument , you would assume that there should have been a massive outcry against the new iPod and its rental feature .
Instead , here is what Ars itself had to say on the subject :
" Apple has answered the calls of consumers and critics with a slick , friendly movie rental section .
After playing with it for a week , I ’m still inclined to say that it ’s off to a strong start .
Though other services may have a superior catalogs ( for now ) or integration with other living room devices , none reach iTunes ’ signature ease - of - use or integration with the world ’s most popular digital media players . "
And what did Ars say about restrictions on the use of the new iPod ?
" As for why movie rentals have these specific new DRM rules applied to them , they ’re clearly conditions enforced by studios interested in locking down their rental content in every way possible .
A crack for iTunes DRM is a scary prospect for execs interested in protecting their content and getting paid their dues , and a movie that typically sells for $ 15 - 20 at retail getting cracked for as little as $ 2.99 must be even more insomnia - inducing .
These were likely some of the compromises Apple had to make in order to score all the major studios , and perhaps to launch a digital rental section in the first place . "
Ars clearly recognized that protection of content played a critical role in content owners being open to providing that content via the iTunes store .
The reviewer is exactly right that such protections were likely a prerequisite for iTunes rentals launching at all .
SOC wo n’t stop piracy altogether , although it will make it more difficult .
And the benefits of incorporating adequate content protection that will open up earlier release windows and provide consumers more viewing options clearly outweighs the unproven harms alleged by opponents of the SOC waiver .
Technology changes all the time .
And the pace and intensity of innovation across the board in technology , communications networks , and consumer electronics is undoubtedly going to raise these types of issues with greater frequency .
I do n’t pretend that these issues are necessarily easy .
But it does strike me that in order to continue providing consumers more services , more choices and the opportunity to do things they currently can’t do today . . . we should n’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good .
Not all consumers are going to be first adopters ; not all technology changes are going to work instantly , seamlessly , and magically on every device currently in the marketplace .
Taking practical steps , like approving the SOC waiver , that move us down the path of greater consumer choice is a far better policy choice than standing pat , or pretending that creators of content are going to accept unnecessary risks with their investments .
Global warming exposed as UN - funded fraud
by Project Mayhem
Russian computer hackers have published emails and source code from the UN - affiliated Climate Research Unit showing profound corruption , fraud , and criminal activity .
What 's really behind the Copenhagen treaty ?
Recently , Russian hackers published over 160 mb of scientific emails and source code taken from the primary ' climate research unit ' -- the University of East Anglia , which is the center of UN / IPCC - promoted global warming alarmism .
What the emails and data prove is shocking , and may represent the greatest scandal in the history of science .
In the emails , these UN - funded scientists talk about deleting data under FOIA request , faking data for journals such as Nature , conspiring to keep opposing science out of peer - reviewed journals ( which they controlled the editorial boards ) , using " tricks " to " hide the [ cooling period ] " etc .
A picture emerges of big science funded to the tune of billions of dollars for the purposes of an underlying international political agenda .
The degree of collusion between big media , the UN , and corrupted scientists involved in frank criminal activity is deeply disturbing .
As I have detailed before , the purpose here is a political one .
Global warming , or now abstractly identified as ' climate change ' , has been chosen by international banks and think tanks as the method of induction of vast political and social engineering never before seen in the history of the world .
We see based on the activities of criminals representing themselves as ' climate scientists ' that the politics came first , and the science came second .
They were more than happy to represent the political interests of the UN and international banks -- as long as their lab was well - funded .
But there are politics behind this indeed .
Here is a small sample of the underlying political agenda : Billions in new taxes , International regulatory control under the UN , Goldman Sachs / CCX carbon trading , Obliteration of national sovereignty , extreme forced austerity and reduction of the standard of living , deindustrialization of the First World countries , and implementation of Orwellian state policies for the purposes of " carbon tracking " .
The science does not matter -- the politics does .
Let us consider for a moment the cynical political objectives behind ' global warming ' before we delve into the mountain of evidence thanks to the leaked emails and source code .
Global Warming and Orwellian State Policy
The Dutch government attempts to introduce GPS tracking units in everyone 's cars under the pretext of ' climate change ' .
THE HAGUE — The Dutch government said Friday it wants to introduce a " green " road tax by the kilometre from 2012 aimed at cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 10 percent and halving congestion .
" Each vehicle will be equipped with a GPS device that tracks how many kilometres are driven and when and where .
This data will be then be sent to a collection agency that will send out the bill , " the transport ministry said in a statement .
http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iYPTOtIepVKcGL_AcCZFe1ht99UQ
Global Warming and New Taxes
One of the primary political aspects of the global warming fraud is the imposition of a massive and bewildering array of new taxes .
Obviously it is plain to see how this is in the interest of governments and banks , particularly if such taxes are imposed on an individual level .
Carbon Insurance For Your Car May Be Down The Road [ Green Gas Taxes at Pumps ] by Terry Tamminen ( cnbc.com ) - Nov. 13 , 2009 .
" A carbon insurance premium could easily be included in such a gas pump surcharge so drivers pay the true cost of operating their vehicles in terms of all relevant risks , including their fair share of creating both fender benders and climate change collisions . "

Global Warming and Personal Autonomy
Selling your house ?
It could be a green crime
Queensland ’s flailing government has now made it a crime to sell your house without first doing a big green audit :
QUEENSLANDERS selling their homes will soon have to complete a 56 - point questionnaire detailing the property ’s environmental credentials

Global Warming and Forced Austerity
The UN has advocated funding global birth control initiatives [ read : ' population security ' ] in order to ' reduce CO2 emissions ' .
Of course now we know the connection between CO2 and temperatures is based on fabricated data . . .
So where does that leave such UN population initiatives ?
UN says Birth control the most effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions [ UN Wants More Abortions and Sterilizations to cut Co2 ] by Ben Webster ( timesonline.co.uk ) - Nov. 19 , 2009 .
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article6922245.ece
The population control objectives of the global warming fraud do not end there .
Andrew Revkin , an NYT correspondent identified in the leaked CRU emails exhibiting a very cozy relationship with the corrupt scientists , advocates restrictions on the number of children couples are permitted to have via the issuance of ' carbon credits ' .
This is similar to what was advocated by Obama 's chief science advisor John Holdren in his book Ecoscience .
There is a political agenda behind global warming .
" Should –probably the single - most concrete and substantive thing an American , young American , could do to lower our carbon footprint is not turning off the lights or driving a Prius , it ’s having fewer kids , having fewer children , ” said Revkin .
“ So should there be , eventually you get , should you get credit–If we ’re going to become carbon - centric–for having a one - child family when you could have had two or three , ” said Revkin .
http://www.cnsnews.com/public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=55667
The above is significant because Revkin is identified in the leaked emails corresponding with the corrupt Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) and has written many pro-global warming articles for the New York Times .
Global Warming and Systemic Financial Fraud
Where would we be in a Zerohedge article without mention of the fraudsters at Goldman Sachs .
No doubt they are present in almost every evil or fraudulent enterprise known to man and global warming is no exception .
Certainly these charlatans plan on making billions trading hallucinated carbon credits on Maurice Strong 's Chicago Climate Exchange ( CCX ) .
Al Gore 's " Carbon Trading " Scam Reeks of Who Else ?
Goldman
http://www.goldmansachs666.com/2009/05/al-gores-carbon-trading-scam-reeks-of.html
These examples illustrate how the global warming fraud is used to push a far - reaching political agenda -- an agenda born out of the unholy fusion of governments , banks , and corrupt scientists .
But let us consider now the content of the leaked emails .
Scientific corruption at the highest levels :

Dear Ray , Mike and Malcolm ,
Once
Tim ’s got a diagram here we ’ll send that either later today or first thing tomorrow .
I ’ve just completed Mike ’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) amd from 1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline .
Mike ’s series got the annual land and marine values while the other two got April - Sept for NH nd N of 20N .
The latter two are real for 1999 , while the estimate for 1999
for NH combined is +0.44C wrt 61-90 .
The Global estimate for 1999 with
data through Oct is +0.35 C cf. 0.57 for 1998 .
Thanks for the comments , Ray .

Obviously the above email speaks for itself .
Despite the glaringly obvious fraud , Phil Jones and his collaborators across the world would have you believe that " trick " and " hiding the decline " are simply normal procedures in any scientific laboratory .
The FORTRAN source code tells a different story .

Discussion
The source code above shows that the scientists involved manipulated their data in order to achieve a predetermined outcome .
This is fraud , plain and simple .
What is worse is these scientists also deliberately deleted the paper trail showing their research was fraudulent when the FOA requests arrived .
This is criminal activity at the highest levels , and these people should be investigated and prosecuted .
The massive amounts of funding they were provided with was used to lie to the public , in order to achieve the objectives of the UN and its affiliated think tanks , whether these scientists were aware of the implication of their corruption or not .
The point is these entire ' climate change ' claims need to be thrown in the trash heap and evaluated by competent scientists without financial or political interests in the outcome of their research .
And above all , the UN's Copenhagen treaty for dramatic forced austerity and international political control should be exposed for the vicious and cynical hoax it actually is .
Copenhagen is the culmination of these fraudulent policies .
National sovereignty will once again be reduced under a treaty conceived and funded by think tanks and international banks .
Massive taxes will be imposed .
Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan will make billions trading hallucinated carbon credits .
Orwellian state policies for tracking individuals and interfering in personal autonomy will become acceptable under the pretext of ' stopping climate change ' , despite the entire rationale being fraudulent .
Monopolistic international finance capital and the billionaire elitists behind it believe they are about to achieve another victory over the unwashed masses with the Copenhagen treaty .
The true political objective behind global warming was proven beyond a doubt in the Club of Rome publication The First Global Revolution .
Keep in mind Al Gore is a member of this elitist group of policymakers , and even chaired a full Club of Rome meeting in Washington DC in 1997 .
" “ The common enemy of humanity is man .
In searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill .
All these dangers are caused by human intervention , and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome .
The real enemy then , is humanity itself . "
- Club of Rome , The First Global Revolution , 1991 .
We should understand that the international political agenda underlying the falsified global warming scandal is , at its core , an ideology of corrupt banks and politicians intent on framing humanity as the enemy , in order to achieve purposes of social control .
Thus , it is no surprise that the ' science ' behind global warming has been exposed as fraudulent .

The worst thing that you or I can do for the planet is to have children .
If they behave as the average person in the rich world does now , they will emit some 11 tonnes of CO ² every year of their lives .
In their turn , they are likely to have more carbon - emitting children who will make an even bigger mess .
If Britain is to meet the government 's target of an 80 % reduction in our emissions by 2050 , we need to start reversing our rising rate of population growth immediately .
And if that makes sense , why not start cutting population everywhere ?
Are condoms not the greenest technology of all ?
World population is forecast to peak at 9.2bn by 2050 .
According to a report by the LSE for the Optimum Population Trust , the lobbying body currently asking parents to " Stop at Two " , it would cost $ 220 m to provide the family planning that would reduce the 2050 population by half a billion , preventing the emission of 34 gigatonnes of carbon .
Introducing low - carbon technology for the same result would cost more than $ 1 trillion .
So why does population control hardly feature on the agendas of the UN bodies or of the governments now committed to tackling climate change ?
And why do the development and environmental groups shy away from it ?
The Guardian 's George Monbiot dismisses the topic as a distraction , the obsession largely of " post - reproductive , middle - class white men… a group more responsible for environmental destruction than any other class in history " .
David King , the government 's former chief scientific adviser , argues : " The only way to tackle climate change is to change the way energy is used by those of us that have already been born . "
It is certainly true that " fewer people equals a greener planet " is simplistic .
In 2050 , 95 % of the extra population will be poor and the poorer you are , the less carbon you emit .
By today 's standards , a cull of Australians or Americans would be at least 60 times as productive as one of Bangladeshis .
As a result , NGOs such as Oxfam , for whom I 've just written a report on climate change 's impact on humans , insist that dealing with consumption in the rich world is much more important than tackling population growth .
According to the International Energy Agency , if the whole world moved over to clean electricity , the CO ² savings would offset the emissions of up to 2.8bn poor people , easily accounting for the entire extra population forecast for 2050 .
But what if we can't reform the way we produce and use energy ?
The most worrying of climate change 's impacts – food and water shortages , forced migration , health epidemics – are exacerbated by population growth .
According to two recent polls , nine out of 10 scientists working in climate change do n't believe we will achieve the changes in energy use committed to by the G8 and the EU .
If they are right , population is going to start to matter a lot .
Do n't we need a fallback plan ?
The NGOs believe it hypocritical to target the poor for having lots of children .
It is one of the universal coping mechanisms of poverty ; our own great - grandparents may well have used it .
And who made the mess , anyway ?
As Rachel Baird , who works on climate change for Christian Aid , says : " Often in the countries where the birth rate is highest , emissions are so low that they are not even measurable .
Look at Burkina Faso . "
So why ask them to pay in unborn children for our profligacy ?
It 's a powerful argument , but it highlights a paradox at the heart of the debate on climate - change adaptation .
It is assumed that vulnerable countries will adapt best through economic development .
The richer a country , the better it will cope with the shocks .
But as countries develop , they emit more carbon .
China 's per person emissions nearly doubled in the first half of this decade , to 4.6 tonnes .
Under normal circumstances , it takes perhaps a generation for the birth rate to drop with increasing wealth , whereas carbon emissions go up very quickly .
As people get richer , they buy cars , use air conditioning , consume more calories and start to swap their vegetables for meat .
So the richer a country gets , the more pressing the need for it to curb its population .
The only nation to have taken steps to do this is China – and the way it went about enforcing the notorious one child policy is one of the reasons the rest of us are so horrified by the notion of state intervention .
Yet China now has 300-400 million fewer people .
It was certainly the most successful governmental attempt to preserve the world 's resources so far .
But lowering birth rate need not be so draconian .
Experience shows it is most effectively done by ensuring women 's equality and improving their education , while providing cheap contraception .
Birth rate , gender equality , education and poverty are inextricably linked .
But how do you reduce population in countries where women 's rights are already achieved and birth - control methods are freely available ?
Could children perhaps become part of an adult 's personal carbon allowance ?
Could you offer rewards : have one child only and you may fly to Florida once a year ?
After all , based on current emissions and life expectancy , one less British child would permit some 30 women in sub-Saharan Africa to have a baby and still leave the planet a cleaner place .
If you have faith in the rich world 's ability to achieve those 80 % cuts in emissions in a mere 40 years , you need not concern yourself too much about population .
But if you are sceptical , you should be worried .
A lot .
Some scientists , the German chancellor 's adviser , Hans Joachim Schellnhuber among them , say that if the cuts are not achieved , we will end up with a planet with a " carrying capacity " of just 1bn humans .
If so , we need to start cutting back population now with methods that offer a humane choice – before it happens the hard way
• This is an edited version of an article that first appeared in the November issue of Prospect magazine .
ISLAMABAD : On fourth day of the military operation in the lawless tribal region of South Waziristan , two bomb blasts went off at a university in Islamabad on Tuesday that left seven people dead and nearly 30 injured , officials said .
Eyewitnesses and police officials said that one attacker struck at a women���s cafeteria of the International Islamic university campus while another bomber blew himself up at the law department of the university .
The blast at the cafeteria left bits of flesh splattered on the floor with shattered window panes .
The second attack took place in the Islamic law department .
At least 29 injured have been shifted to the nearby PIMS hospital in the federal capital where several of them are said to be in critical condition .
The injured included 14 girls and four of them are said to be in serious condition .
The International Islamic University Islamabad ( IIUI ) has more than 12,000 students , nearly half of them women .
Students from around the world attend the university , with most taking Islamic studies .
Interior minister Rehman Malik said that six people were killed ��� two suicide bombers , two men and two women while a senior police official Rana Akmar Hayat told the media that seven people were killed and 29 injured .
�� �Seven people , including two suicide bombers were killed in the twin - attacks while 29 got injured .
Among the dead is one female��� , Rana said at the scene of the attack .
�� �Within seconds , the attacks occurred one after another .
There were 3,000 and 4,000 students on the campus at the time of the attacks��� , said Shandana Butt , a third year law student who saw the attack at cafetaria .
TV footage showed women stained in blood being carried out by security officials and fellow students from the cafeteria building .
Security at educational establishments had been tightened in response to the recent campaign of violence by militants .
In the run-up to the offensive , militants attacked a police station in Peshawar , a United Nations office and the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and three different police facilities in Lahore on the same day .
Before the launch of army operation in Waziristan , it was feared that militants would retaliate by attacking civilians to create panic .
The government knee - jerk reaction was to shut down educational institutions in Islamabad , Lahore , Peshawar and several other cities for one week .
Pakistani forces launched a ground offensive on Saturday to drive out the Taliban and al - Qaida militants from their bases in a tribal region of South Waziristan .
To win support of the tribal people , the Army chief Ashfaq Pervez Kiyani , on Monday , wrote an open letter to the Mehsud tribes of Waziristan , saying : �� �The operation in South Waziristan was not meant to target the brave and patriotic Mehsud tribes , but aimed at ridding them of the elements who had destroyed peace in the region .���
���The target of the operation were Uzbek terrorists , foreign elements and local militants��� , Kiyani said .
The US and other western allies would be uncomfortable over the tactical compromises that Pakistan made with two other Taliban groups in the region controlled by Wana - based Maulvi Nazir , in South Waziristan , and Miramshah - based Hafiz Gul Bahadur , in North Waziristan .
Both Taliban groups were blamed for carrying out significant numbers attacks on Nato and US forces across the border in Afghanistan .

I like to see language implementors ( or creators in this case ) talk about the design challenges or choices they 're facing with in the next version of their languages .
In this video Brendan Eich , the creator of JavaScript , talks about the ES 3.1/4/5 thingy and also explains what features will be added to JavaScript in some near future ( at least for the ECMA standard ) .
I 'll add a couple of comments about the JS features I liked below the video .
Most of the things I liked about the new features of the language are related to Meta - Programming .
These new features describe new behaviors in object properties , like getters and setters , but they are also related to object and property mutability , configuration , visibility , etc.
Getters and Setters were implemented by B.E. more than nine years ago at mozilla , but a new syntax is introduced in the standard by adding a static function to the Object class .
In this example the defineProperty static method of the Object class adds the length property to the obj object .
The get and set methods will be called when accessing or modifying the length property .
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor retrieves the property descriptor of the defined property .
The Object . defineProperty method can also be used to define instance methods :
The method does something similar as inject_into or reduce methods do in other languages :
If configurable=true , the property will be enabled for deletion or to be changed in other ways .
You can set a property to be non-enumerable by setting enumerable =false , and it wo n't be detected in a for in loop ( or in any other " prop " in obj expression ) .
This means that for example we could augment Object .
prototype with methods without having to iterate through them in a for in loop .
The writable property if setted to false wo n't allow you to change the value of that property .
Still no support is added for classical inheritance patterns ( which makes me happy I must confess ) .
Instead , the differential inheritance pattern gets a function that had ( somewhat ) been implemented by frameworks like Closure MooTools and others with the inherits and $ merge functions .
Object.create can be used for implementing prototypical inheritance : you can create a new class A that inherits from B by cloning an object and augmenting it with a Properties object .
For example : However , do n't forget to instantiate the superclass in your subclass constructor : Mutability is nice but sometimes we need to make our objects immutable for design reasons , for security reasons .
These methods change the mutability level of an object .
I hope this was useful to you .
There are a lot more interesting language features to come , so you can read the ECMA draft if you 're interested in knowing more about this new version .
The scene of the shooting was cordoned off
A student has opened fire on classmates at a university in southern Hungary , killing one person and wounding three others , officials say .
The man started shooting during a class in the biophysics research institute at Pecs University , authorities say .
Police said the alleged gunman - a 23 - year - old pharmacology student - ran to a clinic before giving himself up in a phone call .
A first - year male student died of his injuries , an official said .
Those injured were another student , a teacher and a cleaner .
Hungarian Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai said the authorities would provide all possible support to those affected .
" I share the pain of the victim 's family , " he said .
" We do not know yet the reasons for this monstrous act . "
" Nobody can be prepared for this , but to avoid similar tragedies in the future we will have to calmly examine the motives of this one " .
MPAA Tells The FCC : If We Don't Stop Piracy , The Internet Will Die
from the moral - panic dept
The Commission has projected that it could cost $ 350 billion to ubiquitously deploy broadband networks capable of delivering 100 Mbps , which is rapidly becoming the international standard .
The Commission , however , should not ignore that illegal content accounts for a vast amount of online traffic .
Thus , it could generate substantial savings in this tremendous build - out cost -- to be borne by both government and private sector investment -- by encouraging construction of networks that are designed not on the basis of accommodating capacity - hogging transmissions of unlawful content but rather with the goal of providing consumers a rich broadband experience .
[ The ] Commission should pay no heed to assertions by some members of the advocacy community that the problem of content theft can be ignored because some amount of legitimate e-commerce already occurs through vendors such as iTunes ....
The same holds true for the preposterous notion that the law should be ignored unless a property owner can demonstrate that a thief , in the absence of stealing , otherwise would have legitimately purchased a stolen product .
A shoplifter who steals a DVD from a store in a mall is not immune from security intervention , let alone prosecution , simply because he might not have planned to buy the product that he attempted to steal .
Quite clearly , it is the promise of access to the content flowing over the Internet 's network architecture that motivates Americans to adopt broadband .
The Internet without content would be nothing more than a collection of hardware ; a series of computer links and protocols with great capacity to communicate but nothing to say .
Television once was unfairly derided as little more than a toaster with pictures .
In the absence of compelling content , the Internet would offer consumers even less value than that proverbial toaster .
It is the content that flows over and through the Internet that makes the breakthrough technology so potentially powerful .
Throughout history , whenever transformative communications technologies have captured the imagination of consumers , compelling content has been the vehicle for forward progress .
MPAA does not want the Commission 's consideration of the important overarching issue of unlawful online conduct to be derailed by backward - looking debates about the pros and cons of any given technology , particularly those that already have been surpassed by new innovations .
MPAA firmly believes that future developments will yield an entirely new generation of ever - more - sophisticated online protection technologies .
That a tool intended to stop unlawful conduct could be put to ill use , however , is not an argument for prohibiting the use of the tool ....

Never let it be said that the folks in Hollywood are n't good at coming up with a totally fictional horror story .
I just have a problem when they use it not to entertain , but to create a moral panic to push the government to pass laws in their favor .
In discussing the recent 60 Minutes piece that was really nothing more than an MPAA scare tactic , some suggested that it was really just a first step in the process of getting the government to make sure net neutrality rules had a special Hollywood exception .
So , it 's interesting to note that just before thatepisode aired ( and just before Halloween ) , the MPAA sent a " scary " filing to the FCC warning it how the US would always be a broadband laggard if it did n't stomp out piracy .
The full filing ( warning : pdf ) claims , repeatedly , that piracy is sucking up all our bandwidth and getting rid of that would somehow make it cheaper to install faster internet connections .
And , of course , it pushes for kicking file sharers off the internet ( it hides this by calling it " graduated response , " of course , rather than the more common term " three strikes " ) .
The filing also goes on about how the MPAA is just so sure that ISPs can stamp out piracy , and because of that , it thinks the government should force them to get on it .
The MPAA wastes little time mocking those who disagree with its position , and suggesting that the FCC " pay no heed " to consumer concerns :
Except , of course , there 's a huge difference there .
If someone steals a DVD it 's no longer there for someone else to buy .
If someone who never would have purchased the movie views it online .
it 's difficult to see how the MPAA can simply ignore this while assuming that FCC commissioners are too stupid to grasp this rather simple economic concept .
But where the filing really comes into its own in being laughably funny is where it tries to claim that if the FCC does n't do this , the internet will effectively die .
How does it get there ?
Well , first , it claims that the reason people use the internet is to view content from Hollywood .
And , if file sharing keeps up , there wo n't be any of that content left , and then why would anyone use the internet ?
Think that 's an exaggeration ?
How else do you interpret this :
Yes , because even though the internet existed forbefore the folks at the movie studios had even heard of it , they had nothing to say , at all , until people could start sharing the latest camcorded blockbuster .
Do they really think people are this stupid ?
Sorry , Hollywood , but it's not " the content " that you 're thinking about that makes the internet so powerful .
It 's the ability to communicate .
Sure , the content is a nice - to - have , but the internet grew and grew because it let people talk to each other , not because it was another broadcast medium .
This fantasy story by the MPAA also leaves out the fact that more content than ever before is being produced today , even as " piracy " numbers have gone up .
And , oh yes , once again , the movie business is hitting record highs at the box office .
Funny that the MPAA seems to spend so much time insisting that its industry is dying , while leaving out the record revenue bit .
Instead , it just keeps jumping out and yelling that piracy will kill the movie business ...
And then it gets into rewriting history , by insisting thatnew technology is only successful if the big media companies support it : Apparently , the MPAA is unfamiliar with the telephone .
Hopefully , the FCC is a bit more familiar with that particular technology .
The filing goes on and on like this , designed to " scare " the folks at the FCC with a bit of a moral panic , but only inducing laughter ( good show , Hollywood ) from anyone with any actual understanding of technology , history and copyright .
Another favorite tidbit is the MPAA 's demand that the FCC not pay attention to how incredibly screwed upat using technological measures to stop piracy has been in the past :
In other words , please ignore how badly we 've screwed up in the past .
Do n't worry about things like rootkits and security vulnerabilities we 've created .
Also , ignore the fact that DRM does n't work and only punishes our legitimate customers while driving more people to piracy .
That would be a waste of time .
Really .
And finally , I leave you with the most stunning statement of all , along those lines .
One that I 'mthe MPAA lawyers let go through in this filing , because it absolutelycome back to haunt the MPAA in the future .
In responding to concerns from lots of different people , including consumer advocates and consumer electronics firms that the various technological protection measures the MPAA wants to force on ISPs will harm , the MPAA states : Wait ... is n't thatthe argument that the MPAA has used for years against every new file sharing technology out there ?
Was n't it the crux of the Grokster lawsuits ?
That because the tool could be put to ill use , it needed to be prohibited ?
Yet , now , suddenly it does n't want its own technologies prohibited just because they can be put to " ill use . "
Double standard , much ?
This is nothing but a typical moral panic from Hollywood .
They are storytellers out there , and they know how to craft a horror story .
Hopefully , though , the FCC reviewers of this particular fantasy will give it the thumbs down for simply being totally unbelievable .

Why did the comedian lose his rag ?
Because he was sick of people stealing his jokes and posting them on the internet .
An up - and - coming British comic has become involved in a spat with a comedy website after realising that the reason some of his gags were falling flat was that many people in his audience had already read them online .
Gary Delaney noticed that a number of his one - liners had been posted without attribution on Sickipedia.org , a huge online joke compendium .
When he contacted the site and requested that they be taken down , he was subjected to a torrent of abuse at the hands of its users .
The comedian was first alerted to the situation when he noticed that crowds seemed to know what he was about to say , even while he was performing relatively recent material .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" A couple of jokes , I can tell from the audience reaction , have very quickly started to get around , " he told comedy website Chortle .
" A joke I had ...
I could tell that sometimes the audience knew it before I did the punchline , when I had n't even been doing it that long . "
After Mr Delaney contacted Sickipedia and asked its owners to take down his gags , they were replaced with the message : " Joke removed due to a copyright complaint by Gary Delaney , " and a link to his website .
It was not long before an online backlash began .
One of the site 's users , Frypan , wrote : " How about ... we all meet and put a pound into a bucket , and begin a manhunt for Gary Delaney .
Whoever kills him gets the bucket and everyone else still wins .
Seems a worthy proposition , no ? "
Another user , Orifist , wrote : " The biography on Gary Delaney 's website seems to suggest that he 's done nothing of note in about six years .
Copyright that , " before adding an obscenity .
Sickipedia has since introduced a feature allowing the original author of a joke to be credited , although it is still possible to post unattributed material , as the site is supposed to be a forum for budding comedians .
Last night , it hosted its first comedy night in Shoreditch , east London , featuring performances from a handful of its more enthusiastic users .
The site 's administrator , Rob Manuel , who personally apologised to Delaney after the incident , said : " All jokes now have the option of being attributed by anyone who reads them .
The principle – like Wikipedia – [ is that ] many eyes keep things accurate .
I 'd like to stress the site is set up to collect the jokes that do the rounds in pubs , and not to step on the toes of comics on the club circuit . "
Delaney said that both sides had reached an agreement and that he felt the issue had been " resolved " .
However , Sickipedia users were not the only culprits : he also noticed somebody on the micro-blogging website Twitter pilfering his material without crediting him .
" If I post a joke on Twitter , I can't get annoyed if people post that round because I 've already done it on a public forum , " he said .
" But the jokes from my club set are how I make my living , my best and biggest jokes .
It used to be the case that a comic 's set would last decades .
But now I 've got jokes I wrote in May , June and July that are n't working by October because they 've been absolutely trashed around the internet . "
Under UK law , a joke spoken by a comedian during a live performance cannot be copyrighted unless it is recorded or has been written down beforehand .
The idea behind the joke is not protected by copyright , only the expression of that idea – the exact form of words used to tell the gag .
For this reason , comedians such as Jimmy Carr or Delaney – who specialise in " one- liner " jokes which can be easily reproduced verbatim on sites such as Twitter – are far more likely to be subject to plagiarism than those whose humour relies on the telling of long anecdotes , such as Eddie Izzard .
In an interview earlier this year , Milton Jones , another comedian renowned for his one - liners , said the popularity of one of his jokes led to him being heckled during a gig .
" Someone shouted out ' plagiarism ' at a club once to me , and that 's because someone famous used one of my gags on TV .
One of their writers had come around the clubs and nicked it .
If you complain , you become more known as the whingeing comic than for your own career , " said Jones .
In 2006 , Charlotte Harris set up a legal workshop at the Edinburgh Festival , hoping to help emerging comedians safeguard their material against plagiarism .
" I would tell the comedians to write down their material , say what date they wrote it on and stick it on their computer so they had some evidence , " said Ms Harris , who is now a partner at JMW Solicitors .
" Then they have a script of some kind , and if there 's a bit of ad - libbing then that 's fine , because the test for copyright is if it 's substantially the same . "
When is a joke not a joke ?
When it gets you into serious trouble
Stewart Lee v Jack Whitehall
In September , Lee posted a clip of Whitehall , tipped to be the next Russell Brand , on part of his website called " Plagiarists ' Corner " .
Whitehall appeared to have copied a joke in which Lee discussed walking on the Moon , and how dull life would feel afterwards .
A review of Whitehall 's gig accused him of retelling the gag " verbatim " .
However , the pair seem to have made up , as the joke has now disappeared from Whitehall 's set , and Plagiarists '
Corner has gone .
Lee Hurst v an audience member
In September 2008 , Hurst smashed an audience member 's mobile phone because he thought his routine was being filmed .
Hurst was fined £ 60 and ordered to pay compensation and costs after admitting criminal damage .
During his case , he said : " TV programmes have writers writing for the performers and they go around to gigs and take material and sell it to the BBC and ITV and that material is gone .
You are then accused of stealing your own material . "

By swapping a few indium atoms with manganese , chemists have created a new blue chromophore ( J. Am. Chem .
Soc. , DOI : 10.1021/ja9080666 ) .
The Mn- doped substance suggests a route to compounds that could replace existing blue pigments with ones that are cheaper , more stable , and environmentally benign , the researchers say .
“ We were not looking for a blue pigment , ” confesses Oregon State University professor Mas A. Subramanian , who led the research effort .
“ In fact , we were actually looking for a multiferroic material ” — both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric , for instance — and toward that goal were doping YInO 3 with Mn to make YIn 1 - x Mn x O 3 .
Although Subramanian ’s group expected to pull black or gray material from their furnace , they were surprised to see a bright blue powder instead .
“ I had never seen anything like this in all my years working with metal oxides , ” he recalls .
Because YInO 3 is white and YMnO 3 is black , Subramanian wondered what made the new compound blue .
In collaboration with University of California , Santa Barbara ’s Nicola A. Spaldin , his group determined that the color comes from the unusual trigonal bipyramidal coordination of Mn3 + .
This gives rise to energy levels in manganese ’s d orbitals that result in an intense absorption in the red / green region of the visible spectrum .
The reported new composition is unlikely to be used for large - scale pigmentation because of indium ’s cost and toxicity , Subramanian notes .
But his team found they were able to create other blue chromophores by doping Mn3 + into trigonal bipyramidal sites in other metal oxides , such as LuGaMgO 4 .
They are using this strategy to design cost - effective blue pigments using cheaper materials .
“ Today we are still using historical blue pigments like cobalt blue and Prussian blue , despite the fact that there are issues with their toxicity , ” says Patrick M. Woodward , a solid - state chemistry expert at Ohio State University .
“ Subramanian and coworkers have found a simple route to a family of environmentally benign , chemically and thermally stable , bright blue inorganic pigments , ” he says .
[ From " That Which Is Seen , and That Which Is Not Seen , " included in The Bastiat Collection . ]
Have you never chanced to hear it said , " There is no better investment than taxes .
Only see what a number of families it maintains , and consider how it reacts upon industry : it is an inexhaustible stream , it is life itself . "
In order to combat this doctrine , I must refer to my preceding refutation .
Political economy knew well enough that its arguments were not so amusing that it could be said of them , repetitions please .
It has , therefore , turned the proverb to its own use , well convinced that , in its mouth , repetitions teach .
The advantages which officials advocate are those which are seen .
The benefit which accrues to the providers is still that which is seen .
This blinds all eyes .
But the disadvantages which the taxpayers have to get rid of are those which are not seen .
And the injury which results from it to the providers is still that which is not seen , although this ought to be self - evident .
When an official spends for his own profit an extra hundred sous , it implies that a taxpayer spends for his profit a hundred sous less .
But the expense of the official is seen , because the act is performed , while that of the taxpayer is not seen , because , alas , he is prevented from performing it .
You compare the nation , perhaps to a parched tract of land , and the tax to a fertilizing rain .
Be it so .
But you ought also to ask yourself where are the sources of this rain , and whether it is not the tax itself which draws away the moisture from the ground and dries it up ?
Again , you ought to ask yourself whether it is possible that the soil can receive as much of this precious water by rain as it loses by evaporation ?
There is one thing very certain , that when James B. counts out a hundred sous for the tax gatherer , he receives nothing in return .
Afterwards , when an official spends these hundred sous , and returns them to James B. , it is for an equal value in corn or labor .
The final result is a loss to James B. of five francs .
It is very true that often , perhaps very often , the official performs for James B. an equivalent service .
In this case there is no loss on either side ; there is merely an exchange .
Therefore , my arguments do not at all apply to useful functionaries .
All I say is — if you wish to create an office , prove its utility .
Show that its value to James B. , by the services which it performs for him , is equal to what it costs him .
But , apart from this intrinsic utility , do not bring forward as an argument the benefit which it confers upon the official , his family , and his providers ; do not assert that it encourages labor .
When James B. gives a hundred sous to a government officer for a really useful service , it is exactly the same as when he gives a hundred sous to a shoemaker for a pair of shoes .
But when James B. gives a hundred sous to a government officer , and receives nothing for them unless it be annoyances , he might as well give them to a thief .
It is nonsense to say that the government officer will spend these hundred sons to the great profit of national labor ; the thief would do the same ; and so would James B. , if he had not been stopped on the road by the extralegal parasite , nor by the lawful sponger .
Let us accustom ourselves , then , to avoid judging of things by what is seen only , but to judge of them by that which is not seen .
Last year I was on the Committee of Finance , for under the constituency the members of the opposition were not systematically excluded from all the commissions : in that the constituency acted wisely .
We have heard M . Thiers say , " I have passed my life in opposing the legitimist party and the priest party .
Since the common danger has brought us together , now that I associate with them and know them , and now that we speak face to face , I have found out that they are not the monsters I used to imagine them . "
Yes , distrust is exaggerated , hatred is fostered among parties who never mix ; and if the majority would allow the minority to be present at the commissions , it would perhaps be discovered that the ideas of the different sides are not so far removed from each other ; and , above all , that their intentions are not so perverse as is supposed .
However , last year I was on the Committee of Finance .
Every time that one of our colleagues spoke of fixing at a moderate figure the maintenance of the President of the Republic , that of the ministers , and of the ambassadors , it was answered ,
" For the good of the service , it is necessary to surround certain offices with splendor and dignity , as a means of attracting men of merit to them .
A vast number of unfortunate persons apply to the President of the Republic , and it would be placing him in a very painful position to oblige him to be constantly refusing them .
A certain style in the ministerial saloons is a part of the machinery of constitutional governments . "
Although such arguments may be controverted , they certainly deserve a serious examination .
They are based upon the public interest , whether rightly estimated or not ; and as far as I am concerned , I have much more respect for them than many of our Catos have , who are actuated by a narrow spirit of parsimony or of jealousy .
But what revolts the economical part of my conscience , and makes me blush for the intellectual resources of my country , is when this absurd relic of feudalism is brought forward , which it constantly is , and it is favorably received too :
" Besides , the luxury of great government officers encourages the arts , industry , and labor .
The head of the state and his ministers cannot give banquets and soirées without causing life to circulate through all the veins of the social body .
To reduce their means would starve Parisian industry and consequently that of the whole nation . "
I must beg you , gentlemen , to pay some little regard to arithmetic , at least ; and not to say before the National Assembly in France , lest to its shame it should agree with you , that an addition gives a different sum , according to whether it is added up from the bottom to the top , or from the top to the bottom of the column .
For instance , I want to agree with a drainer to make a trench in my field for a hundred sous .
Just as we have concluded our arrangement the tax - gatherer comes , takes my hundred sous , and sends them to the Minister of the Interior ; my bargain is at end , but the minister will have another dish added to his table .
Upon what ground will you dare to affirm that this official expense helps the national industry ?
Do you not see , that in this there is only a reversing of satisfaction and labor ?
A minister has his table better covered , it is true ; but it is just as true that an agriculturist has his field worse drained .
A Parisian tavern - keeper has gained a hundred sous , I grant you ; but then you must grant me that a drainer has been prevented from gaining a hundred sous .
It all comes to this — that the official and the tavern - keeper being satisfied , is that which is seen ; the field undrained , and the drainer deprived of his job , is that which is not seen .
Dear me !
how much trouble there is in proving that two and two make four ; and if you succeed in proving it , it is said “ the thing is so plain it is quite tiresome , ” and they vote as if you had proved nothing at all .
When U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at the Port of Los Angeles opened a shipping container bound for the Netherlands , they discovered a 1965 Volkswagen bus stolen in Washington state 35 years ago .
Far out , man !
The unusual seizure of the bus on Oct. 19 came during a routine inspection of several Volkswagens that were being shipped by an Arizona restorer to customers in Europe .
The vehicle identification number of the bus , which was swiped in Spokane on July 12 , 1974 , was still in police computers .
“ Pretty amazing , is n’t it ? ” customs spokesman Jaime Ruiz said Thursday when the find was announced .

The restorer , who was not identified , is n’t a suspect in the long - ago theft , authorities said .
“ He ’s a victim himself .
He was an innocent purchaser , ” said Mike Maleta , an investigator with the California Highway Patrol , who will attempt to trace the vehicle ’s ownership back through interviews and registration documents .
“ I ’m going to try my best to find the crook , ” he said .
Groovy .

Maleta said Spokane police could n’t find the owner .
“ Allstate paid her $ 2,500 or so to settle the claim , ” he said .
“ Now it ’s worth $ 25,000 . . . .
It ’s in pristine condition .
It looks like it ’s brand new .
So Allstate wanted it . ”

One of the claims in this hacked CRU email saga goes something like “ Well , the scientists acted like jerks , but that does n’t affect the results , it ’s still warming . ”
I got intrigued by one of the hacked CRU emails , from the Phil Jones and Kevin Trenberth to Professor Wibjorn Karlen .
In it , Professor Karlen asked some very pointed questions about the CRU and IPCC results .
He got incomplete , incorrect and very misleading answers .
Here ’s the story , complete with pictures .
I have labeled the text to make it clear who is speaking , including my comments .
From Jones and Trenberth to Wibjorn Karlen , 17 Sep 2008 ( email # 1221683947 ) .
[ Trenberth ]
Hi Wibjorn
It appears that your concern is mainly with the surface temperature record , and my co lead author in IPCC , Phil Jones , is best able to address those questions .
However the IPCC only uses published data plus their extensions and in our Chapter the sources of the data are well documented , along with their characteristics .
I offer a few more comments below ( my comments are limited as I am on vacation and away from my office ) .
[ Karlen to Trenberth ] Uppsala 17 September 2008 , Dear Kevin ,
In short , the problem is that I cannot find data supporting the temperature curves in IPCC and also published in e.g.
Forster , P. et al .
2007 : Assessing uncertainty in climate simulation .
Nature 4 : 63 -64 .
[ My comments ]
Here is the figure from Nature , Assessing uncertainty in climate simulations , Piers Forster et al. , Nature Reports Climate Change , 63 ( 2007 ) doi:10.1038/climate.2007.46a
Original Caption : Figure 1 : Comparison of observed continental - and global - scale changes in surface temperature with results simulated by climate models using natural and anthropogenic forcings .
Decadal averages of observations are shown for the period 1906 to 2005 ( black line ) plotted against the centre of the decade and relative to the corresponding average for 1901 – 1950 .
Lines are dashed where spatial coverage is less than 50 % .
Blue shaded bands show the 5 – 95 % range for 19 simulations from five climate models using only the natural forcings due to solar activity and volcanoes .
Red shaded bands show the 5 –95 % range for 58 simulations from 14 climate models using both natural and anthropogenic forcings .
SOURCE : http://www.nature.com/climate/2007/0709/full/climate.2007.46a.html
Here is the IPCC figure he is referring to , Fig. 9.12 , once again with the black lines showing the instrumentally measured temperatures :
Original Caption : Figure 9.12 .
Comparison of multi- model data set 20C3 M model simulations containing all forcings ( red shaded regions ) and containing natural forcings only ( blue shaded regions ) with observed decadal mean temperature changes ( °C ) from 1906 to 2005 from the Hadley Centre / Climatic Research Unit gridded surface temperature data set ( HadCRUT3 ; Brohan et al. , 2006 ) .
The panel labelled GLO shows comparison for global mean ; LAN , global land ; and OCE , global ocean data .
Remaining panels display results for 22 sub - continental scale regions ( see the Supplementary Material , Appendix 9.C for a description of the regions ) .…
Note that around the globe , temperatures are shown as rising from 1900 to about 1930 , falling or staying level until the mid ’ 70s , and then rising sharply after that .
So these are the curves that Professor Karlen is attempting to reconstruct .
Note that the IPCC chapter identifies these as “ sub - continental regions ” and shows separate data for ocean regions .
[ Karlen ]
In attempts to reconstruct the temperature I find an increase from the early 1900s to ca 1935 , a trend down until the mid 1970s and so another increase to about the same temperature level as in the late 1930s .
A distinct warming to a temperature about 0.5 deg C above the level 1940 is reported in the IPCC diagrams .
I have been searching for this recent increase , which is very important for the discussion about a possible human influence on climate , but I have basically failed to find an increase above the late 1930s .
[ Trenberth ]
This region , as I am sure you know , suffers from missing data and large gaps spatially .
How one covered both can greatly influence the outcome .
In IPCC we produce an Arctic curve and describe its problems and character .
In IPCC the result is very conservative owing to lack of inclusion of the Arctic where dramatic decreases in sea ice in recent years have taken place : 2005 was lowest at the time we did our assessment but 2007 is now the record closely followed by 2008 .
Anomalies of over 5C are evident in some areas in SSTs but the SSTs are not established if there was ice there previously .
These and other indicators show that there is no doubt about recent warming ; see also chapter 4 of IPCC .
[ My comment ]
As I will show below , everything he says about the ocean and the sea ice and the sea surface temperatures ( SSTs ) is meaningless .
The IPCC figure is solely for the land .
[ Karlen ]
In my letter to Klass V I included diagram showing the mean annual temperature of the Nordic countries ( 1890 - ca 2001 ) presented on the net by the database NORDKLIM , a joint project between the meteorological institutes in the Nordic countries .
Except for Denmark , the data sets show an increase after the 1970s to the same level as in the late 1930s or lower .
None demonstrates the distinct increase IPCC indicates .
The trends of these 6 areas are very similar except for a few interesting details .
[ Trenberth ]
Results will also depend on the exact region .
[ My comments ]
I cannot find the NORDKLIM graphic he refers to , so I have calculated it myself .
I used the NORDKLIM dataset available at http://www.smhi.se/hfa_coord/nordklim/data/Nordklim_data_set_v1_0_2002.xls.
I removed the one marine record from “ Ship M ” .
To avoid infilling where there are missing records , I took the “ first difference ” of all of the available records for each year and averaged them .
Then I used a running sum to calculate the average anomaly .
I did not remove cities or adjust for the Urban Heat Island ( UHI ) effect .
Here is the result :
You can see that , as Professor Karlen said , this does not show what the “ Northern Europe ” part of the IPCC graph shows .
It is exactly as Professor Karlen stated , in the NORDKLIM data it rises until 1930 , there is a drop from 1930 to 1970 , followed by an increase after the 1970s to a temperature slightly lower than the 1930s .
( In fact , the rise from 1880 until 1930 dwarfs the recent rise since the 1970’s ) .
Here , for comparison , is a blowup of the “ Northern Europe ” graph from Fig. 9.12 above :
This claims that there is a full degree temperature rise from 1970 to 2000 , ending way warmer than the 1930s .
You can see why Professor Karlen is wondering how the IPCC got such a different answer .
[ Karlen ]
I have in my studies of temperatures also checked a number of areas using data from NASA .
One , in my mind interesting study , includes all the 13 stations with long and decent continuously records north of 65 deg N .
The pattern is the same as for the Nordic countries .
This diagram only shows 11 - yr means of individual stations .
A few stations such as Verhojans and Svalbard indicate a recent mean 11 - year temperature increase up to 0.5 deg C above the late 1930s .
Verhojansk , shows this increase but the temperature has after the peak temperature decreased with about 0.3 deg C during the last few years .
The majority of the stations show that the recent temperatures are similar to the one in the late 1930s .
In preparation of some talks I have been invited to give , I have expanded the Nordic area both west and east .
The area of similar change in climate is vast .
Only a few stations near Bering Strait deviates ( e.g. St Paul , Kodiak , Nome , located south of 65 deg . N ) .
My studies include Africa , a study which took me most of a summer because there are a large number of stations in the NASA records .
I found 11 stations including data from 1898 - 1975 and 16 stations including 1950 - 2003 .
The data sets could in a convincing way be spliced .
However , I noticed that some persons were not familiar with ‘ splicing ’ technique so I have accepted to reduce the study to the 7 stations including data from the whole period between 1898 - 2003 .
The results are similar as to the spliced data set andalso , surprisingly similar to the variability of the Nordic data .
Regression indicates a minor ( if any ) decrease in temperature ( I have used all stations independent of location , city location or not ) .
[ Trenberth ] Africa is notorious for missing and inaccurate data and needs careful assessment .
[ Karlen ]
Another example is Australia .
NASA only presents 3 stations covering the period 1897 - 1992 .
What kind of data is the IPCC Australia diagram based on ?
If any trend it is a slight cooling .
However , if a shorter period ( 1949 - 2005 ) is used , the temperature has increased substantially .
The Australians have many stations and have published more detailed maps of changes and trends .
There are more examples , but I think this is much enough for my present point :
How has the laboratories feeding IPCC with temperature records selected stations ?
[ Trenberth ]
See our chapter and the appendices .
[ My comment ] I have looked at these .
The source for Fig. 9.1.2 is given as “ ( HadCRUT3 ; Brohan et al. , 2006 ) ” .
HadCRUT3 is produced jointly by CRU and the Hadley Centre .
[ Karlen ]
I have noticed that major cities often demonstrate a major urban effect ( Buenos Aires , Osaka , New York Central Park , etc ) .
Have data from major cities been used by the laboratories sending data to IPCC ?
Lennart Bengtsson and other claims that the urban effect is accounted for but from what I read , it seems like the technique used has been a simplistic [ Trenberth ]
Major inner cities are excluded : their climate change is real but very local .
[ My comment ]
It is true that the IPCC Chapter 3 FAQ says this :
Additional warming occurs in cities and urban areas ( often referred to as the urban heat island effect ) , but is confined in spatial extent , and its effects are allowed for both by excluding as many of the affected sites as possible from the global temperature data and by increasing the error range ( the blue band in the figure ) .
To check this claim , I took the list of temperature stations used by CRU ( which I had to use an FOI to get ) , and checked them against the GISS list .
The GISS list categorizes stations as “ Urban ” or “ Rural ” .
It also uses satellite photos to categorize the amount of light that shows at night , with big cities being brightest .
It puts them into three categories , A , B , and C. C is the brightest .
It turns out that there are over 500 cities in the CRU database that the GISS database categorizes as “ Urban C ” , the brightest of cities .
These include , among many others :
AUCKLAND , NEW ZEALAND
BANGKOK METROPOLIS , THAILAND
BARCELONA , SPAIN
BEIJING , CHINA
BRASILIA , BRAZIL
BRISBANE , AUSTRALIA
BUENOS AIRES , ARGENTINA
CHRISTCHURCH , NEW ZEALAND
DHAKA , BANGLADESH
FLORENCE , ITALY
GLASGOW , UK
GUATEMALA CITY , GUATEMALA
HANNOVER , GERMANY
INCHON , KOREA
KHARTOUM , SUDAN
KYOTO , JAPAN
LISBON , PORTUGAL
LUXOR , EGYPT
MARRAKECH , MOROCCO
MOMBASA , KENYA
MOSKVA , RUSSIAN FEDERA
MOSUL , IRAQ
NAGASAKI , JAPAN
NAGOYA , JAPAN
NICE , FRANCE
OSAKA , JAPAN
PRETORIA , SOUTH AFRICA
RIYADH , SAUDI ARABIA
SAO PAULO , BRAZIL
SEOUL , KOREA
SHANGHAI , CHINA
SINGAPORE , SINGAPORE
STOCKHOLM , SWEDEN
TEGUCIGALPA , HONDURAS
TOKYO , JAPAN
VALENCIA , SPAIN
VOLGOGRAD , USSR
So the CRU is using Tokyo ?
Beijing ?
Seoul ?
Shanghai ?
Moscow ?
Their claim is entirely false .
In other words , once again the good folk of the CRU are blowing smoke .
I can understand why it took me a Freedom of Information request to get the station list .
[ Karlen ]
Next step has been to compare my results with temperature records in the literature .
One interesting figures is published by you in : Trenberth , K. , 2005 : Uncertainty in Hurricanes and Global Warming .
Science 308 : 1753-1754 .
As you obviously know , the recent increase in temperature above the 1940s is minor between 10 deg N and 20 deg N and only slightly larger above the temperature maximum in the early 1950s .
Both the increases in temperature in the 1930s and in the 1980s to 1990s is of similar amplitude and similar steepness , if any difference possibly slightly less steep in the northern area than in the southern ( the eddies slow down the warm water transport ) .
Your diagram describes a limited area of the North Atlantic because you are primarily interested in hurricanes .
The complexity of sea surface temperature increases and decreases is seen in e.g.
Cabanes , C , et al 2001 ( Science 294 : 840-842 ) .
[ Trenberth ]
As we discuss , there is a lot of natural variability in the North Atlantic but there is also a common component that relates to global changes .
See my GRL article with Shea for more details .
Trenberth , K. E. , and D. J. Shea , 2006 : Atlantic hurricanes and natural variability in 2005 .
Geophys .
Res. Lett. , 33 , L12704 , doi:10.1029/2006GL026894 . [ Karlen ]
One example of sea surface temperature is published by : Goldenberg , S.B. , Landsea , C.W. , Mestas - Nuoez , A.M. and Gray , W.M. , 2001 : The recent increases in Atlantic hurricane activity : causes and implications .
Science 293 : 474-479 .
Again , there is a marked increase in temperature in the 1930s and 1950s ( about 1 deg C ) , a decrease to approximately the level in the 1910s and thereafter a new increase to a temperature slightly below the level in the1940s .
One example of published data not supporting a major temperature increase during recent time is : Polyakov , I.V. , Bekryaev , R.V. , Alekseev , G.H. , Bhatt , U.S. , Colony , R.L. , Johnson , M.A. , Maskshtas , A.P. and Walsh , D. , 2003 : Variability and Trends of Air Temperature and Pressure in the Maritime Arctic , 1875 - 2000 .
Journal of Climate : Vol. 16 ( 12 ) : 2067ñ2077 .
He included many more stations than I did in my calculation of temperatures N 65 N , but the result is similar .
It is hard to find evidence of a drastic warming of the Arctic .
It is also difficult to find evidence of a drastic warming outside urban areas in a large part of the world outside Europe .
However the increase in temperature in Central Europe may be because the whole area is urbanized ( see e.g .
Bidwell , T. , 2004 : Scotobiology – the biology of darkness .
Global change News Letter No. 58 June , 2004 ) .
So , I find it necessary to object to the talk about a scaring temperature increase because of increased human release of CO2 .
In fact , the warming seems to be limited to densely populated areas .
The often mentioned correlation between temperature and CO2 is not convincing .
If there is a factor explaining a major part of changes in the temperature , it is solar irradiation .
There are numerous studies demonstrating this correlation but papers are not accepted by IPCC .
Most likely , any reduction of CO2 release will have no effect whatsoever on the temperature ( independent of how expensive ) .
[ Trenberth ]
You can object all you like but you are not looking at the evidence and you need to have a basis , which you have not established .
You seem to doubt that CO2 has increased and that it is a greenhouse gas and you are very wrong .
But of course there is a lot of variability and looking at one spot narrowly is not the way to see the big picture .
[ My comment ] Professor Karlen was quite correct .
The claims made by the CRU , and repeated in the IPCC document , were false .
Karlen was looking at the evidence .
[ Karlen ]
In my mind , we have to accept that it is great if we can reduce the release of CO2 because we are using up a resource the earth will be short of in the future , but we are in error if we claims a global warming caused by CO2 .
[ Trenberth ] I disagree .
[ My comment ]
No comment .
[ Karlen ]
I also think we had to protest when erroneous data like the claim that winter temperature in Abisko increased by 5.5 deg C during the last 100 years .
The real increase is 0.4 deg C.
The 5.5 deg C figure has been repeated a number of times in TV - programs .
This kind of exaggerations is not supporting attempts to save fossil fuel .
I have numerous diagrams illustrating the discussion above .
I do n’t include these in an e-mail because my computer can only handle a few at a time .
If you would like to see some , I can send them by air mail .
I am often asked about why I do n’t publish about my views .
I have .
Just one example of among 100 other I could select is : Karlen , W. , 2001 : Global temperature forces by solar irradiation and greenhouse gases ?
Ambio 30 ( 6 ) : 349-350 .
Yours sincerely Wibjorn , [ Trenberth ] I trust that Phil Jones may also respond From : P.Jones To : trenbert Subject : Re : Climate Date : Wed , 17 Sep 2008 16:39:07 +0100 ( BST ) Cc : Wibjorn Karlen [ Jones to Professor Karlen , same email ]
Wibjorn , I ’m in Athens at the moment .
Unless you ’re referring specifically to the Arctic the temperature curves in IPCC Ch 3 all include the oceans .
[ My comment ] Absolutely not .
The legend for Fig. 9.1.2 ( see above ) says “ ( see the Supplementary Material , Appendix 9.C for a description of the regions ) ” Appendix 9.C in turn describes the calculations :
6 . Apply land / ocean mask on observations .
Plots describing observed changes in land or ocean areas were based on observed data that was masked to retain land or ocean data only ( necessary to remove islands and marine stations not existent in models ) .
This masking was performed as in Step 3 , using the land area fraction data from the CCSM3 model .
Note that the ocean is entirely masked out of the observations .
And the regions are described as :
Note 2 : List of Regions

So no , that excuse wo n’t wash .
Once again Professor Karlan is quite correct .
The observations simply do n’t match the CRU / IPCC claims .
Phil Jones ’ story about the regions including the ocean is false .
[ Jones ] Fennoscandia is just a small part of the NH .
When I ’m back next week , I ’ll be able to calculate the boxes that encompass Fennoscandia , so you can compare with this region .
As you ’re aware Anders did lots of the update work in 2001 - 2002 and he included all the NORDKLIM data .
I can send you a list of the Fennoscandian data if you want – either the sites used or their data as well .
I guess you ’re attachments are in your direct email , which I come to later .
One final thing – we are getting SST data in from some of the new sea-ice free parts of the Arctic .
We are not using these as we ’ve yet to figure out how to as we do n’t have normals for these ‘ mostly covered by sea ice in the 1961 - 90 ’ areas .
Cheers Phil
[ My comments ]
Now , I have not taken a stand on whether the machinations of the CRU extended to actually altering the global temperature figures .
It seems quite clear from Professor Karlen ’s observations , however , that they have gotten it very wrong in at least the Fennoscandian region .
Since this region has very good records and a lot of them , this does not bode well for the rest of the globe …
My best to everyone ,

“ Perfection is achieved , not when there is nothing more to add , but when there is nothing left to take away . ” – Antoine de Saint - Exupery
Spring Break of my freshman year of college I went on a 4 - day backpacking trip in the Gila Wilderness of New Mexico .
My partner in adventure , Lucas , was a former Wyoming backpacking guide turned potter - philosopher , the perfect companion for days wandering the woods processing what comes about with the sudden cleaving from the static of modern living .
A year prior we had traipsed around Wrangell - St. Elias National Park in Alaska on a 14 - day trip that cemented our friendship …and wanderlust .
While discussing the details of the Gila trip , we decided to challenge ourselves to go ultralight .
The total weight of our gear , including backpack , could not exceed 20 lbs .
It seemed fairly simple , but after pulling out my backpack I was shocked to learn that I ’d been carrying around 50 lbs of gadgets , gizmos and outdoor accoutrement on previous trips .
Shuddering at the ridiculousness of trying to take so much of the world with me when the point was to leave it behind , I began to scrub my packing list .
I started with a quick kill of substituting a one - man bivouac sac ( 1lb 10 oz ) for the two - man tent ( 9lbs ) I had previously carried .
Next was less clothing , a foam pad instead of an inflatable one , a small aluminum pot rather than a cooking set , etc … . it took a while , but I finally got it down to 20 lbs .
Then the “ what if ’s ” began to flood my mind .
What if we got stuck out there for longer ?
What if we did n’t have enough food , clothing , and emergency gear ?
I threw in a few extra granola bars just to calm my nerves .
After one day on the trail my fears were alleviated , and Lucas and I knew we were on to something big – the benefits of going ultralight far outweighed any losses in comfort or feelings of security .
Nights around the fire were previously spent nursing sore bodies ; now we felt great .
The amount of mileage we comfortably traveled in a day doubled as we found ourselves jogging down small sections of the trail when we got restless .
Scrambling up steep sections would have been slow torture with 50 lbs on our backs ; now we were able to go explore remote areas that offered the best scenic views .
After 4 - days we had covered over 25 - miles , but it had seemed much less .
To say the trip went well would be an understatement – in going ultralight we had unexpectedly discovered the benefits of minimalism – simplicity , efficiency and freedom .
The Goods Life
“ The things you own end up owning you . ” – Tyler Durden , Fight Club
It had been 7 years since my Gila trip and life had moved forward .
There was now a wife , baby , and career .
I found myself roaming the halls of our newly - built 3 - bed , 2 - bath suburban home fuming that we did n’t have enough storage space .
During college I could carry everything I owned in the back of my Dodge pickup .
Now 1,600 square feet was not adequate to house our growing collection of stuff .
Something was wrong with this picture .
How had I accumulated so many random things in such a short period ?
I wondered , “ Had men in the past confronted this suffocating malady ? ” Somehow I could n’t imagine John Wayne wondering where to put his new artisan wine rack .
My father came to mind .
His possessions never occupied a greater place in his life than seemed due .
As a boy I used to sit on the bed watching him as he went through his end - of - day routine .
Cuff links , handkerchief , pocket knife , wallet – each used on a daily basis , each set in their proper place on top of his dresser .
Yes , my dad had “ things , ” but only what he needed and nothing more .
Like a well - seasoned outdoorsman , he understood exactly what was necessary to survive , each tool having a specific purpose .
Granted , my father was a lawyer so his days were spent surviving the jungles of the courtroom rather than those of some remote continent , but the manliness of his effortless utility left a great impression on me even then .
Thinking about men I admired , it dawned on me that most had a quiet contempt towards any excess of material possessions .
Their expertise and confidence were displayed by the fact that they did not require much to live successfully .
They could just as easily get along for a week in the woods with nothing but a knife as they could living in a posh suburban neighborhood with all its amenities .
Possessions had no control over the trajectory of their lives .
They were not gadget junkies , seeking their fix from the latest Best Buy sale .
They were in control of the things they owned , not the other way around .
Real manliness meant freedom from the bondage of material goods .
Inspiration charged through my blood , but then came the inevitable “ now what ? ”
I wanted to shatter the bonds of materialist slavery , but how did that idea translate into real life , with all its strollers , high - definition t.v. ’s and bread makers ?
As I searched for answers … and storage space , I stumbled upon my backpack and was immediately reminded of Lucas and my adventures .
Like a bolt of suburban - lightening , a thought came to me :
Just as I needed to scrub my packing list for the Gila trip , my lifestyle of uber - consumption needed a similar scrubbing .
Simplicity , efficiency and freedom were n’t just for outdoor adventures , they were for the in - between times as well .
Learning to Live the Minimalist Life
“ Simplicity , simplicity , simplicity !
I say let your affairs be as one , two , three and not a hundred or a thousand …
We are happy in proportion to the things we can do without . ” – Henry David Thoreau .
Lucas and I had uncovered a more efficient way to backpack ; I needed a more efficient way for my family and I to live .
Surfing the internet for others with similar problems , I found blog after blog praising the benefits of the minimalist lifestyle .
It appeared that our family was n’t the only one fed up with the constant accumulation of things .
After reading tales of people taking positive action to reduce the amount of clutter in their lives , I ended up at the blog of Mr. Zen Habits himself , Leo Babauta .
The man whose blog has brought the art of less to thousands had just written an e-book , “ The Simple Guide to a Minimalist Life , ” where he answered the question , “ what is the minimalist lifestyle ? ” with the following ,
It ’s one that is stripped of the unnecessary , to
make room for that which gives you joy .
It ’s a removal of clutter in all its forms ,
leaving you with peace and freedom and
lightness .
A minimalist eschews the mindset of more , of
acquiring and consuming and shopping , of
bigger is better , of the burden of stuff .
A minimalist instead embraces the beauty of
less , the aesthetic of spareness , a life of
contentedness in what we need and what
makes us truly happy .
A minimalist realizes that acquiring stuff
does n’t make us happy .
That earning more
and having more are meaningless .
That
filling your life with busy - ness and
freneticism is n’t desirable , but something to
be avoided .
A minimalist values quality , not quantity , in
all forms .
The last point stuck .
The great men I knew did n’t care about having much , but what they did possess had value .
Whether by connection to a time , place , or person , the things in their life meant something .
An old pocket watch , a beautifully engraved humidor , a good pair of work boots that had lasted a lifetime — ageless , well - crafted …quality .
And though they had value , the possessions of these men were held onto loosely .
They seemed to understand that like a handful of sand , the tighter you squeeze the less you can hold .
At the end of my life what would my children and their children find as they searched through my belongings ?
Boxes upon boxes of useless crap , once trendy and exciting , now just a burden to be thrown out ?
Or a few heart - felt belongings to be passed down through generations ?
Not things by which to be held captive , but meaningful items to be used , enjoyed and eventually passed on to someone else .
And so I began going through each room of my house , searching for one item to throw or give away .
It was n’t life - changing , but it was a start .
With each room I began to realize that many of the things I had purchased with such anticipation and fanfare had quickly been relegated to a dark corner of the closet as their novelty wore off , never to be touched again .
I knew that possessions did n’t equal happiness , but it was apparent that I had been learning this lesson over and over again for the past several years .
Each small step towards a life of less felt like a powerful blow to what had become a vicious cycle .
So , you ask , is throwing away a few old books or t- shirts every once and in awhile all it means to be a minimalist ?
Hardly .
While decluttering your life is a great place to start , minimalism is about changing one ’s whole approach to life and opting out of the race to accumulate more .
Advertising convinces us of needs we did n’t know existed and exploits our emptiness by promising fulfillment for a few easy payments of $ 19.99 .
The shopping mall has become our temple , the credit card our burnt offering …yet , the sacrifice is never sufficient for salvation .
Being a minimalist means one simply quits buying in .
The following are the principles of living the minimalist life as laid out by Babauta :
Leo ’s Principles of Living the Minimalist Life
1. Omit needless things .
Notice this does n’t say to omit everything .
Just needless things .
2. Identify the essential .
What ’s most important to you ?
What makes you happy ?
What will have the highest impact on your life , your career ?
3 . Make everything count .
Whatever you do or keep in your life , make it worthy of keeping .
Make it really count .
4 . Fill your life with joy .
Do n’t just empty your life .
Put something wonderful in it .
5. Edit , edit .
Minimalism is n’t an end point .
It ’s a constant process of editing , revisiting , editing some more .
I would add the following :
6 . Hold on loosely .
Even to your prized possessions .
At the end of the day its relationships , not possessions , that make life worth living .
It ’s simple , not easy .
But the rewards of digging into the minimalist life are there for anyone willing to take a few small steps each day .
Of course , most will choose to continue their present habits , but as for me and my house , we ’ve chosen a life of less …and in doing so have gained so much more .
There is “ a lot of evidence ” that Vice President Dick Cheney gave false statements to the FBI during its investigation of the Valerie Plame leak affair , says former White House attorney John Dean .
Dean told MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann that Cheney attained “ something of a record ” by refusing to answer or claiming to not recall the answer to 72 questions posed by the FBI during a May , 2004 , interview .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If you ’ll recall , former Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman did 150 ‘ I do n’t recalls ’ during his three days before the Senate Watergate committee , ” Dean said .
“ This is 72 in less than three hours , that ’s right up there . ”
The comparison is striking , because Haldeman served 18 months in prison for conspiracy and obstruction of justice in the Watergate scandal .
“ There ’s a lot of evidence that [ Cheney ] gave a number of false statements to federal officials , which is clearly a federal offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 , and it could well be obstruction of justice , ” Dean said on MSNBC ’s Countdown Monday night .
Dean added that “ it ’s not clear why Fitzgerald did not aggressively pursue this , ” referring to US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald , who prosecuted the Plame leak case .
Last month , a federal judge ruled that the FBI cannot keep secret the 2004 interview with Cheney .
The investigation that the interview was a part of led to the prosecution of Cheney ’s chief of staff , Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , over the leaking of CIA undercover operative Valerie Plame ’s identity to the public , after her husband , Joseph Wilson , questioned the accuracy of some of the Bush administration ’s “ intelligence ” about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
ADVERTISEMENT
Libby was never convicted of leaking Plame ’s identity , but he was convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury in relation to the case .
President George W. Bush commuted Libby ’s sentence in 2007 .
It has since been reported that Cheney pressured Bush to pardon Libby .
As Olbermann noted , during the interview , Cheney said he “ could not recall telling Libby Plame ’s identity , Libby reminding him of this fact later on , or that Libby had leaked Plame ’s name to reporters , but did remember that he wanted [ White House ] spokesman Scott McClellan to tell reporters Libby had not leaked Plame ’s name .
He admitted he learned Plame ’s name well before Libby , from CIA Director George Tenet . ”
To Dean , Cheney ’s insistence that Libby be pardoned suggests that Libby was the fall guy for Cheney in the investigation .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It clearly shows in this testimony , as well as in all his other actions , that Libby fell on his sword for his boss , ” Dean told Olbermann .
“ His boss obviously felt an obligation and wanted to maintain that relationship of confidentiality . ”
Dean said that Cheney is safe from prosecution , because “ he has now gotten himself beyond the statute of limitations . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Dean should know a thing or two about obstruction of justice .
As White House counsel in the Nixon administration , he was sentenced to 30 months in prison for obstruction of the Watergate investigation .
His sentence was reduced to four months after he testified against other Nixon White House staffers , including Haldeman .

Here ’s a real - life superhero dilemma :
What do you do when you ’re the world ’s most powerful news and opinion magazine , carrying the English - language torch of freedom on behalf of your million - plus high - net - worth readers across the globe , and suddenly you spot injustice on the Eurasian horizon :
Sham elections in an oil - rich Eurasian country , resulting in a one - party parliament ; its autocratic leader just pushed through constitutional amendments allowing him to remain in power for life ; and it ’s waging a campaign to bully Western oil companies out of their lucrative oil fields , in spite of contracts and investments made .
If the country in question is Kazakhstan , and you ’re The Economist , then you know exactly what to do :
Put Vladimir Putin on the cover and scare the shit out of your readers by sounding the “ Hitler Alarm ! ” threat he poses to mankind .
It does n’t matter that you run a version of this story almost every week .
Or that the story you decide to run in the wake of Kazakhstan ’s sham elections happens to have been run in almost the exact same form by all of your colleagues FOUR FUCKING YEARS AGO .
For The Economist , the Putin - as - Fascist story is n’t bound by traditional Newtonian concepts of time or space , let alone the basic principles of Western journalism .
It ’s a story that can be played like a deck of trump cards .
No matter what else happens in the world – for example , the mega - clusterfuck in Iraq , a war that The Economist screamed for in a campaign capped by its infamous“ The Case For War ” editorial — when a story threatens to confuse or upset their agenda , the weekly can just drop the Putin - Hitler trump card .
It works like a dream , every time .
Thanks to the English magazine ’s clever rhetorical strategy , a cocktail of quasi- aristocratic contempt , two - Thesauruses - smarter - than - Newsweek diction , and occasional contrarian - populism to pander to its majority - American readership , readers trust The Economist .
They — particularly the Economist ‘s American readers — trust it because they think it knows more than they do ; this is its entire appeal .
They even get a sick thrill being talked down to by a dirty old aristocratic prig .
For Americans in particular , accustomed to the lifeless , dumbed - down , lowest - common - denominator prose in their own media , reading The Economist is its own reward , giving the American subscriber the sense not only that they ’re smarter than the average Time subscriber , but that it even makes them vaguely decadent , in a literary - port - sipping sort of way .
They become smarter by osmosis simply by being in the imagined drawing room of The Economist ‘s wit- slinging editorial offices .
In reality , The Economist is one of the most appallingly wrong and evil — as in responsible - for - millions - of - dead - people evil — media organs in the English world today .
As far as “ wit ” goes , The Economist ranks up there with Benson , the snappy TV sitcom butler , though it ’s nowhere near as delightfully entertaining as the British butler in the godawful Dudley Moore comedy Arthur .
Or as Michael Lewis , the author of Liar ’s Poker , observed after moving to England ,
“ The magazine is written by young people pretending to be old people .
If American readers got a look at the pimply complexions of their economic gurus , they would cancel their subscriptions in droves . ”
If only it was a question of overrated wit .
But it ’s much worse .
It ’s a sinister and sophisticated English snowjob .
Considering their influence and their influential readership , not to mention where they ’re leading us with their anti-Russia campaign , it ’s time to set the record straight , to put the “ s ” back in “ limey ” and call The Economist for the slimey fucks that they are , before they drag us all down into another disastrous war , just as they did with Iraq .
Last month ’s Kazakhstan / Russia coverage is a perfect example of what ’s so wrong with the magazine .
Just before Kazakhstan ’s sham elections ,
The Economist warned that an “ ugly trade ” might soon happen : Every country in the West , save two , had already agreed to overlook President Nazarbayev ’s out - of - the - closet authoritarianism , and give him the chair to the OSCE in 2009 no matter how disgraceful the elections turned out .
The two holdouts were the U.S. ( whose ambassador praised Nazarbayev ’s constitutional changes allowing him to be president - for - life as “ a good step forward ” ) and Great Britain , which was a bit more circumspect .
These two countries still have n’t made up their minds about whether or not to allow Kazakhstan to take over the OSCE chair .
Coincidentally ,
The Economist has n’t made its mind up either , a position manifested by its decision to allot a meager column - sized article tepidly condemning the elections .
This was completely overshadowed by the multi-page lead article : Russia is “ now ” run by the KGB .
As mentioned above , this story is four fucking years old .
There ’s no “ now ” to it .
The Economist article relies on a report issued in 2003 by sociologist Olga Kryshtanovskaya .
Back in 2003 , The Economist ‘s colleagues in the Western media covered the report as the news story it then was .
The Christian Science Monitor , for example , ran a story called “ KGB influence still felt in Russia ” in its December 30 , 2003 edition .
It stated :
Olga Kryshtanovskaya is a sociologist who dances with wolves .
For more than a decade she ’s been Russia ’s premier expert on the political , business , and security elites .
But even Ms. Kryshtanovskaya says she ’s alarmed by her own recent findings .
Since Vladimir Putin came to power four years ago , she ’s been tracking a dramatic influx into government of siloviki – people from the military , the former Soviet KGB , and other security services – bringing with them statist ideology , authoritarian methods , and a drill - sergeant ’s contempt for civilian sensibilities .
For The Economist ‘s brand of quantum journalism , time is relative , depending on the observer – or rather , the observer ’s agenda .
A story like this is like a fine wine , meant to be stored in a cool place , to be popped open for their readers to help them forget all that other depressing , confusing news coming out of Kazakhstan or Iraq .
Thus , four years after the Monitor ‘s story , The Economist arrives to sound the alarm .
What ’s strange is how sloppy The Economist is about this , to the point where it reads like a classic case of four - years - late plagiarism .
But most readers would never know how dated the peg to the recent cover story really is .
“ Political power in Russia now lies with the FSB , the KGB ’s successor , ” declared the magazine .
Note The Economist ‘s sly insertion of the word “ now ” – giving the reader the impression that news about the siloviki ’s rise is hot out of the box .
“ Now ” in the weekly news world literally means “ now . ”
It does n’t mean four years ago , or even four months ago .
It means last week , or perhaps sometime in the last four weeks .
The Economist betrays even more nervousness about running a story this belatedly with another strange insertion in the opening sentence :
On the evening of August 22nd , 1992 — 16 years ago this week [ note the ludicrous time - peg , “ 16 years ago this week ” — M. Ames . ] —
Alexei Kondaurov , a KGB general , stood by the darkened window of his Moscow office and watched a jubilant crowd moving towards the KGB headquarters in Lubyanka Square …
Let ’s leave aside for now the very strange decision to anchor an anti-silovik story to Kondaurov — a former KGB general who was a top Yukos executive ( respect to the PR firm that helped arrange that ) .
A couple of paragraphs later , we are introduced to Kryshtanovskaya and her four - year - old study .
Here ,
The Economist pulls a classic example of censorship - by - omission :
According to research by Olga Kryshtanovskaya , a sociologist at the Russian Academy of Sciences , a quarter of the country ’s senior bureaucrats are siloviki — a Russian word meaning , roughly , ‘ power guys ’ , which includes members of the armed forces and other security services , not just the FSB .
The proportion rises to three - quarters if people simply affiliated to the security services are included .
These people represent a psychologically homogeneous group , loyal to roots that go back to the Bolsheviks ’ first political police , the Cheka .
They never mention when the report was published , because if they did — “ According to a report four years ago … ” — it would kind of contradict the “ now ” in the sub - header .
So you just do n’t mention it .
Instead , you crudely manipulate her findings : “ the proportion [ of siloviki ] rises to three - quarters if people simply affiliated to the security services are included . ”
Is that really what Kryshtankovskaya reported ?
In an interview with Radio Free Europe last year , she explained “ The 78 percent figure … is not a precise figure . ”
But precision , a quantum journalist might argue , is itself a relative concept .
* * *
For the last few years ,
The Economist has been waging a relentless , obsessive - compulsive campaign to rebrand Russia and Vladimir Putin as a Fascist state and a Fascist regime .
Consider last year ’s “ The Hardest Word ” :
It is an over - used word , and a controversial one , especially in Russia .
It is not there yet , but Russia sometimes seems to be heading towards fascism .
That ’s as serious a charge as can possibly be levied : Nazi Germany with thousands of nuclear weapons .
Fascism in the popular consciousness has a pretty simple , straightforward definition : a country that will invade and enslave the world by force , and gas its Jews .
Is that Russia ?
Because if Russia really is Fascist , then what the fuck are we doing here ?
Every foreigner should run screaming for the border !
The West should demand the immediate and unconditional surrender of the Kremlin or else …or else we ’ll blow the whole fucking world to smithereens by midnight tomorrow .
I ’m serious : If Russia is Fascist , what are we waiting for ?
Is n’t this the lesson of the 30s : Attack now !
Do n’t wait !
Drop the fuckin ’
Bomb before it ’s too late , launch the entire arsenal and say hello to Jesus !!!
The Economist gets around this death - of - mankind problem by liberalizing its definition of Fascism , curiously making it fit contemporary Russia , while at the same time gutting some of its seriousness :
History also offers a term to describe the direction in which Russia sometimes seems to be heading : a word that captures the paranoia and self - confidence , lawlessness and authoritarianism , populism and intolerance , and economic and political nationalism that now characterise Mr Putin ’s administration .
Yep , that ’s right , Fascism does n’t mean violently aggressive militarism , invasions , and the industrial slaughter of millions .
Nope , you had it all wrong .
In these multicultural times , we need to expand Fascism ’s meaning , to make it accessible to other cultures , particularly those we dislike .
So now the new mix ’n’match Fascism includes “ self - confidence , ” “ lawlessness , ” “ intolerance ” …
Let ’s see , what else is happening in Russia that we can put in there ?
Why not add to that Economist definition , “ a word that captures the Dima - bilan mullets and gopniki , face control and purse dogs , people who say ‘ da ’ and people who also say ‘ nyet . ' ”
There , that ensures that Russia is now Fascist !
This sleazy redefinition of the word Fascism allows The Economist to effectively rebrand Russia by working backwards from Russia to Fascism .
The implication is obvious .
The Putin regime must be destroyed before it destroys us .
Maybe not right away — but soon .
That ’s what our leaders have always promised to do should Fascism ever rear its ugly head in Europe again .
* * *
It was n’t always this way .
In fact , if you hopped aboard The Economist ‘s own DeLorean time machine , you ’d find that there was a time when they downright loved their li’l Fascist spy in the Kremlin .
Sometimes they loved him , that is .
And sometimes they did n’t .
Kinda depended on the day of the week – and to what degree he served Anglo - American geopolitical / corporate ambitions .
Keep in mind that in this relationship , Putin is the only one who ’s been consistent .
When he came to power in 2000 , he promoted the siloviki , shut down opposition media , and brought all other sources of power – the Duma , Federation Council , and regional governors , under the Kremlin ’s control in what was called the “ vertikalnaya vlast ’ ” or “ vertical power structure . ”
It was all out in the open .
Everyone knew it .
In the beginning of his reign , The Economist was skeptical — about everything , ranging from Putin ’s credentials as a liberal to an even more serious concern for Western investors , whether or not he could really get the chaos under control , which in his first year or two was really the main concern of Western investors — and The Economist :
“ Though Mr Putin has said he will ‘ eliminate ’ the oligarchs ‘ as a class ’ , the early signs are not encouraging . ” ( May 13 , 2000 ) “ It is not just that reform has bogged down , that economic growth is fizzling out , and that the Chechen war is dragging on unwinnably ; the Kremlin ’s own authority also seems to be fraying . ” ( March 16 , 2001 )
Regarding the media crackdown , in a rare moment of truth - telling The Economist explained ,
“ Independent media in the provinces of Russia have been shriveling for years , under the combined assault of powerful regional bosses and their business friends .
Now the same is happening at the centre .
But , for the time being at least , information is still available to anyone with an Internet connection or a decent radio . ” ( April 21 , 2001 )
That provided some solace then , but is never mentioned today , even though any Russian with a radio or Internet connection is still in the same position they were in on April 17 , 2001 .
Read that quote again , and again …it ’s so incredible in its complete contradiction to everything The Economist says now that I can almost feel my hair falling out of my scalp …
But for those few hairs remaining , there ’s this Economist shocker , coming just a few months later :
“ At home and abroad , things have never looked brighter for Russia ’s president , Vladimir Putin … .
At home , the economy is still growing and reforms continue . ”
( Nov 3 , 2001 .
“ Hope Gleams Anew ” )
Wait … ” Hope gleams anew ” ?
Are you shitting us ?
Did n’t the Economist just insist that … but … you ca n’t do that , can you ?
Let ’s pull up another 2001 quote :
“ Russia ’s opinion polls still show Mr Putin as very popular .
But they are not completely trustworthy — and in any case his standing is artificially bolstered by a servile state - run television . ” ( March 17 , 2001 )
Ah , that ’s what I likes to hear .
Yeah , feed me more of that anti-Putin moral crusading , baby .
Come on , daddy - o , feed me :
“ Mr Putin ’s huge popularity means that his new foreign policy faces no direct threat .
Most Russians are delighted to see their country more popular and respected , and glad to avoid a direct entanglement in Afghanistan .
Even slow and patchy economic reforms are better than none . ” ( November 3 , 2001 )
Wait — you ca n’t flip - flop like that .
Or can you ?
Yup indeed , if you ’re The Economist , you can go a - flippin ’ and a - floppin ’ all you want , on any issue you please , because your credibility is n’t built on being right or consistent or telling the truth — it ’s all about the snotty British tone , and never admitting you ’re a fraud .
Even on the most sacred moral issue of all for Economist liberals , Putin ’s human rights record , they ’ve proven to be flexible :
“ Other western allies , such as Turkey , have plenty of blots on their human - rights record too . ”
( May 18 , 2002 , “ What Russia Wants ” )
Wow .
So first it was unsettling and foreboding , and these days it ’s Hitlerian , but way back in 2002 , it ’s just … a “ blot . ”
And blots like these are par for the course for the West ’s friends , so therefore it ’s not really an issue .
By now , it ’s pretty obvious why The Economist decided to switch to pillow - talk mode with Putin :
In the months after 9/11 , it looked like he was going to be America ’s best , most submissive friend in the whole authoritarian world .
To put it in their own words ,
“ On acute issues , such as American involvement in the former Soviet empire , Mr Putin is shunting Russia ’s policy in the right direction , towards accepting the inevitable . ” ( May 18 , 2002 )
Inevitable indeed .
They really called that one .
But at the time , they were gloating like a clique of condescending English villains , proud of their genius at deception : “ That ’s a good Pootie - Poot !
Good boy !
Now go run along and play with , Blair .
Go on , be a good doggie ! ”
The Economist ‘s flip - flopping over Putin is so over - the - top absurd and shameless , that it reads like a scene out of a bad Mel Brooks skit , with Harvey Korman playing Edward Lucas , by turns grotesquely sweet - talking or contemptuously dismissing the character of Putin , played by Cloris Leachman .
One minute Putin ’s popularity is “ not trustworthy ” and “ artificially bolstered by a servile state - run television ” ; a few months later , “ Most Russians are delighted ” and “ Mr Putin ’s huge popularity means that his new foreign policy faces no direct threat . ”
Truth is a very flexible commodity in the pages of the Economist .
In the sleaziest of all of their many flip - flops , the Economist even managed , in the above - quoted November 2001 article , to brush off a future martyr ’s threat to her safety , balancing it positively against a grotesquely obvious PR exercise :
Change is least visible in politics …
The squeeze on the independent press continues : Anna Politovskaya , the most intrepid Russian reporter dealing with Chechnya , has fled to Vienna after receiving threats .
But the competent and well - publicised salvaging of the Kursk did strike a good note , in sharp contrast to the lies and confusion that surrounded the tragedy of its sinking as it unfolded in August last year .
I - bee - bee - bee - bee - whuhhh ?
So what you ’re saying is , Politkovskaya had to flee for her life , but hey , didja see the way they pulled up those Kursk corpses ?
Pretty impressive , was n’t it ?
If I was a drowned corpse , that ’s how I ’d want to be dredged … Yeah , so , how ’bout them Red Sox , eh ?
Dang , lost my train - a thought here …
I forgot what we were talking about .
Oh yeah , Putin… Right , what a guy !
( Incidentally , speaking of flip - flops , they supported John Kerry in 2004 … after endorsing Bush in 2000 , and the Iraq invasion in 2002 - 3 . )
So what changed ?
Why did Putin ’s crackdown on the media go from being a problem , then to a blot not unlike other blots , then to something you contrast to a successful corpse - salvage mission in Murmansk , to… a clear sign of Fascism ?
What changed is Yukos .
The arrest of oil oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky in October , 2003 .
The darling of everyone from Exxon and Chevron to Dick Cheney and Richard Perle .
The man who argued that Russia should have supported the war in Iraq , and should orient its oil towards the West , rather than China .
The man who , in the end , tried and failed to change the power structure in Russia .
The Economist has admitted as much :
“ If the emergence of Yukos epitomised Russia ’s transition from a planned economy to the wild capitalism of the 1990s , which for all its excesses thrived on private initiative , its destruction was a turning - point towards an authoritarian , corporatist state . ” ( May 10 , 2007 )
What “ excesses ” might Yukos have committed ?
Murder , if you believe ex-Wall Street Journal writer David Satter , whose study of the rapacious oligarchs was once was cited favorably in The Economist .
Mass theft , if you believe even Khodorkovsky ’s candid account of how Yukos ’ assets were acquired .
Not that that ’s a big secret .
But you see , admitting that into the record would sorta muddy up the picture .
So that all gets passed off as “ excesses , ” which could really mean anything , like “ excess of free - market zeal . ”
It ’s a whitewash , just like when Putin seemed pliable , The Economist downplayed his dismal human rights record to mere “ blot ” status .
This is how The Economist has always worked in Russia , its hand constantly on two dials : a “ sunny side ” dial , and a “ bleakness ” dial , the latter ending in Fascism .
Take this example from the Yeltsin years , a period where The Economist ‘s record is so appallingly deceitful that it would require a separate article , and scores of beta - blockers just to read through to avoid suffering a 10 - valve thrombo .
In late 1997 , when it still looked like Western financial institutions were reaping huge profits and stood to earn more , The Economist said of Yeltsin and his notoriously hated “ privatization ” lieutenant , Anatoly Chubais :
Market forces have grown stronger with each year , but may not yet be strong enough to propagate themselves unaided .
Their chances would be much better if there were a hundred more people in government of Mr. Chubais ’s calibre , or even a score .
Mr. Yeltsin , at least , appears to believe that there is n’t one .
Un - Marxist as it might be to argue as much , great men are needed to do great things .
Mr. Yeltsin , in his way , is one such .
And Mr. Chubais , in his way , is another .
Exactly four months later , as the IMF - backed pyramid scheme was unraveling and Westerners started getting burned , The Economist changed its mind , but in smarmy tone suggesting it had known this all along and were n’t fooled the way non-Economist editors were :
Russia ’s institutions being worryingly weak and the powers of its president frighteningly strong , it is vital that the man in charge is beholden to neither demagogues nor billionaires …
Unfortunately , as age , vodka and the wooziness of barely diluted power get the better of him , Mr Yeltsin is utterly failing to do this part of his job … .
Once a Titan , rightly lauded for helping to pull down one of the world ’s most evil regimes , he now seems to lurch , disaster - prone , from one fit of bad temper to the next .
Poor Russia .
Yes , it was so long ago that he was “ rightly lauded ” — I mean , how could anyone possibly have guessed he ’d turn out to have been so terrible four long months later ?
It ’s like when Austin Powers discovered that Liberace was gay : “ Wow baby , who would ’ve guessed ?
I never saw that one coming ! ”
The Economist even played their Fascism card back in the Yeltsin years … although to entirely different purposes , as this 1998 email from scholar Anatol Lieven to David Johnson shows :
“ Dear David , attached is part of my book on Chechnya … The relevance of the argument is demonstrated by the latest article in The Economist : ‘ Could Russia Go Fascist ? — which translates as – ‘ Shoud n’t we give billions of dollars to support Yeltsin and our darling Young Reformer Chubais because Russians are intrinsically given to imperialism and aggression and Chubais assures us that he and Yeltsin are all that is standing between Russia and Fascism . ’
Some of the people you can indeed fool all the time .
Yours , Anatol Lieven ”
In 1998 , The Economist invented a nonexistent Russian Fascist threat in order to prop up a wildly unpopular , corrupt regime , which had overseen the total collapse of its economy , devastated the health of its citizens , and forever ruined the concepts of “ liberalism , ” “ free markets ” and “ democracy ” in the minds of those who survived it …all because Yeltsin seemed to benefit The Economist ‘s readers .
Today , they ’re lying again about the nonexistent Russian Fascist threat , only this time in order to bring down a highly popular ( albeit corrupt ) regime that has overseen the unexpected revival of its economy and power , and seen the health and longevity of its citizens improve enormously .
All because Putin is n’t our bitch .
So the Russian Fascist Threat can be used in any situation , any decade , any era—either to demonize the Kremlin , or to demonize the Kremlin ’s opponents , depending on which side is good for western interests .
Truth is in the eyes of the Economist beholder .
So how did The Economist sink to such a pitiable state ?
The horrible answer is , it ’s always been this vile .
If you go back to The Economist ‘s beginnings in Victorian England , you ’ll find , for example , the magazine ’s brave stand on the Great Irish Famine , the English - led genocide that left up to two million Irish dead .
When a cry went up to stop the famine , The Economist countered ,
“ It is no man ’s business to provide for another .
If left to the natural law of distribution , those who deserve more would obtain it . ”
And speaking of Hitlers , in the mid-1930s , The Economist even found time to praise you - know - who :
“ Herr Hitler is showing encouraging signs of statesmanship . ”
Yes , they really did write that .
The first and last example of genuine wit that The Economist ever produced .

( CNN ) -- Swiss voters on Sunday adopted a referendum banning the construction of minarets , seen by some on the far right as a sign of encroaching Islamism .
" The Federal Council respects this decision , " said a statement from Switzerland 's government .
" Consequently the construction of new minarets in Switzerland is no longer permitted .
The four existing minarets will remain .
" It will also be possible to continue to construct mosques , " the government statement said .
" Muslims in Switzerland are able to practice their religion alone or in community with others , and live according to their beliefs just as before . "
As of 10 a.m. ET , 57 percent of voters had cast ballots in favor of the ban , according to Swiss media reports .
Minarets are tall spires extending from mosques or built next to them .
They help identify a mosque and also serve as a spot where a religious leader can call the faithful to daily prayers .
The move to amend the constitution to ban new construction is part of a campaign by the nationalist Swiss People 's Party ( SVP ) .
The party says the minarets are political symbols and therefore go against the the country 's constitution .
It designed fliers that feature a veiled woman against a background of a Swiss flag pierced by several minarets resembling missiles .
The Federal Commission against Racism denounced the posters , saying they " defame Switzerland 's peaceful Muslim population , feed prejudice and portray the Muslim community as wanting to dominate Switzerland , oppress women and trample on fundamental rights . "
Switzerland 's Federal Council and a majority of members of Parliament opposed the initiative , the government statement said , and officials interpret the vote as reflecting " fears among the population of Islamic fundamentalist tendencies . "
" ... These concerns have to be taken seriously , " the statement said .
" The Federal Council has always done so and will continue to do so in the future .
However , the Federal Council takes the view that a ban on the construction of new minarets is not a feasible means of countering extremist tendencies . "
The SVP has courted controversy with its campaigns in the past .
In 2007 , it faced international criticism for leading an anti-immigration campaign during the federal election that featured a poster with a white sheep kicking a black sheep off a Swiss flag .
Under party leader Christoph Blocher , it went on to win the biggest share of the vote in the 200 - member parliament , taking 55 seats .
Earlier this year , the party issued a poster depicting crows pecking at a map of Switzerland , as the country prepared to vote on whether to support an extension of a free movement of labor deal with the European Union that would include new members Bulgaria and Romania .
A mother 's desperate year - long search for her missing baby has revealed a group of doctors and nurses who allegedly tricked patients into believing that their newborns had died , and then sold the children for a few hundred pounds .
The gang was allegedly headed by the owner of a small private hospital in a working class neighbourhood in the east of Mexico City , where Vanessa Castillo gave birth to a girl by caesarean section on 25 October 2008 .
Castillo says she saw the newborn and heard her healthy cries before the baby was whisked away from her for routine tests .
The next day one of the doctors who had attended the delivery came to her bedside to inform her that the baby had died and had been cremated .
Castillo said that after she was sent home she kept going to the hospital in search of her baby 's death certificate and her ashes , but was repeatedly brushed off .
A few months later , however , she received an email from the son of the owner of the clinic , saying that her baby was alive but had been sold by his father for 15,000 pesos ( about £ 700 ) .
The police investigation that followed led to the arrest this week of the owner of the hospital , two doctors , a nurse and a receptionist , as well as a psychologist who has admitted to buying the child and who apparently looked after her well .
Once tests had confirmed that Castillo was the mother of the child , she was reunited with her baby girl at an emotive press conference yesterday .
" This is the first time I have seen her since she was born , " a tearful Castillo told reporters .
When she was asked about the woman who had bought her baby , she added , " I would like to thank her for looking after my daughter for the last year , but this is not the way to obtain a child . "
Police say they have hard evidence of at least one other similar case involving the clinic , and that they are now going through hospital records in an effort to track down more .
" It could be an important number of babies , " Mexico City 's chief prosecutor , Miguel Mancera , told the Televisa TV network .
" They did n't just steal babies and give them up in illegal adoptions .
They also issued false registrations of births at the clinic for babies born without papers elsewhere . "
The arrested doctors have denied the charges , claiming that Castillo had gone to the hospital for a very late abortion , and that they gave the baby away for adoption to safeguard its life .
During the past year , Mexico City 's authorities have been under fire for not doing enough to track down child trafficking rings .
Local newspapers reported this week that staff from the same clinic had been arrested in 2005 after another mother reported that her baby had been stolen in very similar circumstances .
The prompt release of the staff on that occasion has now raised suspicions of past complicity within the prosecutor 's office .
In another high profile case involving older children , at least five wards of court from dysfunctional families placed in a private shelter run by an evangelical church have disappeared without trace .
The disclosure of personal emails can be embarrassing .
And so it proved this week when hundreds of them , accumulated over more than a decade in the files of the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) of the University of East Anglia , UK , tumbled into the public domain as a result of an illegal hack .
Climate change deniers claim that the emails expose a conspiracy at work to make human - induced global warming a fact .
A columnist for the Guardian newspaper in London said that the emails could scarcely be more damaging .
One blog for the Daily Telegraph , also in London , called it “ Climategate : …
CIUDAD JUÁREZ , Mexico 
The hit men moved in on their target , shot him dead and then disappeared in a matter of seconds .
It would have been a perfect case for José Ibarra Limón , one of this violent border city ’s most dogged crime investigators  had he not been the victim .
Mexico has never been particularly adept at bringing criminals to justice , and the drug war has made things worse .
Investigators are now swamped with homicides and other drug crimes , most of which they will never crack .
On top of the standard obstacles  too little expertise , too much corruption  is one that seems to grow by the day : outright fear of becoming the next body in the street .
Mr. Ibarra was killed on July 27 in what his bosses at the federal attorney general ’s office consider an assassination related to a case he was investigating .
As if to prove the point , less than a month later , one of the lawyers who had worked for Mr. Ibarra also turned up dead .
Two days afterward , an investigator named to replace Mr. Ibarra insisted on being transferred out of Ciudad Juárez , Mexico ’s murder capital .
The current prosecutor investigating Mr. Ibarra ’s cases is working anonymously , his or her name kept secret by the government .
According to Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , the Democrats ’ health reform legislation is basically a sham .
Appearing on MSNBC’s The Ed Show on Friday night , the House ’s most unabashed progressive condemned Democratic leadership for removing his amendment that would allow states to create their own single - payer systems .
Then he called the entire legislative package “ a bailout for insurance companies . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Under a single - payer system , like those in Canada and the United Kingdom , the government pools taxpayer funds to pay for citizens ’ health care and fees are not collected by health care providers .
The Kucinich amendment would allow individual states an opt -in to such a system .
The amendment is missing from health reform legislation unveiled Thursday by Democratic leadership .
“ Representative Kucinich was livid when he found out that his provision to allow states to create a single payer system was stripped , ” News Junkie Post noted .
“ Kucinich ’s amendment passed the House Labor and Education Committee in July .
‘ No one gave me any rational reason , ’ Kucinich said .
‘ I can only assume the insurance company interests brought pressure to take it out .
Otherwise I would have heard from someone . ' ”
“ The [ committee ] vote was 25 to 19 , with support coming from an odd mix of liberal Democrats who support single - payer on its merits and conservative Republicans who want to preserve the rights of states to regulate themselves , ” The Washington Independent noted at the time .
“ The removal of the Kucinich amendment constitutes yet another capitulation to the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries who are already reaping billions of dollars from the bill , ” reads a statement from the congressman ’s office on Thursday .
ADVERTISEMENT
Under the revised public option , “ Pelosi and her team have proposed a plan that would not make payments for care based on Medicare rates … ” CBS News ’s John Nichols noted .
“ Rather , under the Pelosi plan , the rates be tied to those of the big insurance companies .
That ’s a big , big victory for the insurance industry , as it will undermine the ability of the public option to compete — and to create pressure for reduced costs . ”
Speaking to liberal MSNBC anchor Ed Schultz on Friday , Kucinich continued his assault on the legislation .
“ I think we need the support of the American people to say , look , you need that state single - payer amendment in the bill to make it credible , ” the congressman said .
“ I mean , what are people giving up already ?
They ’re being mandated to buy private insurance .
If you read the bill , the people are going to end up paying — the insurance companies can raise rates 25 percent right off the bat , if you read the bill . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Schultz encouraged Kucinich to repeat himself on that point .
“ It ’s on page 22 of the bill , ” he replied .
“ Right here , it says that rates shall be set at a level that does not exceed 125 percent of the prevailing standard rate for comparable coverage in the individual market .
Now …
It ’s very easy to understand what that means . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s not reform , ” Schultz insisted .
“ It means a 25 percent increase , they ’ll have the ability to execute and since insurance companies have already raised rates for the last four years by double - digits , we can expect — based on the bill — another rate increase by the insurance companies . ”
Schultz called the bill a “ sellout ” to insurers because the bill only allows 11 million people into a limited government - run health insurance option , and includes a mandate for Americans to buy private policies .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Maybe instead of a sellout it ’s a bailout , ” Kucinich responded .
“ Maybe what we ’re looking at here is another way that Wall Street ’s speculative engine can be fueled , this time with the help of the premiums of tens of millions of Americans . ”
On his Web site , Kucinich took his point further , calling the legislation “ a bailout for insurance companies ” that must be altered .
“ The Kucinich [ single payer ] amendment has been added to H.R. 3200 in the Education and Labor Committee , the amendment would permit states to enact a single - payer health care system , ” the congressman ’s Web site claimed .

Cheaper Desalination – Saltworks Breakthrough
November 16th , 2009 by Paul O’Callaghan
Paul O’Callaghan is CEO of Cleantech consultancy firm , O2 Environmental Inc. and author of Water Technology Markets .
Canadian firm , Saltworks Technologies , just came out of stealth in relation to their desalination technology , which they claim reduce the electrical energy required for desalination by over 70 % .
They report they can produce 1m3 of water with 1 kW hour of electrical energy , compared to the 3.7k Whr per m3 , which is what is currently achievable using reverse osmosis with the use of energy recovery devices .
[ social_buttons ]
So how to they do it ?
Well its novel .
It appears to be a new approach .
And novel and new are two things scarce as hens teeth in relation to desalination technologies .
They use solar heat ( or waste heat ) to evaporate water and concentrate salt water .
They are converting solar energy into osmotic energy by doing this .
They then use this osmotic energy to desalinate water .
They then expose the concentrated salt water to two separate solutions of regular salt water via two different ‘ bridges ’ , one which is porous to chloride ions , the second which is porous to sodium ions .
The sodium and chloride ions migrate across the respective bridges into the salt water solutions to equalize the difference in ion concentration between the solutions .
This creates two charged solutions , one enriched with sodium ions ( positively charged ) , the second enriched with chloride ions ( negatively charged ) .
These two solutions are then exposed across two similar bridges to the water to be desalinated .
This draws sodium ions into the chloride enriched solution and draws chloride ions into the sodium enriched solution :
Net result desalination .
Doing this they reckon they can produce 1m3 of water using 1kWh of electrical energy , which is used to pump fluids around the pipework .
Because the system is not under pressure , they can use plastic pipes instead of steel pipes , potentially reducing capital costs also .
I met with Saltworks about six months ago in Vancouver and I was impressed by the methodical way they have been going about technology commercialization .
Despite winning a technology innovation award in British Columbia in May 2009 , they have kept this remarkably quiet .
An article in the Economist provides a good review of this .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
It seems Cesc Fábregas 's Barcelona DNA , something mentioned from sources at the Camp Nou on a repetitive basis , has mutated .
While nobody would dispute that the Catalan midfielder has his hometown club in his blood , it is indisputably mixed with red and white cells of a different kind .
Fábregas , whose all - round display shimmered , pledged his affection for Arsenal after scoring with a graceful volley .
He smothered the badge on his shirt with a kiss .
" There 's always speculation I do n't like it here but I am committed to this club 100 per cent , " he said .
" It 's my seventh season and it's hard to hear people say they think I 'm not committed enough .
It was a good time to show them I really love this club . "
Considering this all took place in front of Thierry Henry , who made a pre-match appearance with a regal wave before settling down with his daughter to watch the goalfest , Fábregas 's clarification was useful .
If you did not know better , you could have sworn the Arsenal captain was trying extra hard to put on a good show to ensure Henry returned to the Camp Nou with a sparkling scouting report .
As it is , Henry witnessed a display that justifies Arsenal 's reputation as Barcelona - lite .
The football was at times exquisite .
The goals were beautifully worked .
The defence was an afterthought .
Alex Song had a job and a half on his hands considering every other player on his team outside the back four and goalkeeper had an aversion to being inside their own half .
by Guardian Chalkboards
With that in mind Blackburn 's contribution , especially in a first half that was spectacularly open , was notable .
They took the lead when Paul Robinson launched a free - kick from his own half as far as the opposing penalty area , where Steven Nzonzi – easily Blackburn 's tallest player in the absence of the injured Christopher Samba – beat Thomas Vermaelen in the air to nod a looping header over Vito Mannone .
Vermaelen was evidently seething about being thoroughly outmanoeuvred .
He cantered forward , was fouled by Brett Emerton , dusted himself down , and seized a pass from Fábregas to thump a 25 - yarder into the bottom corner .
Talk about channelling your anger positively .
Vermaelen was so psyched up he almost popped a vein .
Now it was Blackburn 's time to react .
David Dunn barged into Mannone to show he was not about to take things lightly and , when the ball arrived to him in the area , , after solid approach work from El Hadji Diouf and Emerton , he trotted past William Gallas to shoot in off the French defender 's heel .
Before Blackburn had a chance to settle , the see - saw tipped back thanks to Fábregas 's mastery of the assist , which prompted two goals in four minutes .
Robin van Persie and Andrey Arshavin were the grateful recipients .
Sam Allardyce knew Blackburn would have chances to claw their way back , given the vast spaces Arsenal leave uncovered .
Martin Olsson produced a terrific volley that Mannone parried well and David Hoilett was unfortunate when Vermaelen glanced his effort on to a post .
But the major beef came just after the break , when Dunn was denied a penalty , having been tripped by Vermaelen .
" It is a blatant one , " said Allardyce .
" This is why I am into pushing for technology because , if I am given the opportunity to challenge two or three decisions a game , I could challenge that one and we could have a chance to get some points out of Arsenal .
We have been denied that chance and when Fábregas gets that fourth goal we end up looking like , well we are , a well - beaten side .
" You have got to get the major decisions right , otherwise you do n't stay in this league too long , not as a manager or a player , so as a referee you have got to be judged the same .
They are fully professional now , so if they are not good enough , we should find someone who is . "
Fábregas , who could have had a hat - trick , gave Arsenal breathing space , from which the substitutes profited .
Theo Walcott made the watching Fabio Capello's day when he scored with one of his first touches of the season , clipping home after another dinked touch from Fábregas helped Arshavin 's cross into his path .
Then Nicklas Bendtner showed no ill effects of his car crash when he dribbled infield to wallop the sixth past Robinson , who was unfortunate to go home with such a beating to digest , considering he had kept out at least as many again .
This , the only goal not involving Fábregas , occurred when he was off the field .
Thrilled as Arsène Wenger was with his talisman , he was keen to share the plaudits around .
" When we are confident we have a flow that looks like the goals will come at any moment and from anywhere .
There is something in the side that is lighthearted and enjoyable to watch .
Why ?
Because they enjoy to play together and that for me is the most important . "
Would Henry have even got a game in this team ?
" He would , " said Wenger .
" And he would have scored certainly . "

In May , President Obama nominated a renowned scientist known as the “ father of green chemistry ” to head the EPA ’s Office of Research and Development .
For an administration that supports ambitious climate change legislation and stresses the importance of sustainability , the nomination of Paul Anastas , director of Yale ’s Center for Green Chemistry and Green Engineering and a former White House environment director , was very much in keeping with its broader agenda .
Anastas ’ nomination was unanimously approved in committee in July , and his confirmation seemed all but assured .
Yet six months later Anastas still is n’t confirmed .
Standing in his way is Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) , whose block on Anastas ’ nomination raises questions about Vitter ’s close ties to the formaldehyde industry .
Today , the future of the formaldehyde industry is very much in jeopardy .
A few years back , the International Agency for Research on Cancer definitively announced that the chemical , used in building materials and household products , causes cancer in humans .
The EPA , which has studied formaldehyde ’s risks for more than a decade , does n’t go quite so far , saying it ’s a “ probable human carcinogen . ”
But that could soon change .
The EPA has recently signaled that it plans to definitively assess formaldehyde ’s health effects .
“ This is not the time for more delay , ” an EPA spokeswoman told the New Orleans Times - Picayune in September .
As the agency ’s research director , Anastas would surely have a role in this assessment .
Given that one of Anastas ’ specialties is researching “ the design of safer chemicals and chemical processes to replace hazardous substances , ” the formaldehyde industry is predictably concerned about his nomination .
Here ’s where Vitter comes in .
Instead of the EPA ruling on formaldehyde now , Vitter wants the agency to let the National Academy of Sciences review formaldehyde ’s risk , a process that could take a year or more and that might favor industry supporters , environmentalists say , because the NAS review would use industry - based reports .
Likewise , blocking Anastas ’ nomination is another way of slowing the EPA ’s movement on formaldehyde .
( An EPA official told Mother Jones that agency head Lisa Jackson met with Vitter to ask him to let the nomination go through , which did n’t happen . )
And though a Vitter spokesman ’s recent comments that the FEMA - trailer debacle , which exposed thousands of displaced Gulf Coast victims living in government - issued trailers to high formaldehyde levels , demonstrated the need “ to get absolutely reliable information to the public about formaldehyde risk as soon as possible , ” Vitter ’s position ensures the EPA wo n’t be rolling out formaldehyde guidelines anytime soon .
So why is Vitter so sympathetic to the formaldehyde industry ?
Campaign finance records show that many of Louisiana ’s big formaldehyde polluters happen to be — you guessed it — Vitter campaign donors .
He ’s received $ 9,000 from Dow Chemical ’s PAC , $ 5,000 from Monsanto’s , $ 5,000 from ExxonMobil ’s , and $ 2,500 from the American Forest and Paper Association’s .
The American Forest and Paper Association is also a member of the Formaldehyde Council , an industry group whose views align with Vitter ’s ( it ’s lobbied for an NAS review , too ) .
Anastas is under no illusions as to the obstacles in the way , telling Chemistry World in October that “ we face tremendous challenges in ensuring the best science is brought to bear on issues like arsenic and formaldehyde . ”
Reached at his office Wednesday , he remained sanguine about his nomination , saying he was “ extremely enthusiastic about assuming my duties at the EPA when the Senate finalizes its process and if they confirm me . ”
An environmentalist with the Sierra Club summed up the situation best to the Times - Picayune : “ It ’s just disappointing that anybody would try to get in the way of us finally adopting the kind of formaldehyde standards that exist in other [ countries ] that protect people .
It ’s ironic that this could come from somebody from Katrinaland , who has thousands of constituents who were exposed to excess formaldehyde level after being placed in government housing . ”

[ digg - reddit - me ] Yesterday , the Wall Street Journal had an editorial that got passed around as if it were a news story , insisting that the decision of a board of doctors and scientists to recommend that biannual breast cancer screening only for those between the ages of 50 and 75 “ is a sign of cost control to come . ”
The editorial cited this fact :
But the panel — which includes no oncologists and radiologists , who best know the medical literature — did decide to re-analyze the data with health - care spending as a core concern .
Yet this is n’t what news articles are reporting :
Panel members said politics and questions of cost were never part of their discussions of the risks and benefits of mammograms — in fact they are prohibited from considering costs when they make guidelines .
Or this :
In reaching its recommendations , the task force of doctors and scientists determined that early and frequent mammograms often lead to false - positive readings and unnecessary biopsies , without substantially improving the odds of survival for women under 50 .
And it is not the rationale given by the report itself :
The harms resulting from screening for breast cancer include psychological harms , unnecessary imaging tests and biopsies in women without cancer , and inconvenience due to false - positive screening results .
Furthermore , one must also consider the harms associated with treatment of cancer that would not become clinically apparent during a woman ’s lifetime ( overdiagnosis ) , as well as the harms of unnecessary earlier treatment of breast cancer that would have become clinically apparent but would not have shortened a woman ’s life .
Radiation exposure ( from radiologic tests ) , although a minor concern , is also a consideration .
Adequate evidence suggests that the overall harms associated with mammography are moderate for every age group considered , although the main components of the harms shift over time .
Although false - positive test results , overdiagnosis , and unnecessary earlier treatment are problems for all age groups , false - positive results are more common for women aged 40 to 49 years , whereas overdiagnosis is a greater concern for women in the older age groups .
There is adequate evidence that teaching BSE is associated with harms that are at least small .
There is inadequate evidence concerning harms of CBE .
That has n’t stopped this from becoming a right wing talking point nor from causing concerns among independents uncertain about whom to believe – the statements of the board itself , claiming they focused on science , or the speculating opinions of right wingers , playing into people ’s worst fears .
I have some advice for those people on the fence : Read the damn report if you do n’t trust the media .
Do n’t put your blind faith in the often discredited Wall Street Journal editorial page .

The California Milk Advisory Board may have shot itself in the hoof .
The board , which promotes the state ’s dairy farmers and is overseen by the California Department of Food and Agriculture , is again preparing to film commercials touting California milk from California cows -- in New Zealand .
In January , it plans to shoot part of its new series of 10 California “ Happy Cows ” TV commercials in Auckland , taking advantage of that country ’s low production costs .
It comes just after California began offering film tax incentives this summer to reverse so - called runaway production that has caused the loss of thousands of jobs in the Los Angeles area as other states and countries have siphoned off film and TV crews with lucrative financial incentives .

Under the state ’s first film tax credit program , which took effect in July , California is offering $ 100 million in credits for about 50 film and TV projects .
Commercials , however , were excluded from the program .
“ Obviously , the governor prefers that everyone produce their film , television and other projects in California , ” said Camille Anderson , spokeswoman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who strongly backed the measure .
Local union officials were cheesed off to learn that the state milk board was farming out TV work to foreign locales .
“ It ’s totally out of line , ” said Ed Duffy , business agent for Teamsters Local 399 , which represents location managers , studio drivers and casting directors .
“ If they ’re promoting California products , they should be shooting in California . ”

Milk board officials said the New Zealand shoot represented a “ minor portion of production ” and was a matter of simple economics .
The board solicited bids from around the world , and the New Zealand site was the lowest , said Michael Freeman , the board ’s vice president of advertising .
“ It was a no - brainer , ” he said .
“ The dairy industry is facing the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression .
We have a fiduciary responsibility to spend their hard - earned dollars as efficiently as we can .
In this particular case , we found significant cost savings by shooting a portion of this product overseas . ”
The board , which receives funding from dairy farmers , has been running TV ads promoting California ’s “ Happy Cows ” for nearly a decade .
The latest series , which began last year , features New Zealand cows representing bovines from around the world auditioning to be the next California Happy Cow .
Like “ American Idol , ” TV viewers can then go on the board ’s website and vote for their favorite cow .
Although Los Angeles remains the bread - and - butter capital for commercial shoots , it faces growing competition from foreign locales , including countries such as Argentina and New Zealand that offer substantial financial incentives .
Advertisement
The New Zealand shoot will be filmed over three days on the same sound stage the board used for last year ’s TV campaign .
Freeman stressed that all post - production work will be done in California , where it will take six to eight weeks to finish each commercial .
Santa Monica - based Bob Industries is a producer , while the creative side is handled by ad agency Deutsche .
Freeman declined to reveal the budget for the commercial shoot or how much the board is saving by filming in New Zealand .
He added that any scenes involving California cows will be filmed in state .

“ We would never misrepresent California cows by shooting them elsewhere , ” he said .

JERUSALEM , Nov. 18 , 2009  --
There is new friction between the Obama administration and the Israeli government of Prime Minister Netanyahu , once again concerning Israeli settlements .
Ignoring the wishes of the United States , Israel Tuesday greenlighted the construction of 900 new homes in Gilo on the outskirts of Jerusalem .
The United States considers the area occupied land and , as such , considers it a settlement .
President Barack Obama 's ambitious plans to kick - start Middle East peace have been stymied for months by Israel 's refusal to implement a construction freeze in the settlements , and the Palestinians ' refusal to talk without such a freeze .
" We are dismayed at the decision to move forward on the approval process for the expansion of Gilo , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Tuesday evening .
The office of the U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was quick to issue a statement , saying the Israeli move threatened to " undermine efforts for peace and cast doubt on the viability of the two - state solution . "
The Israeli government has offered to restrain settlement construction but only in the West Bank , and confirmed today that it does not consider Gilo to be a settlement .
Netanyahu's spokesman Mark Regev said the prime minister was " willing to adopt a policy of restraint concerning growth in the West Bank , but this applies to the West Bank .
Jerusalem is Israel 's capital and will remain as such . "
Netanyahu has been consistent in his refusal to apply any limit on settlement building in Jerusalem .
Such a stand has upset the Palestinians and the wider Arab world , which wants to create the future capital of the Palestinian state in the eastern section of the holy city .
But most Israelis today agree with their right - wing prime minister and insist that Gilo and other large areas of Israeli housing on occupied land are not settlements and must remain part of Israel forever .
After the 1967 Six - Day War , Israel occupied east Jerusalem and the West Bank , ending almost two decades of Jordanian rule .
The municipal boundaries of Jerusalem were unilaterally redrawn to greatly increase the city 's territorial footprint .
The new boundaries have never been recognized outside Israel .
Palestinians Want to Declare Themselves Independent
The timing of the latest construction plan is likely to upset the U.S. administration 's efforts to persuade the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to come back to the talks .
Since Israel 's refusal to stop building , the Palestinians have been threatening to go forward on their own and declare their statehood without negotiation .
The threats have alarmed both Israel and the United States and the plans to expand Gilo are unlikely to improve the already sour atmosphere .
Maybe the toughest thing about being a designer is suffering the idiocy of your clients .
Clients From
Hell gives designers a much - needed place to air their horror stories .
Which all basically boil down to : Clients have no idea what good design costs .
And clients tend to be ludicrously stupid about design , even while insisting they understand it .
For example :
The artwork is approved , but we need to replace the skeleton , we think
it might be homosexual , and that could ostracise the audience , it ’s a
very masculine industry .
Or :
We think there ’s too much space , can you put all the services we do
inside the logo .
And if you can – make it 3D too , so it moves when you
tilt the paper .
Or :
We have an animation budget of about $ 1200 .
We are looking for
character designs , storyboards and animation .
We are thinking along the
lines of that Pixar Film with fish in it .
You know the one ?
Finding
Nema ?
It ’ll get you good exposure .
We ’ll put it on Virgin Airlines .
Man , there are some doofuses out there .
For designers : Enjoy the site .
For would - be design clients : Maybe you ’ll learn something ?
Oh , right .
Probably not .
Exploration architectures that include heavy - lift vehicles should be created so that no payload is developed that cannot also be launched on at least one other vehicle , like the Delta 4 Heavy .
( credit : Boeing )
Launcher out capability
On August 17 , 1943 , seven B - 17 bomber groups totaling 146 aircraft attacked Regensburg , Germany .
By the time bombing commenced , fifteen of the bombers — over 10 % — had already been lost .
Nonetheless , the remaining bombers inflicted heavy damage on the target : despite the catastrophic losses of aircraft and crew , enough bombers got through the Luftwaffe ’s defenses to successfully complete their assigned task .
As is well - known , earth to orbit ( ETO ) space launch systems are not very reliable , though luckily their failure rates are not quite so poor as those of the B - 17s over Regensburg .
( The Regensburg raid losses were indeed very high — ultimately 24 of the bombers ( 16.4 % ) were lost — much higher than what was considered the maximum sustainable operational loss rate of 5 % . )
From the beginning of 1986 to mid-2008 there were 99 launch failures out of 1878 launches worldwide , for an overall failure rate of just over 5 % .
The parable of the World War 2 bombing raids and the review of the last quarter - century of launch failures illustrate that an ensemble of hundreds or thousands of vehicles can achieve a goal despite poor reliability of the individual vehicles .
However , taken as a whole , the world ’s fleet of launch vehicles was extremely reliable during that period with respect to the task of regularly delivering payloads to orbit .
On average 79 successful flights happened per year , and there were fewer than a handful of instances for which the gap between successive payload deliveries exceeded one month , with the maximum gap being 35 days .
The parable of the World War 2 bombing raids and the review of the last quarter - century of launch failures illustrate that an ensemble of hundreds or thousands of vehicles can achieve a goal despite poor reliability of the individual vehicles .
If we consider the goal of regular delivery of payload to orbit , then we can consider the different launch vehicles to be redundant components .
If a particular component has a 5 % failure rate — one failure in 20 flights — then two statistically identical and independent components operating in parallel will have a 0.25 % failure rate ( 1 in 400 flights ) and three such components in parallel will have a 0.0125 % ( 1 in 8000 flight ) failure rate .
Redundancy can enable high operational availability of the world fleet of ETO launchers despite poor component reliability of the individual launcher types .
A launch vehicle failure can lead to a long standdown for that vehicle type , during which time failure analysis and required modifications must occur before the fleet returns to service .
For example , on January 28 , 1986 , the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after launch and as a consequence , the Shuttle program was grounded and did not return to flight until Discovery launched 975 days later on September 29 , 1988 .
Another 906 - day gap occurred after Columbia ’s failed reentry on February 1 , 2003 , with Discovery returning to flight on July 26 , 2005 .
The Air Force , when embarking upon its Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle ( EELV ) program in the 1980s , decided to fund the development of two launchers , the Atlas 5 and the Delta 4 , both of which now launch critical national intelligence assets to orbit .
“ Assured Access to Space ” was a driving factor behind the development of two EELV types : the Air Force and intelligence community did not want to be completely dependent upon one vehicle type , especially in light of the lower - than - expected Shuttle launch rate and the Challenger disaster .
This ability to have more than one launch vehicle option was called a mixed fleet strategy and the scientific community also realized its importance .
A letter to the NASA Administrator from the National Research Council in 1987 stated that : “ … it is very important that the launch strategy for these missions be flexible and reliable .
Provision of back up modes of launching these missions and identification of alternative launch windows in case of delays in the shuttle schedule should be undertaken to give the program margins of assurance that is vital to its success .
… [ A mixed fleet strategy ] would … go a long way toward reducing uncertainties and difficulties related to shuttle delays , significantly reduce pressure on the shuttle launch schedule , and protect against single point failures . ”
Another prescient space policy document from 1989 states : “ Single - point failures should be avoided where possible in programs as well as in physical systems .
The decision to make the Shuttle our sole launch vehicle put a large , unnecessary single - point failure mode into the U.S. space program .
Similarly , the decision to plan the Space Station so that it can be assembled and serviced only by the Shuttle puts the same single - point failure mode into the Station program . ”
In fact , the long standdown after the Columbia disaster did have deleterious impacts on the International Space Station ( ISS ) construction schedule , dependent upon the Shuttle as it was .
Luckily , redundancy in ISS crew transport was provided by Soyuz during the standdown and ISS was not left uncrewed during that time .
ISS logistics supply is now a model of redundancy : there are currently four options ( Shuttle , Progress , ATV , and HTV ) to deliver cargo to the ISS .
If one of these logistics supply systems were to experience a failure and subsequent long standdown , then the three other delivery systems would likely be able to compensate for the loss in the meantime .
Clearly , the quadruple - redundant logistics supply system to ISS is a much , much more robust system in the face of launch vehicle failures than was the early construction effort for ISS at the time of the Columbia disaster .
In light of the discussion so far , let us now consider the concept of the heavy lift vehicle ( HLV ) , an ETO launch vehicle such as Ares 5 or some other Shuttle - derived launcher .
The Constellation program plans to use the unique capabilities of the Ares 5 : the various components designed to be thrown by that launcher ( e.g. , the Earth Departure Stage ( EDS ) , Altair ) are very large , sized to use its heavy lift capabilities to the fullest , and are not capable of being launched on other existing , smaller launchers without modification .
HLVs are expensive to develop and NASA ’s current budgetary situation is such that if an HLV such as Ares 5 were actually funded and built , then it would be highly unlikely that there would be any money left over with which to build a second , independent HLV capability .
The development of an HLV and the sizing of payloads to utilize the unique heavy - lift capabilities of that singular vehicle are antithetical to the redundancy and high operational availability concepts described in this essay .
To develop a singular HLV and to size payloads that can be launched only on that system is , in simple terms , to put all of one ’s eggs in a single basket : the sizing of payloads such that they can only be launched by Ares 5 makes the Ares 5 a single point of failure .
The development of an HLV and the sizing of payloads to utilize the unique heavy - lift capabilities of that singular vehicle are antithetical to the concepts of redundancy and high operational availability .
Of course , NASA and its contractors would strive to design and build the HLV to be as reliable as possible given the budget with which they have to develop it .
However , it is not unreasonable to think that an HLV might fail at some point and that there might be a very long failure analysis and mitigation program thereafter , just as has happened twice with the Shuttle program .
By contrast , a collection of different medium - lift existing launch vehicles , such as Delta 4 , Atlas 5 , Ariane 5 ECA , and Proton , will not all collectively fail to regularly deliver payloads to orbit .
Individual vehicle types might fail and require extensive downtime , but a system of multiple launch vehicles will not collectively suffer the same fate .
Thus , from a reliability perspective , NASA ’s recent intense focus on HLV development seems quite misplaced .
This author proposes the following “ Launcher - Out Rule ” for consideration as an alternative to this HLV - centric focus : Launcher - Out Rule :
In order to ensure high operational availability , even in the face of launch vehicle failures , NASA shall henceforth size each payload so that it is capable of being launched on at least two existing launch vehicles .
Note that this Launcher - Out Rule does not preclude the development of future launch vehicles larger than those currently operational .
What it does prevent is the sizing of payloads that can only be launched on the largest rocket available ; it would be acceptable under this rule to have a new HLV in the fleet capable of carrying two or more payloads of sizes such that each could be launched on at least one other existing launch system .
The Launcher - Out Rule would not prevent the development of Ares 5 per se , but would prevent the designing of any one payload item larger than that which could be carried on a Delta 4 Heavy .
A conscious effort to hew to the Launcher - Out Rule will naturally increase focus on standard payload adapters and interfaces so that it is not onerous to retask a payload to potentially fly on launch vehicle B after the failure of the originally - planned launch vehicle A . Such planning can allow the migration of payloads to more reliable or less costly launchers which will ultimately appear over time .
The Launcher - Out Rule restricts the sizing of payloads to the payload capability provided by the second - largest ETO launcher .
Thus , in space architectures compliant with the proposed Launcher - Out Rule , the payloads launched would be smaller than in an HLV - dependent architecture designed to achieve similar tasks such as delivery of cargo and humans to beyond - LEO destinations .
Architectures compliant with the Launcher - Out Rule would likely have orbital transfer vehicles , orbital assembly dockyards , or other extraterrestrial integration points ( e.g. , integrate on lunar surface or near a NEO ) , depots , telerobotics , EVAs , pre-positioning of supplies , and , in general , a larger number of smaller operations than in corresponding HLV architectures so as to compensate for the smaller launch vehicles used .
The Launcher - Out Rule does not preclude the development of future launch vehicles larger than those currently operational .
What it does prevent is the sizing of payloads that can only be launched on the largest rocket available .
It is true that each of these extraterrestrial operations has possibilities for failure .
However , in - space glitches have the possibility of being diagnosed and fixed over time , whereas that is often not a possibility during the 8 - 10 minutes of terror the ascent of a launch vehicle entails .
One anecdotal example of this ability to diagnose and fix problems over time is the initial failure of the Near Shoemaker probe to achieve orbital insertion around Eros on its first attempt in December 1998 .
The spacecraft began tumbling and communication was lost for 24 hours .
As a consequence , the probe flew past Eros .
However , contact was re-established and the probe successfully inserted into orbit around Eros in early 2000 , more than a year after the first attempt , and the mission was ultimately successful .
The presence of humans and telerobotic equipment can also mitigate some on - orbit failures .
A famous example is the repair of Skylab and deployment of a sunshield in 1973 after extensive damage the station sustained during launch .
Extra -vehicular activities ( EVAs ) , while requiring extensive preparations , nonetheless have had good demonstrated safety : so far no one has died in the over 350 EVAs performed to date .
Construction of ISS was significantly delayed and over - budget with respect to the original plan , and these facts left a very bad taste in the mouths of many .
ISS construction was overly - dependent on the Shuttle .
However , ISS is now nearly complete and full - complement crew operations have begun .
Sunk costs are sunk , and it is this author ’s hope that the space community will not ignore the positive lessons that ISS has to teach with respect to redundancy , for logistics and crew transport , and well as for the chance to see in action a system with the ability to fix problems at leisure using telerobotics and EVAs .
The planned retirement of the Shuttle in 2010 or 2011 will cause at least a temporary loss of redundancy in crew transport to ISS , though it might well be the case that redundancy will eventually grow , including perhaps the Chinese , SpaceX ’s Dragon , Orbital ’s Cygnus , or other possibilities .
There has been discussion of continuing the Shuttle beyond 2011 at a sharply reduced flight rate ; from this essay it can be seen that one virtue of doing so would be to serve as a backup for Soyuz in case of a Soyuz failure .
The proposed Launcher - Out Rule is not a new concept ; for example , the following wording appears as Groundrule A - 1 in the Space Transportation Architecture Study ( STAS ) from the late 1980s : “ Viable architecture will be based on a mixed fleet concept for operational flexibility .
As a minimum , two independent ( different major subsystems ) launch , upperstage and return to Earth ( especially for manned missions ) systems must be employed to provide assured access for the specific , high priority payloads designated in the mission model . ”
The words “ independent ( different major subsystems ) ” can help us to see a value that international partners can provide in large space architectures .
Soyuz was not grounded at the same time that the Shuttle fleet was after the Challenger and Columbia disasters , and a future failure of , say , a Progress resupply vehicle would likely have no effect on the HTV ’s ability to supply the stations .
The fact that different nations developed their own independent launch capabilities has had the happy side effect of increasing redundancy , even though the original motivations ( such as political or national pride goals ) for developing those separate systems were far removed from reliability considerations .
It might be the case that eventually there will be another failure of one of the logistics supply vehicle types supporting ISS operations .
However , just as the loss of individual bombers over Regensburg did not cause the entire raid to fail , so too the loss of an individual supply vehicle is unlikely to jeopardize the overall success of ISS .
Careful consideration of the operational availability implications of building an HLV — and becoming dependent upon it — versus the alternative of using a mixed fleet to achieve similar goals is warranted .

I was cleaning out a folder on my machine when I stumbled on an oldie but goodie PDF called “ Classic Testing Mistakes ” by Brian Marick .
In the paper he states how he breaks the classic mistakes into 5 themes and how to resolve the mistakes :
1. The Role of Testing : who does the testing team serve , and how does it do that ?
2. Planning the Testing Effort : how should the whole team ’s work be organized ?
3. Personnel Issues : who should test ?
4 . The Tester at Work : designing , writing , and maintaining individual tests .
5. Technology Rampant : quick technological fixes for hard problems .
Common mistakes that I see are :
Communication :
All team members need to be able to communicate with each other .
A tester needs to know what to test , when to test , and the importance of what is to be tested
Ability to change : Schedules & resources change so everyone on the team need to be able to understand that change is inevitable .
Documentation : this is key especially in test steps , defect reports and findings reports .
If you find a defect you have to be able to allow the next person to recreate it by providing them with detailed steps .
Automation :
Not everything can be automated nor should it be .
Pick the tests that you find you are testing the most , smoke tests are great candidates for automation .
Results :
Do n’t be fooled by the results .
If a result shows that a test failed , investigate it before throwing up a flag .
All projects have a mistake of some kind so I thought I ’d see what other people felt were common mistakes as well .
I would like to thank all the contributors on Twitter & Linked In for taking the time to respond to the question / tweet .
Below are the responses I received back with my comments ( in purple of course ) :
Response from @michael_d_kelly on Twitter :
A common mistake I make is to get tunnel vision on the specific changes being made in a release , ignoring other quality criteria I agree , there are times that a person is so focused on one piece that they forget to look at the big picture .
Response from @aegeansys on Twitter :
Ignoring the fact that a certain bug fix is a feature , treating it as a normal bugfix and not adjusting the testing accordingly .
When a bug / defect is a marked as a feature the requirements should also be updated .
I have seen times where test cases are updated but the requirements are not .
Response from Vinodh Sen Ethirajulu on LinkedIn :
1. Functional test plan must be written by a tester and reviewed by a domain expert / business analyst .
This must be withheld from the developer .
This is intentional .
A test plan should be sent to all project team members so everyone knows what the testing group is planning on testing .
2 . Code checkin must be allowed only after all probablem scenarios is tested and passed in unit test .
I agree but there will be times that an emergency fix needs to be put in .
Also , I do n’t think you can say no checkins allowed since there are pieces of code that are not tied directly to others .
I think the response here should be that the code should not be deploed / deliverd to the test group until until testing has been completed
3 . Some tools are there that can anticipate runtime errors better than a human reader / tester .
All modules under current release must be subjected to such tools .
code checkin must be allowed only after this .
This would be more up to the company since not all tools are allowed within an organizations framework .
All three points are common sense .
But some projects these are not followed strictly due to time constraint or resource constraint .
Example of tool as in 3 is findbugs for eclipse .
I am sure such tools exists for other platforms .
Yes , there are tools out there but are not always allowed due to security .
Response from Geoff Feldman on LinkedIn :
1. Time and repetition is not relevant .
Functions and boundary conditions on the functions including preserved state as it affects other functions is key .
This occurs everywhere and all teams are impacted by this
2. Testers looking busy and unable to explain their coverage is a huge red flag .
The bigger flag is when the defects keep showing up in production
3. Methodology is key .
So is a testing process that begins with repeatable , maintained developer unit test .
Agree , bigger issue I see is that not everyone agrees on which process / methodology is going to be followed .
Everyone needs to agree and if it needs to be changed everyone should be made aware of the change .
Response from Rick Kiessig on LinkedIn :
1 . Unit tests written by the same person that wrote the code , because they often use the same faulty logic in their tests as in the code itself .
Solution : have some unit tests written by other developers or QA .
Great solution
2 . Not testing for quality : including performance , scalability and security I think that all applications should be tested for these items .
3 . Focusing on cases that are really “ self - testing , ” rather than on the much - less - visible corner cases .
Agree
4 . Failing to include code coverage measurements and targets in unit test guidelines .
Agree
5 . Not following a coherent testing strategy .
Agree , consistency is key .
6 . Testing low - level components only , and forgetting to test the system as a whole .
This is not something a test team should forget , if this happens I hope you bring it up right away to get it corrected .
Response from Bill Rinko - Gay on LinkedIn :
1 . Not involving the QA group at the requirements phase .
QA should be reviewing and commenting on requirements and design .
Agree
2. Writing tests to the implementation rather than the requirements .
This not only leads to trash as the implementation changes , but validates the wrong thing .
Developers validate the implementation .
Testers should validate the requirements .
Testers should validate that the implementation worked by executing smoke tests and then running the test cases that are based on the requirements
3 . Automating only after the software is stable .
The bulk of passed test cases should be automated .
Disagree , you cannot automate everything .
Just because a test case passed does n’t mean it should be automated .
What should happen is when pieces of functionality are stable and being repeated in testing then they should be automated .
4. Automation experts should write code that can handle instability of early builds .
Automation experts should have development expertise , not just record / playback .
Use humans for inventing new tests , not running old ones .
Partially agree .
Yes , automation experts should have more than just record & playback expertise but if the code is not stable they cannot automate it .
You automate the tests that you know what the expected result will be not ones that you think you know .
Response from Jonathan Ross on LinkedIn :
1 . The tester should have an appreciation of the real world use cases of the deliverable being tested .
Agree
2 . If something feels wrong it is probably a bug of some nature .
This is not always the case , there has been times that I thought something was wrong but when I went back to the requirements it was correct and not a bug / defect .
If it feels wrong check the documentation before writing up the bug / defect .
3 . Do n’t wait until the end of the dev cycle to test .
Small test cycles for small changes .
Everyone on the project should agree to using an agile / iterative approach for this .
4 . Not maintaining test documentation and scripts / tools .
This is huge especially since test teams are usually on multiple projects so up to date documentation is very important to keep track of what has been done , why , and what is left to be done .
You can make sure of this and other common errors with good planning , close work with R&D / Product and a highly motivated QA team who are kept passionate about their work .
Response from Jim Hanlon on LinkedIn :
1 . The most common mistake in the testing process is underestimating the number of test cases required to adequately test the Application Under Test .
This could be due to the requirements constantly changing and / or the test team is not involved in the requirements phase .
2 . A corollary to the first is underestimating the time required to test the AUT .
3 . No automated testing strategy : generation / execution / reporting .
Agree
4 . Some larger organizational issues : poor coordination with the requirements process ; poor coordination with the debug / fixpack / build / release process .
When this happens someone should step up and bring this up as an issue so it can be resolved
Response from Mike Sax on LinkedIn :
1 . Not finding bugs does n’t mean that they ’re not there .
It ’s easy to start a testing effort seeing a small volume of defects and think “ wow , it must be pretty clean ! ”
Do n’t wait until the mid point of the effort to get on top of the testing process to ensure that testers are effectively executing scripts and workflows , as well as evaluating the scripts and process to ensure an effective test cycle .
Agree
2. Communication : Testers and developers who will be fixing bugs should be in close communication with each other .
IM , phone , in person rather than email that can get lost in the shuffle .
Too often , bugs fall into a “ researching ” status for days while emails shuffle back and forth to answer a question that could possibly have been addressed quickly in a face to face chat .
Agree , should have touchpoint meetings as well to help resolve this
3 . Effectively describing bugs : Especially for non QA professionals participating in testing .
They need to be educated prior to beginning testing on the expected standards for creating defect records to ensure that as much information is relayed to the developers as possible ( detailed error messages , screenshots , steps to reproduce , etc ) .
Capturing all of this information initially cuts down on the need for back and forth communication between the developer and tester .
Agree , all bugs should have detailed steps & screenshots so they can be recreated
4 . Managing scope through triage : Effective defect triage will help to minimize the presence of enhancement requests ( either intentional or inadvertent ) that make it into a developer ’s queue and impacts the timeline to complete defect remediation rather than flowing into the project ’s change management process for new or changed functionality .
Agree
Response from Walter Tyree on LinkedIn :
Testing on a hardware / software configuration that is not representative of what the users have .
The computers that developers and testers have are quite often not what the user community will be running .
Having a test lab ( and forcing people to test in the lab ) of machines that are configured for all of the scenarios within an Enterprise can save lots of time ( Ghosting can really help here ) .
Agree , testing should be completed on a variety of different configurations to make sure end users can use the application being delivered .
What common testing mistakes do you see ?
How do you resolve theses issues so they do n’t keep happening ?
What are your thoughts on the responses that are noted in this blog ?
Do you agree / disagree ?

Obama ’s War Against Afghanistan and the History of Opium
Visual Media , Global News Channels and Shaping Public Opinion
‘ Daisy Cutters and Poppy Wearers . ’
Some people may be wondering what this means .
The Daisy Cutter is the most powerful non-nuclear bomb in the American armoury .
Even larger bombs are currently being developed .
The Daisy Cutter has an explosion similar to a small nuclear or atomic bomb .
They say that when one was dropped in Iraq , the explosion lit up the entire front .
Many Iraqi soldiers defected after seeing that bomb .
Several of these were dropped in Afghanistan , especially in the battles of Tora Bora .
Tony Blair is an example of a poppy - wearer .
The poppy represents international peace .
I got the idea for the title of this article from a cartoon I saw in one of the national newspapers .
It was at the time when daisy - cutters were being dropped in Afghanistan and it was international peace day .
The cartoon depicted a picture of Tony Blair wearing a poppy and an explosion behind him .
The caption simply read : ‘ Daisy - cutter … Poppy - wearer ’ .
We are entering an age where the visual media is gaining increasing influence on human societies , especially the 24 - hour news channels , which have now become the most popular of all channels .
A lot has been written about the shaping of public opinion .
I would like to mention some of the things that characterize the visual news media .
First , thought and emotion control .
By relying upon the global news channels for information , the public tacitly allow themselves to be influenced in their thoughts and opinions about global events , on the spurious assumption that such information is unbiased and ‘ independent ’ .
A more ominous recent development , possibly , was illustrated by the case of Princess Diana ’s death .
The virtually unending media coverage generated the huge public outpouring of grief , so uncharacteristic of the British people .
Individuals who would not normally have paid the story much of a second thought were influenced by the unceasing media coverage , repeatedly telling them how devastated they ( the British public ) were , that they found themselves believing it and even feeling it .
News channels have short memories .
This was partly my reason for writing this article .
The material we are currently seeing on the news channels about Afghanistan , the Taliban and the war — it is as if everything that led up to that point has been forgotten .
The comments being made about the Taliban seem as if they come from a vacuum , as if everything that has led up to this point has been erased from the public mind .
When most people think about the Taliban and opium , they have the impression that the Taliban are heavily involved in the opium trade .
That is in fact the message that is coming through from the media at the current time , sometimes through hints , and sometimes more explicitly .
Whereas , in reality , as we shall see , the Taliban were responsible for stopping the opium production in Afghanistan and reducing it to zero .
The Pentagon now spends more than $ 550 m on what it calls ‘ public affairs ’ , not including personnel costs .
So huge amounts of money are being put by the American military into what is referred to as ‘ perception management . ’
It involves manipulating and using the media to convey a certain message .
I will present a couple of examples of this .
It is clear that the media is not a neutral institution .
For example , Tony Blair met Rupert Murdoch three times in the run up to the invasion of Iraq .
Rupert Murdoch owns large sections of the western news media , including Fox News , Sky , the Times newspaper , the Sun , News of the World , at least one of the large American newspapers and much of the Australian news media .
Although ‘ Muslim ’ channels such as the Emirates ’ Al - Jazeera , Pakistan ’s Geo News , and others , may superficially give the impression of being pro-Muslim , this is certainly not the case .
In fact , there is little difference between such channels and mainstream UK or US news channels .
These Arab or Pakistani news channels represent the secular , westernised tier of those societies .
Despite the differing national allegiances , they ultimately share common values with their ex-colonial masters , i.e. , democracy , secularism and often a belief in a capitalist economy .
However , it should be remembered that this West - imitating class is a minority in Muslim countries .
An example of how the news media has been responsible for manipulating public opinion occurred prior to the war against Iraq , when Iraq had invaded Kuwait .
Prior to the American and British led attack , there was a widely reported story of Iraqi soldiers killing Kuwaiti babies .
At a congressional human rights caucus , a young woman called Nayirah relayed a shocking story of what she had allegedly witnessed .
The press latched on to the story , and the initial account of fifteen babies was soon exaggerated in sectors of the press up to 312 .
Several members of congress said that this story had influenced their vote to approve the military action against Iraq .
President Bush frequently mentioned it in the lead up to the war .
In the Senate , six senators specifically cited the story in their speeches supporting the resolution to give Bush authorization to use American forces in Kuwait .
Shortly after the war ended , it became clear that this story was fabricated .
ABC News and Amnesty International amongst others reported that there was no evidence that this had occurred .
Finally , the New York Times made the shocking revelation that Nayirah was in fact the 15 - year - old daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador in America .
Similarly , before Iraq was invaded following the September 11th attacks , most Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was somehow behind 9/11 or that he was directly linked to Al Qaeda , despite the fact that no such link existed .
In fact , Salafi jihadist groups such as Al Qaeda ( supposing we assume that such an organisation substantially exists outside of its media construct ) are ideologically vehemently opposed to secular leaders like Hussein , considering them to be apostates , worse than ‘ disbelievers . ’
Some polls found that 7 in 10 Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was personally involved in September 11th attacks .
This public attitude was engineered by the state department .
President Bush , Dick Cheney and co were hinting at links between the two in public speeches .
The journal Perspectives on Politics published a study in which they looked at this issue .
The authors mention : “ Our analysis of Bush ’s speeches reveals that the administration consistently connected Iraq with 9/11 … ” They go on to mention how the media colluded with the Bush et al. : “ New York Times coverage of the president ’s speeches featured almost no debate over the framing of the Iraq conflict as part of the war on terror .
This assertion had tremendous influence on public attitudes , as indicated by polling data from several sources . ”
This eventually led to Iraq being invaded .
History of the Global Opium Industry
Now , going into the main subject of the article , I am going present you with two historical narratives and they interlink .
One of them is the history of the global opium / heroin trade .
The other is the story of the Taliban .
Part of the intention of this presentation is just to remind people of historical facts .
I will not indulge in conspiracy theory or anything of that sort ; I simply wish to mention historical realities and allow people to judge the facts for themselves .
The information about the Taliban is drawn from sources that are in not in any way pro-Taliban .
The two main books to which I refer are The Taliban by Ahmad Rashid , which many western leaders were reading ( it was said to be Tony Blair ’s bedside reading leading up to the war ) , and Reaping the Whirlwind by a journalist called Michael Griffin .
Neither author is a fan of the Taliban
I present the reader with historical facts which are often obscured or omitted from our dominant sources of news .
People have a right to know the truth , and the British people have a right to know why their sons and daughters are fighting and being killed in a faraway land called Afghanistan .
The Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) said : “ The best jihad is the word of truth in front of a tyrant ruler . ”
The narcotics industry is amongst the largest international businesses in the world .
The U.N estimates approximately $ 400 billion a year is involved .
Kofi Anan , the ex-secretary general of the United Nations , claimed that the illegal narcotics industry is greater than the global oil and gas industry and twice as large as the overall automobile industry .
This gives us an idea of the scale we are dealing with .
We know that the oil and gas or global energy industry is one of the largest industries in the world .
Oil is so central to the global economy that it is referred to as an ‘ oil - based economy ’ .
It is clear that this is a huge , highly organised and integrated international industry .
There must be very powerful players where such vast amounts of money are involved .
This is not about a few Pakistanis smuggling Afghan heroin and selling it in Bradford .
That is just the very lowest point of the chain .
There are far bigger players involved , and they are literally making billions .
The 18th and 19th centuries were the height of the British Empire .
In the 20th century , America emerges as the major world power and proceeds to sideline Britain , France and the old colonial powers .
Let us examine the ‘ Opium Wars ’ , also called the ‘ Anglo - Chinese Wars . ’
The East India Company was owned by British aristocracy and major British traders .
It was a shareholder company and the names of all of the owners can be easily looked up .
The East India Company is described as the mother of modern corporations and , interestingly , it had its own army .
The Mughal Empire was in decline when , in 1757 , the East India Company conquered Bengal .
This was a major opium growing region .
The East India Company pursued a monopoly on the production and export of opium .
It was only later , towards the end of the 19th century , that heroin was first synthesized from opium .
Prior to that , it was the opium that was smoked .
In 1773 , 75 tonnes were exported to China .
The East India Company was selling the opium to China in exchange for Chinese commodities such as silk and tea .
This was against Chinese law .
The Chinese had outlawed opium in their land because of the detrimental effects on their people .
However Britain continued .
By the 1830 ’s , England had become the major drug trafficking organisation in the world , through the East India Company .
Many opium addicts were coming about in China .
The British government gave the East India Company a monopoly on trade with China .
Heroin Destroys Lives
Opium is a devastating addiction .
When people become addicted to opium or heroin , they will give all of their wealth to feed their addiction .
When they run out of money they will start stealing , from their own family , from their neighbours .
Many women will go into prostitution to pay for their habit .
It ’s a very , very addictive drug .
As a side note , many people of my generation did not get into hard drugs like heroin because of the public awareness campaigns that took place in the 1980 ’s when we were going through school .
Many of my generation will remember the ‘ Just Say No ’ campaign that began in America and crossed over to the UK in the 1980s .
The fact that we still remember it shows , firstly , how powerful the visual media is in our lives , and , secondly , how easily it can be used as a force for good if the will is there .
It makes you wonder why such campaigns are not seen any longer and why steps are not taken to prevent the glamorisation of drug use in the media .
From a purely business point of view , this is the best commodity you can imagine .
You sell this to someone and they will come back for more .
Many heroin addicts soon start injecting the drug so that it goes straight into the bloodstream .
This often causes infections and abscesses .
When they keep injecting into the same veins , they clot up so they have to keep finding new ones .
Many end up injecting into their groin or even the base of the tongue .
The Opium Trade in the Nineteenth Century
Moving now into the 19th century , the opium trade was increasing .
By the 1820 ’s it had gone up to 900 tonnes of opium annually from India to China .
Once again the Imperial Chinese government made the opium imports illegal , but Great Britain continued .
By 1837 , 2500 tonnes were being exported .
This was more than all other British exports to China combined .
In effect , the opium trade was fuelling the East India company , and — considering that India was the richest and most productive region of the empire — was a major driver for the empire itself .
The First Opium War came about because the Chinese were resisting the import of opium into their country .
Great Britain sent warships to face the Chinese .
It has been described as “ perhaps the most sordid , base and vicious event in European history . ”
The Chinese were defeated and were forced to sign a treaty in 1842 .
They were forced to pay 6 million dollars for the opium that the Chinese police had destroyed .
Hong Kong was handed over to Britain , and access to Chinese ports was agreed .
Over the next 30 years the opium trade more than doubled .
France was Britain ’s main colonial rival .
In 1856 , because of the devastating effect on the Chinese people , the Chinese once again made attempts to resist .
The Second Opium War broke out and Britain was again victorious .
This time Great Britain demanded complete legalisation of opium and the free propagation of Christianity in China , to which the Chinese had no choice but to submit .
In 1858 , the East India Company was dissolved and the British government itself took on the governance of India .
Incidentally , John Stewart Mill , one of the fathers of modern capitalism , made a ‘ valiant defence ’ of the East India Company .
Following the second opium war , China gave up trying to stop the influx of opium and , to minimise the economic impact of the British trade , decided to grow opium itself , .
By the end of the 19th century , 90 million out of 300 million Chinese were addicted to opium .
Almost a third of the population were addicts .
The Opium Trade in the Twentieth Century
Let us move on to the 20th century which has been triumphantly described as “ the American Century ” .
It seems strange for anyone to want to claim the 20th century , as it was , no doubt , the most bloody , horrific century known to recorded history , which witnessed two world wars and the slaughter of millions .
One of the signs of the End Times according to the Prophet ( may blessings and peace be upon him ) is widespread bloodshed .
As Shaykh Hamza Yusuf has mentioned , the 20th century , especially the first half of it , can be seen in the light of the power struggle between the new American power and colonial rivals Britain and France , with the US emerging victorious .
Many of the events of the 20th century can be looked at in that light .
Looking at America , let us examine actions rather than words .
As Noam Chomsky points out , “ Britain can appeal to an imperial tradition of refreshing candor , unlike the United States which has preferred to don the garb of saintliness as it proceeds to crush anyone in its path . ”
In other words , the British were openly racist and imperial in their outlook .
With the United States , we find a different approach .
They always claim to be doing ‘ good ’ while , in fact , crushing anyone in their path to power and dominance .
If we concentrate on rhetoric and the public stances of politicians , we will simply be lost in circles of half - truths , avoidance , and illogicity .
If we examine actions , we may arrive at a clearer understanding of reality .
Coming into the 20th century , China eventually managed to stop Britain exporting opium to it .
Significantly , it only achieved this with the assistance of the USA .
China had tried in vain for 150 years and fought two wars to stop Britain bringing opium into China , but it had failed .
In 1911 , US president Theodore Roosevelt intervened to break up the British opium trade .
This was , no doubt , a significant blow for Britain ’s imperial economy .
Of course , the American stance was that they were doing it for a good cause .
Through the forum of the Shanghai International Opium Conference , the US pressed for legislation aimed at suppressing the sale of opium to China .
Britain and France had to agree .
By 1917 China had stopped producing and importing opium .
In the 1950s , all opium production in China ceased with the communist regime .
Before the Second World War , it was producing most of the world ’s opium .
Opium production shifted away from China to neighbouring countries which became known as the golden triangle : Thailand , Laos , Burma , all bordering China on the south - west side .
In the 1970s , 67 % of the world ’s opium was coming from this area .
In 1972 , one third of US soldiers coming back from Vietnam were addicted to opium .
Wherever the United States intervenes , politically or militarily , in different opium producing regions , opium production invariably increases .
The US , of course , will blame one factor or another for this , and often claims to be struggling valiantly to fight the drug problem .
Once again , witness ‘ the garb of saintliness ’ that Chomsky describes .
For example , in the 1970s , Nixon launched his ‘ war on drugs . ’
He successfully shut down the heroin supply chain through Turkey and France ( the so - called ‘ French connection ’ ) , but “ inadvertently ” ended up creating a new market for the South - East Asian heroin .
The long term consequence of this drug war was in fact increased global opium production and rising heroin consumption .
In a well - referenced article by Peter Dale Scott , professor at the University of California , Berkley , under the sub - title , ‘ Expanded World Drug Production as a Product of US Interventions , ’ he shows that every time America becomes politically or militarily involved in any drug producing country , drug production multiplies .
Here are some examples he gives for opium production :
Burma : 40 tonnes in 1939 – 600 tonnes in 1970
Thailand : 7 tonnes in 1939 – 200 tonnes in 1968
Laos : Less than 15 tonnes in 1939 – 50 tonnes in 1973
In Columbia , US troops have been intervening since the late 1980s in another so - called ‘ war on drugs , ’ but in fact the coca production ( which is what cocaine is produced from ) has tripled between 1991 and 1999 .
Cultivation of the opium poppy has increased by five times in the region .
Once again , either you can look at realities on the ground or you can listen to the rhetoric .
There are many reasons why they have been unable to curtail drug production , for example , “ We were unable to control the situation here , ” or “ the insurgents are causing trouble so we are unable to control the drug trade , ” etc .
However , with a repeated pattern , excuses start becoming a little lame , to use a colloquial expression .
This is a huge cake , and people want part of the cake .
The CIA has been widely implicated in the international drugs trade . , ,
Afghanistan became important as it began producing a lot of opium .
After the defeat of the communists in 1989 , Afghanistan descended into chaos with multiple warlords , each commanding his own territory and establishing the rule of brute force .
The opium trade flourished .
By the 1990s , half of the world ’s heroin and 90 % of European heroin was coming from Afghanistan .
In 1996 , the Taliban took power in Kabul .
Initially the Taliban allowed the opium production to continue .
Although opium is illegal in Shariah law , they justified their position by saying that stopping the opium trade would have a devastating impact on Afghanistan ’s impoverished economy , and , secondly , that Afghan opium was being exported to non-Muslim lands , so it was not the Taliban ’s concern .
Insight into the players involved in the international drug trade
In 1986 , Major Zahooruddin Afridi of the Pakistan Army was caught driving to Karachi from Peshawar with 220 kilograms of high grade heroin .
This was the largest seizure in Pakistani history .
Two months later , Air Force officer , Flight Lieutenant Khalilur Rahman was caught with 220 kilograms of heroin on the same route .
He calmly confessed that this was his fifth mission .
The total value of just these two seizures was $ 600 million , equivalent to the entire US aid to Pakistan that year .
This brings home the vast sums of money involved .
If this is the value of just two seizures , it is perhaps not surprising , bearing in mind human nature , that top government officials and army personnel are involved .
Both men were put in jail in Karachi but soon mysteriously disappeared .
Ahmed Rashid mentions that “ western anti-narcotics agencies in Islamabad kept track of drug lords , who became Members of the National Assembly …
Drug lords funded candidates to high office in both Bhutto ’s PPP and Sharif ’s Pakistan Muslim League . ”
This is what money can do .
At the end of 2000 , Mullah Omar , no doubt under pressure from other ulema , reversed the Taliban position and issued the fatwa to ban the opium poppy , despite the economic repercussions on his country .
The United Nations confirmed that by spring , which is the time of year for the opium harvest , opium production had gone down to almost zero .
Half of the world ’s heroin had been stopped by that one act of Mullah Omar .
Martin Jelsma , in the International Journal on Drug Policy , states , “ The Taliban opium ban in 2000 / 2001 had , there is no doubt , the most profound impact on opium / heroin supply in modern history . ”
You can imagine that some very powerful people were not too happy about this .
Soon after this , the September 11 attacks took place in New York , leading , within months , to the invasion of Afghanistan .
America and Britain brought back all of the old drug lords , the so called Northern Alliance .
Opium production went straight back up to what it had been before the ban by the Taliban .
It is by no means clear who engineered the September 11 attacks .
Iraq had nothing to do with September 11 , but it was invaded as a direct result .
September 11 led to America gaining direct control of Iraq , with its huge oil reserves , and Afghanistan , with its huge opium crop .
American forces were extremely efficient in immediately seizing and securing the Iraqi oil fields , but are not organised enough to this day to provide basic amenities for the Iraqi people , or stop the opium / heroin production in Afghanistan .
An important point about the poppy growth in Afghanistan is that it is relatively simple for the US to eradicate it .
All of it is well mapped out by satellite imagery .
By satellite , you can read what is written on a cigarette packet so it is no problem identifying the massive opium fields .
Sophisticated computer programs can map out exactly where the opium is growing .
The US forces could destroy the crops using aerial spraying techniques .
They do not even have to go on the ground , they can simply fly over , spray and destroy .
This is not denied by the US and its allies , but other reasons are given to justify why opium poppies are not destroyed .
A recent development is that the media has started to portray the Taliban as the cause of the current explosion in heroin and opium production .
In 2002 , following the American - led invasion , the United Nations drug agency issued an urgent warning that the allied forces need to act quickly to destroy the poppy crops before the end of spring .
Otherwise the heroin that the Taliban had stopped would flood back .
However , the Bush Administration - CIA decided not to destroy the poppy crop in Afghanistan , saying , “ We decided not to destroy Afghanistan ’s opium over fears that such an act may destabilise Pakistan . ”
Just $ 200 given to each Afghan poppy farmer would compensate for their opium crop .
For just $ 20 million in total , America could get the farmers to stop growing opium by simply paying them off .
A significant point to note in this regard is the ease and rapidity with which the Taliban were able to eradicate opium production
In Afghanistan , despite having none of the sophisticated technology or resources available to western agencies .
The results of the Taliban opium ban shocked the world anti-narcotics agencies , including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , which have been operating for decades on a budget of billions to fight against the global illegal drugs trade .
The only sensible conclusion we can draw from this is that there are powerful forces working to prevent easy and effective strategies from being implemented by anti-narcotics agencies .
In view of the effectiveness of the Taliban opium ban , claims by anti-narcotics agencies that they have been unable to find effective means of fighting the ‘ war on drugs ’ despite the immense resources thrown at them by the US and other governments are implausible .
Rashid mentions that several members of the US Drugs Enforcement Administration in Pakistan in the 1980s resigned from their posts or requested to be relocated as the CIA refused to allow them to do their job .
In 2009 , opium production has continued to escalate dramatically .
Recent figures from the UN show that 90 % of the world ’s heroin now comes from Afghanistan .
History of the Taliban
It was 1989 that the Soviet troops finally left Afghanistan .
America and Pakistan had been helping the so - called Mujahidin fight against the communists .
The puppet communist government left behind by the Russians was overthrown by 1992 .
Following that , Afghanistan descended into an anarchic state , and it was in 1994 that the Taliban emerged .
Ahmad Rashid says , “ Afghanistan was in a state of virtual disintegration just before the Taliban emerged …
The country was divided into warlord fiefdoms …
The warlords seized homes and farms and abused the population at will . ”
They were kidnapping boys and girls for sexual pleasure and robbing merchants in the markets .
Traditional the ulema mention that an hour of anarchy is worse than 40 years of a tyrant .
You may have a tyrant ruler but he maintains law and order .
People can go about their normal life .
But when you have anarchy , a complete breakdown of authority , the poor and the weak in society are the ones who suffer most .
Ahmad Rashid is an Afghan himself .
He met several of the original Taliban , friends of Mullah Omar .
They told him that during the time after the communists were defeated , some of the mujahidin , like Mullah Omar , went back to their madrasas ( schools ) to continue studying and teaching .
All of the anti-communist fighters were referred to as mujahidin but some were doing it for the sake of God , some evidently were not .
Mullah Omar himself had a school where he was teaching students in the south of Afghanistan .
His companions mention that they used to sit and discuss what they could do about the state of the country .
They agonised over the abuses taking place and the suffering of the people .
In the spring of 1994 , the initial event that took place is quite widely reported and probably true .
Two teenage girls were abducted by one of the commanders , taken to a military camp , their hair shaved , and they were repeatedly raped .
Some of their family came to Mullah Omar and asked for his help .
Mullah Omar took thirty students with sixteen rifles between them .
They freed the girls and hung the commander from the barrel of a tank .
Mullah Omar said later , “ We were fighting against Muslims who had gone wrong .
How could we remain quiet when we could see crimes being committed against women and the poor . ”
Word got around of this incident .
People started coming to Mullah Omar and asking for his help .
A few months later , two commanders were fighting over a young boy that both wanted to rape .
Several civilians were killed in that fight .
Omar and the students freed him .
This led , as Rashid describes it , to Mullah Omar emerging as a ‘ Robin Hood figure , ’ helping the poor against the warlords and druglords .
From this beginning , the Taliban ( or ‘ Students ’ ) eventually took control of Kandahar and then the south of Afghanistan .
Within two years , they had marched into the capital , Kabul .
Mullah Omar Declared ‘ Commander of the Believers ’
In Kandahar , there is a museum which contains a burdah ( a cloak ) which is attributed to the Prophet himself , and is considered the most holy shrine in Afghanistan .
The cloak is rarely taken out of the museum .
For Mullah Omar , it was brought it out for the first time in 60 years .
Draped in the blessed cloak , the ‘ students ’ pledged allegiance to him and declared him ‘ Ameer al Mu’mineen ’ ( Commander of the Believers ) .
Strict Interpretation of Islam
The Taliban were criticised for was their strict interpretation of Islam .
This aspect is routinely used as a justification for invading the country .
Journalist , Michael Griffin mentions the following acts of the Taliban when they took Kabul :
They made an announcement on the radio ordering : “ All those sisters working in government offices are hereby informed to stay at home until further notice ” .
They were probably concerned about unislamic free - mixing in government departments .
This paralysed the government , of which 25 % staff were women .
They made the full body covering ( Niqaab ) obligatory for women .
Men had to wear shalwar kameez apparently , not western clothing , grow long beards and forced to go to the mosque five times a day .
They prohibited toothpaste , insisting on the natural tooth - cleansing root , miswak .
All of the following were forbidden : TV , kite flying , pigeons , dancing , music , singing , chess , marbles , cigarettes , and using paper as a wrapper in case it was printed with extracts of the Quran .
I do n’t know what really happened .
How many times have you seen Taliban ambassadors or representatives on television , explaining their point of view ?
You have to give people a chance to speak ; this is a fundamental aspect of justice .
One of the most effective techniques of media control is simply not to give the ‘ enemy ’ a voice .
One of the rare exceptions was when Taliban Envoy , Saeed Rahmatullah Hishami , was interviewed on the American radio station , Talk of the Nation , prior to the September 11 attacks .
He protested at the biased reporting and demonisation of the Taliban by western media : “ If I had all my knowledge of Taliban from the media here , I would hate the Taliban as well . ”
He was asked why the Taliban stopped girls going to school .
He repeatedly said , “ The Taliban have never said that girls should not go to school . ”
In fact , he stated that the Taliban had appealed to the international community to help Afghanistan provide facilities for girls to obtain a segregated education .
The United Nations had responded by building several girls ’ colleges there which had been running successfully under the Taliban .
He also stated that contrary to the media depiction of the Taliban as misogynous zealots who did not allow women to leave their houses , the Taliban had respect for women and had improved the situation for Afghan women , making it safe for them to walk the streets .
He said that women were working in several government ministries under Taliban rule .
He also claimed that the Taliban had offered the US to try Bin Laden in Afghanistan if the US provided evidence that he was involved in attacks on civilians in Tanzania and Kenya .
Anyone convicted of killing civilians under Taliban rule would get capital punishment .
The US rejected this offer .
The Taliban made a further offer agreeing to an international monitoring committee to be present in Afghanistan to watch Bin Laden ’s activities for the rest of his life , to ensure that he was not politically active .
This was also rejected by the US .
Saeed Hishami emphasised that the Taliban had done what no one else had done for Afghanistan : bring law and order , disarm the people , establish peace and security , make it safe for women to walk the streets , and stop opium production , but , he lamented , “ the world has only sent us cruise missiles , sanctions , isolation and criticism . ”
From the limited information I have , I suspect the Taliban did have a strict interpretation of Islam .
But one thing you can see from the list of prohibitions is that it is according to the traditional Hanafi school of law .
If you read the later books of Hanafi jurisprudence , you will find that the Taliban rulings pretty much follow them to the letter .
Was there wisdom in enforcing such a strict set of rules suddenly upon the people ?
That is debatable , but really the whole discussion about the Taliban ’s interpretation of shariah obscures and deviates attention from the real issues at hand
Muslims are becoming a persecuted minority in the UK , sometimes living in an atmosphere of fear if they wish to speak the truth .
One of the things we appreciate in this country is freedom of speech .
There is an increasing tendency to see things in the ‘ you ’re either with us or with the terrorists ’ fashion of George W Bush .
I do not support terrorism or attacks on innocent civilians in this country or any other , but does this mean I have to support an unjust foreign policy of the UK government ?
Do Muslims not have a right to express dissent without being labelled a ‘ fifth column ’ or ‘ traitors in our midst ’ ?
America ’s War Against the Taliban
When the Taliban came into power , perhaps they had a strict interpretation of Islam , but they brought law and order to the country , and it was a widely popular movement , because the poor and the oppressed , who were suffering from the anarchy , drug lords , and warlords , welcomed them .
The poor and weak were the ones who benefited because the Taliban brought justice and security .
They brought strict punishments , but for people who wanted to be law abiding citizens , go out and work , earn their daily living and feel safe on the streets , they were heroes and saviours .
They are aggressively demonised in the global media .
It is difficult to see the reality through the propaganda , and they are certainly not a media - savvy group .
In 1996 , the Taliban came into power in Kabul .
In the beginning they were welcomed by the Pakistan and US administrations .
People do not know this but there were Taliban ambassadors in America trying to work out a deal for a gas pipeline through Afghanistan .
An American oil company and an Argentinean one were competing for this contract .
So the US was dealing with the Taliban .
At that time the Taliban were allowing the opium production to continue .
Pakistan was particularly pleased because the Taliban had made the roads safe , and Pakistani trade could transit through Afghanistan to Turkmenistan and other central Asian destinations .
A few feminist voices objected to alleged abuse of women ’s rights , but Pakistan recognised the Taliban government , as did Saudi Arabia and the UAE .
But in early 2001 , they stopped the opium .
After September 11 2001 , the USA delivered the following ultimatum to the Taliban : The Taliban should hand over all the leaders of al Qaeda , release all imprisoned foreign nationals , close immediately every terrorist training camp , and give the United States access to terrorist training camps for inspection .
The Taliban responded that if the US gave them evidence that Bin Laden was guilty , they would hand him over .
They said that they had no evidence in their possession linking him to the September 11 attacks .
The response was not unreasonable : give us evidence and we will hand him over .
On 4th October , it is believed that the Taliban offered to turn Bin Laden over to Pakistan to have a trial in an international tribunal according to Islamic Shariah .
Pakistan refused .
On 7th October , the military threat was building up , and the Taliban offered again to detain Bin Laden and try him under Islamic Law , if the United States made a formal request and presented evidence .
This was also immediately rejected by the US .
When the American - led forces attacked Afghanistan , Pakistan entered into full cooperation with the American forces , allowing them to use her land and airspace .
Faced with the full might of Washington and her allies , Pervez Musharraf committed one of the most treacherous acts in Islam ’s history .
Fellow Muslim neighbours and brothers whom Pakistan had supported were ignominiously forsaken to gain American favour .
If Pakistan had simply remained neutral , it would have saved some honour .
Even Russia refused its airspace to be used by America until only a few weeks ago , when Barack Obama finally persuaded Putin and colleagues to allow it .
I was in Syria when Iraq was invaded .
I attended Friday prayer at the mosque of Shaykh Said Ramadan al - Buti .
In the sermon , he said , “ Not one leader of the Arab countries has stood up .
Not one voice has been heard from any Arab leader against the invasion of Iraq . ”
Baghdad has been bombed and Iraq has been invaded and not a voice heard from her Arab neighbours .
Shaykh Buti said that it would have been better for us to die , for all of us to have been killed [ referring to the Arab people ] , then to suffer such a humiliation and disgrace .
Whereas Musharraf capitulated , Mullah Omar remained steadfast .
The Taliban were clearly desperate not to enter a conflict with America and her allies .
They made offer after offer to the United States to try and resolve the issue , but they were not willing to hand over a man against whom they were given no evidence .
The Voice of America radio station conducted an interview with Mullah Omar through satellite phone just before the commencement of the war .
The US National Security Council raised objections and it was never broadcast in America .
However it was published in full in the UK in the Guardian newspaper — not front page news though .
Most people probably missed it .
This is a transcript of the interview :
VoA : Why do n’t you expel Osama Bin Laden ?
Mullah Omar :
This is not an issue of Osama Bin Laden , it is an issue of Islam .
Islam ’s prestige is at stake .
So is Afghanistan ’s tradition .
VoA : Do you know the US has announced a war on terrorism ?
Mullah Omar : I am considering two promises .
One is the promise of God , the other is that of Bush .
The Promise of God is that ‘ My land is vast . ’
If you start a journey on God ’s Path , you can reside anywhere on this Earth and will be protected .
The promise of Bush is that there is no place on Earth where you can hide and I cannot find you .
We will see which one of these two promises is fulfilled .
VoA : But are n’t you afraid for the people , yourself , the Taliban , your country ?
Mullah Omar : Almighty God is helping the believers and the Muslims .
God Says
He will never be satisfied with the infidels .
In terms of worldly affairs America is very strong .
Even if it was twice as strong , or twice that , it could not be strong enough to defeat us .
We are confident that no one can harm us if God is with us .
VoA : You are telling me you are not concerned but Afghans all over the world are concerned .
Mullah Omar :
We are also concerned .
Great issues lie ahead but we depend on God ’s Mercy .
Consider our point of view .
If we give Osama away today , Muslims who are now pleading to give him up would then be reviling us for giving him up .
Everyone is afraid of America and wants to please it , but Americans will not be able to prevent such acts like the one that has just occurred because America has taken Islam hostage .
If you look at Islamic countries the people are in despair , they are complaining that Islam is gone but people remain firm in their Islamic beliefs .
In their pain and frustration some of them commit suicide acts .
They feel they have nothing to lose .
VoA : What do you mean by saying America has taken the Islamic world hostage ?
Mullah Omar : America controls the governments of the Islamic countries .
The people ask to follow Islam but the governments do not listen because they are in the grip of the United States .
If someone follows the path of Islam , the government arrests him , tortures him or kills him .
This is the doing of America .
If it stops supporting those governments and lets the people deal with them then such things wo n’t happen .
America has created the evil that is attacking it .
The evil will not disappear even if I die and Osama dies and others die .
The US should step back and review its policy .
It should stop trying to impose its empire on the rest of the world , especially on Islamic countries .
VoA : So you wo n’t give Osama Bin Laden up ?
Mullah Omar : No .
We can not do that .
If we did it means we are not Muslims , that Islam is finished .
If we were afraid of attack , we could have surrendered him the last time we were threatened and attacked .
So America can hit us again and this time we do n’t even have a friend .
VoA : If you fight America with all your might , can the Taliban do that ?
Wo n’t America beat you and wo n’t your people suffer even more ?
Mullah Omar : I am very confident that it wo n’t turn out this way .
Please note this .
There is nothing more we can do except depend on Almighty God .
If a person does then he is assured that the Almighty will help him , have mercy on him , and he will succeed .
Afghanistan Post - Invasion
By 2006 , a few years after the invasion , the Washington Post reported that opium production in Afghanistan , now providing more than 90 % of the world ’s heroin , broke all previous records .
The United Nations office of drugs and crime in 2006 reported that the harvest in Afghanistan was going to be a world record , and up to 92 % of the world ’s heroin was now originating in Afghanistan .
The Daily Mail on 21 July 2007 carried an article by Craig Murray , British ambassador in neighbouring Uzbekistan from 2002 to 2004 , entitled : “ Britain is protecting the biggest heroin crop of all time ” .
He asks why British troops are being killed in Afghanistan .
He says , “ The Taliban had reduced the opium crop to precisely nil .
That is an inconvenient truth that our spin has managed to obscure … ”
“ They were as unlikely to sell you heroin as a bottle of Johnny Walker ” ( alluding to the fact that they are strict Muslims ) .
“ They stamped out the opium trade and impoverished and drove out the drug warlords , whose warring and rapacity had ruined what was left of the country after the Soviet war . ”
Murray says that since the invasion , Afghanistan has progressed from simple opium production to actually manufacturing heroin .
Now , “ opium is converted into heroin on an industrial scale , not in kitchens but in factories .
Millions of gallons of the chemicals needed for this process are shipped into Afghanistan by tanker .
The tankers and bulk opium lorries on the way to the factories share the roads , improved by American aid , with Nato troops . ”
He goes on to say in the article : “ The four largest players in the heroin business are all senior members of the Afghan government .
This is the government that our soldiers are fighting and dying to protect ” .
Murray is vehemently anti-Taliban but he is willing to speak the truth , and his concern is that British soldiers are dying in an unjust war .
This is very relevant because recently there has been a new upsurge in fighting and the propaganda machine has been working in overdrive to provide fresh justifications for continued British involvement in Afghanistan .
Hamid Karzai is reported to have acted as a consultant for US oil company , UNOCAL , and is an ex-CIA operative .
Following the invasion , he was made president of Afghanistan .
George Bush was not a very subtle player .
Karzai ’s brother has been linked to the heroin trade .
The New York Times on October 4 2008 reported that an enormous cache of heroin was found under some concrete blocks .
Karzai ’s brother phoned the commander who had seized the heroin and instructed him to release the vehicle and the drugs .
Two years later a similar incident took place .
Once again his brother was involved .
In fact the article goes on to state that it is widely known that Karzai ’s brother is heavily involved in the international heroin trade .
It mentions that the White House ‘ favoured a hands off approach ’ toward Karzai ’s brother .
( This means they will not get involved ) .
The White House justified its position by alluding to “ the political delicacy of the matter ” .
Current Situation in Afghanistan
As the British death toll escalates , the propaganda machine has gone into overdrive to keep the British public on board .
According to the media , the Taliban are responsible for all of Afghanistan ’s problems including the opium / heroin production .
The Taliban are the enemies of the Afghan people and it has fallen to the valiant efforts of the allied forces to save them from them .
If you look carefully , however , the facts do surface from time to time .
On December 2 2006 , the Washington Post admitted that the Taliban were not to blame for the record levels of opium : “ … most experts believe it is largely an organized criminal enterprise .
According to a major report on the Afghan drug industry jointly released last week by the World Bank and the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime , key narcotics traffickers “ work closely with sponsors in top government and political positions . ” , , , ”
Barack Obama came into power with a lot of enthusiasm , even from sections of the Muslim world .
The first major step he took , after visiting London to tackle the economic crisis , was to gather European leaders together in Paris to initiate a new offensive against the Taliban .
As a direct result , two million people so far have been made homeless in the northwest frontier region .
Let ’s keep an eye on what he does , not what he says .
Omari Roberts , 23 , was widely praised after tackling Tyler Juett , 17 , and a 14 - year - old accomplice when he caught them breaking into his mother ’s home .
He chased the 14 - year - old off , then returned to the house to find Juett still there .
They scuffled and Juett suffered a six - inch stab wound that severed vital arteries .
Juett was rushed to hospital but later died from his injuries .
Websites which were set up in his memory were swamped with messages backing the right of householders to protect their property .
But yesterday Roberts appeared in court accused of murdering Juett and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm .
The burglary was at the home of foster carer Jacqueline McKenzie - Johnson in Old Basford , Nottingham in March .
Peter Eavis notes something quite astonishing today : " data - share - img= " " data - share = " twitter , facebook , linkedin , reddit , google , mail " data - share - count = " false " >
Peter Eavis notes something quite astonishing today :
The interest rate on [ Goldman ’s ] long - term borrowings was a minuscule 0.92 % in the third quarter , down from 3.53 % in the third quarter of 2008 .
This $ 203 billion of debt is Goldman ’s largest single funding source , so as its cost plunges , its bottom line benefits …
Goldman has been helped by its use of interest - rate derivatives .
When issuing long - term fixed - rate debt , Goldman has for years entered swaps that effectively convert nearly all of that debt to floating - rate .
Thus , as interest rates plummeted , so did one of Goldman ’s main expenses .
To put these numbers into perspective , a savings of 2.43 percentage points in one quarter amounts to $ 1.2 billion in saved interest costs on $ 203 billion .
That ’s over 40 % of its third - quarter earnings .
Even so , Goldman ’s hedging gains by converting fixed - rate into floating - rate debt pale in relation to $ 3.6 billion that Wells Fargo made on much the same trade , hedging its mortgage - servicing rights .
Clearly much if not most of the US banking sector made enormous profits in Q3 on interest - rate swaps — profits which are the very definition of unsustainable .
And there ’s another question , too : if the likes of Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs are making billions on these swaps , who ’s on the other side of the trade ?
Who lost billions of dollars by swapping floating into fixed ?
Call it the Summers trade , after Larry ’s disastrous foray into the rates market when he was at Harvard .
It did n’t work then , and it clearly is n’t working now , either .
There is something very traditional about the Irish economic crisis .
Â
If you consider the staples of 1980s economics , they were the ideas that nominal wages adjust very slowly downwards and that labour markets segment strongly into insiders who are able to hold onto jobs in recessions and outsiders who bear the burden of adjustment either through job loss or wage cuts .
Â
That ’s a fairly accurate description of Ireland over the last year .
It ’s informative to look at our latest Central Statistics Office report on earnings and employment in the private sector , especially the comparisons of the 2nd quarter 2008 ( arguably the last pre-crisis quarter ) with the same quarter in 2009 .
Â Â
On an annual basis , average hourly earnings across all industrial sectors were up 4 percent , though earnings in finance and insurance were down 12 percent .
Â Â
On a quarterly basis , hourly earnings had declined — meaning that Ireland still spent the first 3 quarters of the financial crisis generating increases in hourly wages for people with jobs .
Â
By the way , the Consumer Price Index for the year to October is down over 6 percent , with corresponding implications for the inflation - adjusted earnings .
And if you look at job grades ( as classified in Ireland ) who was able to maintain their paid hours ? —
In the industrial sector , average paid hours per week for managers , professionals and associated professionals rose very slightly from 38.2 to 38.3 hours in the year to Q2 2009 .
They fell by 2.2 % to 35.2 hours for clerical , sales and service employees and fell by 4.8 % , from 39.2 to 37.3 hours for production , transport , craft and manual workers .
Underling this is that employment fell by 2 percent for managerial grades , 8 percent for clerical , and 12 percent for production / manual workers .
Â
In other words , the closer your work was to white collar , the more likely it was that you kept both your job and your total earnings .
Â Â Just to confirm this , the percentage change in weekly earnings over the year for the three grades in industry ( i.e. the non-financial private sector ) are +0.6 % ( managers ) , - 0.5 % ( clerical ) , and - 1.5 % ( manual ) .
Â
And while earnings in finance got hammered , job losses in finance were quite moderate , which is more or less what you ’d expect when the big money left the sector but the government has stepped in to put a floor under how bad things can get .
And this is the private sector .
Â
What about the public sector ?
Â
Well , the government has suspended a pay increase that it foolishly negotiated at the height of the financial market collapse this time last year , but it ’s still sitting down with the public sector unions to agree a new plan in advance of the budget due in 3 weeks .
Â
The outlines of the potential agreement that have been leaked to the media make for fascinating reading for anyone wondering about the objectives of Irish public sector unions .
Â
Because the deal envisages job cuts , a recruitment freeze , and slashed overtime — in exchange for keeping the core pay scales as they are .
Â
In other words , if most of your pay comes from working a fairly steady workweek and you ’re well established in the system ( or collecting a pension from it ) , it ’s a good deal .
Â
If your hours are variable and / or you ’re one of the younger workers who could get squeezed out in a staff reduction or a recruitment freeze , it ’s more worrying .
Â
But that ’s the deal your union bosses are pushing for .
There may be an implicit assumption of the insiders that the people who lose out in this deal can ultimately emigrate .
Â
That was the Irish mode of adjustment of the past .
Â
Whether that ’s the basis of a political consensus over the next 12 months is another question entirely .
Â
Our Minister of Finance expresses wonderment that there have been no riots yet as a result of the cutbacks already made .
Â Â Perhaps that ’s because the distributional implications of the crisis have not been so obvious , hidden as they were in the preferred public sector vs private sector narrative that dominates the media .
Â Â
But the evidence points to a strong insider - outsider distinction in understanding how the Irish crisis has unfolded and why , 15 months in , there ’s still no consensus on how to get out of it .
Â
It does n’t seem to bother the people lending the government 20 billion euro a year .
Â
One wonders why .
UPDATE 30 NOVEMBER : Irish trade union researcher Manus O’Riordan takes a related look at the statistics .
In this article : Comelec Rules that Ang Ladlad poses ' risks ' to Pinoy youth
Ang Ladlad to appeal decision
Danton Remoto : Comelec 's ideas on homosexuals are ' obsolete
MANILA - The Commission on Elections ( Comelec ) on Wednesday rejected Ang Ladlad for party - list accreditation on the grounds that the party advocates " sexual immorality " and " immoral doctrines . "
Ang Ladlad is an organization of gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transgenders ( LGBT ) .
In a ruling dated November 11 , the Comelec said that although the party presented proper documents and evidence for their accreditation , their petition is " dismissable on moral grounds . "
Page 5 of the ruling states that Ang Ladlad 's definition of the LGBT sector as a marginalized sector who are disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation " makes it crystal clear that the petitioner tolerates immorality which offends religious beliefs . "
The document quotes passages from both the Bible and the Koran ( taken from internet site www.bible.org) that describe homosexuality as " unseemly " or " transgressive . "
The Comelec goes on to state that accrediting Ang Ladlad would pose risks for Filipino youth .
" Should this Commission grant the petition , we will be exposing our youth to an environment that does not conform to the teachings of our faith , " the ruling stated .
' Gays are threats to youth '
This statement is followed by a quote by preacher Lehman Strauss published in a website saying " older practicing homosexuals are a threat to the youth . "
The Comelec said it is " not condemning " the LGBT community but " cannot compromise the well - being of a great number of people . "
The document was signed by Commissioners Nicodemo Ferrer , Lucenito Tagle , and Elias Yusoph .
Ang Ladlad also applied for party - list accreditation in 2007 , but was denied this due to the lack of regional membership in the Philippines .
' Painfully obsolete ideas '
Danton Remoto , National Chairperson of " Ang Ladlad " that pushes for LGBT rights .
He also plans to run for Senator in 2010 .
Photo by Ralph Camus .
Danton Remoto , President of Ang Ladlad , told abs - cbnNEWS.com / Newsbreak in a phone interview that they will contest the Comelec ruling before the Supreme Court .
" This is a decision of painfully old men with painfully obsolete ideas on homosexuality .
We are in the 21st century already , we are fighting for human rights .
They do not know what they are talking about , " he said .
Remoto , who taught literature at the Jesuit - run Ateneo de Manila University for over 20 years , criticized the Comelec 's allegation that older homosexuals are threats to the youth .
" How would I have stayed in the country 's premier exclusive Catholic school ( Ateneo ) if I were a threat to the youth ? " he stated as an example .
He also took issue against the Comelec ruling 's frequent citation of internet - sourced reports , saying that a legal document should at least use primary sourcing .
Remoto said this spoke of " intellectual bankruptcy " among Comelec officials .
Remoto said that the Comelec ruling is offensive to the LGBT community and an insult to their human rights .
Comelec spokesman James Jimenez , however , said he does not consider the Comelec 's dismissal of Ang Ladlad 's petition for party - list accrediation as a human rights issue .
" They might bring it up because they might feel offended of being called immoral .
In that case , it 's their right to bring whatever action is deemed necessary , " he told abs - cbnNEWS.com / Newsbreak in a phone interview .
He added that the right to be voted for is not absolute and is subject to reasonable regulation .
Immoral institution ?
Remoto also questioned the Comelec 's decision to deny the party 's accreditation based on moral and religious reasons since the Constitution provides for separation between the Church and State .
" Since when did the Comelec become a moral arbiter ?
The Comelec is a state institution , [ it is ] not the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines , " he said .
" The Comelec has no right to make decisions on morality because it is not a moral or religious institution .
It is a political institution , and hence , should confine itself to politics , " Remoto added .
Jimenez said it is standard for the Comelec to consider what each party - list stands for before accrediting them .
He cited the case of the Samahang Magdalo , a reformist group led by detained mutineers , who were denied party - list accreditation on the grounds that they " advocated violence . "
The Ang Ladlad is requesting help from the Ateneo Human Rights Center in filing a motion for reconsideration before the Comelec , before raising the issue to the Supreme Court , where Remoto believes the party may have " some hope . "
All is not lost for Remoto and his crusade for LGBT rights , however , since he announced plans to run for Senator in 2010 " under a big political party . "
He will make a formal announcement in 2 weeks .
Should the Comelec approve his candidacy , he will be the first openly gay senatorial candidate in recent history .

I am happy to announce this round version number of Padre .
Does that mean we are half - way to the 1.0 release ?
Will people think that a 1.00 release can't be good so they need to wait for the 2.03 release to start using Padre ?
We 'll see if we need to play with version numbers to communicate something or if we can just steadily increase at every release .
There are a couple of new features in this release :
Thanks to Andrew Bramble ( aka. the submersible toaster ) the F1 button that used to show the Padre man page even if you asked for something else is now it fixed .
Ahmad M. Zawawi ( AZAWAWI ) fixed a couple of bugs and straightened the author / license of share / doc/ perlopref.pod missing
Sebastian Willing ( SEWI ) added basic FTP - remote - editing capability and
made the menubar configurable ( even though it still lacks a dialog for this )
Gabor Szabo ( SZABGAB ) ( aka myself ) added an initial version of a regex editor
and an initial version of " Find Method Declaration " which can be found in the Perl menu and when right clicking on a function name of method call .
Padre 0.50 is making its way to CPAN .
enjoy and distribute
We 're a few months away from the launch of God of War 3 , and everyone has played the first two games in preparation , right ?
For those interested in revisiting the PlayStation 2 classics , or for gamers who somehow missed them the first time around , Sony has released quite the package : God of War 1 and 2 together in one Blu-ray disc , complete with a graphical boost to take advantage of the power of the PlayStation 3 .
This has resulted in a somewhat uneven experience that proves a few things .
First , these games stand up against even the most modern of games , and second , it 's an odd experience when graphics are given a resolution boost ... and little else .
Title God of War Collection Developer SCE Studios Santa Monica Publisher Sony Computer Entertainment Price $ 39.99 Shop.Ars Platform PS3
The game now runs at 720 p , featuring fullscreen anti-aliasing , and the action moves at at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second .
Keep in mind that the graphics themselves have n't changed at all , they are simply clearer .
That 's not a huge complaint ; the God of War games have always looked great on the PlayStation 2 and , while some of the textures may look bland next to today 's games , the upgraded resolution means the game looks like a current - generation title .
God of War is known for its smooth , flowing style of combat , which makes the now - constant 60 frames - per - second animation much more than just a bullet point .
The game is more responsive than the originals .
There is no slow - down , the game never seems to tax the hardware , and combat simply feels better .
The games also feature support for trophies , giving you extra incentive to play through both titles again .
But how are the games now ?
Sony sent over an early copy of the game , sans packaging , allowing us to spend a good amount of time with both titles for the review .
I thought I was simply going to dabble with a level here and there , and maybe watch a video or two , before giving my thoughts on the graphics .
But I had forgotten just how fun these games are , even today .
You can select to begin either God of War 1 or 2 from the title screen , and each game features a wide selection of videos talking about the making of the games .
What 's impressive about these games , looking back , is how large - scale some of the set pieces are .
You 'll fight huge enemies , run across epic backdrops , see and do amazing things .
The combination of combo-laden battle with the quick - time events to finish off bosses feels just as satisfying as it always did .
There is a reason that the God of War games have become a genre onto themselves ; once you get the hang of stringing attacks together you 'll get addicted to trying to beat your high score for consecutive hits .
The ability to level up your weapons and attacks adds another layer of complexity to the games .
The enemies are devilish , the violence is extreme , there are sex minigames , and you play a character who is not a good man by any stretch of the imagination .
They were good games when they were released , and I had a wonderful time diving into both games again .
If you are new to the series , you are in for a treat ; this release can compete with any game on the market right now .
There are a few downsides
The main problem with this collection is that the cut - scenes that are prerendered are ... how do I put this nicely ... ugly as sin .
The in - game graphics are great , the scenes shown in the game 's engine look very nice , but the movies themselves are a huge step down from the graphical clarity of the rest of the experience .
It 's not a huge issue , but it can be distracting , and more than a little jarring .
If you already own both of these games , it may also be a hard sell to get you to pony up the money again simply for the facelift .
There is no new content to be found at all ; these are direct copies of the first release , redone in HD .
If your newer consoles have spoiled you , this may be worth the money .
If you still have your PS2 sitting around and do n't mind standard - definition graphics , you may just want to replay the games you already own .
Still , getting both games and having them look this good for $ 40 is a wonderful value .
If you have n't met the Ghost of Sparta yet , this is a no - brainer .
The smoother frame - rate improves the feel of the game , the updated graphics are easier on the eyes , and the price tag is just right .
This is a hell of a way to get fans excited for the upcoming God of War 3 .
Verdict : Buy
Note :
We contacted Sony for screenshots , and were told none were officially released .
While that 's a little ... odd , we were pointed towards this great Bitmob story with some amazing comparison shots of the PS2 and PS3 versions of the game .
If you want to check out the differences in more detail , that 's a good place to start .

I 've written two essays attempting to disprove " military Keynesianism " - the idea that military spending is the best stimulus .
See this and this .
In response , a reader challenged me to prove that anyone would advocate military spending or war as a fiscal stimulus .
In fact , the concept of military Keynesianism is so widespread that there are some half million web pages discussing the topic .
And many leading economists and political pundits sing its praises .
Bill Kristol agrees .
Noting that the military was " spending all kinds of money already , " Mr. Kristol wondered aloud , " If you 're buying 2,000 Humvees a month , why not buy 3,000 ?
If you 're refurbishing two military bases , why not refurbish five ? "
This is not the first time that defense spending has been endorsed as a way to jump - start the economy .
Nearly five decades ago , economic advisers to President Kennedy urged him to increase military spending as an economic stimulus ...
Similar arguments are heard today .
The members of Connecticut 's congressional delegation have been particularly outspoken in their support for the Virginia - class submarine , and they have n't been shy about pointing to the jobs that the program provides in their home state .
The Marine Corps ' V - 22 Osprey program wins support on similar grounds .
Despite serious concerns about crew safety and comfort , the V - 22 program employs workers in Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Delaware and Texas , and a number of other states .
Theories of Military Keynesianism and the Military - Industrial Complex became popular after the Second World War , and perhaps for a good reason .
The prospect of military demobilization , particularly in the United States , seemed alarming .
The U.S. elite remembered vividly how soaring military spending had pulled the world out of the Great Depression , and it feared that falling military budgets would reverse this process .
If that were to happen , the expectation was that business would tumble , unemployment would soar , and the legitimacy of free - market capitalism would again be called into question .
Seeking to avert this prospect , in 1950 the U.S. National Security Council drafted a top - secret document , NSC - 68 .
The document , which was declassified only in 1977 , explicitly called on the government to use higher military spending as a way of preventing such an outcome .
Previously administration officials had encountered stiff resistance from Congress to their pleas for a substantial buildup along the lines laid out in NSC - 68 , a landmark document of April 1950 .
The authors of this internal government report took a Manichaean view of America 's rivalry with the Soviet Union , espoused a permanent role for the United States as world policeman , and envisioned U.S. military expenditures amounting to perhaps 20 percent of GNP .
But congressional acceptance of the recommended measures seemed highly unlikely in the absence of a crisis .
In 1950 " the fear that [ the North Korean ] invasion was just the first step in a broad offensive by the Soviets proved highly useful when it came to persuading Congress to increase the defense budget . "
As Secretary of State Dean Acheson said afterwards , " Korea saved us . "
The buildup reached its peak in 1953 , when the stalemated belligerents in Korea agreed to a truce .
This is military Keynesianism � the determination to maintain a permanent war economy and to treat military output as an ordinary economic product , even though it makes no contribution to either production or consumption .
This ideology goes back to the first years of the cold war .
During the late 1940s , the US was haunted by economic anxieties .
The great depression of the 1930s had been overcome only by the war production boom of the second world war .
With peace and demobilisation , there was a pervasive fear that the depression would return .
During 1949 , alarmed by the Soviet Union 's detonation of an atomic bomb , the looming Communist victory in the Chinese civil war , a domestic recession , and the lowering of the Iron Curtain around the USSR 's European satellites , the US sought to draft basic strategy for the emerging cold war .
The result was the militaristic National Security Council Report 68 ( NSC - 68 ) drafted under the supervision of Paul Nitze , then head of the Policy Planning Staff in the State Department .
Dated 14 April 1950 and signed by President Harry S Truman on 30 September 1950 , it laid out the basic public economic policies that the US pursues to the present day .
In its conclusions , NSC - 68 asserted : " One of the most significant lessons of our World War II experience was that the American economy , when it operates at a level approaching full efficiency , can provide enormous resources for purposes other than civilian consumption while simultaneously providing a high standard of living " .
With this understanding , US strategists began to build up a massive munitions industry , both to counter the military might of the Soviet Union ( which they consistently overstated ) and also to maintain full employment , as well as ward off a possible return of the depression .
The result was that , under Pentagon leadership , entire new industries were created to manufacture large aircraft , nuclear - powered submarines , nuclear warheads , intercontinental ballistic missiles , and surveillance and communications satellites .
This led to what President Eisenhower warned against in his farewell address of 6 February 1961 : " The conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience " � the military - industrial complex .
By 1990 the value of the weapons , equipment and factories devoted to the Department of Defense was 83 % of the value of all plants and equipment in US manufacturing .
From 1947 to 1990 , the combined US military budgets amounted to $ 8.7 trillion .
Even though the Soviet Union no longer exists , US reliance on military Keynesianism has , if anything , ratcheted up , thanks to the massive vested interests that have become entrenched around the military establishment .
Militarism is the one great glamorous public - works project upon which a variety of elements in the community can be brought into agreement .
Inevitably , having surrendered to militarism as an economic device , we will do what other countries have done : we will keep alive the fears of our people of the aggressive ambitions of other countries and we will ourselves embark upon imperialistic enterprises of our own .

IN A profession notoriously resilient to hard times , online dating sites threaten to do what the global financial crisis could not - send the sex services industry broke .
The $ 1.2 billion industry has bled $ 74 million over the past financial year , with brothels taking the hardest hit .
In contrast , the market for exotic dancers and strippers , albeit starting from a small base , has steadily grown .
Sex is up there with tobacco and alcohol , according to the independent business information analyst IBISWorld .
Recessions and depressions appear to have little impact on abstinence .
But while prostitution has proven through the ages to have the stamina to withstand the vagaries of the economic climate , the digital age may prove to be the profession 's nemesis .
A senior analyst at IBISWorld , Edward Butler , who used industry surveys and Australian Bureau of Statistics data to crunch the numbers , said the 6 per cent contraction the sex industry experienced in the last financial year was most likely attributable to the surge in online dating sites which allow people to be frank about their penchant for casual sex .
A specific type of T helper cell awakens the immune system to the stealthy threat of cancer and triggers an attack of killer T cells custom - made to destroy the tumors , scientists from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center report in the early online edition of the journal Immunity .
The role of Th17 , one of only four known types of T helper cell , opens a possible avenue for overcoming cancer 's ability to suppress or hide from the body 's immune system , said senior author Chen Dong , Ph.D. , professor in M. D. Anderson 's Department of Immunology .
Dong and colleagues found that Th17 stifled development of metastatic melanoma tumors in the lungs of mice .
" While there is much work to be done , these preclinical findings imply the possibility of taking a patient 's Th17 cells , expanding them in the lab , and then re-infusing them as treatment , " Dong said .
Development of a vaccine to stimulate Th17 cells would be another possible application .
Dong earlier discovered the existence of Th17 cells and established that they secrete the inflammatory protein interleukin - 17 ( IL - 17 ) .
His lab showed that overexpression of IL - 17 contributes to both autoimmune and inflammatory diseases .
" Th17 cells also are found in a variety of solid tumors and we wanted to know whether these cells promote cancer or play a preventive or protective role , " Dong said .
Their research showed that mice made deficient in Th17 cells and then injected with a strain of melanoma that gathers in the lungs experienced aggressive cancer growth compared to mice with normal levels of Th17 .
At 16 days , tumors in the knockout mice had fused together and coated the lung so extensively that they were no longer countable .

Next , they tested Th17 for preventive effect , injecting Th17 cells primed with tumor - specific antigens and the melanoma cells at the same time .
At 16 days , mice with Th17 had low or barely detectable levels of cancer while control mice had a heavy tumor burden in their lungs .
A third set of experiments tested a treatment effect , showing that mice injected with Th17 after they already had melanoma in their lungs had a 75 percent reduction in tumor burden compared with normal mice .
In all experiments , mice with Th17 also had higher levels of several categories of immune system cell than did those with normal or suppressed Th17 .
T cells are lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell produced by the thymus equipped with receptors that recognize and bind to antigens , pieces of invading organisms presented to the T cells by dendritic cells .
The bound antigen converts the T cell to T helper cells that secrete signaling molecules called cytokines to launch an appropriate immune response .
Helper cells , in effect , guide the adaptive immune response .
In the Immunity paper , additional experiments outlined the specific pathway by which Th17 suppresses tumors :
Tumor invasion of the lung attracts Th17 cells that secrete IL - 17A .
IL - 17A in turn promotes the secretion of two chemokines , CCL2 and CCL20 , which recruit leukocytes to the tumor site .
The leukocytes include dendritic cells , which seize tumor antigens and migrate to the lymph nodes .
There , the antigens are used to prime CD8 + killer cells , which then migrate to the lung and kill established tumors .
The research was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health , M. D. Anderson 's Center for Targeted Therapy , a Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Scholar Award to Dong , and a Trust Fellowship of M. D. Anderson .
Co-authors with Dong and first author Natalia Martin - Orozco , Ph.D. , are Yeonseok Chung , Ph.D. , Xuexian O. Yang , Ph.D. , and Tomohide Yamazaki , all of the Department of Immunology ; Pawel Muranski , M.D. , and Nicholas Restifo , M.D. , both of the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health ; Sijie Lu , Ph.D. , of M. D. Anderson 's Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy ; and Patrick Hwu , M.D. , and William Overwijk , Ph.D. , both of M. D. Anderson 's Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology .

From travel guru Rick Steves :
When I came home after the most learning 12 days of travel I ’ve ever had in my life , I realized this is a proud nation of 70 million people .
They are loving parents , motivated by fear for their kids ’ future and the culture they want to raise their kids in .
I had people walk across the street to tell me they do n’t want their kids to be raised like Britney Spears .
They are afraid Western culture will take over their society and their kids will be sex toys , drug addicts and crass materialists .
I just feel we underestimate the spine of these people .
They will fight and die to defend their values .
And their values are not to destroy America and Israel .
Their values are to defend their way of life against Western encroachment .
They ’ve given up democracy because they know a theocracy will stand strong against encroaching Western values .
We think they ’re terrorists , but we have to remember that 96 percent of the planet is not American .
And most of them look at us like an empire .
When I write about us being an empire , it touches a nerve more than almost anything else I write .
I get so much angry feedback .
But I do n’t say we ’re an empire .
I say the world sees us as one .
I say there ’s never been an empire that did n’t have disgruntled people on its fringes looking for reasons to fight .
We think , “ Do n’t they have any decency ?
Why do n’t they just line up in formation so we can carpet bomb them ? ”
But they ’re smart enough to know that ’s a quick prescription to being silenced in a hurry .
Salon
As is typical on Salon.com , they try to make the rest of the article a hit piece on Republicans .
Democrats good , Republicans primitive ignorant fundamentalist terrorists .
I think Steves is mostly cool with that ideology , which is shame unto him .
What if trading democracy for theocracy brought more stability ?
What if the biggest enemy is n’t government , but a population out of control , drowning in their own desires and becoming more neurotic by the minute ?
Interestingly , we heard the same thing from al - Qaeda :
“ The Americans impose themselves on everyone who believes in his religion and his rights .
They accuse our children in Palestine of being terrorists .
Those children that have no weapons and have not even reached maturity .
At the same time they defend a country with its airplanes and tanks , and the state of the Jews , that has a policy to destroy the future of these children . ”
“ As we mentioned before , Allah ordered us in this religion to purify Muslim land of all non-believers , and especially the Arabian Peninsula where the Keâ€™ba is .
After WWII , the Americans became more aggressive and oppressive , especially in the Muslim world .
We are surprised this question is coming from Americans .
Each action will solicit a similar reaction .
We must use such punishment to keep your evil away from Muslims , Muslim children and women .
American history does not distinguish between civilians and military , and not even women and children .
They are the ones who used the bombs against Nagasaki .
Can these bombs distinguish between infants and military ?
America does not have a religion that will prevent it from destroying all people . ”
“ Wherever we look , we find the US as the leader of terrorism and crime in the world .
The US does not consider it a terrorist act to throw atomic bombs at nations thousands of miles away , when it would not be possible for those bombs to hit military troops only .
These bombs were rather thrown at entire nations , including women , children and elderly people and up to this day the traces of those bombs remain in Japan .
The US does not consider it terrorism when hundreds of thousands of our sons and brothers in Iraq died for lack of food or medicine .
So , there is no base for what the US says and this saying does not affect us , because we , by the grace of God , are dependent on Him , Praise and Glory be to Him , getting help from Him against the US .
As for the last part of your question , we are fulfilling a duty which God , Praise and Glory be to Him , decreed for us .
We look upon those heroes , those men who undertook to kill the American occupiers in Riyadh and Khobar ( Dhahran ) .
We describe those as heroes and describe them as men .
They have pulled down the disgrace and submissiveness off the forehead of their nation . ”
“ Everything is made possible to protect the blood of the American citizen while the bloodshed of Muslims is allowed in every place .
With this kind of behavior , the U.S. government is hurting itself , hurting Muslims and hurting the American people . ”
“ We were good friends .
We fought together in the same trench against the Russians until Allah sent them away in humiliating defeat .
You mentioned that he works for meâ€ ” we do not have anyone who works for someone else .
We all work for Allah and await his reward .
And regarding your mention of his attempt to assassinate President Clinton , it is not surprising .
I did not know about it , but it is not surprising .
As I said , every action solicits a similar reaction .
What does Clinton expect from those whom he killed and assaulted their children and mothers ?
This is not a surprising matter . ”
Al - Qaeda Appreciation Society of North America ( Aqasna )
The response is universal : the biggest player on the field is feared because he is powerful .
In the case of the West , he is also feared because he is decadent .
Do you want your daughter to grow up like Britney Spears , and to know thirty anonymous men in sexual congress before marrying an idiot ?
Do you want your children to drink alcohol and watch TV as a means of numbing their neurotic lives ?
Do you want your kids to have advertising instead of culture , marketing instead of history , and fear of offending others instead of morality ?
That ’s why people oppose the United States : because we have no native culture , we have become the raw force of the marketplace , destroying culture wherever we go and replacing it with Coca - Cola , Britney Spears ’ gaping vagina , and psychologists who tell us everything is OK but still cannot center our lives .

A police officer in a small US town used a stun gun on an unruly 10 - year - old girl after he said her mother gave him permission to do so .
Now the town 's mayor is calling for an investigation into whether the Taser use was appropriate .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Officer Dustin Bradshaw said in a report that police were called to the home in Ozark , Arkansas on 11 November because of a domestic disturbance .
When he arrived , the girl was curled up on the floor , screaming , the report said .
Mr Bradshaw 's report said the girl screamed , kicked and resisted any time her mother tried to get her in the shower before bed .
" Her mother told me to tase her if I needed to , " he wrote .
The child was " violently kicking and verbally combative " when Mr Bradshaw tried to take her into custody and she kicked him in the groin .
He delivered " a very brief drive stun to her back , " the report said .
The names of the girl and her mother were redacted in the report .
Mayor Vernon McDaniel said the girl was n't injured and is now at the Western Arkansas Youth Shelter in Cecil .
However , Mr McDaniel said he wants Arkansas State Police - and if they decline , the FBI - to investigate the incident .
State police have declined , and the FBI wo n't say whether it is involved .
" People here feel like that he made a mistake in using a Taser , and maybe he did , but we will not know until we get an impartial investigation , " he said .
Police Chief Jim Noggle said no disciplinary action was taken against Mr Bradshaw .
He said Tasers are a safe way to subdue people who are a danger to themselves or others .
" We did n't use the Taser to punish the child - just to bring the child under control so she would n't hurt herself or somebody else , " he said .

The police chief said his department has never had to Taser a child before .
But he said if the officer tried to forcefully put the girl in handcuffs , he could have accidentally broken her arm or leg .
Mr Noggle said the girl will face disorderly conduct charges as a juvenile in the incident .
The girl 's father , Anthony Medlock , told the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette that his daughter has emotional problems but that she did n't have a weapon and should n't have been Tasered .
" My daughter does not deserve to be tased and be treated like an animal , " said Mr Medlock , who is divorced from the girl 's mother and does not have custody .

Geek obsession : H. P. Lovecraft
Advertisement
Why it ’s daunting : “ We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity , ” H. P. Lovecraft wrote in 1926 , in his legendary short story “ The Call Of Cthulhu , ” “ and it was not meant that we should voyage far . ”
And yet he did voyage far :
Although he led an insular life primarily in his native Providence for most of his 46 years , his fiction traveled from the hellish ice of Antarctica to planets of his own devising , such as Yaddith and Yuggoth .
And beyond that physical plane is a roiling miasma of extradimensional gods and monsters — concepts mostly interchangeable to Lovecraft — which fueled the cosmological horror of his work .
No wonder he ’s borne an aura of impenetrability since his first professional publication in 1922 .
His reputation has grown as generations of horror writers from Stephen King to Neil Gaiman have heaped praise and reverence on him .
As with the sinister Cthulhu cults Lovecraft wrote about , there ’s a real - world cult of Lovecraft that ’s been dissecting , debating , and expanding on his legacy for decades .
Venturing into that realm for the first time can feel like dipping your toes into one of Lovecraft ’s infinite black seas .
Possible gateway : The Best Of H.P. Lovecraft : Bloodcurdling Tales Of Horror And The Macabre
Advertisement
Why : Besides the dizzying metaphysical depth of his fiction , another reason Lovecraft is so daunting is the multitude of editions and volumes collecting his work since the ’40s .
Del Rey began issuing cheap mass - market paperbacks of Lovecraft in the ’60s , but the horror boom of the ’ 80s led the publisher to produce a more comprehensive overview of his work .
The result is 1982 ’s Bloodcurdling Tales Of Horror And The Macabre , a trade - paperback selection of some of his best - known stories , such as “ The Call Of Cthulhu ” — an account of one man ’s discovery of the ancient , loathsome forces that sleep and seethe beneath the flimsy fabric of reality — and “ The Dunwich Horror , ” a repulsive tale of human - demon miscegenation .
The latter cites three of Lovecraft ’s most notable and recurring creations : the fictional Massachusetts town of Arkham , its mysterious Miskatonic University , and the apocryphal tome of hidden truths called the Necronomicon .
Topping the book off is an introduction by Psycho author Robert Bloch , a teenage protégé of Lovecraft , which puts his mentor ’s nightmarish work into biographical perspective .
Next steps :
Only a handful of Lovecraft ’s stories stray into novella - length territory , and the greatest of them is “ At The Mountains Of Madness . ”
Besides being the apotheosis of his Cthulhu Mythos , the story fuses and crystallizes just about everything that ’s stunning about Lovecraft : pseudo - archeology , rich prose , hideous deities , epic yet claustrophobic vistas , and the type of metaphysical terror traditionally wielded by priests and prophets .
( As a bonus : You ’ll never watch John Carpenter ’s The Thing the same way again . )
Praised by everyone from Joyce Carol Oates to Michael Chabon , “ At The Mountains Of Madness ” is a great place to dig deeper after experiencing the short , sharp shocks of Lovecraft ’s anthologized work .
The Modern Library Classics edition of the book from 2005 is the way to go :
In addition to the inclusion of Lovecraft ’s sprawling , essential essay , “ Supernatural Horror In Literature , ” in which he traces his heritage back to gothic fiction and Edgar Allan Poe , the edition boasts an introduction by fantasy author China Mievillé that looks at Lovecraft with a fresh , unflinching eye .
Alternately , the Science Fiction Book Club released a gorgeous 2001 hardcover anthology called Black Seas Of Infinity , edited by Lovecraft scholar Andrew Wheeler .
Wheeler does n’t just contribute an insightful , sweetly personal introduction , he includes the full text of At The Mountains Of Madness , plus two brief but fascinating appendices : Lovecraft ’s step - by - step account of his writing method — which , since the age of 6 , included documentation of his frequent and feverish dreams — and the autobiographical “ Some Notes On A Nonentity , ” a bittersweet , self - deprecating piece penned four years before his death .
Advertisement
Where not to start : Although Del Rey chased Bloodcurdling Tales with a series of excellent Lovecraft collections , the one volume that should n’t be read right away is the enticingly titled Tales Of The Cthulhu Mythos .
Only one of the book ’s stories is by Lovecraft — and it ’s “ The Call Of Cthulhu , ” which appears in Bloodcurdling Tales .
The rest are tales set in Lovecraft ’s universe written by other authors , from friends and contemporaries like Clark Ashton Smith and Conan creator Robert E. Howard on up to followers like Stephen King .
The quality of this glorified Lovecraft fanfic — reams and reams of which exist — is n’t bad in this specific case , but it is n’t at all necessary in understanding or appreciating Lovecraft ’s singular vision .
By the same token , avoid anything titled Necronomicon :
The nefarious grimoire existed only as a prop in Lovecraft ’s elaborate milieu , but acolytes and pranksters alike have published various books under that title over the years .
If there ’s a bona fide Lovecraft story that ’s better to leave until you ’re more acquainted with the man ’s peculiar worldview , it ’s “ The Horror At Red Hook . ”
While it sadly is n’t the lone example of Lovecraft ’s infamous , well - documented racism , it ’s easily his most offensive — although Lovecraft apologists will often contend that he was predominantly an equal - opportunity misanthropist .
Introduction
Comet is a technique to stream data , or “ push ” events to the web browser , instead of making the client poll the server every few seconds .
This lets the client receive near real - time updates .
If you want to read more about Comet , check out the article on Wikipedia , more specifically , the section about Ajax with long polling , as this is what our server will implement .
I chose web based chat because it is a great “ hello world ” for learning how Comet works , and I really enjoy programming chat related stuff ( see my very old implementation of GameRanger )
Chat Architecture
Before we get into any code , we have to talk about how the overall chat system works .
Here are a few specifications .
Erlang is going to handle all server - side tasks .
Mochiweb will be used to serve the browsers .
There will be only one ( global ) chat room .
When a user sends a message , all others in the room will see it .
Okay , that should do it for now .
That is the very basic outline of what the chat system needs to do .
Now let 's talk about the server .
Server Overview
The server will use Erlang 's OTP feature to make sure that all of our services remain running and are monitored .
We are going to have the following logical services managed by OTP :
chat_room
chat_postoffice
chat_web
The other modules are :
chat_mailbox - handles mailbox processing
chat_util - helper functions for the application
chat_sup - supervisor
chat_server - the chat_server application
chat_room
This module will be used to maintain the state of our chat room , and allow us to implement any " chat_room " logic , such as join / leave , sending messages , etc , .
chat_postoffice
This module is very important , it will hold all the mailboxes for each user in the chat room .
Whenever we want to notify a user of something , we will send a message to the " post office " .
The post office will then relay the message to an individual user 's mailbox .
After the message has arrived in a user 's mailbox , the mailbox may notify our web server , and the web server can notify the client 's web browser .
( I know , that 's a lot handle , but do n't worry , it will be explained ) .
chat_web
Finally , the chat_web module is what the web browsers will be talking to , this is the front - end of the chat system .
The web module will handle the basic tasks , such as joining the chat room , sending messages , and of course , receiving messages .
Implementing chat_mailbox
In Part 2 , we will implement the chat_mailbox module for our chat server .

Recording hundreds of thousands of individual uplinks from satellite transmitters fitted on penguins , albatrosses , sea lions , and other marine animals , the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) and BirdLife International have released the first - ever atlas of the Patagonian Sea -- a globally important but poorly understood South American marine ecosystem .
The atlas contains the most accurate maps ever assembled for this ecosystem revealing key migratory corridors that span from coastlines to deep - sea feeding areas off the continental shelf hundreds of miles away .
Data for the atlas was gathered by a team of 25 scientists working over a 10 - year period -- many of them supported by the National Research Council of Argentina ( CONICET ) .
The team tracked 16 species of marine animals , which produced some 280,000 individual uplinks of data over the Patagonian Sea , a huge area ranging from southern Brazil to southern Chile .
Called Atlas of the Patagonian Sea : Species and Spaces , the 300 - page book was edited by Valeria Falabella and Claudio Campagna of the Wildlife Conservation Society , and John Croxall of Birdlife International .
The atlas , which is in English and Spanish , will be used to help inform potential policy decisions in the region such as managing fisheries and charting transportation routes of oil tankers .
This vast region , which spans 3 million square kilometers ( 1.1 million square miles ) , is becoming increasingly threatened by burgeoning development and overfishing .
" This unprecedented atlas was essentially written by the wildlife that live in the Patagonian Sea , " said Dr. Claudio Campagna who runs the Wildlife Conservation Society 's " Sea and Sky " initiative .
" The atlas helps fill in many gaps of knowledge and should serve as a blueprint for future conservation efforts in this region . "
" This is an exceptional collaborative achievement ; now that we know where some of the region 's most important marine areas are , they need to receive appropriate protection and management , " said John Croxall , Chair of BirdLife 's Global Seabird Programme .
The atlas underscores the need to establish a new network of marine protected areas that would include open - sea environments that are linked to key coastal areas .
Many of the species tracked travel vast distances between coastal breeding grounds and feeding areas .
For example , satellite data revealed that southern elephant seals travel more than 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 miles ) during an average season at sea , and an additional 10,000 kilometers in repeated vertical dives for food .
" The Patagonian Sea is a remarkable intersection of global physics , marine biodiversity , and climate and economic change , " said Dr. Steven E. Sanderson , President and CEO of the Wildlife Conservation Society .
" The Atlas of the Patagonian Sea will advance conservation of this region and can serve as a roadmap for the creation and management of future marine protected areas -- of which there are precious few worldwide . "
The list of species tracked for the atlas includes five species of albatross , three species of petrel , four varieties of penguin , two fur seal species , the South American sea lion , and the southern elephant seal .
The completion of the Atlas of the Patagonian Sea is due in large part to the generosity and long - standing support of the Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation for the WCS " Sea and Sky " initiative .
Additionally , WCS 's conservation work in this region has been supported by the Mitsubishi Foundation for the Americas and Mr. and Mrs. James M. Large , Jr .

Comic books have not had a long and proud history being adapted into movies .
But it 's rare that they are actually adapted by the original creators , of see them making a significant impact on the finished work .
Exceptions like Sin City and Persepolis , while not setting the box office on fire , have a consistency , voice and appeal denied to the likes of , say , Spider - Man .
I received a copy of a draft of the Y The Last Man screenplay written by Brian K. Vaughan .
It 's undated , but is draft version 1.2 , which is four years old and seems to be the version he was working on around this time .
Since this point , the screenplay has been worked on by Carl Ellsworth and director DJ Caruso and the finished product , if we ever see it , with or without Shia La Beouf , will be different .
So whatever version hits the screen , it wo n't be this one .
For a start Caruso has talked about a trilogy and this is most definitely a done - in - one .
But it might give us a few signposts .
Y The Last Man is a long , rolling , sprawled out comic book , taking in much of the world , all sorts of tones and themes , exploring history , philosophy , human nature , love , desire , necessity and science as a world deals with losing all of its men in a brief period .
That is , of course , aside from Yorick .
And his monkey .
Brian K Vaughan wrote that when finishing Y he stayed with the same ending that his younger self had planned when he stated Y .
But they were clearly two different people .
When Brian started Y he was a relatively low - profile writer with an unsuccessful run on Swamp Thing under his belt that Heidi MacDonald , editor at Vertigo Comics , had taken a bit of a chance on .
When he finished , he was one of the biggest name writer in comics , was picked as one of the main writers on Lost , and in demand by many .
He was a different person and Y was a different book .
He 'd also become a better writer .
A longform periodical comic like Y , Cerebus and Sandman has to be , by its nature , patchwork as the writer changes his / her mind through its publication .
The screenplay can fix this and make things tighter , better , and more thoroughly designed - or it can just find some cool bits and then invent a new thread to join the dots .
This script definitely does the former .
So this movie is not so much an adaption of the comic book , it 's certainly not anywhere near as faithful as Watchmen tried to be and failed .
Instead it 's Ultimate Y The Last Man , taking all the things Brian had learned while writing the comic and applying them to its very beginning .
It 's more focused .
Characters who grow and develop , who we first met as the comic progressed are there right at the beginning , following their own parallel lives that we only get to understand in the comic in flashback or exposition .
Basically there 's a whole whole lot of Lost - style foreshadowing that 's been re-engineered into the start , giving a multi- layered narrative .
Which is handy , because I understand that it was this draft of the screenplay that got Brian his gig on Lost .
And it 's removed the comic book necessity to get an understandable chunk into that first 22 pages .
The screenplay starts with the big death scene , on a much grander scale and in so much more detail than the comic , and then goes into a lot of Previously On Y The Last Man set up scenes with all sorts of characters that might have taken up the first one or two trade paperbacks .
So some bits are contracted , some bits and extended , and while a whole lot of plot and characters are lost , themes , characters and points are never betrayed or abandoned .
We stay in one country rather than going on an international cruise .
The Washington scenes , so extended in the comic are now a brief skip through .
There are slightly less lesbians .
Because this focuses much more on the journey .
The ending is restructured in parts and the one element I really enjoyed in the comic but thought I was missing during the script , and was all ready to moan about , hits me between the eyes right at the very end .
You did that on purpose , did n't you Brian ?
Not so much an easter egg but an easter egg on my face .
It 's an accurate , clever , funny and intriguing adaptation of the comic into the film medium .
As a movie it should delight , entertain and provoke as much as the original .
It 's shorter , concentrated , and more punchy - but I was suprised how much I did n't mind that it was n't the comic .
Oh and you 're going to love who the President is .
I do so hope they keep that .
Look what we have here :

SUBTITLE H-SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAL MALPRACTICE
Current Law
No provision
Chairman's Mark
The Chairman 's Mark would express the Sense of the Senate that health care reform presents an opportunity to address issues related to medical malpractice and medical liability insurance .
The
Mark would further express the Sense of the Senate that states should be encouraged to develop and test alternatives to the current civil litigation system as a way of improving patient safety , reducing medical errors , encouraging the efficient resolution of disputes , increasing the availability of prompt and fair resolution of disputes , and improving access to liability insurance , while preserving an individual 's right to seek redress in court .
The Mark would express the Sense of the Senate that Congress should consider establishing a state demonstration program to evaluate alternatives to the current civil litigation system .
The video above tells the story of Merlyna Adams -- a school principal from Louisiana who sought treatment for a kidney stone .
After a month of botched treatment , her body developed sepsis , a complication caused by infection .
She suffered congestive heart failure , renal failure and pulmonary failure .
The restricted blood flow to her hands and feet required her to have both legs amputated below the knee and she lost both hands .
She is unable to engage in everyday tasks like brushing her teeth , taking a bath , eating or using the restroom without another person .
Every year , the lives of 98,000 Americans are utterly devastated by medical malpractice .
98,000 Reasons has more info and more of these heartbreaking stories .
There 's also a page to take action and tell the Senate not to gut patient 's rights .
I 'm bringing this up because the Senate is quietly considering gutting the rights of patients harmed by medical malpractice to sue .
It 's called " tort reform " and it's been one of the longest running right - wing scams going .
Teabaggers seem to think it was written into the Bill of Rights and then hidden by Communists .
Dozens of states have enacted " tort reform " with disastrous results .
Now it 's a very real possibility that it will be snuck into the health care bill .
We 've seen with Stupak - Pitts the way absolutely awful crap can suddenly insert itself into a huge bill like this .
This little noticed note ( PDF ) from a several hundred page " Sense of the Senate " document indicates that " tort reform " is a very real threat to attach itself to health care reform like a tick :
This is a sop to the Blue Dogs who are ever vigilant for ways to claim to be doing deficit reduction while actually throwing millions and millions to the insurance companies .
The CBO has stated that " tort reform " does almost nothing to reduce costs , all it does is screw anyone who is the victim of a bad doctor .
Please send a message to your Senator today and tell them this is NOT the kind of reform we need .

MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) -- A Spanish judge Tuesday ordered an Argentine pilot to be kept in prison in Madrid , Spain , until a decision is made about whether he should be extradited to his home country on charges that he participated in " death flights . "
The lawyer for Julio Alberto Poch talks to reporters outside the court in Madrid .
Former Argentine Navy Lt. Julio Alberto
Poch is one of two pilots arrested recently for allegedly piloting " death flights " in which more than 1,000 prisoners were thrown alive out of planes during Argentina 's " dirty war " in the 1970s and ' 80s , officials said .
Judge Eloy Velasco , at the National Court , ruled that Poch , who was arrested in Valencia , Spain , last month on an Argentine warrant , would not be granted provisional liberty , despite his defense lawyer 's request , said the court spokesman , who by custom is not identified .
Poch appeared Tuesday in a closed - door hearing that lasted about an hour in the judge 's chambers at the high - security court , which handles cases of terrorism , the spokesman said .
The decision on extradition could take several months , the spokesman said .
Poch faces long - standing charges for human rights abuses during the 1976 - 83 right - wing dictatorship .
In Argentina , police arrested former Navy Capt .
Emir Sisul
Hess last week in the town of Bariloche , near the border with Chile .
An initial hearing for Sisul Hess was held Friday , federal court official Cecilia Brizzio told CNN .
Poch and Sisul Hess are accused of piloting aircraft from which drugged and blindfolded prisoners were hurled to their deaths in the Atlantic Ocean or the Rio Plata .
The prisoners included students , labor leaders , intellectuals and leftists who had run afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views .
Most were dragged off the street or otherwise summarily arrested and held without trial in secret prisons where many were tortured .
Sisul Hess , accused in more than 900 deaths , has denied the allegations , Argentina 's government - run Telam news agency said .
According to Telam , both men were arrested after they told colleagues or friends about their alleged involvement .
As many as 30,000 people disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the dictatorship .
Argentine human rights activist Hebe de Bonafini , who lost two sons and a daughter - in - law in the " dirty war , " said Monday she found no joy in the arrests .
" You can never take back the horror , " she said .
" In no way am I happy . "
Bonafini is president of the Association of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , a group of mothers whose children disappeared during the war .
She urged the government to continue looking for war crime suspects .
Speaking of the pilots , she said , " There are several .
They are not the only ones . "
Poch , a commercial pilot for the Dutch airline Transavia.com , was arrested September 23 when his flight made a stopover in Valencia , Telam said .
He was wanted on an international arrest warrant .
Poch had been a navy pilot from 1976 until late 1980 , Telam said .
Upon leaving the navy , he moved to Holland and had been living there since .
Argentine federal Judge Sergio Gabriel Torres is pursuing the extradition of Poch and handling the arrest of Sisul Hess .
Torres traveled to Holland to question Poch 's colleagues and others , Telam said .
An aviator told Torres that Poch had said at a restaurant in Indonesia in December 2003 that there were occasions in which people were thrown out of helicopters and airplanes because the armed forces were dealing with " terrorists , " Telam said .
The aviator , identified as Tim Eisso Weert , told the judge that Poch said it was a humane way to execute people because they were drugged , the government news agency reported .
A co-pilot told the judge that Poch had said they " should have killed all " the subversives , Telam reported , and that he admitted " some responsibility " because " when you fly persons on board the responsibility lies with the pilot . "
Sisul
Hess is similarly said to have implicated himself , telling friends that the prisoners " did not suffer because they were drugged , falling like little ants , " Telam said .
Sisul Hess served as a helicopter pilot in 1976 - 77 and retired as a captain in 1991 , the news agency said .
He was arrested September 29 and transferred to Buenos Aires , Argentina 's capital .
Judge Torres was not available Monday to take three phone calls from CNN , aides said .
Nor were any documents on the cases available , the aides said .
CNN 's Arthur Brice and Al Goodman contributed to this report

Two maritime provinces declined to distribute a book to students saying it was racist and promotes stereotypes of First Nations people .
British Columbia schools are giving the same book for free to students in Grade One .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners Hurrah !
Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
The Canadian Children 's Book Centre and the TD Bank Financial Group announced on Nov. 13 they are providing more than 500,000 copies of Let's Go! The Story of Getting from There to Here to school kids in Canada .
Within a week the provincial governments in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia said no thanks .
New Brunswick refused to distribute the book , written by former ChickaDEE magazine editor Lizann Flatt and illustrated by Scot Ritchie , after curriculum consultants and an Alberta university professor advised against it , the St. John Telegraph - Journal reported .
" The representations of aboriginal people are stereotypes -- everyone looks the same -- and they are all depicted in the past , with feathers on their heads , " the paper quoted the province 's Department of Education saying .
" The aboriginal peoples are represented in passive roles , waiting for ' progress ' to come and ' better ' them . "
A ministry official was also quoted saying Europe is depicted as " heavenly " with a castle and a sunburst behind it while the First Nations people look generic .
Stereotypes to be avoided : NDP's Simpson
Let 's Go! tells the story of transportation , beginning with people who walked : " With soft footfalls they followed food , hunted herds , wandering through the wilderness . "
On page six the Europeans arrived .
" One day , blown on strong ocean winds from the lands of the kings and the queens , sailing ships slid swiftly to shore , " the book says .
" The men who explored found riches in fishes , riches in furs , and riches in timber from trees . "
The Greater Victoria School District 's administrator for Aboriginal Education , Nella Nelson , said she had not seen the book but would look into it .
The description of " generic " First Nations people was concerning , she said .
" That would get my reaction to begin with .
Not all people in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia wear feathers . "
Thumbing through a copy of the book , the B.C. New Democratic Party 's critic for Aboriginal relations and reconciliation , Bob Simpson , said it reminds him of the debate over removing the murals in the legislative buildings that depicted First Nations people in a way many found offensive .
" That 's my first gut reaction to this , " he said .
" You have that fixing of a stereotype . "
The First Nations people are portrayed as technologically behind the Europeans , then they disappear from the story .
If the book 's going to be distributed through public schools , the government should be careful of what messages it is sending , he said .
Deciding on books not up to province : minister
It is up to each school district whether or not they want to distribute the book , said Moira Stilwell , who on top of her job as advanced education minister is acting as education minister while Margaret MacDiarmid is recovering from being sick .
" I 'm not familiar with the book , " Stilwell said .
" I have n't read it .
The bottom line is school districts are responsible for resourcing what goes into the schools in their districts including books , so really it 's their decision . "
Any further questions should be put to the TD Bank , she said .
Asked why provincial governments in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick would have a say in what books are distributed to students she declined to answer .
A media contact for TD and the Children 's Book Centre did not answer questions by publishing time .
Nor did author Flatt respond to an email message .
' There 's got to be a process ' : Simpson
It 's unbelievable that the B.C. Education Ministry would have no say on the distribution of the book , said the NDP 's Simpson .
" In order to get access to the public school system a decision had to be made in the Ministry of Education , " he said .
One can imagine a situation where a white supremacist group might want to distribute a book with their own subtle take on " progress " to students , he said .
" That 's up to the individual school boards to decide that ?
I do n't think so .
There 's got to be a process where those decisions are made . "
Distributing the book is inconsistent with what the government has said about the need to build better relationships with First Nations in the province , he said .
" This government has touted the New Relationship and part of the New Relationship is the refining not only of our relationship with First Nations but our historic relationship with First Nations , " he said .
In recent months the proposed Rights and Reconciliation Act fell apart , two First Nations have pulled out of the treaty process and First Nation leaders have blasted the HST , he said .
The relationship is a sensitive issue for the government right now , he said .
" In that context you do n't need any more pokes in the eye . "

The X - Men Guide To Unlocking Your Financial Mutant Powers
Tweet
The year was 1992 and the local Pizza Hut had just unveiled a new arcade game .
Not knowing what we were in for , my brother and I begged our parents for a couple bucks and wandered over the the small game room while we waited for some deep dish .
As we turned the corner , we were confronted with the screen featured above …
“ Wow … look … this one has room for up to 6 - players ! ”
We exclaimed as we slid a handful of quarters in and the rest , they say , was history .
I ’m not sure I can credit this machine for my years of video game addiction ( I ’m fairly sure that award belongs to Golden Axe a year or two before ) , but I actually squirm at the thought of adding up how much of our parent ’s money was inserted into this contraption .
It would be a scary number .
I ’m not the biggest comic book nerd , but when it comes to video games , I take no prisoners .
I thought it would be fun to break down the X - men featured in the game ( as well as the villains ) and relate them each to personal finance topics based on their given powers .
And I was right …
I had a blast taking this trip down memory lane .
In all seriousness , it got me brainstorming about my own strengths and weakness in our journey to get out of debt … or what I now refer to as my very own Financial X - Men Mutant Power !
Enjoy .
The X - Men… a .k.a.
The Good Guys
Professor Xavier : Financial Independence
Real Name : Charles Xavier
Charles Xavier Mutant Power :
The world ’s most powerful telepath .
In the game / series : Professor X is n’t actually a playable character in the game .
Instead he leads the X - men team through the game and gives the orders .
He ’s a master of telepathy , who can enter people ’s mind for both good and ill intentions if needed .
Financial explanation : Professor X represents our own personal journey to financial independence .
You ca n’t play Xavier in the game , just as you ca n’t simply wake - up and achieve financial independence .
Instead you have to build various skills , assemble a diverse team , and ‘ give the orders ’ to eventually lead to your own vision of success .
Wolverine : Passionate Debt Reduction
Real Name : James “ Logan ” Howlett
James “ Logan ” Howlett Mutant Power : Regeneration , Adamantium Skeleton & Claws
In the game / series : Wolverine ’s abilities in game are n’t necessarily authentic to the comic series .
For example , his special power is sort of a augmented , laser - based swipe ( kind of weird ) .
And his regeneration / durability abilities are n’t reflected more than any other character .
In the series , Wolverine is shown as brash , aggressive , passionate , and ultimately very effective in nearly all missions .
Financial explanation : Wolverine is the “ Dave Ramsey ” of the X - Men world .
While he may have made mistakes in the past ( as many of us with large debts have ) , he ’s focused , determined , and some may even say ornery .
Regardless of what you think of him , it ’s tough to argue against his effectiveness .
His intensity is most valuable when stepping up to turn around a situation or to eliminate a large amount of debt .
With this financial comparison , it should n’t surprise you that Wolverine was my favorite character to play .
Colossus : A Healthy , Dependable Income
Real Name : Piotr Rasputin
Piotr Rasputin Mutant Power : Super strength and quasi - invulnerability in special “ organic metal form . ”
In the game / series : Like Wolverine , Colossus ’ in game powers are n’t super authentic .
His durability is n’t taken into account and his mutant power is an energy force field of sorts ( again , a little weird ) .
In the series , though , he is known for his consistent and sturdy support .
His ability to transform into the ‘ organic metal ’ form means that he can withstand many attacks others can’t and his super strength often comes in handy .
Financial explanation : Colossus is most similar to a strong and healthy income .
While a consistent income is not an absolute must ( nor is it a guarantee of success ) , there ’s little doubt that it goes a long way in helping us withstand various external influences in our financial life .
Of course , the larger the income the more leverage ( or ‘ strength ’ ) we have to accomplish our financial goals .
Storm : Entrepreneurial Spirit
Real Name : Ororo Iqadi T’Challa - Wakandas
Ororo Iqadi T’Challa - Wakandas Mutant Power : Weather manipulation
In the game / series : Storm ’s mutant power allows her considerable influence over the weather .
In the game , she uses lightning attacks and is able to summon a hurricane as her special .
Storm has a diverse skill set and can utilize everything from gusts of wind to rain , and blizzards to thunderstorms .
She can adapt quickly to many situations ( although favors outside obviously ) and has shown above average leadership throughout the comic series .
Financial explanation : Storm ’s diverse skill set and ability to control many different moving parts best reflects an entrepreneurial mindset .
While not everyone needs to run out and start a business , even long - time employees can increase there value with knowledge of basic entrepreneurial principles .
Many of us can benefit from devoting some spare effort to a part - time business , both monetarily and otherwise .
Nightcrawler : Financial Agility
Real Name : Kurt Wagner
Kurt Wagner Mutant Power : Teleportation
In the game / series : Nightcrawler was almost always the most in - demand character in the arcade game .
He was just so fun to play and his special was awesome ( a flurry of teleportation all around the screen ) .
In the series , Nightcrawler tends to focus on stealth objectives using his night - vision , wall climbing skills , and ability to blend into shadows .
Financial explanation : Nightcrawler embodies what I like to call “ financial agility . ”
This is reflected in the growing trend to have a flexible income , minimalist possessions , and no deep ties to any specific location .
Nightcrawler would almost certainly be a fan of a simple financial approach that allowed him to opt - out of much of the ‘ normal ’ hustle and bustle ( and allow for travel , of course ) .
As a side note , I often wonder whether Chris Guillebeau yells , “ BAMF ! ” as he boards public trains in random less - traveled European countries .
Cyclops : Leadership & Balance
Real Name : Scott Summers
Scott Summers Mutant Power : Shoots beam of energy from eyes
In the game / series : Cyclops is a long - time member and the most consistent leader of the X - men team .
His mutant power in the game is a straight - forward but powerful beam of ‘ concussive force ’ ( fairly consistent with series ) .
Cyclops is one of the most emotionally balanced and well - rounded characters in the series .
Financial explanation : Cyclops best reflects the power of having a well - rounded approach , especially in regards to a work / life or business / life balance .
While it at times may be slightly less effective than , let ’s say , Wolverine ’s approach ( that conflict is shown throughout the series ) , Cyclops consistent leadership role is irreplaceable .
This principles - based approach can be of similar value in our financial lives , grounding our emotions and helping us to avoid burnout .
Dazzler : Frugality
Real Name : Alison Blaire
Alison Blaire Mutant Power : Transforms sound into light energy
In the game / series : Let ’s be honest … nobody wanted to play Dazzler .
It ’s not that she was any worse than the other characters , she just was less fun ( and popular ) .
Like Storm , the beauty of her approach is in her resourcefulness .
She ’s able to transform sound into light energy , including laser beams , flashbangs , and holograms .
Financial explanation : Dazzler resourcefulness represent the power of frugality and the do - it - yourself mentality .
She ’s embodied the skills of being able to bargain hunt , make common products at home , and the ability to repair before looking to replace .
Frugality is n’t about being cheap or wasting time … it ’s about eliminating waste , increasing quality , saving money , and having a little fun .
Remember Warren Buffett , whose time is arguably more valuable than any other person in the world , is well - known for his frugality .
The Bosses … a .k.a.
The Bad Guys
Like most games , there are many bosses that stand in your way as you progress along your journey .
The same is true of our journey into financial freedom .
The bosses are all related to common financial hurdles that block us along the way .
Pyro : A Basic Income
Real Name : St. John Allerdyce
St. John Allerdyce Mutant Power : Manipulate fire
In the game / series : Pyro is the first boss in the game and can easily be referred to as the weakest .
While his fire attacks can appear strong , with a little effort the can be avoided most of the time .
Financial explanation : Pyro represents a simple , basic income .
Honestly , that ’s the first financial hurdle we all have to overcome .
We do n’t need a 6 - figure income out of the gates ( although that would be nice ) , but few of us will last long without at least a minor income stream in the beginning .
Once that is covered we can start to get more creative !
The Blob : Student Loan Debt
Real Name : Fred Dukes
Fred Dukes Mutant Power : Super - strength , Durability
In the game / series : “ Nothing moves The Blob ! ” – The Blob is the first of a string of bosses that have super - strength and strong physical attacks .
In the series , it ’s said that his mass is so large that his skin is immune to all but the strongest attacks including bullets .
Financial explanation : Unfortunately , student loans are the first sizeable debt most of us encounter in our journey .
And , ironically , the can often feel just like a huge ‘ blob ’ hanging over our heads .
While they may appear daunting at first , just like The Blob they can be taken down with consistent and repetitive force .
Wendigo : Car Loans & Leases
Real Name : Has affected many different people .
Has affected many different people .
Mutant Power : Super - strength , Durability
In the game / series : Wendigo is actually a curse that can transform normal men into a mythical beast .
In the game , Wendigo is the second in a chain of bosses who have super - strength .
Throughout the series , Wendigo also possesses increased speed , durability , regenerations , and extra - sharp claws and teeth .
Financial explanation :
While owning an automobile is generally not a negative thing , just like in the series , it can be ‘ cursed ’ by an attached loan or lease agreement .
Financing a depreciating asset is almost always a bad idea and car leases are renowned for the ability to come back a bite us in the butt .
Nimrod : Hasty Home Ownership
Real Name : N / A
N/ A Mutant Power : Super - strength , Leader of Sentinels
In the game / series : Throughout the game you encounter many Sentinels as the basic enemies .
Nimrod is considered the most powerful ( and versatile ) of all Sentinels , as well as being a leader of sorts .
In addition to the common super - strength , in the series , he possesses both teleportation and shapeshifting abilities .
Financial explanation :
Home ownership is almost always the largest financial commitment any of us will make in our lives .
All too often , the various expenses and responsibility ( financial and otherwise ) are not all taken into account , especially during the first purchase .
The general Sentinel army represents the miscellaneous expenses , repairs , burdens , and stress of home ownership .
Nimrod , himself , embodies a hefty mortgage , which if not controlled properly can quickly destroy our financial goals .
The White Queen : Negative Influences
Real Name : Emma Frost
Emma Frost Mutant Power : Telepathy
In the game / series : While The White Queen is one of the easier bosses and the game , in real life the story is n’t always the same .
Like Professor X , the White Queen is a telepath although certainly less powerful .
She is most well - known for her manipulation techniques , especially those involving seduction .
Financial explanation : The White Queen is a combination of all the external negative influences that bombard us .
These may be tangible influences , such as family and friends , or intangible emotions , such as fear of success or guilt about money .
Working through these issues is a normal part of the path to financial freedom .
The key is to keep them from dominating our thoughts on a regular basis .
Juggernaut : Credit Card Debt
Real Name : Cain Marko
Cain Marko Mutant Power : Super - strength , Unstoppable while in motion
In the game / series :
It ’s widely known that the Juggernaut is not actually a mutant , but instead derives his power from a gem worn in his helmet .
His strength is second to none and it ’s said that he does n’t require food , water , or sleep to stay active .
Once he gets moving , he ’s impossible to stop , often plowing through anything in his way .
In the game , he is even equipped with a Bazooka !
Financial explanation :
This was the easiest of all !
Juggernaut represents credit card debt , of course .
High interest credit card debt is on of the most dangerous financial pitfalls , especially once it ’s able to gain momentum .
The actual credit cards are the proverbial helmet , which is the source of the high interest debt ’s power .
Often times , the fastest way to defeat this beast is to ‘ remove the helmet ’ by cutting up and canceling the credit cards themselves .
Even the Bazooka can be directly related to the shady techniques employed by credit card companies !
Mystique : Lifestyle Inflation
Real Name : Raven Darkholme
Raven Darkholme Mutant Power : Shapeshifting
In the game / series : Mystique is one of the most popular X - men villains .
She can replicate the physical appearance of anyone whom she comes into contact with , including their voice .
She uses this ability and her cunning nature to take advantage of and infiltrate all sorts of situations for her own gain .
In the game , she impersonates both Professor X and Magneto at different times and is the second to last boss before the real Magneto .
Financial explanation : Mystiques ’ ability to shapeshift reflects the role lifestyle inflation can play in our financial lives .
Often times , we simply tread water .
As our income grows , we allow our responsibilities and expenses to mimic the increase .
This is the reason why so many lottery winners , professional athletes , and celebrities still end up with severe financial problems several years down the road .
Magneto : Financial Stress
Real Name : Max “ Magnus ” Eisenhardt
Max “ Magnus ” Eisenhardt Mutant Power : Magnetism manipulation
In the game / series : Magneto is the final boss and as is customary , the most difficult to defeat .
His attacks are quick and powerful and his Magnetic Shield defends him from counter attacks ( and even hurts too ) .
Throughout the series , he ’s the most common enemy the X - men routinely face .
He has complete mastery of anything metallic .
Financial explanation :
The last and most powerful obstacle we have to overcome on our path to financial independence is eliminating the stress from our finances .
Ultimately , stress is behind all of our financial woes .
Stress from too much money … stress from too little money .
Stress from the burden of debt or stress from fighting with your spouse over spending .
Stress of too many possessions or not enough food to eat .
For me , financial independence is n’t being debt - free or having 10 million dollars in a bank account .
It ’s simply finding out how to use sound financial principles to eliminate as much stress from our finances as possible , so we can concentrate on the more important things in life .
Thus , stress is the last ‘ boss ’ we have to defeat .
What ’s your financial X - Men mutant power ?
While mapping out these correlations was a lot of fun , it does bring up a great issue .
We all have strengths and weaknesses when it comes to our finances .
Even Cyclops ’ well - rounded approach will eventually need the help of the others along the way .
When I first started focusing on my finances , I was in full - on Wolverine mode .
Lately , I ’ve slid more into a freakish combination of Storm and Nightcrawler ( describing it that way makes me smile ) .
I ’ve never benefited from Colossus ’ power ( a healthy income ) and I could also learn a little more from Cyclops from time to time .
What ability most resembles your own strengths ?
There are literally hundreds of X - men , so I ’ve only cracked the tip of the iceberg here .
If you are an uber comic nerd go ahead and get creative . 😉
Whew … this took longer than I thought !
Aside from his Nine Stories , J.D. Salinger published twenty - two stories in various magazines which remain uncollected .
Several attempts have been made to compile these stories together but have met stiff resistance by the author .
Spanning his literary career between the years 1940 - 1965 , these stories display changes in both the author 's style and message .
While some are plainly of commercial quality , most are serious works containing an expansive gift of enlightenment and self - examination : that very - satisfying " Salinger moment " .
Provided here is a list of those stories , sorted by publication date and accompanied by a short synopsis of each .
" The Young Folks "
Story XVI ( March / April 1940 ) , pp.26-36 .
" The Young Folks " , was Salinger 's first published story .
It was published in Whit Burnett 's Story magazine .
Burnett was the teacher of short story writing at Columbia where Salinger took his course .
Salinger himself was twenty one at the time of its publication .
The story satirizes the selfish concerns of a pair of young adults at a party and the festering shallowness of their lives .
" Go See Eddie " Kansas City Review VII ( December 1940 ) , pp.121-124 .
" Go See Eddie " is a tense story about a brother and sister .
The brother tries to force his sister to go see Eddie about a job .
In the process , he reveals his knowledge of her affair with a married man .
" Go See Eddie " was initially submitted to Story magazine and then Esquire before being accepted by the Review .
Forgotten for decades , this story was uncovered in 1963 by Salinger biographer Warren French .
Reprinted in Massachusetts : Fiction : Form & Experience , 1969 .
" The Hang of It "
Collier 's CVIII ( July 12 , 1941 ) , pp.22 ,
A commercial tale of a soldier who just can't seem to get " The Hang of It " .
The positive ending to the story was fitting for the countries upcoming involvement in World War II and popular with the magazines of the time .
Reprinted in Chicago , Consolidated Book Publishers Inc. , The Kit book for Soldiers , Sailors , & Marines , 1942 & 1943 .
" The Heart of a Broken Story "
Esquire XVI ( September 1941 ) , pp.32 , 131-133 .
" The Heart of a Broken Story " is Salinger 's satirical story about the products of the slick magazines in the 30's and 40's .
Salinger pokes fun at the formulaic boy meets girl stories that appear with regularity in the magazines .
A very funny story , it also has a serious filp - side .
The only story to be narrated by Salinger himself , it nonetheless shows his unwillingness to control his characters .
" The Long Debut of Lois Taggett "
Story XXI , ( September / October 1942 ) , pp.28 - 34 ,
" The Long Debut of Lois Taggett " is the tale of a debutante and her long process of coming out .
Throughout this pessimistic story , Lois struggles to deal with the harshness of reality and maintain her own humanity .
Before she can let go of pretense , she must first deal with a psychotic husband , a loveless second marriage , and her child 's crib death .
When , in 1963 , Story magazine requested permission to reprint this story , Salinger declined .
Reprinted in New York , Dutton , Story : The Fiction of The Forties , 1949 , pages 153-162 .
" Personal Notes of an Infantryman "
Collier 's CX ( December 12 , 1942 ) , pp.96 .
" Personal Notes of an Infantryman " is a War story about an older man trying to get in the military , and then overseas to combat with a surprise ending .
Readers of " The Hang of It " will have a strong sense of deja vu at this story 's end .
" The Varioni Brothers "
Saturday Evening Post CCXVI ( July 17 , 1943 ) , pp.12-13,76-77 .
" The Varioni Brothers " is a short story dealing with two brothers , one a sensitive artist who 's attempts at writing the great American novel are thwarted by the manipulations of his brother who forces him to write music instead of his book .
Ultimately , the good brother is destroyed due to his brothers actions .
Salinger had hoped that this story would be made into a movie , but it did not happen .
Salinger was scornful of this story and hid the fact that it was analogous of the duality of his own nature .
However , he ressurrected portions of this story in later works - primarily through the characters of Seymour and Buddy Glass .
g6t2 ,
" Both Parties Concerned "
Saturday Evening Post , CCXVI ( February 26 , 1944 ) , pp.14,47-48 .
" Both Parties Concerned " is a story of a young couple and their baby .
The story chronicles their struggles to mature from adolescence and the conflicts they encounter .
This was an experimental work for Salinger , who used it to explore different character - types and vernacular .
Readers will doubtlessly sense the presence of Holden Caulfield in its main character .
It is possible that the character of Ruthie is based upon a Bainbridge , Georgia " peach " with whom Salinger had a romance .
It was originally titled " Wake Me When It Thunders . "
" Soft Boiled Sergeant "
Saturday Evening Post , CCXVI , ( April 15 , 1944 ) pp.18,32,82-85 .
Written before he had actually seen combat , " Soft - Boiled Sergeant " chronicles a young soldier 's entry in the military and his contact with a good natured Staff Sergeant he could never forget .
Despite its military setting and condemnation of phoniness , this is primarily a story about love written at a difficult stage in Salinger 's personal life .
It was originally titled " Death of a Dogface . "
" Last Day of the Last Furlough "
Saturday Evening Post CCXVII ( July 15 , 1944 ) , pp.26-27 , 61-62 , 64 .
" Last Day of the Last Furlough " covers the last days of furlough for Babe Gladwaller before he is shipped off to the war .
Salinger claimed indifference toward this story but it remains an important work ( ushering in " something new in [ his ] work " ) , and among his most intensely personal .
He uses his own Army SSN number as Babe 's , perhaps in reference to his own departure for the war .
Babe spends most of the time with his little sister , Mattie , until his fellow soldier Vincent Caufield comes over to spend the evening with them before departing in the morning .
In this story , Vincent announces his brother Holden has been reported Missing in Action .
Babe and Mattie 's relationship mirrors the future relationship between Holden and Phoebe .
Babe 's monologue to his sister is poignant and reminiscent of Holden 's desire to catch innocence .
" Once a Week Wo n't Kill You "
Story XXV ( November / December 1944 ) , pp.23 -27 .
" Once a Week Wo n't Kill You " is another of Salinger 's stories dealing with the departure of a soldier for combat in Europe , and the soldiers request that his wife spend more time with his Aunt when he is gone .
Oddly , this story was written when Salinger was already in England .
" A Boy in France "
Saturday Evening Post CCXVII ( March 31,1945 ) , pp.21,92 .
" A Boy in France " is one of the few stories in which Salinger deals with combat in the war .
The setting is at the front , a soldier in his foxhole , trying to maintain his sanity by reading , and rereading a note sent from his sister .
Again , Babe is a forunner of Holden and his relationship with his little sister Pheobe in Catcher in the Rye .
This is a stark and symbolic tale with an inspiring ending .
Like a number of Salinger 's early stories , stylistically , " A Boy in France " is only a notch away from being pure poetry .
Reprinted in Post Stories 1942 - 45 , 1946 ; Saturday Evening Post July - August , 2010 .
" Elaine "
Story XXV ( March / April 1945 ) , pp.38 - 47 .
" Elaine " is a story of a beautiful but slow girl incapable of dealing with the real world and the people that that would take advantage of her .
As the story progresses we become increasingly protective of Elaine .
The story 's ending convinces us of the wisdom and kindness of allowing different realities to different circumstances .
But it also hints at the irretrivability of beauty once it has been crushed .
" This Sandwich Has No Mayonnaise "
Esquire XXIV ( October 1945 ) , pp.54-56 , 147-149 ,
" This Sandwich Has No Mayonnaise " is the hauntingly poetic account of an anguished Vincent Caufield , Holden 's older brother , who narrates this story as a sergeant waiting in the back of a troop truck of men preparing to go to a dance in town .
Vincent 's mind is totally caught up in thoughts about Holden though , who he has been told is Missing in Action .
This story leaves Vincent in the throes of desperation and an unwillingness to accept .
It is filled with peace - time reminiscences of the Caulfield family .
Narrated in the first person , this is Salinger 's first story told as stream - of - consciousness .
Reprinted in New York , G. P. Putnam 's Sons , The Armchair Esquire , 1958 & 1960 , pp. 187-197 .
" The Stranger "
Collier 's CXVI ( December 1 , 1945 ) , pp.18,77 .
Babe Gladwaller and his little sister Mattie reappear in " The Stranger " .
Babe feels it his responsibility to seek out Vincent Caulfield 's former girlfriend ( the king - hording Helen Beebers from " The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls " ) and tell her that Vincent has been killed in action .
Afterwards , Babe has an epiphany through Mattie that changes his perception ( much as Holden will have through Phoebe and Teddy will have watching his own sister drink milk ) and renews him .
As all three of the Caulfield brothers are dead at the time of this story , this is chronologically the last of the Caulfield stories .
It is likely that Salinger refers to this story in a July 1945 letter to Ernest Hemingway .
" I'm Crazy "
Collier 's CXVI , ( December 22 , 1945 ) , pp.36,48,51 .
" I'm Crazy " is an early version of Holden 's departure from prep school that later shows up in The Catcher in the Rye .
With minor alteration , much of this story is familiar to readers as the chapter where Holden visits Mr. Spencer .
What sets this story apart from the Catcher version is the presence of an additional Caulfield sister and the clarity of Holden 's resignation and compromise at the end .
" Slight Rebellion off Madison "
New Yorker , 22 ( December 1946 ) , pp.76-79 , or 82-86 ,
" Slight Rebellion off Madison " is an early version of a scene in The Catcher in the Rye .
The story follows Holden when he is home from Pency and goes to the movies , then skating with Sally Hayes .
Followed by his drunken calls to her apartment late at night .
An early story , it is the first of Salinger 's Caulfied works to be accepted for publication .
Although written in 1941 , the New Yorker witheld its publication until after the war .
It has a strong Fitzgerald feel .
Reprinted in New York , Random House , Wonderful Town : NY Stories from the New Yorker , David Remnick .
2000 .
" A Young Girl in 1941 with No Waist at All "
Mademoiselle 25 ( May 1947 ) , pp.222-223,292-302 .
" A Young Girl in 1941 with No Waist at All " is set on a cruise ships final voyage to Havana just prior to its conversion to use in WWII as a transport .
The story involves a crew member falling in love with a engaged girl and their relationship on board .
Salinger himself served as this ship 's entertainment director in 1941 and is plainly the basis for Ray Kinsella , the story 's main character .
" The Inverted Forest "
Cosmopolitan ( December 1947 ) , pp.73-109 ,
" The Inverted Forest " is another one of Salinger 's stories dealing with a great poet who is corrupted and prevented from his artistic calling by the negative influence of other people .
This story examines the relationship of poetry to art , art to spirituality , and spirituality to revelation .
One of Salinger 's longer magazine pieces , it was understood by few readers and notably unpopular .
Reprinted in Cosmopolitan Diamond Jubilee Iss , March , 1961 , 111-32 .
" A Girl I Knew "
Good Housekeeping 126 ( February 1948 ) , pp.37,186-196 .
" A Girl I Knew " is set in pre-WWII Austria and deals with an American in Vienna who falls in love with a Jewish girl just as the Nazis come to power .
On his return to Vienna as a American soldier after the war , he seeks out the girl only to find she has been killed in a concentration camp .
Despite its very funny begining , this story examines the human ability to commit and acquiesce to atrocities , and convicts all people for that capability .
Although the extent of the love relationship remains unknown , the basic events of this story actually happened to Salinger .
After the war , Salinger had a powerful desire to reunite with the girl depicted in this story , going as far as to ask Counter Intelligence for a transfer to Vienna .
Originally titled " Wien , Wien " .
Reprinted in Best American Short Stories of 1949 , 1949 , pp 248-260 .
" Blue Melody " or " Needle on a Scratchy Phonograph Record "
Cosmopolitan , CXXV ( September , 1948 ) , pp.50-51,112-119 .
" Blue Melody " , originally titled " Needle on a Scratchy Phonograph Record " is a story of Jazz and segregation .
It follows a promising Jazz singer as her career climbs , only to have it end when her appendicitis bursts and no hospital will treat her .
This story is Salinger 's tribute to Blues great Bessie Smith and contains an appearance by the Varioni Brothers

A blog called Big Government has this post up – AMA Endorses Largest Denier of Health Care Claims – as smoking gun proof that Medicare is a heartless government institution because a report card ( pdf ) by the AMA on health insurance providers shows Medicare rejects a larger percentage of claims then the nation ’s largest corporate insurers ( 6.85 % , with private insurer Aetna a close second at 6.8 % ) .
The report only shows that Medicare – with by far the largest number of claims – rejects some .
The same report also notes Medicare with Payment Timeliness – 99.99 % and Accuracy of payments – 98.53 % .
Only one private insurance company scored higher on accuracy .
In a less then ideal chart of why claims are denied , the report says Medicare rejects claims frequently for wrong billing codes , being billed for non-covered services .
Out of a total of 675 remark codes ( reasons payment was not made on a claim or part of a claim ) Medicare used the highest at 95 .
That would suggest that many providers are not using proper billing codes for Medicare claims – which ties into this story from a recent post – Less than half of medical students understand health care system .
I ’ve read the AMA report card several times for any proof or indication that Medicare ’s motives could be unequivocally attributed to spite , maliciousness or indifference and the report simply does not supply that information .
That information being completely absent from the report card , Big Government and quite a few anti-health care reform comrades , have filled in that gap by assigning their own biases .
Some other possible reasons for the number of denials could be that the bulk of Medicare recipients are a high risk group – those 65 or older .
That group also gets the highest number of high cost medical procedures and surgeries .
The more complex the claim the more likelihood of having questions about billing .
One myth this report card dispels , probably to the disappointment of yellow faux journalists at B.G. , is the idea that government agencies are careless fountains of wealth who cut checks without careful adherence to the rules and regulations regarding disbursement of funds .
In addition private insurance companies do two things Medicare cannot do .
One , private insurers can get a mix of high , low and moderate risks policy holders .
Statistically speaking all of Medicare recipients are high risks .
The more visits to the doctor , the more claims .
Second , private insurers can simply cancel a policy because they do not want to pay a claim .
An event that would not be counted in the claims denial column .
There is a third possibility .
The AMA has recently been tilting toward supporting President Obama and Democrats plans for health care reform , but the AMA has a history of knee jerk opposition to any health - care reform .
So it is possible their methodology and their calculations are way off , especially considering a report by the California Nurses Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee
Claims denial rates by leading California insurers , first six months of 2009 : • PacifiCare — 39.6 percent
• Cigna — 32.7 percent
• HealthNet — 30 percent
• Kaiser Permanente — 28.3 percent
• Blue Cross — 27.9 percent
• Aetna — 6.4 percent
A few of those companies are not on the AMA report .
Aetna ’s stays about the same .
Cigna ’s percent of denials goes up about 29 % on the California Nurses Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee report .
HealthNet goes up about 26 % .

Vaccine for cocaine habit ?
May be coming soon
A simple shot could be the latest tool in curbing cocaine abusers ’ habits , says new research .
The vaccine - like shot not only kept them from getting high but also helped them fight their addiction , showed the first successful rigorous study of this approach to treating illicit drug use .
The shots did n’t work perfectly , but the researchers say their limited success is promising enough to suggest the intriguing vaccine approach could be widely used to treat addiction within several years .
“ It is such an important study .
It clearly demonstrates … that it is possible to generate vaccine that could interfere with cocaine actions in the brain , ” said Dr. Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funded the study .
The results come just days after that government agency announced plans for the first late - stage study of an experimental nicotine vaccine designed to help people quit smoking .
The NicVAX vaccine has been fast - tracked by the Food and Drug Administration , and the research will be paid for with federal stimulus money .
The cocaine and nicotine vaccines both use the same approach , stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that attach to molecules of the drugs and block them from reaching the brain .
Soon we ’ll have to think up some new ways to generate the angst ridden journeys of self - discovery in novels , songs and movies .
Memory enhancing drugs are bound to have some dark graphic novel inspiring drawbacks .
Then there is the monotony of possibly living three or four hundred years .
I know some people with shopping addictions and / or addictions to accumulating stuff .
Hopefully some wonder drug is in the works for them too .

Mark Pittman , the Loeb Award - winning Bloomberg journalist , a personal friend , a legendary financial reporter and the first person to sue the Fed ( in conjunction with Bloomberg News ) and win , passed away on Wednesday .
He was 52 .
Our thoughts are with his family .
Bloomberg 's brief on Mark 's legacy .
Nov. 27 ( Bloomberg ) -- Mark Pittman , the award - winning investigative reporter whose fight to open the Federal Reserve to more scrutiny led Bloomberg News to sue the central bank and win , died Nov. 25 in Yonkers , New York .
He was 52 .
Pittman suffered from heart - related illnesses .
The precise cause of his death was n’t known , said his friend William Karesh , vice president of the Global Health Program at the Bronx , New York - based Wildlife Conservation Society .
Pittman , a former police - beat reporter who joined Bloomberg News in 1997 , wrote stories in 2007 predicting the collapse of the banking system .
That year , he won the Gerald Loeb Award from the UCLA Anderson School of Management , the highest accolade in financial journalism , for “ Wall Street ’s Faustian Bargain , ” a series of articles on the breakdown of the U.S. mortgage industry .
Pittman ’s fight to make the Fed more accountable resulted in an Aug. 24 victory in Manhattan Federal Court affirming the public ’s right to know about the central bank ’s more than $ 2 trillion in loans to financial firms .
Pittman drew the attention of filmmakers Andrew and Leslie Cockburn , who gave him a prominent role in their documentary about subprime mortgages , “ American Casino , ” which was shown at New York City ’s Tribeca Film Festival in May .
“ Who sues the Fed ?
One reporter on the planet , ” said Emma Moody , a Wall Street Journal editor who worked with Pittman at Bloomberg .
“ The more complex the issue , the more he wanted to dig into it .
Years ago , he forced us to learn what a credit- default swap was .
He dragged us kicking and screaming . ”
Police Reporter , Ranch Hand
James Mark Pittman was born Oct. 25 , 1957 , in Kansas City , Kansas , where he played linebacker on the high school football team .
He took engineering classes at the University of Kansas in Lawrence before graduating with a degree in journalism in 1981 .
He was married soon after and had a daughter , Maggie , in 1983 .
The marriage ended in divorce .
Pittman ’s first reporting job , covering the police department for the Coffeyville Journal in southern Kansas , paid so little he took a part - time job as a ranch hand across the Oklahoma border in Lenapah , according to an interview he gave to Ryan Chittum for the Columbia Journalism Review ’s The Audit , a watchdog for the business press .
“ What a funny guy -- huge personality , ” Chittum said in an e-mail message .
“ Mark was my favorite reporter working .
In a time when too much journalism is timid or co-opted , Mark personified the whole ‘ afflict the comfortable ’ tenet of the business .
Mark ’s passing is a huge loss for journalism at a time when we can least afford it . ”
No Small Moves
Pittman spent a year in Rochester , New York , with the Democrat & Chronicle newspaper and 12 years at the Times Herald - Record in Middletown , New York , where he met his second wife , Laura Fahrenthold - Pittman in 1995 .
“ All I know is we fell in love the moment we met , ” Fahrenthold - Pittman said in an interview Friday .
“ We moved in together a week later .
He was as serious about his family life as he was about work .
Mark did nothing in a small way . ”
Pittman joined Bloomberg News in 1997 .
In 2007 , he was writing about the securitization of home loans when subprime borrowers , who have bad or limited credit histories , began missing payments on their mortgages at a faster pace .
Pittman ’s June 29 , 2007 , article , headlined “ S&P , Moody ’s Hide Rising Risk on $ 200 Billion of Mortgage Bonds , ” was excoriated at the time by Portfolio.com for “ trying to play ‘ gotcha ’ with the ratings agencies . ”
“ And that really is n’t helpful , ” said the unsigned posting .
[ TD : the posting is not unsigned , it was authored by " Yves Smith " and Felix Salmon ]
Beating the Pack
Pittman ’s story proved prescient .
So did his reports on U.S. banks exporting toxic mortgages overseas , on Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson ’s role in creating those troubled assets while he was chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and on the U.S. bailout of American International Group Inc .
“ He ’s been on this crisis since before the crisis , ” said Gretchen Morgenson , the Pulitzer Prize - winning financial columnist for the New York Times .
“ He was the best at burrowing into the most complex securities Wall Street could come up with and explaining the implications of them to readers of all levels of sophistication .
His investigative work during the crisis set the standard for other reporters everywhere .
He was a giant . ”
In the “ Faustian Bargain ” series , Pittman explained how 5 percent of U.S. mortgage borrowers missing monthly payments could lead to a freeze in lending throughout the world .
‘ Fearless , Most Trusted ’
“ Mark Pittman proved to be the most fearless , most trusted reporter on the most important beat during the 12 years he wrote about credit markets , corporate finance and the Federal Reserve at Bloomberg News , ” said Bloomberg Editor - in - Chief Matthew Winkler .
“ His colleagues will miss his laughter and generous sense of mission .
Bloomberg readers were rewarded by his many achievements culminating with a federal court ruling validating his search for records of taxpayer - financed policies withheld from the public and the Gerald Loeb Award . ”
Public policy would be more effective if reporters , lawmakers and citizens understood how the financial system worked and why the crisis happened , Pittman said in the Feb. 27 , 2009 , interview with Chittum .
“ Hopefully , we will be able to inform the people enough to know how badly we ’re getting screwed , ” he said with a laugh .
“ We need to know how to prevent it from happening again , and we need to know who did it . ”
Standing 6 feet 4 inches with a booming laugh , a loud telephone voice , and a taste for bourbon , Pittman made lifelong friends on Wall Street , in Congress , in journalism circles and in the artistic community after he and his wife opened an art gallery in Yonkers in 2005 .
‘ A Great Loss ’
“ I always learned something new when I spoke with Mark , ” said Representative Scott Garrett , a New Jersey Republican on the House Financial Services Committee .
“ He was dogged in pursuit of the truth .
This is a great loss for journalism and for those who relied on Mark for his insight . ”
In “ American Casino , ” the title of which comes from an expression Pittman uses in the documentary , the filmmakers profile subprime borrowers who are losing their homes , mortgage brokers who made loans they knew their customers could never repay and bankers and ratings analysts whose companies profited from the housing boom .
Pittman provides an anchor for the narrative , at one point searching the Bloomberg terminal and finding the mortgage of a Baltimore teacher going through foreclosure inside a security underwritten by Goldman Sachs .
Celebrating Life
“ He was a wonderful friend , a seeker of truth , a fighter for right , a proud family man , a big and jovial hand , a lover of food , drink and celebration of life , ” said Joshua Rosner , managing director of Graham Fisher & Co. , a consulting and analysis firm in New York .
“ This is a personal loss , a professional loss and a societal loss .
He is truly irreplaceable . ”
Along with his wife and daughter Maggie , Pittman is survived by daughters Nell , 10 , and Susannah , 8 , from his second marriage ; his father Warren Pittman ; mother Donna Pittman - Nealey ; and brothers Barry Pittman and Craig Pittman .
“ He was so large -- in spirit and in person -- and his passion for his craft was so great , it is impossible to think that it could just end , ” said Jeffrey Taylor , Pittman ’s editor on the “ Faustian Bargain ” series .
Bloomberg ’s lawsuit against the Fed , which was filed after Pittman ’s requests under the U.S. Freedom of Information
Act were denied , continues without him .
The central bank won a delay pending an appeal , which is scheduled for the week of Jan .
4 .
“ He was one of the great financial journalists of our time , ” said Joseph Stiglitz , a Nobel Prize - winning economist and Columbia University professor .
“ His death is shocking . ”
At the time of his death , Pittman ’s outgoing messages offered a link to a black - and - white photo of Woody Guthrie .
Written on Guthrie ’s guitar : “ This machine kills fascists . ”
Since several people have emailed me inquiring about my next online screenwriting course , here ’s some information .
I ’ll be teaching a 1 - week online class through UCLA Extension ’s Writers ’ Program from 2/3–2/10/2010 .
The course is called “ Screenplay Universe : The External and Internal Worlds . ”
Here is a description of the course :
This course looks at a screenplay ’s universe , how it is comprised of the External World ( Plotline ) as conveyed through action and dialogue and the Internal World ( Themeline ) as conveyed through intention and subtext .
Every moment in a script is an interplay between these two realms and we will study excerpts from the movie American Beauty to see how the pros do it .
The course consists of daily lectures , daily Q&A on the discussion boards , and one 90 - minute live - chat ‘ office hour ’ session .
There are no writing assignments .
I ’ve taught the course before and it ’s gotten great reviews from students .
The course number is V4621 .

The amazing man who drives car with thought - powered arms after losing limbs in accident
Handy : Christian Kandlbauer shows off the mind - controlled arms he drives with
A former mechanic who lost his arms in an industrial accident four years ago is able to drive again thanks to thought - powered artificial limbs .
Christian Kandlbauer , who lost his arms after being electrocuted by 20,000 volts , retook his driving test and passed .
Using the nerves that previously controlled the healthy limbs , the 22 - year - old Austrian merely has to think what he wants his arms to do and the command is obeyed .
The thought from his brain creates a particular electrical impulse in the nerve endings at the site of amputation .
Those impulses are picked up by electrical connections to the artificial arm , which respond to the specific impulse and so causing the arm to move as he wants .
Mr Kandlbauer , who became the first recipient in the world of such ‘ intelligent ’ artificial limbs two years ago , now drives to work in a modified disabled car after passing his test last week .
‘ The driving is really important to me , ’ he said .
‘ But now I can also drink a glass of beer without needing a straw .
Now that ’s impressive !’
He will be in the German capital Berlin on Friday to further showcase his abilities with his arms after they were fitted in 2007 .
Before being fitted , the apprentice , who lost his arms in September 2005 , underwent a complex operation in which nerves are relocated .
The Otto Bock health care company invented in the prosthetics in conjunction with medical scientists in Vienna .
‘ After this selected nerve transfer surgery , the signals that were once responsible for controlling the arm are used for controlling the new prosthesis , ’ said the makers of his arms .
‘ Electrodes installed in the socket of the prosthesis respond to these control signals .
When the user sends movement signals , a complex electronic analysis inside the prosthesis converts the signals and recognises the movements the user would like to make . ’
He now works as a warehouse clerk at the company where he was employed as a mechanic before his accident .
If you love Android and Android loves you , perhaps you can consummate your relationship with an early Valentine ’s Day gift by purchasing the Xperia X10 on February 10th .
That ’s right folks – in their UK Sony Ericsson Store has an announcement that the Xperia x10 should be available on February 10th and you can pre-register for information about the device as well .
But that ’s not all : we ’ve also recently been blessed with a couple promotional videos and samples of pictures and videos taken with the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 .
First let us get the official angle with some X10 promotional vids :
And how about a video and a couple pictures taken with the Xperia X10 by none other than the Official SE Blog itself :
The picture quality seems nothing short of fantastic … but I would take that at face value .
There is n’t any way the SE Blogger would have posted crappy pictures and you never know , maybe it took awhile to get pictures these good to come out .
But no matter what , the phone at least has the capability of taking pretty awesome photos .
Also remember the video ( which is pretty good too ) and pictures were taken with an X10 running on preliminary software and beta hardware so the results might be better on an actual production unit .
And if they ’re WORSE on a production unit , someone has a big problem with quality control .
I ’d like to remind you folks of something – the February 10th date was only a TARGET date and it was for the UK .
There is not telling when it will come out elsewhere and furthermore , you ca n’t be positive it will come out in February in the UK either .
Sony Ericsson has a history of being a bit late on their Xperia products and when you consider its also the first Sony Ericsson Android Phone … well , I just do n’t want you to get your hopes up .
But all these official , inside looks are making us excited indeed .
Here is the information from that pre-registration page :
Secret codes enbedded into pages printed by some colour laser printers pose a risk to personal privacy , according to the Electronic Frontier Fundation .
The US privacy group warns the approach - ostensibly only designed to identify counterfeiters - has become a tool for government surveillance , unchecked by laws to prevent abuse .
" In the current political climate , it 's not hard to imagine the government using the ability to determine who may have printed what document for purposes other than identifying counterfeiters , " the EFF said .
The ACLU recently issued a report revealing that the FBI has amassed more than 1,100 pages of documents on the organization since 2001 , as well as documents concerning other non-violent groups , including Greenpeace and United for Peace and Justice .
EFF notes that only the privacy policy of your printer manufacturers - rather than any legislative controls - stop the Secret Service from using printer codes to secretly trace the origin of non-currency documents .
" No law regulates what sort of documents the Secret Service or any other domestic or foreign government agency is permitted to request for identification , not to mention how such a forensics tool could be developed and implemented in printers in the first place .
With no laws on the books , there 's nothing to stop the privacy violations this technology enables , " the EFF warns .
All this sounds like the stuff of black helicopter conspiracy theory but the EFF wants to flesh out its preliminary research by gathering information about what printers are revealing and how .
It 's asking consumers to get involved by sending in test sheets from colour laser printers .
In addition to documenting what printers are revealing , the EFF is filing a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request over the issue .
These research efforts are a necessary precursor to any legal challenge from the EFF and ammunition for possible lobbying on legislation to protect consumer privacy . ®
