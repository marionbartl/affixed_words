Vietnam has ordered six of the Russian Kilo class submarines
Vietnam has signed billion - dollar contracts to buy submarines and fighter jets from Russia , Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has announced in Moscow .
The deals make Vietnam one of the key clients of the Russian arms industry .
The weapons purchases come at a time when disputes over sovereignty are increasing in the South China Sea , which Vietnam calls the East Sea .
Vietnam , China and other countries have competing claims over potentially oil and gas - rich island chains there .
" Vietnam signed contracts for the purchases of submarines and planes from the Russian side , " the Vietnamese prime minister said , without elaborating .
Russian agency Interfax quoted unnamed sources as saying that Hanoi was to buy six diesel - electric Kilo - class submarines worth $ 2bn ( Â£ 1.2bn ) .
Vietnam is already awaiting the delivery of eight Sukhoi Su-30MK2 fighter jets from Russia in 2010 .
It is considering ordering 12 more , Interfax quoted another Russian source as saying .
A regional defence analyst said the rising tension in the South China Sea was " clearly a source of concern " to Hanoi .
The submarine acquisition " would increase [ Vietnam 's ] negotiating power in the maritime disputes " , Professor Carlyle Thayer of the Australian Defence Force Academy said .

MonoDevelop goes cross platform .
Since the beginning of time , man has yearned to get a cross platform .
NET IDE .
Homer 's Odyssey described one man 's effort to achieve such a thing .
And it was not until today , September 9th of 2009 that the world can test out such a tool .
With this release MonoDevelop leaves its cozy Linux nest and embarks on a wild adventure into the hearth of MacOS and Windows .
The MonoDevelop team made this one of their major goals for this release : to turn our loved IDE into a cross platform IDE .
If you are curious about the details , check out the What is new in MonoDevelop 2.2 page .
MonoDevelop on Windows
We are not only bringing MonoDevelop to OSX and Windows as a plain GUI port , but we are also providing installers , deep operating system integration and support for native debugging on each platform .
MonoDevelop on MacOS X
In addition to becoming a cross platform IDE , there are many new features in MonoDevelop .
For instance , MonoDevelop can be used to develop ASP .
NET MVC applications on OSX and Linux and Silverlight applications on OSX and Linux .
Debugger
MonoDevelop now has integrated debugger support .
Not only it is able to debug Mono applications , it also can work as a frontend to GDB to debug native applications .
In addition , on Linux it is possible to debug ASP.NET pages .
New Add-ins
New exciting add-ins : ASP .NET MVC , Silverlight and iPhone ( for use with MonoTouch ) .
Policies
A common problem that we face as open source developers is that not every project uses the same coding style .
Different teams use different coding conventions .
MonoDevelop now supports policies to describe how files should be edited and what defaults should be used in each :
Editor Improvements
My favorite new feature is Dynamic Abbrev ( Alt - / ) a feature that we brought from Emacs and that fills me with joy .
That being said , for the non-Emacs lovers there are plenty of features that you asked for , and that we implemented :
Extensive refactoring support .
And I mean , it is extensive .
. Code templates .
On the fly formatting .
Acronym Matching in Code Completion
XML Documentation Shown in Code Completion
VI mode for those users hooked up on VI commands , they can now use those within MonoDevelop .
Another pretty cool feature is the code generation support that is triggered with Alt - Insert .
When you press
Alt - insert it will popup a context sensitive dialog box that offers a few options of code that could be generated at this point : ToString methods , Equals / GetHashCode methods all based on existing fields and properties .
Why go Cross Platform ?
Going cross platform means that developers will have the same tool across all of the operating systems they use : Windows , Mac and Linux .
. NET developers that have been enchanted by OSX will be able to continue developing software with their favorite programming languages while enjoying OSX and will be able to go back and forth between Windows , OSX and Linux as needed .
This also means that they can work with developers in other platforms , regardless of the personal choices of other team members .
As many of you know , the number of contributors to a project is linked to the number of users of that project .
By expanding our market presence from Linux , we expect to get contributions , fixes , improvements , bug reports , code and add-ins from developers in other platforms .
We intend to make MonoDevelop the Eclipse of the .NET community .
Just like Eclipse became the foundation for Java development , we hope that MonoDevelop will become the foundation for .NET development , and hopefully for much more than that .
A multi-system IDE
We are not religious when it comes to supporting other programming languages [ 1 ] .
We want to embrace not only .
NET - based projects like Gtk# , Silverlight , ASP .
NET , Boo , C# , F# , Visual Basic and Windows .
Forms .
We are also embracing other developer platforms like Python , C/C++ , Vala , and we want to expand our presence to work with the Flash , PHP , Ruby , Rails , Flex and any other communities that need a cross platform IDE .
[ 1 ] we are just religious about the fact that C# is a better programming language to build an IDE than Java is .
Thanks !
This release could not have been possible without the endless nights and the collaborations of our contributors and all of the end users that reported bugs and gave us feedback .
A brewing political controversy could turn into a parliamentary one after the Liberals introduced a motion Thursday to force the government into releasing secret documents in the Afghan detainee affair .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said the government has censored documents with " Soviet zeal , " and should immediately release any records relating to an incident of torture which was documented by Canadian troops .
The motion passed in Parliament by a vote of 145 - 143 , forcing the Tories to release the documents .
However , if the Tories do n't release the reports , Canada 's courts might have to intervene on the case , which could centre on arguments of parliamentary privilege and national security .
The parliamentary maneuvering follows revelations by Gen .
Walt Natynczyk , who said Canadian troops captured a man and handed him over to Afghan police , only to later see him being beaten .
The third Geneva Convention mandates that transferring prisoners who are then tortured is a war crime .
Though Natynczyk has called a military inquiry , MPs said that launching an internal investigation is not enough , because the military would be equal to both the accused and the jury .
" For over a year , the Conservatives had credible reports of torture from Canadian diplomats and soldiers in the field -- and they did nothing , " Ignatieff said .
" They must account for that year of willful blindness .
Their refusal to get to the truth is costing us our credibility on human rights , and is a threat to the honour of Canada , which our troops so bravely uphold every day that they serve . "
Earlier in the day , opposition MPs demanded the resignation of Defence Minister Peter MacKay and a public inquiry into the affair .
" It 's time for this government to take the step that 's required and that 's to ask the minister to step down and start the inquiry , independently , " said NDP Leader Jack Layton .
The demands in Ottawa came as the Conservative government continues to face heated questions over its insistence that the Canadian Forces never knowingly put Afghan detainees at the risk of torture .
Natynczyk revealed that in June 2006 , Canadian troops captured a man and handed him over to Afghan police , only to find out that he was mistreated and beaten .
The Canadians then took the man back into their custody .
Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe pointed to a 2006 report by a Canadian commander in Afghanistan that stated photos were taken of detainees before handing them over to Afghan authorities .
Duceppe said this was " in order to have evidence of mistreatment because , I quote ' it has happened in the past . ' "
Duceppe alleged that the government knew about the abuse for " quite some time . "
However , Prime Minister Steven Harper said the report was evidence that the Canadian government took action to prevent the abuse , and that the issue was dealt with up to four years ago .
He accused the opposition MPs of attacking Canadian soldiers .
" Canadian forces , when faced with a case of abuse , took immediate action to deal with that ... that should hardly be used as a reason to attack the forces , it should be used as a reason to praise them . "
The day before the revelation , Natynczyk said that Canadian troops had only questioned the photographed man , not captured him .
But after reviewing the file with his staff , the general called a news conference to release the correct information .
Natynczyk also said the military inquiry would determine why neither he , or his predecessor Rick Hillier , saw a platoon commander 's report which detailed the prisoner 's capture .
Liberal defence critic Ujjal Dosanjh said the government cannot claim that Natynczyk 's announcement yesterday was the first time it learned about this specific incident of detainee abuse .
Further questions
Ottawa law professor Errol Menders said the incident report forms " incontrovertible proof " that Canada should have immediately ceased transfers to Afghan authorities , a decision which the government is ultimately responsible for .
" If these guys had no clear instructions , and it 's clear they did n't , they were almost making it up on the fly which shows you the civilian command was putting them into an untenable position , " Mendes said .
The revelation by Natynczyk led opposition members to attack the Conservative government and MacKay , who has said " there is not a single , proven allegation " of abuse prior to 2007 .
When MacKay appeared before the special House of Commons committee on Wednesday , he said it was " an outrageous , false , inflammatory and insulting allegation " from a fellow MP .
He also said that " no one ever turned a blind eye .
Let me be clear , the government of Canada has never been complicit in torture or any violation of international law by willfully allowing prisoners taken by the Canadian forces to be exposed to abuse . "
Richard Colvin , the diplomat who testified last month that the Conservative government was indifferent to his warnings of torture , is preparing a letter for the House of Commons committee to respond to statements made by the government in recent weeks .
The Conservative government initially responded to Colvin 's allegations by trying to discredit him , a tactic that prompted a backlash from other diplomats and from opposition members .
MacKay first said there were " incredible holes " in Colvin 's allegations , though the defence minister has recently said his attacks on the ex-diplomat 's allegations were not personal .
With files from The Canadian Press
Obama âs dwindling band of true believers has taken heart that their man has finally delivered on one of his many promises â the closing of the GuantÃ¡namo prison .
But the prison is not being closed .
It is being moved to Illinois , if the Republicans permit .
In truth , Obama has handed his supporters another defeat .
Closing GuantÃ¡namo meant ceasing to hold people in violation of our legal principles of habeas corpus and due process and ceasing to torture them in violation of U.S. and international laws .
All Obama would be doing would be moving 100 people , against whom the U.S. government is unable to bring a case , from the prison in GuantÃ¡namo to a prison in Thomson , Illinois .
Are the residents of Thomson despondent that the US government has chosen their town as the site on which to continue its blatant violation of U.S. legal principles ?
No , the residents are happy .
It means jobs .
The hapless prisoners had a better chance of obtaining release from GuantÃ¡namo .
Now the prisoners are up against two U.S. senators , a U.S. representative , a mayor , and a state governor who have a vested interest in the prisoners â permanent detention in order to protect the new prison jobs in the hamlet devastated by unemployment .
Neither the public nor the media have ever shown any interest in how the detainees came to be incarcerated .
Most of the detainees were unprotected people who were captured by Afghan war lords and sold to the Americans as " terrorists " in order to collect a proffered bounty .
It was enough for the public and the media that the Defense Secretary at the time , Donald Rumsfeld , declared the GuantÃ¡namo detainees to be the " 780 most dangerous people on earth . "
The vast majority have been released after years of abuse .
The 100 who are slated to be removed to Illinois have apparently been so badly abused that the U.S. government is afraid to release them because of the testimony the prisoners could give to human rights organizations and foreign media about their mistreatment .
Our British allies are showing more moral conscience than Americans are able to muster .
Former PM Tony Blair , who provided cover for President Bush âs illegal invasion of Iraq , is being damned for his crimes by UK officialdom testifying before the Chilcot Inquiry .
The London Times on December 14 summed up the case against Blair in a headline : " Intoxicated by Power , Blair Tricked Us Into War . "
Two days later the British First Post declared : " War Crime Case Against Tony Blair Now Rock - solid . "
In an unguarded moment Blair let it slip that he favored a conspiracy for war regardless of the validity of the excuse [ weapons of mass destruction ] used to justify the invasion .
The movement to bring Blair to trial as a war criminal is gathering steam .
Writing in the First Post Neil Clark reported : " There is widespread contempt for a man [ Blair ] who has made millions [ his reward from the Bush regime ] while Iraqis die in their hundreds of thousands due to the havoc unleashed by the illegal invasion , and who , with breathtaking arrogance , seems to regard himself as above the rules of international law . "
Clark notes that the West âs practice of shipping Serbian and African leaders off to the War Crimes Tribunal , while exempting itself , is wearing thin .
In the U.S. , of course , there is no such attempt to hold to account Bush , Cheney , Condi Rice , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz , and the large number of war criminals that comprised the Bush Regime .
Indeed , Obama , whom Republicans love to hate , has gone out of his way to protect the Bush cohort from being held accountable .
Here in Great Moral America we only hold accountable celebrities and politicians for their sexual indiscretions .
Tiger Woods is paying a bigger price for his girlfriends than Bush or Cheney will ever pay for the deaths and ruined lives of millions of people .
The consulting company , Accenture Plc , which based its marketing program on Tiger Woods , has removed Woods from its Web site .
Gillette announced that the company is dropping Woods from its print and broadcast ads .
AT&T says it is re-evaluating the company âs relationship with Woods .
Apparently , Americans regard sexual infidelity as far more serious than invading countries on the basis of false charges and deception , invasions that have caused the deaths and displacement of millions of innocent people .
Remember , the House impeached President Clinton not for his war crimes in Serbia , but for lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky .
Americans are more upset by Tiger Woods â sexual affairs than they are by the Bush and Obama administrations â destruction of U.S. civil liberty .
Americans do nât seem to mind that " their " government for the last 8 years has resorted to the detention practices of 1,000 years ago â simply grab a person and throw him into a dungeon forever without bringing charges and obtaining a conviction .
According to polls , Americans support torture , a violation of both U.S. and international law , and Americans do nât mind that their government violates the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act and spies on them without obtaining warrants from a court .
Apparently , the brave citizens of the " sole remaining superpower " are so afraid of terrorists that they are content to give up liberty for safety , an impossible feat .
With stunning insouciance , Americans have given up the rule of law that protected their liberty .
The silence of law schools and bar associations indicates that the age of liberty has passed .
In short , the American people support tyranny .
And that âs where they are headed .
When I was forced onto a PC this morning , under great duress , I tried to reassure myself with simple thoughts â PC user thoughts .
Here was the latest and greatest Microsoft Â® Windows Â® , I told myself , the recipient of awards and accolades from the entire PC world , the perfectest operating system ever .
How bad could it be ?
Then I opened a browser .
Feeling faint , I leaned in for a closer look , and choked back vomit at the horror : Windows 7 renders CJK ( Chinese , Japanese , and Korean ) with bitmap glyphs .
Not even inline rÅmaji ( Latin ) text is spared the bitmap treatment .
On top of that we have Windows â apparent inability to adhere to a full - width character grid .
This is most obvious at lower left , where a column of prices teeters askelter as if struck by a chair hurled by a monkey in a furious rage .
Here , for comparison , are the same pages rendered on a system designed not by clueless trogs , but by expert developers who respect the art of typography :
Now , everyone knows that Microsoft is slow to adopt new technologies .
But to render text with jaggies â worse , CJK text , the readability of which is improved tremendously by antialiasing â some 34 years after Apple invented subpixel rendering ?
Appalling even by Microsoft âs standards .
Assuming Windows 7 is even capable of rendering CJK decently on a fresh install , why does it remain halfway illegible in these everyday examples ?
Does Windows make you tweak the registry or find extra font packs just to lift its display typesetting to bare mediocrity ?
I thought conservatives hated the ' War on Christmas ' .
From C - SPAN 's Washington Journal Dec. 24 , 2009 .
TPM has more -- Not Knowing What Else To Do , Health Reform Foe Takes Down Christmas Tree :
No , this is not an Onion story .
On C - SPAN 's call in show this morning , a woman named Bunny from Parsons , Kansas , said she was so disappointed by the Senate 's health care vote that she took down her Christmas tree .
And it seems like her call was not a prank .
It was n't just Bunny 's tree that went .
" I have taken my Christmas wreath off my house .
I have taken all the lights down , " she said .
" This is supposed to be a nation under God , and it is n't .
They absolutely have ruined Christmas . "
[...]
" So you took down your Christmas tree because of the Senate health care bill ? " he asks , with a hint of incredulity .
" I certainly did .
And I would like to see every light in the nation go out , especially in the White House , " Bunny replies .
She also explains that members of Congress are sullying " God 's holiday for the birth of his son " and that she opposes the bill so fiercely because its death panel provisions will unleash a " genocide " on seniors .
Rapid influenza diagnostic tests used in doctors ' offices , hospitals and medical laboratories to detect H1N1 are virtually useless and could pose a significant danger to public health , according to a Loyola University Medical Center researcher .
" At Loyola , we determined four years ago that the rapid tests for influenza detected only 50 percent of the patients who were positive , " said Paul Schreckenberger , Ph.D. , director of Loyola 's clinical microbiology laboratory .
" I can flip a coin and get the same results as I could with those tests .
So what 's the value of the tests ?
I can flip a coin for free . "
Schreckenberger said use of the tests could delay effective treatment with antiviral medication for critical hours for a large number of high - risk patients who registered a false negative with the rapid tests .
The tests can generate results in a half - hour or less and are available for purchase on the Internet in prices ranging from $ 20 to $ 299 .
" People who actually are infected with H1N1 are being sent home without treatment .
Those in high - risk groups could face serious illness , " Schreckenberger said .
" As for the others : maybe they go back to work ; maybe the children go back to school and infect others . "
Studies published recently in prominent medical journals back up Schreckenberger 's assertion .
One study published in The New England Journal of Medicine concludes that that one test generated a false negative 49 percent of the time , meaning it detected H1N1 only 51 percent of the time .
Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Virology found another test generated a false negative 82.2 percent of the time , detecting H1N1 only 17.2 percent of the time .
A study in Emerging Infectious Diseases , published by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , found that a test generated a false negative 88.9 of the time , detecting H1N1 only 11.1 percent of the time .
The agency 's Web site features data that coincides with the findings of its journal .
" The effectiveness of these test is not acceptable and reporting false results is a public health hazard , " said Schreckenberger , who is also professor of pathology , Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine .
" Our government agency , the CDC , is publishing data that proves that these kits do n't work .
That 's a big concern to me . "
Loyola utilizes a molecular - based test that detects 98 percent of people who are positive for influenza , Schreckenberger said .
The test has a 24 - hour turnaround time .
However , about 90 percent of all hospital labs in Chicago and across the United States use rapid tests to confirm a diagnosis .
Some hospitals use the rapid tests but will double check all negatives with a more accurate test .
" It 's not the physicians .
They believe the results just like they believe any lab results .
It 's the laboratories .
They should be telling physicians who order these rapid tests , ' I 'm sorry .
We do n't do them .
They do n't work .
We can offer you these other alternatives , ' " Schreckenberger said .
The tests are so inaccurate that physicians are being told by public health officials that they should consider anyone exhibiting flu - like symptoms as infected with H1N1 and then care for them accordingly , Schreckenberger said .
Also , public health agencies have begun tracking people with flu - like symptoms instead of cases confirmed by the rapid tests because they know the tests are unreliable .
" If these kits do not work , then why do 90 % of the hospital laboratories still perform them on their patients ?
False negative test results can only lead to a bad outcome and puts a huge financial burden on the health care payers . "
Schreckenberger said .
NEW DELHI / LONDON ( Reuters ) - China and other big developing nations rejected core targets for a climate deal such as halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 just five days before talks start in Copenhagen , diplomats said on Wednesday .

China , the world âs top emitter , together with India , Brazil and South Africa demand that richer nations do more and have drawn â red lines â limiting what they themselves would accept , the diplomats told Reuters .
The four rejected key targets proposed by the Danish climate talks hosts in a draft text -- halving global greenhouse gases by 2050 , setting a 2020 deadline for a peak in world emissions , and limiting global warming to a maximum 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times , European diplomats said .
Developing nations want richer countries to do much more to cut their emissions now before they agree to global emissions targets which they fear may shift the burden of action to them , and crimp their economic growth .
â We cannot agree to the 50/50 ( halving emissions by 2050 ) because it implies that ... the remaining ( cuts ) must be done by developing countries , â South Africa âs chief climate negotiator Alf Wills said , partly confirming the EU diplomats â comments .
Rich nations â carbon offers so far were far below those recommended by a U.N. panel of scientists , Wills told Reuters , making clear that developing nations could change their stance if industrialized states tightened their carbon targets .
The dispute underscored a rich - poor rift which has haunted the two - year talks to agree a new global climate deal to succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2013 and dampens hopes of rescuing the December 7 - 18 Copenhagen summit .
A legally binding deal is already out of reach for the U.N. talks , with only a political deal possible .
GLOBAL EMISSIONS
â The paper is defensive .
It lays out the red lines for those emerging economies , â one European diplomat with knowledge of the paper âs contents told Reuters .
Hosts Denmark had suggested a cut in world emissions of 50 percent by 2050 .
â They say they ca nât accept two degrees , global peaking in 2020 and 50 percent compared to 1990 levels . â
â They do nât want any figures under the heading of a shared vision in the Copenhagen draft , â a second diplomat said .
Developing nations point out that the developed world is most to blame for greenhouse gases in the atmosphere now , after two centuries of industrialization and burning fossil fuels .
China and the United States , the second - biggest emitter , buoyed hopes last week that Copenhagen could agree ambitious emissions reduction targets for individual nations , offering proposals for 2020 .
India is poised to follow China âs example and propose on Thursday a target to slow growth in its greenhouse gas emissions , but not cap these altogether , government sources told Reuters on Wednesday .
China last week said it would cut carbon emissions per unit of economic output by up to 45 percent by 2020 versus 2005 levels -- by improving energy efficiency and getting more energy from low - carbon , renewable sources .
India says it could cut such carbon intensity by 24 percent by 2020 compared with 2005 levels , according to provisional government estimates obtained by Reuters on Wednesday .
India , the world âs fourth highest emitter , is under pressure to announce details of how it will control its growing carbon emissions , and issuing targets will probably strengthen New Delhi âs hand at the Copenhagen negotiations .
Government sources said India âs Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh will make a statement in parliament on Thursday in which he could announce the targets .
India âs carbon intensity target will let overall emissions rise to 2020 , at a slower rate than economic growth , experts say .
â Targets in terms of intensities ought to be very strict , which India âs are not , â said Asbjorn Aaheim , a researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo .
He said the target would be hard to achieve only if India âs economic growth was weak and the population grew above most expectations .
Australia âs parliament rejected laws to set up a carbon trading scheme on Wednesday , scuttling a key climate change policy of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and providing a potential trigger for an early 2010 election .
Per MMA
Weekly , the good news :
Shinya Aoki could make his Strikeforce debut in March , according to the San Jose , Calif . - based promotion 's CEO .
Scott Coker on Monday told MMAWeekly.com that " dialogue was continuing " with Aoki 's camp and follow - up meetings were planned during a trip to Japan for Dynamite !
Dream vs. Sengoku on New Year 's Eve . " I do believe Aoki will probably be here fighting for Strikeforce in March sometime , " he said .
And the bad news :
Of course , with an American debut , Aoki would likely have to swap his pants for run -of - the - mill fight shorts .
As fun as it is to anticipate Aoki's American debut , if you read closely , you 'll note that nothing is signed and all we really have is Scott Coker 's sincere desire to bring Aoki to Strikeforce .
But Coker , uniquely among American promoters has got a proven track record of bringing over top Japanese talent , including Kasuo Misaki and Mitsuhiro Ishida .
On the issue of the grappling pants , Aoki has told Michael David Smith it 's immaterial :
I asked Aoki in an e-mail interview set up by Dream whether his pants aid his grappling skills , and his response ( as translated by a Dream PR representative ) indicated that he was n't too pleased with my question .
" It is nothing to do with my grappling skills , " Aoki replied .
" Anybody who has experience of grappling should know about this .
This questions seems for non professional . "
Precedents are rapidly being set in stone for the complete elimination of not just Aoki style long legged grappling shorts , but other designs that enhance fighters ' gripping abilities .
As Zak Woods argued , there 's a good reason for this :
WKR certainly understands the ban as long as it is shown that the shorts do provide an advantage compared to other athletic apparel .
A commission 's duty is to keep an equal playing field for all competitors .
Part of that duty is combating unfair technological advantages .
Sports fans saw one such incident in international swimming earlier this summer .
When Milorad Cavic defeated Michael Phelps in Rome the Serbia swimmer was wearing a new Arena X - Glide swimsuit .
It was determined that the technologically superior suit gave Cavic an unfair advantage and the Arena X - Glide suit was recently banned from international competition .
On the other hand there is already a set precedent for equipment that allows fighters to more easily perform their speciality : mma gloves .
When they were first introduced by Tank Abbott at UFC 6 they were immediately controversial and perceived as giving strikers an unfair advantage .
I believe mma gloves are essential .
Mainly because I like to see good punching exchanges .
But there is a cost to mma gloves -- they make securing submissions , especially the rear naked choke much harder .
This makes fights that should have been over go longer , results in more decisions , and lots of stalling while fighters have overwhelmingly dominant position but can't capitalize because their opponent is grabbing their gloves and they 're not allowed to strike at the back of the head .
And that 's not even getting into the reality that many many pro-fighters practice very advanced arts of oiling up their bodies via baths before fight time so that they appear dry and clean upon entering the cage but once they start sweating they 're oozing oil from every pore .
But I 'm willing to make that compromise .... IF we accept that something should be done to make it easier to get submissions .
There is a simple , elegant solution .
Mandate that all fighters wear Aoki style grappling pants .
That eliminates the unfair advantage argument , maintains a level playing field AND encourages more submissions .
The only argument against it comes from those who fear and hate the art of submission fighting .
Because really , what 's wrong with seeing more submissions ?
It 's not like Aoki 's pants suddenly transform him into a submission king .
If I were wearing Aoki pants I 'd be just as hapless and harmless as ever , just like donning a pair of mma gloves wo n't turn me into a knock out king .
The fighters still have to get the submissions , they just have a slighty easier time .
New federally financed drug research reveals a stark disparity : children covered by Medicaid are given powerful antipsychotic medicines at a rate four times higher than children whose parents have private insurance .
And the Medicaid children are more likely to receive the drugs for less severe conditions than their middle - class counterparts , the data shows .
Those findings , by a team from Rutgers and Columbia , are almost certain to add fuel to a long - running debate .
Do too many children from poor families receive powerful psychiatric drugs not because they actually need them Â but because it is deemed the most efficient and cost - effective way to control problems that may be handled much differently for middle - class children ?
The questions go beyond the psychological impact on Medicaid children , serious as that may be .
Antipsychotic drugs can also have severe physical side effects , causing drastic weight gain and metabolic changes resulting in lifelong physical problems .
On Tuesday , a pediatric advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration met to discuss the health risks for all children who take antipsychotics .
The panel will consider recommending new label warnings for the drugs , which are now used by hundreds of thousands of people under age 18 in this country , counting both Medicaid patients and those with private insurance .
Meanwhile , a group of Medicaid medical directors from 16 states , under a project they call Too Many , Too Much , Too Young , has been experimenting with ways to reduce prescriptions of antipsychotic drugs among Medicaid children .
They plan to publish a report early next year .
The Rutgers - Columbia study will also be published early next year , in the peer - reviewed journal Health Affairs .
But the findings have already been posted on the Web , setting off discussion among experts who treat and study troubled young people .
Some experts say they are stunned by the disparity in prescribing patterns .
But others say it reinforces previous indications , and their own experience , that children with diagnoses of mental or emotional problems in low - income families are more likely to be given drugs than receive family counseling or psychotherapy .
Part of the reason is insurance reimbursements , as Medicaid often pays much less for counseling and therapy than private insurers do .
Part of it may have to do with the challenges that families in poverty may have in consistently attending counseling or therapy sessions , even when such help is available .
â It âs easier for patients , and it âs easier for docs , â said Dr. Derek H. Suite , a psychiatrist in the Bronx whose pediatric cases include children and adolescents covered by Medicaid and who sometimes prescribes antipsychotics .
â But the question is , â What are you prescribing it for ? â
That âs where it gets a little fuzzy . â
Too often , Dr. Suite said , he sees young Medicaid patients to whom other doctors have given antipsychotics that the patients do not seem to need .
Recently , for example , he met with a 15 - year - old girl .
She had stopped taking the antipsychotic medication that had been prescribed for her after a single examination , paid for by Medicaid , at a clinic where she received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder .
Why did she stop ?
Dr. Suite asked .
â I can control my moods , â the girl said softly .
After evaluating her , Dr. Suite decided she was right .
The girl had arguments with her mother and stepfather and some insomnia .
But she was a good student and certainly not bipolar , in Dr. Suite âs opinion .
â Normal teenager , â Dr. Suite said , nodding .
â No scrips for you . â
Because there can be long waits to see the psychiatrists accepting Medicaid , it is often a pediatrician or family doctor who prescribes an antipsychotic to a Medicaid patient Â whether because the parent wants it or the doctor believes there are few other options .
Some experts even say Medicaid may provide better care for children than many covered by private insurance because the drugs Â which can cost $ 400 a month Â are provided free to patients , and families do not have to worry about the co-payments and other insurance restrictions .

â Maybe Medicaid kids are getting better treatment , â said Dr. Gabrielle Carlson , a child psychiatrist and professor at the Stony Brook School of Medicine .
â If it helps keep them in school , maybe it âs not so bad . â
In any case , as Congress works on health care legislation that could expand the nation âs Medicaid rolls by 15 million people Â a 43 percent increase Â the scope of the antipsychotics problem , and the expense , could grow in coming years .
Even though the drugs are typically cheaper than long - term therapy , they are the single biggest drug expenditure for Medicaid , costing the program $ 7.9 billion in 2006 , the most recent year for which the data is available .
The Rutgers - Columbia research , based on millions of Medicaid and private insurance claims , is the most extensive analysis of its type yet on children âs antipsychotic drug use .
It examined records for children in seven big states Â including New York , Texas and California Â selected to be representative of the nation âs Medicaid population , for the years 2001 and 2004 .
The data indicated that more than 4 percent of patients ages 6 to 17 in Medicaid fee - for - service programs received antipsychotic drugs , compared with less than 1 percent of privately insured children and adolescents .
More recent data through 2007 indicates that the disparity has remained , said Stephen Crystal , a Rutgers professor who led the study .
Experts generally agree that some characteristics of the Medicaid population may contribute to psychological problems or psychiatric disorders .
They include the stresses of poverty , single - parent homes , poorer schools , lack of access to preventive care and the fact that the Medicaid rolls include many adults who are themselves mentally ill .
As a result , studies have found that children in low - income families may have a higher rate of mental health problems Â perhaps two to one Â compared with children in better - off families .
But that still does not explain the four - to - one disparity in prescribing antipsychotics .
Professor Crystal , who is the director of the Center for Pharmacotherapy at Rutgers , says his team âs data also indicates that poorer children are more likely to receive antipsychotics for less serious conditions than would typically prompt a prescription for a middle - class child .
But Professor Crystal said he did not have clear evidence to form an opinion on whether or not children on Medicaid were being overtreated .
â Medicaid kids are subject to a lot of stresses that lead to behavior issues which can be hard to distinguish from more serious psychiatric conditions , â he said .
â It âs very hard to pin down . â
And yet Dr. Mark Olfson , a psychiatry professor at Columbia and a co-author of the study , said at least one thing was clear : â A lot of these kids are not getting other mental health services . â
The F.D.A. has approved antipsychotic drugs for children specifically to treat schizophrenia , autism and bipolar disorder .
But they are more frequently prescribed to children for other , less extreme conditions , including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , aggression , persistent defiance or other so - called conduct disorders Â especially when the children are covered by Medicaid , the new study shows .
Although doctors may legally prescribe the drugs for these â off label â uses , there have been no long - term studies of their effects when used for such conditions .
The Rutgers - Columbia study found that Medicaid children were more likely than those with private insurance to be given the drugs for off - label uses like A.D.H.D. and conduct disorders .
The privately insured children , in turn , were more likely than their Medicaid counterparts to receive the drugs for F.D.A. - approved uses like bipolar disorder .
Even if parents enrolled in Medicaid may be reluctant to put their children on drugs , some come to rely on them as the only thing that helps .
â They say it âs impossible to stop now , â Evelyn Torres , 48 , of the Bronx , said of her son âs use of antipsychotics since he received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder at age 3 .
Seven years later , the boy is now also afflicted with weight and heart problems .
But Ms. Torres credits Medicaid for making the boy âs mental and physical conditions manageable .
â They âre helping with everything , â she said .
50 interesting facts about the Cornish and the Constitutional Status of Cornwall .
It may have been the year of one of her classic films , Some Like It Hot , but a home movie found after 50 years in an attic apparently demonstrates that Marilyn Monroe may have enjoyed pot too .
A silent reel - to - reel colour film , dating probably from the late 1950s , shows a relaxed star taking a quick puff from what is alleged to have been a joint of marijuana while sitting on a couch with at least two other people .
But , as President Bill Clinton and other politicians might put it later , she did not inhale , not much anyway .
The film shows Monroe , smiling widely , with a cigarette in hand , and then seemingly self - absorbed in the contemplative pleasure of the moment , taking a drag , eyes closed , her head of trademark golden curls resting on the back of the sofa .
The person who shot the film at a private house in New Jersey insists the cigarette contained marijuana .
The moviemaker is remaining anonymous but insisted the pot " was mine " .
US collector Keya Morgan , who recently paid Â£ 275,000 for the movie and is putting the copyright of an image from it up for sale on eBay later this week , dates it to 1958 or 1959 , based on Monroe 's appearance .
He is making a documentary about the actor , whose final years were to see her turn increasingly to drugs of another sort , barbiturates and alcohol .
She died from an overdose , probably self - inficted , although murder conspiracy theories abound .

California regulators on Thursday went where no regulators have gone before â approving a utility contract for the nation âs first space - based solar power plant .
The 200 - megawatt orbiting solar farm would convert solar energy collected in space into radio frequency waves , which would be beamed to a ground station near Fresno , Calif .
The radio waves would then be transformed back into electricity and fed into the power grid .
â At the conceptual level , the advantages of space - based systems are significant , â said Michael Peevey , president of the California Public Utilities Commission , during a hearing on Thursday .
â This technology would offer around - the - clock access to clean renewable energy , and while there âs no doubt this project has many hurdles to overcome , both regulatory and technological , it âs hard to argue with the audacity of the project . â
â It âs hard to argue with the audacity of the project . â â Michael Peevey , California Public Utilities Commission
A Southern California start - up called Solaren will loft components for the solar power plant into orbit and sell the electricity it generates to Pacific Gas and Electric , the major utility in Northern California , under a 15 - year contract .
The project is supposed to be turned on in 2016 .
Solaren , founded by veterans of Hughes Aircraft , Boeing and Lockheed , plans to deploy a free - floating inflatable Mylar mirror one kilometer ( 0.62 miles ) in diameter .
This will collect and concentrate sunlight on a smaller mirror , that in turn will focus the rays on photovoltaic modules , according to the company âs patent .
In an interview with Grist in April , Gary Spirnak , Solaren âs chief executive , said that the vital part of making a space - based solar farm economically viable was to take the weight out of the system to reduce the number of rocket launches .
Still , Mr. Spirnak , who previously ran space shuttle flights for the United States Air Force , acknowledged that putting a solar power plant in space would cost a few billion dollars more than a terrestrial photovoltaic farm generating the equivalent amount of electricity .
The rate that P.G.& E. agreed to pay Solaren for the electricity produced by the solar station remains confidential .
Also , regulators said on Thursday that the utility could not count the project toward its renewable energy mandates unless certain milestones were met .
â I âll be the first to admit our reach may exceed its grasp , â said Mr. Peevey of the utilities commission .
In a good sign for another cutting - edge utility energy project , California commissioners on Thursday also approved a request by Southern California Edison to spend $ 30 million to finance studies on what would be the world âs first power plant to convert petroleum coke into hydrogen to generate electricity .
The carbon emissions would be captured and used to enhance recovery of oil from wells near Bakersfield , Calif .
The United States Department of Energy earlier this year awarded $ 308 million to the Hydrogen Energy California project .
â This would be a first mover project , â said Mr. Peevey .

Not unlike queerings past , women were allowed to dance on the stage or poles but men were not , resulting in the use of force against a gay man .
Many men were asked to leave the stage and were pulled down by a bouncer .
Some tried to resist , but it was nât until a pair refused to leave the stage that the situation began to escalate , as evidenced in the video below .
The man was escorted out of the bar , but was quickly allowed back in by the manager , giving the man and his companion complimentary shots .
After this , no more men were escorted off the women - only dancing stage .
When questioned , a man who identified himself as one of the managers of the bar said , â It is just the policy of bars in this area [ to not allow men on the stage ] . â
That translates to , â The stage is reserved for the objectification of women . â

( CNN ) --
The first nine months of this year has seen more pirate attacks than all of last year .
And more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates , an international maritime watchdog group said Wednesday .
The increase in attacks has forced many countries to patrol pirate hotspots such as the Gulf of Aden .
" The increased activity in Somalia is the major reason for the spike , " said Cyrus Mody , manager of the International Maritime Bureau , which monitors shipping crimes .
From January 1 until September 30 , pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks , compared with 293 in all of 2008 , the Bureau said .
Of the incidents this year , Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent : they launched 168 attacks .
Most of them took place off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden , a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia .
They successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages .
Eight others were wounded , four more killed and one is missing , the Bureau said .
Somali pirates are still holding four ships for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages .
Somalia 's transitional government , which has a tenuous grip on power , has been unable to stop the pirates -- many of whom are based in the port cities .
This has prompted Europe and other Western countries to step up maritime patrols .
" In the Gulf of Aden , the number of attacks have gone up .
But because of the presence of naval vessels , the success rate of the pirates have decreased , " Mody said .
" The navies are responding very very effectively . "
Today 's pirates are a far cry from the eye - patched , peg- legged swashbucklers of Hollywood .
They don night - vision goggles , carry rocket launchers and navigate with global positioning devices .
Many pirates are trained fighters ; others are young thugs enlisted for the job .
Experts say they often sail out to sea in a mother ship and wait for a target .
When they find one , the pirates board smaller boats and move in , typically with five to seven armed hijackers per boat .
Two recent trends have led to a rise in piracy : access and opportunity .
As global commerce picks up , more and more of the world 's fuels , minerals and other crucial commodities travel by ship .
Ninety - five percent of America 's foreign trade , for instance , moves by water , according to the U.S. Maritime Administration .
That cargo is an easy target for robbers in countries that lack the resources to secure their shorelines , such as Somalia .
Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in Somalia in the 1980s , when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast .
Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms .
Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions .
With the ransoms they collect , pirates can earn up to $ 40,000 a year , analysts say .
That 's a fortune for someone from an impoverished country .
Some analysts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the piracies .
" Yes , the ransoms have probably caused the piracy to become a bit more rampant .
But at the same time , from the owner 's point of view , there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo , " Mody said .
" It 's basically a cycle . "
Other trouble spots this year were waters off Nigeria , with 20 attacks ; Malaysia with 14 ; and Bangladesh with 12 .

â During the relevant production period , all such tests were negative , â Fairbank Farms said in written answers to questions from The Times .

However , the company added on Thursday that it was re-evaluating its testing procedures .
â In addition to those controls , Fairbank is evaluating the addition of another firewall such as additional testing of incoming product , â the company said .
Asked about the move by Trader Joe âs to terminate its relationship , the company said : â We respect each retailer âs right to select their suppliers .
And any retailer may dictate a quality assurance protocol for their suppliers to follow to protect their customers .
Our finished product testing protocol is the most stringent in the industry and that continues to be a selling point with our customers . â
The United States Department of Agriculture , which banned the deadly E. coli strain known as 0157:H7 in 1994 , has encouraged Â but does not require Â meat companies to test their products for the pathogen .
In the absence of such a rule , meat companies have adopted varied practices .
But in recent weeks , a growing number of meat industry officials have said they endorse trim testing by grinders despite resistance by slaughterhouses and some trade groups .
Grinders typically use trimmings from multiple suppliers , these food safety experts say , and only ingredient testing , when it uncovers E. coli , enables grinders to identify the slaughterhouse that shipped the contaminated trim .
â The raw material sampling really helps you do the trace back needed to go back to someone and say , â I do nât know what âs going on , you âve controlled this for a long time , what âs changed ? â â said Dr. David M.
Theno , a consultant who became a food safety officer at Jack in the Box after the fast food chain âs deadly outbreak of E. coli in 1992 , which prompted the government ban on 0157:H7 .
Dr. Theno , who retired last year , said he worked with Costco and AFA Foods â predecessor company to devise new safety systems , and he confirmed previous statements by AFA Foods officials that they started testing trim at their grinding facilities , like Costco did , but then stopped when slaughterhouses balked at selling them trim .
The Army general of U.S. forces in Northern Iraq , Major General Anthony Cucolo , has banned pregnancy among military personnel in his command .
A court - martial and jail time could be faced anyone who becomes pregnant or impregnates another service member .
That includes married couples , according to the order .
The order went into effect on Nov. 4th .
It was first reported by the military publication Stars and Stripes .
Col .
David Thompson , the inspector general for all soldiers in Iraq stated that to this point , no one has been prosecuted under the order .
In fact , no one has even accused under the policy .
The order , officials state , is because of Army policy which requires a pregnant soldier to be removed from a war zone within 14 days of learning of the pregnancy .
It creates a hole in the unit , which makes it difficult to complete its mission .
Despite what some might assume , there 's nothing wrong with the order , per se .
According to Thompson , who was interviewed by Stars and Strikes , â It is a lawful order . "
At the same time , Thompson told the publication that it âs the first time he can recall pregnancy being prohibited .

Mayor Richard Daley says any part of city government is up for grabs if the price is right .
But if he is tempted to dangle Chicago 's vast water system as his next lease deal , he might want to first consult Atlanta , which is still smarting from a botched experiment with privatizing a big - city water supply .
Or the mayor could look someplace closer to home , like Bolingbrook , one of dozens of suburbs and downstate communities furious about steep rate increases imposed by a private water operator .
Daley is searching for more jackpots as his administration draws heavily on the money it reaped from leasing parking meters and the Chicago Skyway to ease the city through the recession .
The mayor recently told the Tribune editorial board that he has met with consultants who outlined new privatization deals , but he would not provide details .
" Everything is always on the table , " Daley said , though mayoral aides later insisted that nothing immediate is in the works .
If Chicago tried to sell off its water department to a private company , it would be the largest U.S. city to do so .
Such a deal also would run counter to movements in dozens of smaller towns across the suburbs and the rest of the nation , where local officials are having second thoughts about private control of public water .
Mayors from Homer Glen to Urbana are threatening municipal takeovers of their local water systems , moved by complaints about skyrocketing rates and lackluster service from corporate operators .
Fort Wayne , Ind. , already wrested away part of its water system and is seeking to buy back the rest after accusing a private operator of putting shareholder interests before those of customers .
Backers of privatizing government services suffered a bigger setback in Atlanta , where city leaders tried during the late 1990s to turn over management of the water system to a corporate operator .
In 2003 , less than four years into a 20 - year deal , Atlanta regained public control in response to cost overruns , service problems and breakdowns .
Similar concerns forced Milwaukee this year to scuttle a bid to lease its water system .
Even the idea of studying a deal prompted such a fierce outcry that city leaders backed off , at least for now .
" Water is critical to a city 's future management and growth , " said Rob Hunter , Atlanta 's commissioner of watershed management .
" It 's not something you want to turn over to somebody else . "
It is unknown how much money could be raised by leasing Chicago 's system , which pumps treated Lake Michigan water to 7 million people in the city and suburbs .
The payoff likely would increase based on how much control the city would be willing to sign over to a private water company .
But given the public backlash over the mayor 's controversial parking meter deal and mindful of what has happened in other communities that have experimented with private control of water , questions remain about whether the short - term windfall would be worth the potential long - term costs .
Mayoral critics want to make sure more safeguards are in place to ensure public debate of any future lease proposals .
They note that Daley aides briefed aldermen on the parking meter deal just one day before the City Council approved it in December .
" The fact that they 've refused to answer any questions ( about a potential water lease ) suggests there is something in the works , " said Ald.
Scott Waguespack , 32nd , one of only five aldermen who voted against the mayor 's parking meter lease .
Lenders and investors are skittish to cut new deals in the wake of the financial crisis , but Daley says he wants to revive his proposed lease of Midway Airport when the markets recover .
Another target could be the water system , though Daley concedes that could be a tougher sell .
The Department of Water Management currently is run by unionized employees , some of whom were hired through an illegal patronage system that rewarded pro-Daley campaign workers .
" You 're giving this more weight than is warranted , " said Jacquelyn Heard , Daley 's spokeswoman .
" The mayor is not thinking at all now or even in the near future about leasing any more assets . "
Private operation of water systems already has become a contentious issue in the suburbs , where many mayors are fighting rate increases from a company that charges more for the same Lake Michigan water than neighboring municipal systems .
They fear that privatizing the Chicago system could lead to even higher rate increases that would be passed along to dozens of suburbs that buy water from the city .
Homeowners in DuPage and Will counties will pay 30 percent more for their water next year if a private operator , Illinois American Water , wins state approval for a rate hike .
The company , which sells water to 44,200 suburban households and businesses , wants to charge its DuPage County customers $ 13.50 for every 1,000 gallons .
Will County customers would pay $ 14.37 for the same amount of water .
By contrast , Chicago 's water rates will jump 14 percent in January , to $ 2.01 for every 1,000 gallons of water .
Naperville , a suburb that operates its own municipal system , charges $ 3 per 1,000 gallons .

" I certainly do n't want to be crosswise with the good mayor of Chicago , but I 'd rather own my own water system , " said Bolingbrook Mayor Roger Claar .
" We should control our own destiny , not turn it over to some private operation . "
Claar and officials in nearby Homer Glen , Plainfield and Woodridge are threatening to use eminent domain powers to seize their water systems from Illinois American , which started buying up dozens of suburban and downstate systems in the 1980s .
Urbana and Peoria already tried to buy their water systems from Illinois American but failed to muscle proposals through the Illinois Commerce Commission .
In response , mayors from across the state lobbied for a 2006 state law that eliminated the need for commission approval of water system purchases .
" Chicago would be crazy to lease its water system , " said Urbana Mayor Laurel Prussing .
Illinois American , she said , has " been able to take advantage of a monopoly for too long . "
In an e-mail , Illinois American said it is unfair to compare its rates to those charged by municipalities .
Cities can levy additional taxes and fees to fund services , and some have kept rates low by avoiding maintenance and upgrades , the company argued .
The company 's proposed rate increase , the second requested in as many years , would pay for $ 184 million in new pipes , hydrants and other equipment statewide , said Kathryn Foster , an Illinois American spokeswoman .
" Even if the rate request were granted ... water remains a good value at around a penny a gallon , " she said .
Other cities that have turned their water systems over to corporate operators or considered such a deal often promote privatization as a more cost - effective way to finance upgrades .
" Private operators can achieve greater efficiency and scale in their cost of capital improvement , " claimed a Web site promoting a bid last year to lease the sewer system in Akron , Ohio .
Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard has solicited bids from two dozen companies to lease his city 's water and sewer systems .
Most of the proposals pledge to cut costs by combining billing and service fleets and by promising to lower the price of needed improvements .
Customers remain skeptical , if not hostile , to privatizing water .
Last year , voters overwhelmingly rejected Akron 's sewer lease .
In Indianapolis , residents have filed a lawsuit accusing the company that already operates the city 's water system of routinely overcharging 250,000 households .
Moreover , some cities that have experimented with privatization figured out that municipal bonds still are a cheaper way to finance improvements than turning over their water systems to companies .
" The pitch is that privatization will lead to lower rates , " said Hunter , the Atlanta water commissioner .
" That is n't necessarily true . "
Still , mayors and other local officials keep pushing the idea .
They see public asset leases as a way to avoid raising taxes , slashing services or firing workers .
Wally Morics , the elected Milwaukee comptroller , this year suggested leasing the water system to pump more money into city coffers .
He estimates a 75 - to 99 - year lease could generate up to $ 600 million , which would be invested to provide an endowment of $ 30 million a year .
" We see budget gaps that are just going to grow and grow and grow in the future , " Morics said .
" People want services , but our model to pay for those services is broken . "
Daley boasts that he had the foresight to lease Chicago 's parking meters and the skyway before the financial markets collapsed .
But at the rate his administration is spending money from those leases , most of the jackpots will be gone by next year .
Instead of investing the money and spending only the interest earnings , Daley 's proposed budget would drain nearly $ 600 million from the $ 1.15 billion lease of city parking meters , on top of almost $ 400 million that will be spent by the end of this year .
That leaves less than $ 800 million of the $ 2 billion reaped from the leases .
With Daley predicting that Chicago will continue to limp through the economic recovery , there will be pressure to find new sources of money to keep city government operating .
Meanwhile , private companies will keep collecting all of the money generated by parking meters and the skyway for most of the next century .
" If you think the parking meter deal was a disaster , just think what could happen with water , something everybody uses and needs , " said Woods Bowman , a professor of public service management at DePaul University and the former chief financial officer for Cook County .
" What happens when the money runs out and there 's nothing left to sell or lease ? "

Because the " civilian labor force " grows about 1.2 % a year ( slightly slower in recovery years ) .
( See chart above . )
As a result , we need an impressive number of new jobs each month just to stay even .
Here 's Asha :
The average growth of the civilian labor force in the last twenty years ( 1989 - 2008 ) was 1.2 % and
the median also works out to be 1.2 % .
During the business expansion of November 2001 -
December 2007 , the labor force grew at an average pace of 1.1 % ( median = 1.1 % ) .
For a steady unemployment rate , the rate of increase in employment should match the rate of
growth of the labor force .
Based on the average growth of the labor force in the last 20 years , it
appears that roughly 140,000 jobs have to be created each month in 2010 to meet the increase in
the labor force .
We computed this number by using the level of employment in the household
survey for November 2009 ( 138.502 million ) as the starting point and raised the reading by 1.2 %
( growth of the labor force ) .
[ Monthly increase in employment = 138.502 * 1.012=140.164 ,
( 140.164-138.502 ) /12 = 138,502 jobs per month ] .
The labor force of the nation has recorded gains during the entire post - war period , with the exception of 1951 .
Data from the first eleven months of 2009 suggest that the labor force most likely held steady in 2009 .
The labor force typically grows at a sluggish pace compared with the historical average in the first year of an economic recovery ( see chart 1 ) , which leads us to
consider a slightly lower growth rate for 2010 .
By implication , the prediction of the necessary
increase in employment to match the growth of the labor force will be smaller than our estimate
of approximately 140,000 per month .
Considering a 0.75 % increase in the growth of the labor
force ( one standard deviation below the 1.2 % growth rate ) would roughly require 86,600 jobs per
month .
The main result of this exercise is that employment has to increase roughly 86,600 each
month in order for the unemployment rate to hold steady in the near term and a decline in the
jobless rate would entail a much larger gain .

US President Barack Obama has ordered a review of air security after a Nigerian man was charged with trying to blow up a transatlantic jet on Christmas Day .
Spokesman Robert Gibbs said Mr Obama wanted to know how a man carrying explosives had managed to board a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit .
Airport security measures in the US and internationally have been tightened .
On Sunday , a passenger on the same Northwest Airlines route triggered a brief security scare .
The FBI later said the passenger had locked himself in a toilet , but the incident had not been serious .
Mr Gibbs told ABC
News the system of watch - lists used by US government agencies would be examined , after it emerged that the Christmas Day suspect was listed and known to officials .
A US record for 23 - year - old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was created last month .
' Dangerous substance '
The US government uses three watch - lists , which become shorter as risk increases .
They include one with some 550,000 names on it , a " selectee " list with 18,000 people within the higher - risk category , and a " no - fly " list with 4,000 names of people who are not allowed to board planes .
UMAR FAROUK ABDULMUTALLAB
Son of a wealthy Nigerian businessman Attended a British school in Togo Studied mechanical engineering at University College London Spent time in Dubai , Yemen and Egypt
Profile : Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab UK travellers face delays Fresh security fears
Send us your comments Mr Abdulmutallab was placed on the lowest - risk list by US authorities in November 2009 , after his father alerted authorities about the behaviour of his son .
Mr Gibbs said the number of people on the watch - list was " a huge number " .
" The president has asked that a review be undertaken to ensure that any information gets to where it needs to go , to the people making the decisions .
The president wants to review some of these procedures and see if they need to be updated , " he said .
On 24 December Mr Abdulmutallab travelled from Nigeria to Amsterdam and then on to Detroit with an explosive device attached to his body , US officials say .
Shortly before the flight was due to land in the US , he allegedly attempted to detonate the device beneath a blanket but he was overpowered by passengers and crew .
Mr Abdulmutallab , the son of a prominent Nigerian banker , has been charged by US authorities with trying to blow up the Northwest Airlines flight as it was coming in to land .
US airlines especially have tightened security after the attempt , increasing screenings and body searches and , in some cases , confining passengers to their seats without pillows or blankets for the last hour of their flight .
Mitigation measures Mr Gibbs said " air detection capabilities " would also be examined as part of the review .
" The president has asked the Department of Homeland Security to answer the - quite frankly - the very real question about how somebody with something as dangerous as PETN could have gotten onto a plane in Amsterdam . "
Mr Abdulmutallab is from a wealthy Nigerian family Mr Abdulmutallab was allegedly carrying PETN , or pentaerythritol - the same material used by shoe bomber Richard Reid who tried to destroy a transatlantic flight in 2001 .
Mr Abdulmutallab's route began in Yemen , from where he travelled to Ethiopia , Ghana and Nigeria .
He then flew from Lagos , Nigeria , to Amsterdam , where he boarded the flight to Detroit .
According to Nigeria 's Information Minister Dora Akunyili , Mr Abdulmutallab had arrived and flown out of Nigeria on 24 December .
Nigerian authorities , who on Sunday pledged to co-operate with the US investigation , said all passengers passing through the country 's 22 airports would be screened .
Wealthy or influential people and their families are often allowed to skip checks , media reports say .
Speaking to ABC New , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said there was no immediate indication that Mr Abdulmutallab was part of a broader terror plot , but that the investigation was continuing .

As Los Angeles City Hall has struggled against a sea of red ink , one financial bright spot through the long recession has been the Police Department âs red - light camera program , which has seen a sharp rise in revenue , according to court data obtained by The Times .
From late 2007 to late 2009 , monthly revenue from cameras , now operating at 32 city intersections , has nearly doubled from about $ 200,000 per month to about $ 400,000 , according to estimates prepared by the Los Angeles County Superior Court , which processes ticket payments .
The city âs income now far exceeds that of Culver City and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , both of which had often eclipsed Los Angeles in photo enforcement income , records show .
Los Angeles officials insist the program is intended to reduce accidents and save lives , although red - light camera critics contend cities are chiefly interested in raking in money from automated systems that snag violators 24 hours a day .
Advertisement
The improved financial performance of Los Angeles â program , one of the largest in the nation , appears to be the result of changes in program administration , not a sharp spike in violations processed through the courts , according to the records .
Last year , the city more than doubled the amount charged for most of its red - light camera tickets .
The change , based on a legal recommendation from the city attorney , affects thousands of motorists each year who make rolling right turns against red lights -- known as â California stops . â
According to Los Angeles Police Department estimates provided to The Times last year , about eight in 10 photo tickets were issued for right turns , which some experts say are less likely to result in serious accidents .
Most California cities had long treated right - turn infractions the same as running straight through red lights .
Before the change , Los Angeles issued rolling right - turn tickets under a vehicle code section with a much lower fine .

When Los Angeles brought its fines in line with those in other cities , right - turn ticket penalties increased from $ 156 to $ 381 .
The city âs share of each ticket payment increased from $ 58 to nearly $ 150 , where it remains today .
The city also brought additional cameras online last year and has been working in recent months with the vendor to improve the system âs operation , said LAPD Lt. Ron Katona .
The cameras now routinely meet city performance standards , which call for 80 % of violations photographed by the system to be of prosecutable quality , Katona said .
The bulk of the cash collected from red - light violations , whether caught on camera or issued by patrol officers , goes to state and county programs .
With the most recent increases , red - light ticket penalties in Los Angeles County reached an average of $ 446 in August -- or about $ 500 when drivers elect to also go through traffic school so their violations are nât reported to insurance carriers .
Advertisement
â They âre pricing themselves to the point the average citizen ca nât afford it , â said Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine , a one - time LAPD traffic cop .
â They say the punishment must fit the crime . â
Zine is exploring ways to bring down the fines on red - light camera and other high - cost moving violations , possibly by treating them as city administrative infractions , similar to parking violations .
He noted that courts are overloaded and cutting back services .
The state âs share of the ticket revenue would be cut back under his plan , Zine acknowledged .
But there might be court system savings by moving adjudication of some violations to the city , he said .
Some violators would still get points on their driving record , he said , but â we may be able to save [ them ] a lot of money . â
On Zine âs motion , the city also has ordered a detailed review of the effect red - light cameras have had on accident rates .
Advertisement
As early as next month , the Los Angeles Police Commission is expected to consider whether the current camera vendor âs contract should be extended and / or reassigned .
The initial contractor , Nestor Traffic Systems , recently went into receivership and was taken over by a competitor , American Traffic Solutions .
The commission is also expected to begin the process of seeking new bidders for the city âs photo enforcement program , which based on past experience could set off intense lobbying by top red - light camera providers .
The current contract expires in April 2011 , at the latest .

The first round of Greatest Hits titles for the PS3 came out and were not really what people were expecting , mostly because of how ugly they were , and for perfectionists , how ugly they made their collections .
With the recent amount of redesigning that Sony has done with the PlayStation brand , it seems the Greatest Hits is also in for a face lift .
While it is a very subtle change , it should be a good one , as long as the games do not come in Red jewel cases like the one pictured below .

I confess that I am very fearful for the future of this country , even more fearful than I have been in the Bush years .
And that , I also confess , is a development I would never have predicted .
But there had been the possibility of opposition over the past seven years , although it finally became clear that all such opposition was a deadly illusion , and that the nominal opposition was in certain respects even guiltier than the Bush criminals .
An Obama victory will kill much of the possibility for meaningful political opposition for good -- that is , opposition that might significantly alter the existing system without destroying it ( if that is at all possible , which I am almost entirely convinced it is not ) .
But the resentments , the anger and possibly even the hatred will remain , and they may grow .
What happens then ?
It hardly bears thinking about .
Almost every politician lies , and most politicians lie repeatedly .
Yet in one sense , Obama 's speech is exceptional , rare and unique -- but not for any of the reasons offered by Obama 's uncritical , mindless adulators .
It is exceptional for this reason : it is rare that a candidate will announce in such stark , comprehensive terms that he will lie about every fact of moment , about every aspect of our history that affects the crises of today and that has led to them , about everything that might challenge the mythological view of America .
But that is what Obama achieved with this speech .
It may be a remarkable achievement -- a remarkable and detestable one , and one that promises endless destruction in the future , both here and abroad .
Second , we will work with our partners , the UN , and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy , so that the government can take advantage of improved security .
This effort must be based on performance .
The days of providing a blank check are over .
President Karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction .
And going forward , we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance .
We will support Afghan Ministries , Governors , and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people .
We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable .
And we will also focus our assistance in areas â such as agriculture â that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people .
In the past , we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly .
Those days are over .
Moving forward , we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interests , mutual respect , and mutual trust .
We will strengthen Pakistan 's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries , and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe - haven for terrorists whose location is known , and whose intentions are clear .
America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan 's democracy and development .
We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting .
And going forward , the Pakistani people must know : America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan 's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent , so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed .
Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt , and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents , our country has borne a special burden in global affairs .
We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents .
We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies .
We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions â from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank â that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings .
For unlike the great powers of old , we have not sought world domination .
Our union was founded in resistance to oppression .
We do not seek to occupy other nations .
We will not claim another nation 's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours .
What we have fought for â and what we continue to fight for â is a better future for our children and grandchildren , and we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples ' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity .
In the end , our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms .
It derives from our people â from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy ; from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries ; from the teachers that will educate our children , and the service of those who work in our communities at home ; from the diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad ; and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people , by the people , and for the people a reality on this Earth .
This vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue â nor should we .
But I also know that we , as a country , cannot sustain our leadership nor navigate the momentous challenges of our time if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse .
It is easy to forget that when this war began , we were united â bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack , and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear .
I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again .
I believe with every fiber of my being that we â as Americans â can still come together behind a common purpose .
For our values are not simply words written into parchment â they are a creed that calls us together , and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation , one people .
America â we are passing through a time of great trial .
And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear : that our cause is just , our resolve unwavering .
We will go forward with the confidence that right makes might , and with the commitment to forge an America that is safer , a world that is more secure , and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes .
To all those who repeatedly claimed that , no matter what " mistakes " he might make and regardless of the scope of the devastating effects of those errors , Obama had to represent a markedly better choice than McCain , take note : in certain respects , Obama is far more dangerous than McCain could have been .
For the same reasons , Obama is also more dangerous than Bush was .
I remind you that I have written numerous essays damning Bush for almost every single one of his policies .
It is hardly the case that I viewed Bush in anything approaching a positive light , however remotely .
In large part , the danger represented by Obama arises from the fact that Obama 's election gutted whatever effective opposition might have existed .
To their eternal shame , the Democrats never opposed Bush in any way that mattered -- but at least theof opposition had not been obliterated entirely .
In the near term and probably for longer , that possibility now appears to have been extinguished .
I 've been writing about this aspect of Obama and what he embodies for some time ; see , as one example , " The Fatal Illusion of Opposition . "
As I noted in a later article Even given my views over a substantial period of time , I have to admit that I was taken aback by one aspect of Obama 's speech this evening on Afghanistan .
I was n't mistaken about the policies he would announce , or the obviously false arguments he would employ to justify those policies .
About all that , I was correct in every detail ; see the immediately preceding article for the details .
Nor was I surprised by the number and comprehensiveness of the lies Obama told .
On the occasion of Obama 's widely - heralded speech about race in America , I wrote Before discussing the aspect of Obama 's speech that most concerns me -- and that , I respectfully submit , should deeply concern you -- let me note that Obama made very clear that he purportedly intends to extricate us from Central Asia by involving us in increasingly complex ways in the affairs of both Afghanistan and Pakistan .
If you think that is a glaringly obvious contradiction , you 're entirely correct .
How exactly do you leave that region of the world more quickly by involving yourself in ever more complicated and numerous ways ?
The answer is that you But as my previous article stated , Obama and the U.S. government are not unlike the dreaded house guest who insistently tells you he 's going home in just another week or two -- honestly , he is , and how could you possibly not believe him ? -- even as he redecorates your extra bedroom at notable cost and takes over several of your closets for many of his most precious belongings .
You hear his words , and you see what he does -- and your heart sinks as you realize that a life of independence , a life that isis gone .
Consider the extent of our ongoing involvement in all aspects of life in Afghanistan :
Were Obama and the U.S. appointed dictator of Afghanistan ?
I seem to have missed that bit of news .
Almost immediately after that passage , Obama said : " So tonight , I want the Afghan people to understand - America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering .
This is the advantage of holding a gun to someone 's head : your victim is n't about to call you a goddamned liar when you can pull the trigger at any moment .
And consider what Obama said about Pakistan :
If you think we 're leaving this part of the world any time soon , or perhaps even in your lifetime , you 'll believe anything .
But that 's all right : lots of Americans do precisely that .
But all of this is standard issue for rulers of Empire ; the rhetoric and presentation may be of better quality than offered by Bush or that would have issued from McCain , but the points are essentially identical .
What I find both revealing and disturbing is the concluding section of Obama 's speech ; more specifically , there are two elements that Obama put together in a way that is extraordinarily manipulative .
I also consider it exceedingly dangerous .
Look at the final section that begins , " Finally , we must draw on the strength of our values ... "
Obama tells a series of notable lies here , starting with his very next sentence : " That is why we must promote our values by living them at home â which is why I have prohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay . "
Guantanamoclose , " at some future date that forever recedes from the present .
And Obama may have said the words that " prohibit [ ] torture " -- but Bush said the same words , to the same effect .
In fact , Obama has emphaticallyended the practice of torture : as proof , consult this article and this one ( and there are more than a few additional articles elsewhere making the same and related points ) .
Obama 's description of the unique role played by the United States tells the usual story of " American exceptionalism . "
We might appreciate the uniformity of the ruling class 's view on this point , captured in this passage from earlier tonight :
This is indistinguishable from the views of Irving Kristol , widely considered the " godfather " of the neoconservative movement , views which I recently recalled in this piece .
For Kristol as for Obama , the impersonal , unanswerable forces of history have placed this " special burden " on America 's shoulders .
We don' tto run the world , but no one else is sufficiently special or unique to do the job ; as Kristol so wretchedly and dishonestly put it , it was all just " our bad luck . "
Weto do it -- for the good of everyone who lives on Earth .
This is the all - purpose disinfectant for crimes of staggering magnitude : the U.S. murders more than a million innocent Iraqis , but we did it for the Iraqis ' " own good " ; we torture , but we only do it because our enemies leave us no choice -- and we learn very early that the infliction of pain is the path to moral improvement , most especially for the improvement of those weaker than ourselves
As was true of Obama 's speech on race , the lies this evening were breathtaking in their scope :
You might object to these proclamations by pointing out , as one singularly contradictory fact , that the U.S. maintains a global empire of military bases .
Your objection is easily parried by the earlier part of the argument :
But do n't you see we don' tto do this ?
This is n't what we would choose , if the world would only behave itself .
The United States hasabout any of this , not if we want a world of security and peace .
And thatwhat you want , is n't it ?
Thus do domination , control and power serve as their own justification .
This is what Kristol believes , it is what Obama believes -- and he told you he believed all this two and a half years ago -- and it is what everyone in the American ruling class who wields power believes .
With this background , I want you to read or reread the final paragraphs of Obama 's speech .
It is this passage more than any other that causes me to conclude that Obama is an extraordinarily dangerous man , and a manipulator of the first order :
Two aspects of these remarks are noteworthy ; I consider both to be abominable in their meaning and intent .
Obama maintains that " our security and leadership " ultimately " derives from our people , " and he then itemizes certain of those " people " ( " workers , " " entrepreneurs , " " teachers , " and so on ) .
It 's obvious that Obama means , and me , and every other " ordinary " American .
What may not be immediately obvious is much more significant .
Given the context of this speech , and in light of Obama 's announcement that the U.S. will remain in Central Asia for decades to come ( in addition to being involved in virtually every other region of the world in numerous ways ) , Obama thus seeks to implicatein the crimes of Empire .
Never mind that the ruling class will act as it chooses for its own interests , and that they do n't give a damn about you except insofar as you provide the money and blood for their damnable work .
Forget the fact that you are incapable of redirecting the actions of the U.S. government , and that your only choice is to withdraw your support when the crimes become too ghastly for you to allow yourself to be associated with them any longer .
No , according to Obama the crimes of Empire arecrimes .
The work of Empire iswork .
You are as responsible , and asas anyone .
Obama maintains that you cannot disown it , even if you wish to .
And that leads directly into the second aspect of these concluding remarks .
Read this sentence again : To make certain you understand him , Obama makes the same point a moment later : Obama has put us all on notice : if we disagree with his policies , if we condemn the endless series of aggressive wars waged by the U.S. , we are imperiling the strength and security of the United States itself .
If we dare to criticize him or the actions of the U.S. government , we are displaying " rancor and cynicism and partisanship " that will " split asunder " the absolutely necessary national " unity . "
If we challenge Obama on any point of importance , we are " poisoning " the " national discourse .
"
In other words : disagreement on any matter of moment is not only dangerous , butand evenAnd if you consider the logical end of this argument , and what has happened before in American history ( see this post about what happened during both World Wars , underpresidents ; much more about Wilson , World War I and the suppression of dissent will be found here ) , there is a further meaning : such disagreement may well beNo , I am not saying that Obama makes this full argument in explicit terms .
He has n't -- not yet .
But look at the meaning of what he has said -- and consider the principles upon which that view rests , and where those principles can lead .
But most people will focus only on the immediate problem of Afghanistan and Pakistan , and this very ominous warning will escape them .
To return to one of the points from which we began : when Bush or others in his administration made efforts in this direction , they were quickly condemned .
If McCain had offered similar statements , he would almost certainly have been similarly condemned , out of primitive partisanship if for no other reason .
But who will object when Obama makes such statements ?
Other than a few disaffected people like me , anyone at all ?
Anyone of note ?
I very much doubt it .
We shall see .
Many of my articles over the last few years have analyzed what I consider to be the great dangers represented by Obama .
My judgment of him has been consistently negative in the extreme .
But I have to say that I now think I underestimated just how dangerous he may prove to be in time .
And in terms of his concluding remarks tonight , what might happen if there were , may God forbid , another attack in the U.S. on the scale of 9/11 or even worse ?
What would Obama say and , more importantly , what might he proposeabout those who displayed " rancor " or " cynicism " or " partisanship , " or who " poisoned " the " national discourse , " thus perilously undermining national " unity " ?
In the wake of such an attack here at home , who would oppose him ?
Would anyone dare to ?
And if they did , at what cost ?
Vigilance , my friends .
Eternal vigilance , as the man said

Dear Straight Dope : I have been reading about this floating garbage island in the Pacific on various news sites for years now .
It 's always the same information and never any pictures .
I 've looked all over Google Earth for this island of debris that 's supposed to be as large as Australia by some accounts and nada , nothing , bupkus .
Reports say that it 's growing exponentially due to typhoons , littering , and maritime accidents and that thousands of birds are dead or dying on the surface , strangled after gorging on plastic water bottles .
This means that someone has actually seen it up close or has lied through their lying teeth .
Now they 're saying that there 's an Atlantic floating island and it's as large as Iceland .
Or Greenland .
Or Australia .
Are the liars lying through their lying teeth , or are there really floating garbage islands bumping into the land masses of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans ?
Worried About the Birds
SDStaff paperbackwriter replies :
Such areas of plastic debris accumulation do exist â as Cecil confirmed a couple of years ago â and there are people who have seen them up close .
The idea , however , that you could prove or disprove their accounts by looking at Google Earth images is half - baked at best .
Google does nât provide high - resolution imagery for the middle of the ocean .
And even if it did , you would nât be able to see the tiny particles that make up the garbage patches .
Calling these garbage islands is highly misleading , as they âre not solid expanses of plastic you can walk on .
The plastic collected in the confluence of ocean currents called the North Pacific Central Gyre , for example , is in the form of very , very small pieces , almost invisible to the naked eye .
One study of the gyre found 334,271 pieces of plastic per square kilometer of ocean surface , but these pieces weighed only 5,114 grams altogether â that âs about 11 pounds .
The average piece of plastic they found weighed only about 15 milligrams , or about the weight of a grass seed .
The great majority of these particles are less than 2.8 millimeters in diameter , or a bit more than a tenth of an inch .
Mostly they âre shreds of plastic film , as from garbage and shopping bags , and bits of monofilament fishing line and nets .
The idea of a garbage island also implies there is a distinct edge to the area where the plastic debris is found .
This is another misconception .
As you sail west from the Pacific coast of the U.S. the density of particles increases until you reach an area that is roughly between 135Â° W and 155Â° W and 35Â° N and 42Â° N â the center of the gyre .
This is as substantial as the garbage patch gets , but to the naked eye , it âs just an expanse of relatively calm water that the major currents in the North Pacific circle around .
Even here the average density of particles is only 11 pieces of plastic per cubic meter .
The only way to see a garbage island is by dragging a plankton net through it .
You âre right to be worried about the birds , and marine life in general , though .
Eighty - two of 144 maritime bird species sampled in one worldwide study had plastic debris in their stomachs .
In 1985 one scientist estimated that plastic debris ingestion and entanglement ( i.e. , in fishing nets or longline fishing gear ) kills 100,000 marine mammals each year in the North Pacific alone .
In some areas inorganic fragments make up a greater proportion of the plankton layer ( by mass ) than organic material does .
This is especially bad for filter feeders â a group that includes shrimp and small fish as well as the baleen whales â which are ingesting plastic instead of plankton .

Weapons failed US troops during Afghan firefight
In the chaos of an early morning assault on a remote U.S. outpost in eastern Afghanistan , Staff Sgt. Erich Phillips ' M4 carbine quit firing as militant forces surrounded the base .
The machine gun he grabbed after tossing the rifle aside did n't work either .
When the battle in the small village of Wanat ended , nine U.S. soldiers lay dead and 27 more were wounded .
A detailed study of the attack by a military historian found that weapons failed repeatedly at a " critical moment " during the firefight on July 13 , 2008 , putting the outnumbered American troops at risk of being overrun by nearly 200 insurgents .
Which raises the question : Eight years into the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan , do U.S. armed forces have the best guns money can buy ?
Despite the military 's insistence that they do , a small but vocal number of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq has complained that the standard - issue M4 rifles need too much maintenance and jam at the worst possible times .
A week ago , eight U.S. troops were killed at a base near Kamdesh , a town near Wanat .
There 's no immediate evidence of weapons failures at Kamdesh , but the circumstances were eerily similar to the Wanat battle : insurgents stormed an isolated stronghold manned by American forces stretched thin by the demands of war .
Army Col. Wayne Shanks , a military spokesman in Afghanistan , said a review of the battle at Kamdesh is under way .
" It is too early to make any assumptions regarding what did or did n't work correctly , " he said .
Complaints about the weapons the troops carry , especially the M4 , are n't new .
Army officials say that when properly cleaned and maintained , the M4 is a quality weapon that can pump out more than 3,000 rounds before any failures occur .
The M4 is a shorter , lighter version of the M16 , which made its debut during the Vietnam war .
Roughly 500,000 M4s are in service , making it the rifle troops on the front lines trust with their lives .
Sen . Tom Coburn , R - Okla. , a leading critic of the M4 , said Thursday the Army needs to move quickly to acquire a combat rifle suited for the extreme conditions U.S. troops are fighting in .
U.S. special operations forces , with their own acquisition budget and the latitude to buy gear the other military branches can't , already are replacing their M4s with a new rifle .
" The M4 has served us well but it 's not as good as it needs to be , " Coburn said .
Battlefield surveys show that nearly 90 percent of soldiers are satisfied with their M4s , according to Brig .
Gen. Peter Fuller , head of the Army office that buys soldier gear .
Still , the rifle is continually being improved to make it even more reliable and lethal .
Fuller said he 's received no official reports of flawed weapons performance at Wanat .
" Until it showed up in the news , I was surprised to hear about all this , " he said .
The study by Douglas Cubbison of the Army Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth , Kan. , has n't been publicly released .
Copies of the study have been leaked to news organizations and are circulating on the Internet .
Cubbison 's study is based on extensive interviews with Phillips and other soldiers who survived the attack at Wanat .
He describes a well - coordinated attack by a highly skilled enemy that unleashed a withering barrage with AK - 47 automatic rifles and rocket - propelled grenades .
The soldiers said their weapons were meticulously cared for and routinely inspected by commanders .
But still the weapons had breakdowns , especially when the rifles were on full automatic , which allows hundreds of bullets to be fired a minute .
The platoon - sized unit of U.S. soldiers and about two dozen Afghan troops was shooting back with such intensity the barrels on their weapons turned white hot .
The high rate of fire appears to have put a number of weapons out of commission , even though the guns are tested and built to operate in extreme conditions .
Cpl. Jonathan Ayers and Spc. Chris McKaig were firing their M4s from a position the soldiers called the " Crow 's Nest . "
The pair would pop up together from cover , fire half a dozen rounds and then drop back down .
On one of these trips up , Ayers was killed instantly by an enemy round .
McKaig soon had problems with his M4 , which carries a 30 - round magazine .
" My weapon was overheating , " McKaig said , according to Cubbison 's report .
" I had shot about 12 magazines by this point already and it had only been about a half hour or so into the fight .
I could n't charge my weapon and put another round in because it was too hot , so I got mad and threw my weapon down . "
The soldiers also had trouble with their M249 machine guns , a larger weapon than the M4 that can shoot up to 750 rounds per minute .
Cpl. Jason Bogar fired approximately 600 rounds from his M - 249 before the weapon overheated and jammed the weapon .
Bogar was killed during the firefight , but no one saw how he died , according to the report .

James Fallows , an editor of The Washington Monthly from 1972 , to 1975 , reports for The Atlantic from Yokohama , Japan .
Sometimes the Monthly includes " tribalism " on its list of evil practices , along with expense - account conventions , end - of - the - year government spending sprees , and so on .
There 's an important point > ; here that is concealed by an unfortunate name .
" Tribalism " does n't sound as if it has anything to do with the average American 's life .
The word sounds like something strictly from the Third World , appropriate only for people who actually describe themselves as belonging t" tribes , " like the Ibos in Nigeria or the Miskitos in Nicaragua .
But the meaning behind the term has a bearing not only on America 's major problems but also on the countrys best future hopes .
The idea behind " tribalism " is the inst >; inctive sense that people are divided into " us " and " them " categories on the basis of traits they acquire by birth or upbringing - race , language , religion , clan , or caste membership .
One crucial ingredient of the tribal mentality is that it 's almost inconceivable for people to shift out of the category they 're born into .
The other crucial ingredient is a double standard of morality .
People inside the tribe - " us " - deserve better treatment than the people on the outside - " them . "
When tribalism is described thi >;s way , it 's easy to think of illustrations of its deplorable effects - in Northern Ireland , in the Middle East , in The Godfather and Romeo and Juliet .
There are other , less obvious illustrations .
The central tragedy of the Philippines , I think , is a " Godfather " - like family / tribal ethic that allows people to mistreat anyone who 's not part of the same clan or " barangay .
"
The more important point , however , is that this kind of tribalism is the normal outlook in most of the world .
It is not some peculiar , lo >; calized evil , like wife - burning in India , or just a form of ignorance that economic progress automatically corrects , like the drinking of impure water .
From what I can tell after several years in Asia , most people strongly prefer to live with others of their own " tribe " and feel only a feeble bond to those who are born different from them .
This emotion is strongest in the most modern Asian country - Japan - but is powerful in all the others .
The Chinese have a very strong sense of Chinese - ness ; most Koreans > ; scorn " impure " children of KoreanAmerican marriages ; the politics of most Asian countries break down on tribal lines ( sometimes these are racial and ethnic , as in Malaysia ; sometimes regional , as in Korea ; sometimes based on clans , as in the Philippines and Indonesia ) .
Asia is not a microcosm for the entire world ; but in its belief that tribal ties do and should matter strongly , it is more typical of the world than America is .
To most Americans , this tribal outlook sounds terrible - and it clearly is har >; mful in its effects .
( One reason why Japan is happier internally than , say , India is that its sense of " us " includes most people in the country .
That is , tribalism warps it only in its dealings with the outside world . )
But why , when so many people take the tribal mentality for granted , does it seem to Americans not just inconvenient but " wrong " ?
One underlying reason is the Western / Christian concept that every human being is created by the same God and therefore all people have some bond .
Obviously the > ; explanation can be taken only so far , since Christianity has coexisted with and even been used to justify slavery , apartheid , holy wars , and other intolerant practices .
Still , Christianity and Islam are the two religions with the most powerful evangelical component , based on the idea that everyone regardless of race is a potential convert .
( Buddhism is also theoretically universal but in practice leads to less evangelism . )
In the background of every mainly Christian culture lurks the suspicion that triba >;l discriminations are basically wrong .
The other explanation is a specifically American one : the idea that a society can be made up of people who did not have a preexisting racial or cultural tie to one another .
Yes , the Founding Fathers were nearly all from English or other white Western European backgrounds ; yes , they excluded blacks from their social contract and killed off the Indians ; yes , the American vision has never been free from tribal bias .
What makes America unusual , however , is the goal of >; a society that accepts individuals regardless of their " tribal " background .
This is a goal very few other societies share .
If we think of the United States as a nontribal society in a tribal world , what does that tell us ?
One possible conclusion , implied in much of what the Monthly has said on the subject , is that we should try to convert everyone else to believe as we do .
That is noble but completely unrealistic .
The only effective conversion America can carry out is case by case , through immigratio >;n. ( China , India , and the Philippines may remain tribal societies ; but Chinese , Indians , and Filipinos who try to become Americans are , by definition , showing a desire to be judged as individuals , not as members of a category or tribe . )
The more sensible conclusion , I think , is a version of the old " Socialism in One Country " theory about Russia .
The most admirable thing America stands for is its nontribal , open social ideal .
America can best help itself and promote its ideal by doing everything possibl >;e to make it work at home .
What this means is recognizing the tribal roots of many of our domestic problems - not just black / white differences but also the screw - you spirit of interestgroup politics and big -city life .
Calling these things " tribalism " does not make them easier to solve , but it does help show why they 're particularly offensive to America 's unique ideal .
An appreciation of tribalism can also help our foreign policy .
The political - science term " nationalism " sounds like a force that waxes an > ;d wanes - increasing when Third - World countries are escaping from colonialism , decreasing at other times .
In fact , nationalist feelings are another form of tribalism , and as such should be seen as a constant in our dealings with other countries .
America stands for certain universal values , like freedom and democracy , and we should never be afraid to recommend those values to others .
But we should remember that the values themselves will be much more popular if they 're not mixed up with cultural or politica >;l subservience to the United States .
No matter how popular American movies , music , and blue jeans may be around the world , no other society really wants to be dependent on the United States , England , for example , is culturally closer to America than Vietnam or Nicaragua is , and the English desperately needed U.S. help during World War II .
Yet even the Brits after a while got tired of GIs who were over - paid , over - sexed , and ( the main problem ) " over here . "
Our values will go farther if they advance other c > ; ountries ' nationalist feelings , not overwhelm them .

The Independent newspaper says Gulf Arab states are in secret talks with Russia , China , Japan and France to replace the US dollar with a basket of currencies in the trading of oil .
The US dollar eased after the report , written by veteran Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk and posted on The Independent 's website .
It cited unidentified sources in Gulf Arab states and Chinese banking sources in Hong Kong .
Fisk said the proposal was for trade in crude oil to move to a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan , the euro , gold and a new , unified currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council , including Saudi Arabia , Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Qatar .
" Secret meetings have already been held by finance ministers and central bank governors in Russia , China , Japan and Brazil to work on the scheme , which will mean that oil will no longer be priced in dollars , " said the report .
It added that France had also been involved in the talks .
The article said the plans may help to explain the sudden rise in the price of gold , which is commonly seen as a safe haven in troubled economic times .
The Independent said US authorities were aware that the meetings had taken place but had not discovered the details and were " sure to fight this international cabal " .
The issue of shifting oil trade away from the US dollar has been raised occasionally in recent years , but analysts and experts say it is unlikely to occur any time soon .
" I do n't think we will see much concrete actions coming out of such discussions because even when the dollar is weak , it does n't mean that commodities are undervalued , " said David Moore , commodities analyst at the Commonwealth Bank .
" In fact , when the dollar weakens , commodities prices tend to increase by a higher ratio . "
Iran began settling most of its crude oil exports in non-dollar currencies - primarily the euro - several years ago , but the actual price for its oil is still set in dollar terms .

â How is it possible to even imagine that Google could get the consent of people who appear in videos put online ? â Mr. Vaciago said after the hearing , which was held behind closed doors .
â How could the company check if consent has been given ?
Whoever uploads the video has to ask for the consent of those in the video .
This is a rule that applies to all video platforms on the Internet . â
The prosecutors rested their case last month after asking for a one - year sentence for three executives â David Drummond , senior vice president and chief legal officer ; Peter Fleischer , global privacy counsel ; and George Reyes , a former chief financial officer .
Prosecutors are seeking a six - month sentence for Arvind Desikan , who is now head of consumer marketing for Google in Britain .
If found guilty , the four defendants , none of whom have appeared in court since the trial began this year , would not serve time in jail because sentences of less than three years are commuted in Italy for those without a criminal record .
Mr. Vaciago and another lawyer for Google will finish their arguments in front of the judge Dec. 23 .
The prosecutors will then have a chance to respond Jan. 27 .
If only a limited amount of new material is presented , a ruling could come that day or soon after .
While Mr. Vaciago said he concentrated on addressing the question of the consent of those appearing in the videos , he said he would address the crux of the accusation at the next court appearance â that Google either knew the video was up and did nothing to take it down immediately or showed negligence even if it did not know .
Washington ( CNN ) --
One hundred and fifty new full - body scanning machines are set to be placed in airports across the United States as federal authorities work to close security loopholes exposed by the attempted Christmas Day bombing of a U.S. - bound airliner .
The Transportation Security Administration ordered the scanners before the bombing attempt for up to $ 170,000 apiece .
Plans are also in place to purchase an additional 300 units by 2012 , TSA officials said .
Forty body scanners are currently in use at 19 U.S. airports .
Use of the technology -- considered overly invasive by critics -- is optional , according to the TSA Web site .
Passengers who opt out of the screening receive an alternate form of checking , which includes a pat - down procedure .
There are two types of full - body scanners .
One uses " backscatter " technology to produce an X - ray image of a person .
The other uses millimeter - wave technology , which shows a detailed photo negative .
TSA officials have attempted to address privacy concerns by promising to blur pictures of passengers ' faces and delete all images produced .
One former TSA official told CNN that a body scanner could have stopped Umar Farouq AbdulMutallab , the man accused of trying to blow up a December 25 Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam , Netherlands , to Detroit , Michigan .
" I firmly believe in the whole body imaging system as a screening device , " Charlotte Bryan said .
" I believe that it would have detected that there was something there in that position on his body .
It may not have detected it as an explosive , but it certainly would 've raised some flags that would have required further detection and a review either by an officer or further scanning . "
Critics , however , warn that full - body scanners should not be the only answer to continued airport security problems .
" Right now the system is not working as effectively as it needs to be , " said Geoff Freeman , a representative of the U.S. Travel Association .
" It 's time to hit the pause button and do a wholesale review of what we have today and put in place the policies that will ( give ) America the most secure and efficient travel process . "
CNN 's Mike Ahlers and Sandra Endo contributed to this report
A prostitute who posed as an undercover police officer to deceive vulnerable men in Swindon has been sent to jail for three years .
Hayley Cosgrave , 29 , of Cumberland Street , London , was found guilty of three counts of deception and one of burglary , following an earlier trial .
Swindon Crown
Court heard she conned a number of men out of a total of Â£ 800 after posing as an undercover officer .
She told them that if they did not pay her " fines " they would face the courts .
The court heard there had been a series of incidents .
You must have known he was vulnerable and that 's why you went back .
This makes the offence particularly serious
Judge Douglas Field Cosgrave 's last deception , which she pleaded guilty to , involved her jumping into a man 's car in Swindon 's Manchester Road and threatening him with a trip to the police station or an on - the - spot " fine " .
After convincing the man she was a " genuine " officer he was taken to a cash dispenser to hand over Â£ 200 .
Sentencing her on Tuesday , Judge Douglas Field referred to another case where she targeted another man over a number of months .
He said : " You must have known he was vulnerable and that 's why you went back .
This makes the offence particularly serious .
" It 's with great regret you cannot pay compensation to your victims , " Judge Field added .

The number of Faith schools has grown in Britain
The government is facing criticism over claims that it allows faith schools to refuse jobs or promotion to staff with different , or no , spiritual beliefs .
The National Secular Society is arguing at its conference that current legislation discriminates against well qualified , non-religious teachers , The Department for Children , Schools and Families has said it has not received any complaints .
It said beliefs are only taken into account in a small number of cases .
Currently , the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 allows faith schools in England and Wales to take into account an applicant 's religious beliefs , or lack of them , when considering them for a teaching post .
This is intended to ensure that staff fully support the school 's particular religious ethos , such as Christianity or Judaism .
The Act was later amended to include school support staff .
In Scotland , Catholic faith schools are allowed to request that applicants provide a suitable referee who can testify to their personal religious beliefs and character .
Catholic teachers are asked to provide a testament from their parish priest .
The NSS has told the BBC that such requirements are discriminatory , and have no bearing on whether a person can teach a particular subject well .
No discrimination The Executive Director of the NSS , Keith Porteous Wood , will tell the Windsor Castle conference that the legislation is " appalling " .
" As religious observance plummets , it is unfair for non-religious teachers to be discriminated against in employment .
" How religious do you have to be to teach maths ? "
However , Mr Porteous
Wood will argue that teachers can accept a school 's religious ethos , and even support it to the extent of attending acts of worship with the pupils , as long as they are not required to actually believe it .
Some critics are worried about how far a faith school teacher might be required to reflect the school ethos , and whether their private lives could come under scrutiny .
Earlier this year a headteacher at a Catholic primary school in Sheffield resigned over his plans to remarry a second time .
Michael Cassidy told parents in a letter that " ... my position as head teacher is no longer compatible with the conditions and services of my contract .
Therefore I have no option but to leave . "
Should teachers have to uphold their school 's religious beliefs ?
The Catholic Church teaches that marriage can never be completely dissolved and therefore marrying a second time is adultery in the eyes of God .
In a letter to the pressure group Accord in October , schools minister Vernon Coaker admitted that school governors did have the power to decide if a staff member 's conduct was damaging to a school 's ethos and were entitled to take appropriate action .
But a spokesperson for the Department for Children , Schools and Families told the BBC that any school wishing to discriminate on the grounds of faith had to demonstrate , if challenged , that there was a ' genuine occupational need ' .
" No one has come to us complaining of discrimination . "

Jesus Hated Bald Pussy By Hunter S. Thompson
From " Kingdom Of Fear "
2003
Let 's face it , the yo - yo president of the U.S.A. knows nothing .
He is a dunce .
He does what he is told to do , says what he is told to say , poses the way he is told to pose .
He is a fool .
No . Nonsense .
The president cannot be a Fool .
Not at this moment in time , when the last living vestiges of the American Dream are on the line .
This is not the time to have a bogus rich kid in charge of the White House .
Which is , after all , our house .
That is our headquarters , it is where the heart of America lives .
So if the president lies and acts giddy about other people 's lives , if he wantonly and stupidly endorses mass murder by definition , a loud and meaningless animal with no functional intelligence and no balls .
To say this goofy child president is looking more and more like Richard Nixon in the summer of 1974 would be a flagrant insult to Nixon .
Whoops !
Did I say that ?
Is it even vaguely possible that some New Age Republican whore - beast of a false president could actually make Richard Nixon look like a Liberal ?
The capacity of these vicious assholes we elected to be in charge of our lives for four years to commit terminal damage to our lives and our souls and our loved ones is far beyond Nixon's .
Shit !
Nixon was the creator of many of the once - proud historical landmarks that these dumb bastards are savagely destroying now : the Clean Air Act of 1970 ; Campaign Finance Reform ; the endangered species act ; a Real - Politik dialogue with China ; and on and on .
The prevailing quality of life in America - by any accepted methods of measuring - was inarguably freer and more politically open under Nixon than it is today in this evil year of our Lord 2002 .
The Boss was a certified monster who deserved to be impeached and banished .
He was a truthless creature of former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover , a foul human monument to corruption and depravity on a scale that dwarfs any other public official in American history .
But Nixon was at least smart enough to understand why so many honorable patriotic U.S. citizens despised him .
He was a Liar .
The truth was not in him .
Nixon believed , as he said many times , that if the president of the United States does it , it can't be illegal .
But Nixon never understood the much higher and meaner truth of Bob Dylan 's warning that " To live outside the law you must be honest . "
The difference between an outlaw and a war criminal is the difference between a pedophile and a Pederast :
The pedophile is a person who thinks about sexual behavior with children , and the Pederast does these things .
He lays hands on innocent children , he penetrates them and changes their lives forever .
Being the object of a pedophile 's warped affections is a Routine feature of growing up in America , and being a victim of a Pederast 's crazed " love " is part of dying .
Innocence is no longer an option .
Once penetrated , the child becomes a Queer in his own mind , and that is not much different than murder .
Richard Nixon crossed the line when he began murdering foreigners in the name of " family values " - and George Bush crossed it when he sneaked into office and began killing brown skinned children in the name of Jesus and the American people .
When Muhammad Ali declined to be drafted and forced to kill " gooks " in Vietnam he said , " I ai n't got nothin ' against them Viet Cong .
No Cong ever called me Nigger . "
I agreed with him , according to my own personal ethics and values .
He was right .
If we all had a dash of Muhammad Ali 's eloquent courage , this country and the world would be a better place today because of it .
Okay .
That 's it for now .
Read it and weep .... See you tomorrow , folks .
You have n't heard the last of me .
I am the one who speaks for the spitit of freedom and decency in you .
Shit .
Somebody has to do it .
We have become a Nazi monster in the eyes of the whole world - a nation of bullies and bastards who would rather kill than live peacefully .
We are not just Whores for power and oil , but killer whores with hate and fear in our hearts .
We are human scum , and that is how history will judge us ...
No redeeming social value .
Just whores .
Get out of our way , or we 'll kill you .
Well , shit on that dumbness .
George W. Bush does not speak for me or my son or my mother or my friends or the people I respect in this world .
We did n't vote for these cheap , greedy little killers who speak for America today - and we will not vote for them again in 2002 .
Or 2004 .
Or ever .
Who does vote for these dishonest shitheads ?
Who among us can be happy and proud of having all this innocent blood on our hands ?
Who are these swine ?
These flag - sucking half - wits who get fleeced and fooled by stupid little rich kids like George Bush ?
They are the same ones who wanted to have Muhammad Ali locked up for refusing to kill " gooks " .
They speak for all that is cruel and stupid and vicious in the American character .
They are racists and hate mongers among us - they are the Ku Klux Klan .
I piss down the throats of these Nazis .
And I am too old to worry about whether they like it or not .
Fuck them .
" When you are not playing as well as we had been , and playing like crap on that road trip and losing and losing and then you are starting to come out of it , and playing a little bit better , you are still going to lose coming up that slope .
You âre playing good enough to win , but you are still in the dump , you âre losing those games .
At some point , that turns and you are winning those games .
Then you âve turned the corner .
We âre losing games we should win right now , but hopefully , we âre over the crest , we can see the top and start scoring some goals and win .
We need to make it [ bleeping ] happen on Thursday .
It needs to [ bleeping ] happen now , so we can get over that hump and get this ship headed into the right direction . " >>
Chris Pronger
These are things we know .
The news , here ?
Someone is saying it out loud .
Yep , the Flyers are in a funk right now , and Chris Pronger spoke out about it today with CSNPhilly.com .
In a 1,075 word article , just about all of them were quotes from Pronger .
He spoke for a while and he spoke in a ton of detail giving us a glimpse into his role on this team , into Mike Richards as a captain , and partially into the dynamic of this Flyers locker room .
The biggest bombshell out of Pronger 's interview ?
He respects Richards ' captaincy but through the summer , training camp , preseason hockey , and now 24 games of the regular season , Pronger can't get a read on what type of captain Richards is .
" [ Richards ] has nât come to me [ to ] ask me anything , and it âs delicate because at the end of the day , it âs his team .
He âs the captain .
He needs to show the rest of the players that it is his team .
I do nât want to be the guy that has to stand up every day and tell ourselves to look into the mirror and play better and all this stuff .
" I do nât know if he is â rah - rah â type or talkative type .
It is a difficult tightrope to walk .
I do nât want to step on his toes .
Maybe he is evaluating .
You ca nât just jump into a situation and ranting and raving without understanding what has gone on here in the past , as well .
It 's great that Pronger is respectful to Richards and his captaincy .
It would n't be right for an outsider to come in and take over , or " step on toes " as Pronger puts it .
The problem I see here is that Pronger , a 16 - year NHL veteran who has been certainly been around the block a few times , does n't know what kind of captain Richards is .
Should n't Richie be setting that kind of tone , as the captain , early in the season ?
In training camp ?
Certainly before the quarter pole of the regular season , no ?
Every single player on that team should know what kind of captain Mike Richards is , regardless of the amount of time they 've spent here .
If a player with the resume and leadership qualities that Chris Pronger has can't step into his locker room and understand how the captain interacts with his team , then how is that captain truly a leader ?
There 's a difference between being a quiet , lead - by - example type than having your teammates not understand that you 're the quiet , lead - by - example type .
I 'm obviously an outsider looking in .
I 'm not in that locker room on a daily basis , but this seems extremely problematic to me .
We 've all been trying to wrap our brains around the inconsistency issues surrounding this team for the last several seasons now .
Could part of the problem be a leadership void amongst the players , starting with the captain and trickling down to the rest of the team ?
What do you think ?
Neat game , though the stone pushing seems buggy sometimes , but nothing gamebreaking , so hats off to one of the more creative plattformer games from back in 2009
To get all medals I had to create a level of course .
And it would be a waste to not put it public for others to try , else I would have wasted my time for almost nothing .
So feel free to check it out , it 's very easy , but still requires a bit of thinking .
I like to imagine it plays on a mountains peak on the robots hunt for his spaceship parts .
A harsh territory with little place to grow plants .

Let âs not fool ourselves .
Whatever threat the real Afghanistan poses to U.S. national security , the â Virtual Afghanistan â now poses just as big a threat .
The Virtual Afghanistan is the network of hundreds of jihadist Web sites that inspire , train , educate and recruit young Muslims to engage in jihad against America and the West .
Whatever surge we do in the real Afghanistan has no chance of being a self - sustaining success , unless there is a parallel surge Â by Arab and Muslim political and religious leaders Â against those who promote violent jihadism on the ground in Muslim lands and online in the Virtual Afghanistan .
Last week , five men from northern Virginia were arrested in Pakistan , where they went , they told Pakistani police , to join the jihad against U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
They first made contact with two extremist organizations in Pakistan by e-mail in August .
As The Washington Post reported on Sunday : â â Online recruiting has exponentially increased , with Facebook , YouTube and the increasing sophistication of people online , â a high - ranking Department of Homeland Security official said .
...
â Increasingly , recruiters are taking less prominent roles in mosques and community centers because places like that are under scrutiny .
So what these guys are doing is turning to the Internet , â said Evan Kohlmann , a senior analyst with the U.S. - based NEFA Foundation , a private group that monitors extremist Web sites . â
The Obama team is fond of citing how many â allies â we have in the Afghan coalition .
Sorry , but we do nât need more NATO allies to kill more Taliban and Al Qaeda .
We need more Arab and Muslim allies to kill their extremist ideas , which , thanks to the Virtual Afghanistan , are now being spread farther than ever before .
Only Arabs and Muslims can fight the war of ideas within Islam .
We had a civil war in America in the mid-19th century because we had a lot of people who believed bad things Â namely that you could enslave people because of the color of their skin .
We defeated those ideas and the individuals , leaders and institutions that propagated them , and we did it with such ferocity that five generations later some of their offspring still have not forgiven the North .

Campbell 's monkey have distinct alarm calls Scientists may be a step closer to understanding the origins of human language .
Two studies suggest that the ability to combine sounds and words to alter meaning may be rooted in a species of monkey .
A team found the Campbell 's monkey can add a simple sound to its alarm calls to create new ones and then combine them to convey even more information .
The research is published in the journals Plos One and PNAS .
' Krak - oo '
Human language is incredibly complex , but one commonly used feature is the process of adding another unit - a prefix or suffix - to a word to change its meaning .
For example , adding " hood " to the word " brother " to form " brotherhood " .

A team looking at Campbell 's monkeys ( Cercopithecus campbelli campbelli ) in the Ivory Coast 's Tai National Park found that these primates do a similar thing .
The researchers studied alpha males in six wild groups .
These monkeys do not play a very social role but are alert to potential threats and disturbances and use their calls to highlight them .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The researchers discovered that the monkeys made several distinct alarm cries , among them calls described as " boom " , " krak " and " hok " .
The team found that booms were sounded when a falling branch had been spotted or to initiate group travel .

Kraks were only given after a leopard had been sighted .
While hoks were almost exclusively sounded when a crowned eagle swooped above the canopy .
But further analysis revealed that while booms were always unaltered , the monkeys sometimes added an " oo " to their kraks and hoks - and this transformed the information they were conveying .

Klaus Zuberbuehler , an author of the paper from the University of St Andrews , Scotland , said : " If you add this subtle additional oo unit to turn krak into krak - oo , then that call can be given to a whole range of other contexts .
If you take the suffix away then it is almost exclusively a leopard alarm call . "
Please turn on JavaScript .

While krak - oo appeared to be a general alarm call given to almost any disturbance , hok - oo was used for commotion specifically in the canopy , from the presence of neighbouring groups of monkeys to a glimpse of other flying animals .
Professor Zuberbuehler added : " What is interesting is that the same acoustic modifier is being used for these calls and that is really analogous to using a suffix in human language . "
' Boom , boom ' A second study focused on how Campbell monkeys combined their alarm calls , as they were more likely to use a longer sequence of calls than voice individual ones .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Professor Zuberbuehler said : " Sometimes the monkey can give 10 , 15 or even 20 calls , and typically different types of calls can appear in these sequences ...
So we tried to understand what particular context would trigger these sequences . "
The scientists found that a sequence made up only of booms was used to prompt the group to travel .
If a pair of booms was followed by some krak - oos , it was almost exclusively given when falling trees or branches had been seen .
But if two booms were followed by a mix of krak - oos and hok - oos , then that seemed to signal the presence of a neighbouring group of Campbell 's monkeys or another lone male .
Professor Zuberbuehler said : " These are three different events that are nothing to do with each other , but they are basically made of the same call types . "
He added : " This is the first time that we can demonstrate that these sequences convey something about the environment or an event the monkey has witnessed . "
The researchers say that while the monkey 's linguistic talents may be unique amongst primate species , if the findings prove to be more widespread then they could help to reveal more about the origins of language .
Professor Zuberbueler said : " Campbell 's monkeys and humans separated from a common ancestor about 30 million years ago .
" This set of papers shows that in terms of the call morphology , there seem to be ancestral traits floating around the primate lineage that have n't been known before . "

BERLIN Â Nokia , the world âs largest cellphone maker , reported a $ 1.36 billion loss in the third quarter on Thursday as it wrote down the value of its wireless networks venture by $ 1.35 billion and global sales declined 20 percent .
The company said that its leading share of the global cellphone market remained unchanged at 38 percent .
But it acknowledged that its lead in smartphones , the fastest - growing segment of the market , had fallen to 35 percent , from 41 percent , losing ground to Apple âs iPhone and Research in Motion âs BlackBerry devices .
Nokia âs quarterly loss was in contrast to a profit of $ 1.63 billion a year earlier .
Analysts said Nokia was being hurt by the slowing global economy , ferocious price competition and a weak portfolio of smartphones .
â Apple and R.I.M. are really starting to eat into Nokia âs lead in smartphones , â said Jan Dworsky , an analyst at Handelsbanken Capital Markets in Stockholm .
BAGHDAD , Aug. 25 , 2012 Â President Obama flew into Baghdad today on his end - of - term tour to highlight successes in U.S. foreign policy .
At a time when the Arab - Israel negotiations remain mired in deadlock and Afghanistan remains mired in quagmire , Mr. Obama hailed the peaceful end of America âs combat presence in Iraq as his only Middle East achievement .
Speaking to a gathering of Iraqi and U.S. officials under the banner â Mission Actually Accomplished , â written in Arabic and English , Mr. Obama took credit for helping Iraq achieve a decent Â albeit hugely costly Â end to the war initiated by President Bush .
Aides said Mr. Obama would highlight the progress in Iraq in his re-election campaign .
Could we actually read such a news article in three years ?
I would nât bet on it .
But I would nât rule it out either .
Six years after the U.S. invasion , Iraq continues to unnerve and tantalize .
Watching Iraqi politics is like watching a tightrope artist crossing a dangerous cavern .
At every step it looks as though he is going to fall into the abyss , and yet , somehow , he continues to wobble forward .
Nothing is easy when trying to transform a country brutalized by three decades of cruel dictatorship .
It is one step , one election , one new law , at a time .
Each is a struggle .
Each is crucial .
This next step is particularly important , which is why we cannot let Afghanistan distract U.S. diplomats from Iraq .
Remember : Transform Iraq and it will impact the whole Arab - Muslim world .
Change Afghanistan and you just change Afghanistan .
Specifically , the Obama team needs to make sure that Iraq âs bickering politicians neither postpone the next elections , scheduled for January , nor hold them on the basis of the 2005 â closed list â system that is dominated by the party leaders .
We must insist , with all our leverage , on an â open list â election , which creates more room for new faces by allowing Iraqis to vote for individual candidates and not just a party .
This is what Iraq âs spiritual leader , Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , is also demanding .
It is a much more accountable system .
An appearance by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio at Arizona State University 's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication was cut short Monday night when a group of protesters broke into song .

During a public " Meet - the - Press " style interview that began at 7 p.m. in the First Amendment Forum , Arpaio fielded questions from a panel of journalism professors .
The event was preceded by a gathering of more than 100 protesters who chanted and held signs that read " Stop Arpaio " and others that read " We support Sheriff Arpaio . "
" I do n't agree with a lot of what he is doing and he tries to avoid any questioning , " said Christina McDonald , a Cronkite student .
" Tonight he was doing the same thing and he would n't answer questions directly . "
Cronkite Dean Christopher Callahan prefaced the panel interview by pointing out these types of events are to show that the press has a responsibility to " hold people accountable . "
The professors asked Arpaio about his relationship with the media and whether he believes his office grants everyone access to information .
" The people have a right to know what I 'm doing , " Arpaio said .
" I 'm not afraid to face the media , no matter what the subject is . "
The panel questioned Arpaio about free press and First Amendment rights for 45 minutes and began to ask about other issues , including racial profiling , when protesters in the room began to sing .
Without another word , Arpaio took off his microphone and was escorted from the building , and Callahan addressed the protesters and the students .
" I understand your passion about this issue , " Callahan said .
" It just seems to me , misplaced . "
Some students agreed and said the protesters should not have interrupted .
" I felt that the protesters were really out of place by not allowing the journalists to finish questioning him , " said Gabrielle Abrams , a Cronkite student .
" In protesting Arpaio , they helped him out by letting him leave 20 minutes early . "
The architect of George W. Bush âs presidency triggered a protest to his visit to a Wisconsin university Thursday , drawing about 40 protesters carrying signs calling him a war criminal at the University of Wisconsin - Milwauke .
â We believe that before he speaks at this university for thousands of dollars , he should be put on trial for the crimes against humanity that he and the rest of the Bush administration committed , â Natasha Morgan of Students for a Democratic Society told local tv network WISN .

Hecklers interrupted Bush âs former Deputy Chief of Staff several times .
â I âll make a deal with you , â Rove said .
â I âll keep my remarks short and then you can get a microphone and you can ask me any damn question you want .
Until then , do something that may come hard to a liberal intellectual , and that is show respect for the rights of others , like everybody else who came here tonight . â
Rove used his speech to slam Obama , saying that he had tripled the deficit .
Rove believes that Americans voted for the president because they mistakenly thought he was inspirational .
Reports say that Rove was paid $ 25,000 for his speech .
WISN has more details here .

How about the Texas sit -down ?
As in Austin , grab a chair and get a grip on your blood - pressure medication .
The official Bowl Championship Series standings wo n't be revealed until Sunday , but there is enough information available now to put together a pretty accurate snapshot .
And it 's not good news for Texas .
Does anyone make a giant foam finger for " We 're No. 4 " ?
The latest unofficial standings from BCS guru have Florida and Alabama on top with one - loss Virginia Tech ahead of Texas , which checks in fourth .
Rounding out the almost nailed - down top 10 is Boise State at No. 5 , followed by USC , Louisiana State , Ohio State , Cincinnati and Iowa .
How solid are these standings ?
Well , the only piece of information missing from the formula is one of the six BCS computers , Peter Wolfe , who is holding his standings for the official unveiling .
It did n't matter that Texas got passed for the No. 2 spot by Alabama this week in the Associated Press poll , because the AP is no longer in the BCS formula .
It did matter that Texas got passed by Alabama in the Harris Interactive poll , which is used in the BCS along with the USA Today coaches ' poll .
Texas remains at No. 2 in that index .
Texas is getting hammered right now in two computers .
The Longhorns are No. 22 in Jeff Sagarin 's ratings and No. 18 in Ken Massey 's index .
No need to panic yet , Texas , it 's still way before early .
We 'll be sure to tell you when to panic .
Beat Oklahoma this week and , who knows , Sagarin might bump you into the top 10 .
It might be a good idea to wait before making travel plans to Pasadena for this year 's BCS national title game .

CAMP WILSON , Afghanistan â
The patrol was going fine until the trucks got stuck .
The rear wheels of two massive , 30 - ton armored troops carriers were buried up to the top of the rim in a wet , thick mud .
Then the shooting started .
The vehicles were part of a combat patrol organized by C Company of the 1st battalion , 12th Infantry .
Company commander Duke Reim led his men on foot through villages and fields on a mission to find out who was living in a region that is in his area of responsibility but into which his unit has never ventured .
Reim and his men had just talked to locals who told them how the Taliban imposed a curfew in the area , and how the Talibs warned villagers that if they told the soldiers anything they would be killed .
Then , after the soldiers had left , and just a few hundred feet from where they had talked to Afghan villagers , shots rang out across the open field .
The soldiers scrambled for cover , ready for a fight .
They looked for the shooter , but saw no one .
C Company âs third platoon leader , Lt. Nathan Wagnon , said it was nât an attack ; it was a message .
â It âs just harassing fire , â he said .
â They âre basically just letting us know that , hey we know you âre here and we do nât like it . â
This area is called the â Heart of Darkness , â and sits just a mile from the battalion âs main base .
It âs an area where the Taliban rules and Talibs move around on motorbikes with near impunity in miles of heavily vegetated , sparsely populated flood plain .
The 1 - 12 battalion is part of an effort to secure the villages surrounding Afghanistan âs second largest city , Kandahar .
Kandahar city has been called the â Center of Gravity â in the fight in southern Afghanistan .
Coalition forces are ringing the city in an effort to prevent the Taliban from gaining power and mounting attacks inside the city
On the edge of that ring is C Company of the 1 - 12 .
Like much of Afghanistan , the company is in charge of a large swaths of rural territory too big for its limited number of troops to secure .
So the coalition and the villagers are making do in a kind of in - between world , that leaves many Afghans stuck between â and equally fearful of â the Taliban and the U.S. troops .
Each side âs territory is pretty clear .
A road that runs south from the battalion âs base , called Camp Wilson , divides the area that his men can patrol , and the area the Taliban effectively control .
â That is basically the demarcation line between what we âre protecting and what we âre disrupting , â said 1 - 12 âs battalion commander , Lt. Col. Reik Andersen .
The â Heart of Darkness , â is more " Apocalypse Now " than Iraq .
Like Vietnam , booby traps and ambushes are the most common form of attack here , says Reim .
His unit patrols this area , and Reim says the road is his â interdiction line . â
He points to a map in the company âs headquarters , showing a large area west of the base where American troops have never ventured .
â Over here , in Sangsar , is where the Taliban actually originated , â he says .
And the Taliban are still there , and largely in control .
The price has been heavy when C Company has crossed that line .
Since September , the company has lost four men to booby traps and hidden bombs aimed at foot patrols .
The drive down the â interdiction line â in an armored personnel carrier is nerve - wracking .
Its takes 20 minutes to drive just one mile because the road has been repeatedly blown up by roadside bombs .
Reim and his men drive down the dangerous road at least twice a day , where they set up patrols and go house to house in an effort to expand what Reim calls his â sphere of influence . â
The captain says his company has been attacked seven times on the road in the past month by snipers with recoilless rifles .
â They âve also used the RPG 9âs over there , the heat rounds , that have actually penetrated the [ vehicle ] hull , â he said .
â So a lot of guys are usually worried coming down through there it might be their time . â
When they arrive to a village where Reim wanted to talk to locals , the soldiers find it abandoned .
Bullets have left pockmarks in the mud brick walls of farms and houses .
Some buildings have collapsed from airstrikes or artillery .
These are scars from battles Canadian troops fought here with the Taliban in 2007 and 2008 .
The Canadians took heavy casualties .
No coalition troops have come here since then , until today .
About a half mile away , the troops do find Afghans in a small set of mud brick buildings and compounds .
C Company âs third platoon leader Wagnon finds an Afghan man named Sultan .
Sultan is standing at the door to his home with his children .
He says about 50 people live in this village .
Wagnon asks if his troops can provide anything : food , blankets , medicine .
Sultan âs father , a bearded old man named Faisal Mohammad , smiles and laughs before responding .
â Yes , we need blanket , we need everything , we are poor people , â he says .
â But the Taliban wo nât let us take anything from the coalition forces . â
â Well , â the Lieutenant responds , â We are going to provide consistent security in this area .
We want to help you guys live a secure life , and have the things you need .
So any information you can give us about the Taliban , will help us keep them away from you . â
The men thank the Americans .
They ask them for blankets , but to bring them discreetly .
The Afghans continue to giggle nervously through the conversation .
This area has never been secure .
The Americans are here today .
But this will continue to be Taliban territory until the U.S. and coalition set up a base or some kind of permanent presence here .
Then , the shots ring out .
It could be the same people the soldiers just talked to .
No one knows .
Wagnon says it âs difficult to know who is friend or foe here .
â It âs very difficult to know if you can actually trust what they âre saying , â he said .
â And to an extent , they âre right , they are caught in the middle of it .
So a lot of the times because they âre in that situation they âll play both sides . â
Wagnon says there are specific instances where villagers have told troops they do nât know where the Taliban is , only to have soldiers get ambushed in the same area shortly after .
Still , he says he understands .
â Honestly , if I were in their shoes , I âd do the same thing .
I do nât blame them , â he said .
â It âs a complicated situation . â
â That âs hardest part , [ is who we 're ] actually dealing with , â Reim says .
â Farmer by day , Taliban by night . â
Reim says he âll continue to push deeper into this area .
He hopes to set up an outpost so he and his unit can better monitor the region , and provide closer security for the locals .
But it âs hard with such a big area and so few troops .
C Company is at the edge the current counterinsurgency effort to secure bigger population centers farther east .
The Afghans here may be stuck between the Taliban and the U.S. troops for some time to come .

I âm sitting in a farang restaurant in Chiang Mai , Thailand .
I âm there for the fast wifi and cold beer , eating a cheeseburger .
An American man sitting next to me decides to chime in : â I see you âve come halfway across the world to eat American food . â
Now , this is a tourist place â their Thai food sucks .
It âs toned down for Westerners .
If you want real Thai food , you go to a place with plastic tables and chairs and sit in the heat .
He âs eating what appears to be the worst plate of pad thai ever made .
They do nât even have chili in this joint .
If you ask for chili , they bring you a bottle of tabasco .
Heresy .
â How long have you been in Thailand ? â I ask .
â The wife and I have been here for six days now .
We âve got a couple more before flying back . â
â Oh . That âs nice . â
I just let the comment hang there â
I âm not going to give him the satisfaction of explaining my story .
And , of course , after a minute he takes the bait .
â How long have you been traveling ? â
â Four years .
I âve eaten my body weight in Thai food .
And sometimes I just want a frigginâ burger . â
That pretty much ends the conversation .
â It has been a true pleasure to work with Kurt .
My experiences with Kurt include input interviews where he asks great questions to dive in on a topic , messaging development where he helps get to the heart of the matter , content development where he brings a story to life , and editing where he polishes and puts the finishing touch on existing copy .
Kurt is versatile team player â he is reliable , professional , and thoughtful .
If you want to have a great experience with a writer , give Kurt a shot . â
Glover picked her victim up by her hair and banged her head against the toilet A former Playboy Model of the Year who banged another woman 's head against a toilet up to 10 times and broke her nose has been found guilty of assault .
Louise Glover , 26 , formerly of Essex , attacked Maxine Hardcastle after accusing her of looking at her husband during a night out in Brighton in 2007 .
Glover fainted , sobbed and wailed after being convicted at Hove Crown Court .
Judge Charles Kemp told her to be quiet and adjourned sentencing to February .
He warned her she could face jail .
The judge said : " All the court 's sentencing options have to be open . "
The court heard Glover , who had denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm , invited Miss Hardcastle and her friend , Nancy Stillwell , to an appearance she was making in Brighton on 15 December 2007 .
' Essex girls '
They were part of a 10 - strong party which moved on to the Oceana nightclub in the early hours .
Jurors heard the three women ended up in a toilet cubicle , where Glover became agitated and accused them of looking at her husband - from whom she is now estranged .
Glover - who has made semi-naked appearances in magazines and newspapers and was dressed in a pink Santa outfit - ordered the pair not to look at or talk to him .
" I know what you Essex girls are like , " she told them .
My nose was on the other side of my face
Maxine Hardcastle
The court heard she " flipped " one minute , then showed warmth to the other women , before telling them she might be being paranoid and did not have many friends .
Glover then spilled an alcopop drink down Miss Stillwell 's dress , and Miss Stillwell left the pair alone while she went to dry her outfit .
The court heard that was when Glover became angry again .
She hit Miss Hardcastle , breaking her nose and making her hit her head on the cubicle .
During the trial , Miss Hardcastle - the daughter of 1980s musician Paul Hardcastle - told the court : " I knew that my nose was broken because there was blood everywhere .
" But she just picked me up by my hair and pulled my body weight by my hair and did exactly the same thing again . "
' Could not breathe ' Playboy 's Model of the Year 2006 repeatedly hit her victim's head against the toilet and then tried to force her head down the bowl .
The court heard Miss Hardcastle could not breathe through her nose because of the blood , and had to try to keep her face away from the water in order to breathe .
She said : " My nose was on the other side of my face .
It was n't in the middle of my face anymore .
It was completely on one side . "
The attack ended after Glover 's husband was heard outside the cubicle telling her to stop , the court heard .
Glover later claimed she acted in self - defence after Miss Hardcastle became emotional and hysterical about apparent family problems .
She said Miss Hardcastle sustained her injuries when the cubicle door was kicked in .
Glover , whose last UK address was Audley Gardens , Loughton , Essex , was given conditional bail .

We have never known more about others and less about ourselves .
How bad did this decade suck ?
Well , let âs put it this way .
The damn thing never even got a name .
Not one that stuck .
The aughts never did it for me , nor did the â00s do it for anyone else , which is really saying something for a nothing decade .
But it âs worse than that .
There is almost no mention of this sorry decade âs impending end .
Saddam Hussein âs funeral was better attended .
This decade is headed for a burial in the Potter âs Field of cultural history .
You might argue that we âre still hung over from all the VH1 top one hundred lists at the close of the last millennium , but ten years was certainly enough time to string together a few clips of a doped up Paula Abdul stammering on American Idol and call it a retrospective .
This was a decade during which the Dow opened around 11,600 and closed around 10,500 .
Meanwhile , the national debt began around $ 5.6 trillion and reached around $ 12.9 trillion .
Do nât worry , though .
Lots of people got rich .
Just not us .
This was a decade in which we all feigned surprise when the banks collapsed and feigned more surprise when they were rescued like Miss USA drowning in a lake .
It was business as usual edited for television .
What Bernie Madoff did was standard practice .
He just did too much of it to too many powerful people .
Somewhere , somehow , Bernie deserves a medal for distracting public attention from the fact that we sent in renegade U.S. corporations like Blackwater to occupy sovereign nations and act with utter impunity .
This was the decade of the reality show that bore no similarity whatsoever to reality .
This was a decade that began with Kelly Osbourne popping Vicodin and ended with Jon and Kate Gosselin âs agents pursuing spinoffs .
This was the decade in which the dramatic plot died and in its place was put an HD camera recording every inebriated trailer park spat , catfight , liposuction procedure , girl - on - girl hookup , and crystal meth factory raid cable producers could dredge up on Craigslist .
We faded in on Monica Lewinsky and faded out on Tiger Woods .
The Internet was nât invented or even popularized during the decade .
It just got better at selling porn .
Sure , some of the other technological advances were impressive .
You can call anyone anytime from anywhere in the world for next to nothing .
God is on our friends and family plan , but we have nothing to say .
This decade our children answered billions of standardized statewide multiple choice questions without ever learning much .
That same time might have been better spent going to class , but in the New World Order every right answer is worth half a school lunch .
Quick â who is the vice president of the United States ?
This was a decade during which a man with the equivalent of a sixth grade education appeared to run the Western World .
This was a decade in which the political hacks who actually did took the â free â out of â free market â while pirating U.S. coffers like crack - addicted sexaholics in a Tijuana whorehouse .
This was a decade in which the methodical thinker who replaced the Three Stooges in the White House was given eight weeks to recreate the Garden of Eden .
This was a decade in which Americans gained billions of pounds while Jenny Craig , Nutrisystem , and Slim - Fast made billions of dollars .
More athletes than ever had to pee into a cup , and only twenty - three men over the age of forty - five were able to get it up without a pill .
Fifty is the new twenty .
Unfortunately , twenty is the new fifty .
We have never known more about others and less about ourselves .
Money still ca nât buy love , but it âs coming so close why split hairs ?
Vacant - minded opportunist shills are given five million dollars to put their name to books no one reads .
We treat stem cells better than kids .
We defend our marriages against non-existent threats before destroying our marriages all by ourselves .
Politicians make it in bathroom stalls and we get screwed .
We take our GPS everywhere but have no idea where we âre going .
We text , blog , and twitter other texters , bloggers , and twitterers , guaranteeing that when we perish in a Ford Explorer tumbling down an embankment , the virtual community will know exactly what we were feeling .
We are no longer world leaders in manufacturing , medicine , research , education , civil rights , quality of life , or life expectancy .
What we are world leaders in is telling the world what awesome world leaders we are .
We are the world capital of disillusioned delusional drugged - out desperados opening fire on innocent people in schools , offices , malls , post offices , and public squares .
We do nât call this terrorism .
Therefore , we are safe from terrorists .
Of course , a decade is just an arbitrary designation of an entity we call time marked by a number of revolutions of the Earth around the sun equaling the number of fingers on two hands and neither beginning nor ending coincident with a natural periodic phenomenon such as a solstice or equinox .
And it is , of course , not the decade itself that is to blame but rather the folks who acted poorly during it .
In spite of all the negatives , then , there is hope because we are in control .
That âs great , because frankly I do nât think I can take too many more decades like this one .

Ali Sibat 's death sentence apparently resulted from advice and predictions he gave on Lebanese television .
According to Saudi media , in addition to Sibat , Saudi religious police have arrested at least two others for witchcraft in the past month alone .
Before his arrest , Sibat frequently gave advice on general life questions and predictions about the future on the Lebanese satellite television station Sheherazade , according to the Lebanese newspaper Al - Akhbar and the French newspaper Le Monde .
Saudi newspaper Al - Madina reported on November 15 that a lower court in Jeddah started the trial of a Saudi man arrested by the religious police and said to have smuggled a book of witchcraft into the kingdom .
On October 19 , Saudi newspaper Okaz reported that the religious police in Taâif had arrested for â sorcery â and â charlatanry â an Asian man who was accused of using supernatural powers to solve marital disputes and induce falling in love . [...]
In February 2008 , Human Rights Watch protested the 2006 â discretionary â conviction and sentencing to death for witchcraft of Fawza Falih , a Saudi citizen .
Minister of Justice Abdullah
Al al - Shaikh responded that Human Rights Watch had a preconceived Western notion of shariâa , but did not answer the organization âs questions about Falih âs arbitrary arrest , coerced confession , unfair trial , and wrongful conviction .
She remains on death row in Quraiyat prison , close to the border with Jordan , and is reportedly in bad health .
In November a Lebanese TV psychic , Ali Sibat , was found guilty of witchcraft by a Saudi court and condemned to death .
According to , this is not the only death sentence for witchcraft handed down in The Kingdom in recent years ; it 's clear that the Saudi legal system takes this problem quite seriously .
In Mr. Sibat 's case , the interesting wrinkle is not just that he is a Lebanese citizen , rather than a Saudi subject , but that his criminal activities occurred in Lebanon , not Saudi Arabia .
( Unlike , say , Fawza Falih - - see below -- who is on death row for having " practiced witchcraft , consorted with djinn and slaughtered animals " to make a man impotent . )
Sibat was arrested while visiting Saudi Arabia on religious pilgrimage .
Evidently , Saudi Arabia 's sharia courts claim universal jurisdiction in such matters .
( Then again , since Sibat 's show was on a satellite TV station , one could argue that his criminal activities were n't really confined to Lebanon . )
It is not uncommon for foreigners to be sentenced to death and executed ( usually by beheading ) in Saudi Arabia .
Will Ali Sibat be one of them ? , from whose blog I found out about this news item , predicts " international condemnation if they actually do this . "
One would hope so .
Meanwhile , those of you who practice witchcraft or sorcery should probably avoid visiting Saudi Arabia .-- Jeff Weintraub==============================Dec. 4 2009 â 8:04 amIn the United States , television psychics are merely mocked .
In Saudi Arabia , they are executed .
The Saudi Arabian government is planning to execute Lebanese television psychic Ali Sibat .
Sibat was found guilty of witchcraft by a Saudi court in November , a crime which carries the death sentence .
It appears that Sibat was targeted for arrest and trial while visiting Saudi Arabia for the Hajj .
Saudi Arabia âs special religious police , the Mutaween , grabbed him out of his hotel room and placed the host in custody .
Sibat was then tried on charges related to his satellite television show : According to Sibat âs supporters in Lebanon , he was denied a lawyer at his trial and â tricked â into making a confession .
Sibat âs Lebanese lawyer , May al - Khansa , stated that the television psychic was told he would be deported to Lebanon if he confessed to witchcraft .
Instead , Saudi lawyers used Sibat âs confession as proof he deserved the death penalty .
Saudi Arabia routinely sentences foreigners to the death penalty .
Additionally , death sentences are usually carried out through public executions â mainly in the infamous Chop - Chop Square Unfortunately for Sibat , Saudi Arabian authorities have refused to define what they call â witchcraft , â â sorcery â or â charlatanry . â
Saudi Arabia lacks a penal code outside of sharia and judges are given wide latitude in defining criminal acts .
Activist group Human Rights
Watch trawled the Saudi press and found other examples of a literal witch hunt taking place in the country :
The Los Angeles Times reports that the 51 - year - old Falih was given the death penalty after a man accused her of making him impotent .
A Saudi court in the northern town of Quraiyat determined that Falih had practiced witchcraft , consorted with djinn and slaughtered animals in an effort to make the man impotent .
According to Saudi authorities , her death was for â the benefit of â public interest â and to â protect the creed , souls and property of [ Saudi Arabia ] . â â Interestingly , documents surrounding the Falih case indicate that she is a foreigner â a Jordanian â who also got caught up in the Saudi witch hunt .
NEXT year China will overtake Japan to become the world 's second - largest economy .
Its rapid ascent has led some to question whether China will follow in Japan 's footsteps , with the bursting of a massive bubble followed by years of decline .
But China is still far poorer than Japan was at its peak , and thus has more room to improve productivity .
A transition of surplus labour from agriculture to industry and services would increase efficiency and bring its economy more in line with the developed world .
And China 's stimulus package has produced much needed infrastructure that will reinforce future growth .
But in the long run , a shift away from investment and exports towards domestic consumption would make China 's output more sustainable , and help it to avoid experiencing a bubble like Japan's .
Pacquiao - Mayweather Round 1 : Drug Test
Drug testing seems to be the first round fight for Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. as a misunderstanding surfaces on what type of drug testing should be used on their much - anticipated fight .
According to Golden Boy Promotions , which represents Mayweather , the seven - division titleholder Pacquiao refuses to submit himself for an Olympic - style drug testing process or to a World Anti-Doping Agency procedure .
Such methods are stricter and more rigorous compared to what is required by the Nevada State Athletic Commission .
One difference example is the lack of random blood testing in the state level .
Floyd Mayweather Sr. has repeatedly accused Pacquiao of taking illegal substances , something that the Filipino denies .
Pacman never failed a drug test before .
Pacquiao âs trainer Freddie Roach told ESPN earlier that the pound for pound champ is willing to take the tougher test standards .
He said , â They can do whatever kind of drug testing they want .
They are scared of Manny and scared of his power .
He âll pass any test in the world . â
Leonard Ellerbe , chief executive of Mayweather Promotions said that for the fight to push through , Pacquiao must undergo the tougher drug tests or the deal is off .
The tougher drug test , he claims , was part of the contract .
The attack strained Baghdad 's relations with the US A US federal judge has dismissed all charges against five guards from US security firm Blackwater over the killing of 17 Iraqis in 2007 .
The five , contracted to defend US diplomatic personnel , were accused of opening fire on a crowd in Baghdad .
District Judge Ricardo Urbina said the US justice department had used inadmissible evidence .
The five had all pleaded not guilty to manslaughter .
A sixth guard admitted killing at least one Iraqi .
The killings , which took place in Nisoor Square , Baghdad , strained Iraq 's relationship with the US and raised questions about US contractors operating in war zones .
Lawyers for the five guards say they were acting in self - defence , but witnesses and family members of those killed maintain that the shooting on 16 September 2007 was unprovoked .
Plea deal
The disputed evidence concerned statements the guards were compelled to give to state department investigators .
As these statements would have been self - incriminating , they were therefore protected under the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution .
Prosecutors should therefore have built their case against the men without them .
Judge Urbina wrote in his ruling that the arguments by prosecutors and investigators that they had not used the defendants ' compelled testimony to make their case " were all too often contradictory , unbelievable and lacking in credibility " .
Justice department spokesman Dean Boyd told the Associated Press news agency : " We 're obviously disappointed by the decision .
We 're still in the process of reviewing the opinion and considering our options . "
Here 's a guy that 's a decorated war hero who we maintain should never have been charged in the first place
Steven McCool Lawyer for Donald Ball
The five guards were Donald Ball , Dustin Heard , Evan Liberty , Nick Slatten and Paul Slough - all of whom are decorated military veterans .
As well as the 14 counts of manslaughter , they had faced 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a machine gun to commit a crime of violence , a charge that carries a 30 - year minimum sentence .
Their lawyers said the men were thrilled by the ruling .
" It 's tremendously gratifying to see the court allow us to celebrate the new year the way it has , " said Bill Coffield , who represents Mr Liberty .
" It really invigorates your belief in our court system . "
Donald Ball 's lawyer , Steven McCool , said it felt like the " weight of the world " had been lifted from his client 's shoulders .
" Here 's a guy that 's a decorated war hero who we maintain should never have been charged in the first place , " he said .
A sixth Blackwater employee , Jeremy Ridgeway , had agreed to a plea deal in return for testifying against his colleagues .
7 January 2010 : Story corrected to remove reference to an immunity deal and to make it clear that the judge 's ruling referred to the compulsory testimony , and that they use of such testimony was in violation of the Fifth Amendment against self - incrimination .

TORONTO Â Iran âs most senior cleric denounced the role of the volunteer militia force known as the Basij in the crackdown against protesters , saying the force âs actions were against religion and â in the path of Satan . â
The cleric , Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , condemned the force in a statement posted on an opposition Web site , mowjcamp.com , decreeing that â the assailants have acted against religion and must pay blood money â to those who were wounded or to their families .
It was the harshest criticism of the militia to date by the ayatollah , who has sided with the opposition leaders .
The Basij militia has played an instrumental role in the crackdown ; the opposition has said that at least 73 people have been killed since the post-election protests began in June .
The opposition is planning another demonstration on Dec. 7 , known as Student Day .
Dozens of student leaders have already been arrested .

German car giant Mercedes has bought the Brawn Formula 1 team in a move that is likely to see Jenson Button join McLaren as Lewis Hamilton 's team - mate .
Mercedes will buy 75 % of Brawn in partnership with an Abu Dhabi investment company but will continue as McLaren 's engine partner until 2015 .
Brawn , who won both world titles in their debut season in 2009 , will be rebranded as Mercedes Grand Prix .
Nico Rosberg will be their lead driver , with Nick Heidfeld his likely partner .
Fellow German Timo Glock , who drove for Toyota last season , is also a possibility .
The team has not yet confirmed Rosberg , who drove for Williams in 2009 , but he is widely known throughout F1 to have already signed for the Mercedes team .
We 've had discussions with Jenson over what we think is a sensible salary and this deal is not going to change anything in that respect
Brawn chief executive Nick Fry Mercedes motorsport vice - president Norbert Haug indicated that talks with Button were ongoing but had already revealed the team is in negotiations with Heidfeld .
" We are talking ( with Button ) and that 's why we cannot announce the driver line - up , " said Haug on Monday .
" We have to accept that speculation takes place , but that 's the name of the game . "
But he added : " This will be an international team - Mercedes - Benz is a global player .
" We definitely do not want to have a pure German team .
It 's an international team and we want to have the best drivers in the car . "
Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche , whose company owns Mercedes , echoed Haug 's thoughts .
" What we would like to see is the best drivers in the two seats , " he said .
" We certainly would not be opposed if one of them was German but that is not a prerequisite . "

Button , who won the drivers ' title this year , has been trying to secure a pay - rise from his Â£ 3.5 m salary but it seems Mercedes is not interested in granting his wish .
The 29 - year - old Englishman visited McLaren with manager Richard Goddard on Friday , with Button now expected to join the Woking - based team for a salary around double what Brawn were offering .
Button 's decision is understood not to be solely about money - sources say he considers McLaren might have a more competitive car than Brawn in 2010 .
" We 've had discussions with Jenson over what we think is a sensible salary and this deal is not going to change anything in that respect , " Brawn chief executive Nick Fry told BBC Radio 5 live .
ANDREW BENSON BLOG
You would not find many people in F1 who fancied Button 's chances of beating Hamilton in the same car
" I hope Jenson will be with us as we 've been together for a good few years , but F1 is not divorced from the rest of the world .
" The reason we 've survived as a team is that we have operated in our means . "
Finn Kimi Raikkonen , who has been forced to leave Ferrari to make way for Fernando Alonso , remains an outside possibility for the seat alongside 2008 world champion Hamilton .
Despite the takeover , both Haug and Zetsche indicated that there were unlikely to be wholesale changes , with Ross Brawn remaining as team principal .
They also said Brawn would have a key role to play in deciding the driver line - up for 2010 and beyond .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Ross Brawn is the boss of the team and it would not be smart of us to dictate to him anything like a driver decision , " said Zetsche .
Brawn and Fry will retain a 24.9 % shareholding in the team .
The remaining 75.1 % will be split between Mercedes , which will own 45.1 % and Abu Dhabi company Aabar Investments , which will own 30 % .
Brawn said : " Brawn GP has been through an incredible journey over the last 12 months .
" From fighting for our survival to forging a strong relationship with Mercedes - Benz High Performance Engines , winning both the constructors ' and drivers ' world championships , and now accepting Daimler and Aabar 's offer to buy our team , which will secure its future . "
As part of a deal that will see the McLaren Group buy back Mercedes 's 40 % shareholding by 2011 , the German company will continue to supply free engines and sponsorship to the team for at least the next six years .
It 's a win -win situation , both for McLaren and Daimler
Ron Dennis
McLaren boss
The team 's official name will remain Vodafone McLaren Mercedes .
McLaren chairman Ron Dennis described the deal as " a win- win situation , both for McLaren and Daimler " .
McLaren and Mercedes said one of the reasons for them to split was because of McLaren 's road - car building ambitions .
McLaren is launching a high - performance sports car called the MP4 - 12C in 2011 .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
Dennis said : " I 've often stated that it 's my belief that , in order to survive and thrive in 21st Century Formula 1 , a team must become much more than merely a team .
" That being the case , in order to develop and sustain the revenue streams required to compete and win grands prix and world championships , companies that run Formula 1 teams must broaden the scope of their commercial activities .
" In the MP4 - 12C , which will be introduced to market in 2011 , we have a car that has inherited the genes of the iconic McLaren F1 of 1994 and has already been the subject of much global media acclaim . "

One year ago today , a brain - damaged man died peacefully at the age of 82 , and neuroscientists the world over learned the identity of the man who was referred to in the textbooks only as " H.M. " Henry Gustav Molaison
lost much of a brain structure called the hippocampus during an operation in the 1950s .
The procedure was meant to stop his epileptic seizures .
However , the hippocampus is critical to memory formation , so the surgery left Molaison unable to form new long - term memories [ New Scientist ] .
By studying Molaison 's behavior over decades , researchers learned an enormous amount about memory formation .
Today , researchers at The Brain Observatory in San Diego are taking the next step in studying the workings of Molaison 's brain :
They 're slicing it up .
During Molaison 's life , he and his guardian agreed that his brain should be donated to science upon his death .
So his brain was frozen , and beginning today it will be cut into about 2,600 very thin slices ( think deli meat ) .
Each slice will be photographed , and many will be studied microscopically to determine exactly which parts of Molaison 's brain were damaged in that long - ago operation .
The slicing operation , which began about an hour ago , is being streamed live on the Internet , although it 's hardly a gripping action sequence ( it looks more like scientists going about their business in a lab ) .
In addition , the photos of the brain slices will soon be posted online for all the world to marvel at .
Behavioral neuroscientist Suzanne Corkin , who worked with Molaison for decades , says the dissection will yield many new insights .
â The extraordinary value of H.M. âs brain is that we have roughly 50 years of behavioral data , including measures of different kinds of memory as well as other cognitive functions and even sensory and motor functions " said Corkin ....
" We know what he was able to do and not do .
Our goal is to link his deficits to damaged brain areas and his preserved functions to spared areas â [ San Diego Union Tribune ] .

Is the Federal Reserve too secretive ?
This issue has waxed and waned .
It âs reappearing again in Congress because the Fed failed to prevent the financial crisis and the â great recession , â prompting calls for major change at the world âs most powerful central bank .
The change with the most backing is a proposal by Rep. Ron Paul ( R ) of Texas to allow the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) to audit Â­â examine and investigate â the Fed âs monetary policy decisions .
Fed officials adamantly oppose it .
" My fear is that if we take what could be an unpopular step , Congress will order an audit , which would be a way of applying pressure , or perceived as a way of applying pressure , to our policy decisions , â Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in congressional testimony Dec. 3 .
â Incredibly dangerous , â stated former Fed governor and Columbia University professor Frederic Mishkin .
The fear is that a less independent central bank , heavily influenced by politicians , will permit greater inflation .
But Mr. Paul âs amendment attracted bipartisan support with more than 300 cosponsors .
It became part of a broad financial - reform bill that passed the House Financial Services Committee earlier this month .
The GAO can already audit the Fed âs regulatory and supervisory activities .
The amendment would repeal a 1978 law that forbade the agency from looking into the Fed âs relations with foreign central banks and the monetary deliberations of its Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , which sets short - term interest rates .
But release of GAO findings would be delayed 180 days to ease fears of political meddling with interest rate policy .
Congress has constitutional authority over the Fed with its vital money - creating power .
At present , the Fed âs books are audited by Deloitte and Touche , a private firm .
As a libertarian , Paul seems presently more interested in ending Fed secrecy than putting Congress in charge of monetary policy .
His recent book , â End the Fed , â suggests closing the central bank , presumably letting financial markets , certainly not central bankers or politicians , set interest rates .
â Politics are already part of monetary policy , â argues Paul âs press secretary , Rachel Mills .
The amendment merely aims at providing greater Fed â transparency and accountability , â she says .
The Fed is far less secretive than it was in the late 1970s , when a Monitor column , urging faster release of FOMC decisions , prompted a rebuke by then - Fed Chairman Arthur Burns .
â David , â said Dr. Burns , â that column was nât worthy of you . â
The central bank has long resisted greater scrutiny by Congress , according to a new book , â Deception and Abuse at the Fed . â Author Robert Auerbach , a former economist and investigator with the House Committee on Financial Services , details the incredible and sometimes dishonorable efforts
Fed officials have made to keep their operations secret and independent .
In an interview , he listed some shady actions : no -bid contracts , falsely telling Congress for 17 years it had no transcripts of its monetary policymaking body when it actually did , improper payments to academics totaling as much as $ 80,000 a month , leaked policy decisions to journalists and others that could be exploited in financial markets , and shredding of official records .
Mr. Auerbach talks of Fed examiners and officers in New York taking gifts , and sometimes jobs , from banks they regulate .
â Examination was a joke , â says the economist , now at the University of Texas at Austin .
More â checks and balances â are needed .
Â» UPDATE : March 20 , 2017 â
The legal team for Polanski â who has been a fugitive from U.S. justice for nearly four decades â has asked a judge to rule that their client has served more than enough time in custody for having had sex with a minor in the spring of 1977 .
In the flat light of the grand jury room , a nervous , deeply embarrassed 13 - year - old girl sat alone -- no attorney , no mother , no friend -- facing three tiers of middle - aged strangers silently studying her from their leather armchairs .
The questions that day in March 1977 were clinical in tone .
The answers would set off a furor from Hollywood to London and Paris that has yet to subside .
Advertisement
Samantha Gailey -- sandy brown hair , dimpled chin , missing class at her junior high in Woodland Hills -- described her alleged rape by director Roman Polanski two weeks before at Jack Nicholson âs home above Franklin Canyon .
She clutched a small heart charm her friend had given her .
â After he kissed you , did he say anything ? â asked the prosecutor , Roger Gunson .
â No , â the girl said .
â Did you say anything ? â
Advertisement
â No , besides I was just going , â No , come on , let âs go home .
. . .â
He said , â I âll take you home soon . â â
â Then what happened ? â
â And then he went down and started performing cuddliness . â
â What does that mean ? â
Advertisement
â It means he went down on me , or he placed his mouth on my vagina .
. . .
I was ready to cry .
I was kind of -- I was going , â No . Come on .
Stop it . â
But I was afraid . â
Samantha âs testimony that day was unequivocal :
She had kept trying to get away from him , putting her clothes back on , saying no repeatedly .
She had made up a lie about having asthma to get out of a Jacuzzi .
He persisted .
She was scared .
She did not physically fight him off .
He began to have sex with her , then , concerned she might get pregnant , switched to anal sex .
When he drove her home , he told her not to tell her mom , adding , â You know , when I first met you , I promised myself I would nât do anything like this with you . â
A generation of spectacle would follow : Polanski âs indictment , his plea deal , his flight from the country , allegations of judicial and prosecutorial misconduct , his decades of exile and critical success , his Oscar , a sympathetic HBO documentary last year , his rearrest in Switzerland last month .
Along the way , various people would scrub the core allegations into something more benign -- a probation officer would deem the crime a â spontaneous â act of â poor judgment , â a prison psychiatrist would call it â playful mutual eroticism . â

But Samantha âs stark testimony has never been seriously impugned , in or out of court .
When she sued Polanski years later for sexual assault , he pleaded the 5th when asked if he illegally gave her champagne and part of a quaalude pill , then performed oral copulation on her and sodomized her .
An extensive review of several thousand court documents , as well as numerous interviews , shows a basic dynamic defining the entire saga -- one force trying to drive debate away from a young girl âs unshaken allegations , and another trying to reel it back in .
Now with the debate renewed by his arrest , the 32 - year legal , media and cultural odyssey may finally be coming to an end .
Taking pictures
Samantha met Polanski through her mother , Susan , a television actress who had had small roles in episodes of â Starsky and Hutch â and â Police Woman . â
The director said he had an assignment to photograph young girls for a Paris fashion magazine , Vogue Hommes , and had heard about Samantha from a mutual friend .

Polanski went to her home on the afternoon of Feb. 20 and took some pictures in the hills nearby .
He picked her up again March 10 , stopped at Jacqueline Bisset âs house and , as the light was fading , went to Nicholson âs compound on Mulholland Drive .
Polanski dropped Samantha off at her home a few hours later and went about his business .
He met with Robert De Niro that evening to discuss making a movie based on a William Goldman novel , â Magic . â
The next night , a team of seven police investigators and prosecutors pulled up to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel .
Polanski was meeting friends in the lobby .
The boyish , 43 - year - old Polish director was as recognizable as any star , known not just for his movies but the extremes of his life -- the death of his mother at Auschwitz , his playboy image , the killing of his wife , Sharon Tate , and their unborn child by the Manson family .

The lead detective , Philip Vannatter , spotted him and strode up , quietly saying he had a warrant for his arrest and needed to search his room .
â We do nât want to create a sensation , â the detective said , according to Polanski âs 1984 autobiography .
Polanski asked what the charge was .
â Rape . â
Polanski led him to the suite , according to Vannatter âs grand jury testimony .
As they walked , the detective saw him pull what looked like a tablet out of his coat pocket and lower his cupped hand , as if he were going to drop it on the floor .

Vannatter opened his hand below Polanskiâs .
â Why do nât you drop it into my hand instead of the floor ? â he said .
It was a quaalude pill , marked â Rorer 714 . â
In the suite , Vannatter and his team collected cameras , lenses , film , slides and negatives , and found a small vial of prescription quaaludes .
They arrested Polanski and drove to Nicholson âs house with another search warrant .
Polanski was talking feverishly along the way .
â He was nervous as a hen on a hot rock , â Vannatter , who was later a key figure in the O.J. Simpson case , recalled this month .
â He kept asking me if he could have the quaalude back all night because he was so nervous . â

Before the grand jury
While the commotion over Polanski âs arrest raged , the detectives built their case .
Vannatter was looking to put him in prison for 15 to 20 years .
The physical evidence was strong , but not perfect .
The photos developed from Polanski âs film showed Samantha topless , drinking champagne in a Jacuzzi .
The pills matched the one she described .
A police criminalist could not find sperm in her underwear , but a chemical test indicated semen .
The doctor who examined Samantha found no bruises or tearing , but would explain that this was common when no force was involved .
The district attorney took the case to the grand jury on March 24 .
As is usual , there would be no cross-examination , no public , no media .
The 23 - member panel would decide if there was enough evidence to go to trial .
The first witness was Samantha âs mother , Susan Gailey .
Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Gunson inquired about the first photo shoot .

â Did you ask Polanski if you could go ? â
â Yes , â Gailey said .
â And he said , â No , that he would rather be alone with her because she will respond more naturally . â â
She said he and Samantha returned at dusk .
â He came in for a while , â she said .
â He drew some pictures of pirates for her . . . . â
Polanski came back a little over two weeks later , after a trip to New York .
Again , he and Samantha drove off in the late afternoon .

â When was the next time that you heard from Samantha ? â Gunson asked .
â I had a phone call at about 6 oâclock , â she began , and then paused to backtrack .
â Before she went , she had indicated to me that she did nât like him .
. . . â
Gunson cut her off .
â May that be stricken from the record ? â
â OK , â she continued .
â I asked her if she was OK .
And she said , â Uh - huh . â . . . .
And I said , â Do you want me to pick you up ? â
And she said , â No . â
And then Polanski got on the phone and he said they were at Jack Nicholson âs house , and the sun went down so fast that they did nât get very many pictures , and there was artificial light there , and a Jacuzzi there , and that they were going to take some pictures there .
. . .

â I thought , why a Jacuzzi ?
But I did nât say anything .
I mean I just did nât . â
When Samantha returned some time after 8 , she rushed to tell her mom something before Polanski walked in .
â She was kind of weird - looking .
. . .
I said , â What âs the matter ? â because I thought something was really wrong .
And she said , â I told him I had asthma because I did nât want to get in the Jacuzzi .
I just wanted you to know that . â â
Her daughter went to her bedroom to change as Polanski walked in .
Advertisement
â What did he say ? â Gunson asked .
â Asked me about her asthma . . . .
And I said , â Yeah it âs really too bad . â
And then he said , â What kind of medicine does she take for that ? â
And I said , â Oh , lot of different kinds , â just fumbling around .
. . . â
Gailey asked to see some of the photos from the previous shoot .
Polanski brought a slide viewer from the car .
She , her boyfriend , and her 20 - year - old daughter , Kim , gathered around to see .

â We looked at about five or six that were just head shots , â she said .
â And then all of the sudden there was a shot of Samantha bare to her waist with just her jeans on .
And Kim stepped back .
And I stepped back .
And the dog peed on the floor , and Kim went for the dog and threw her out .
. . .
It must have been some kind of energy thing happening because she never does that .
â And then I just sat there and thought , â Well , but I do nât want to make a scene .
. . .
So I am going to . . . be calm for minute .
. . .â
I decided not to say anything so that Samantha would not feel like she did an awful thing and cause a big scene .
I thought I would wait and get him out of the house .
. . .
â He made a phone call , and then he gave Kim a lecture about how she should nât have disciplined the dog like that .
And then he left . â
Kim testified that later that night Samantha âs boyfriend Steve came over and she heard the two of them talking about what had happened .
Kim told her mother , who called the police .

Telling of topless photos
Gunson called his key witness to the stand after lunch .
He guided Samantha through the events between meeting Polanski and being photographed by him in the chaparral above her home .
â What did Mr. Polanski say with respect to posing without anything on your top ? â he asked .
â He said , â Here , take off your top now . â
And I thought they were for the shots that you got so you do nât see anything on your shoulders . â
Advertisement
â When you returned home , did you tell your mother that he had taken photographs of you without a top ?
â No . . . .
I was just going to say I do nât want to get any more pictures taken again . â
From the three tiers , the grand jurors studied her closely , assessing her credibility , her morality .
In the front row , Jean Biegenzahn , then 48 , thought she looked like a normal young girl , much like her own 15 - year - old daughter .
â She was so scared , and here are 23 old fogies watching her , â she recalled this month .
Advertisement
Biegenzahn believed her .
Joanne Smallwood , the youngest juror at 39 , did too .
She also thought Samantha was â fast â for her age .
Samantha would later describe herself at 13 as a girl speeding out of a tomboy childhood .
She wanted to be a movie star .
â I had a 17 - year - old boyfriend who drove a Camaro , but my room was knee - deep in clothes , â she told People magazine in 1997 .
â I had a Spider - Man poster on the wall , and I kept pet rats . â
Next the prosecutor came to March 10 .
Samantha described Polanski taking more topless shots , pouring them champagne , then later offering her part of a quaalude , marked Rorer 714 .
Advertisement
â Why did you take it ? â Gunson asked .
â I do nât know .
I must have been pretty drunk or else I would nât have , â she said .
Jurors questioned her behavior .
Not only did she not physically resist Polanski , she had to admit she âd had sex before -- twice , she said -- had been drunk before , and had tried part of a quaalude before .
She continued : He wanted to take pictures in the Jacuzzi .
No one else was in the house .
She got in .
He told her to take off her underwear .
She did .
He took a few pictures , then went into the bathroom and came back naked .
He got into the deep part of the hot tub .
Advertisement
â He goes , â Come on down here . â
And I said , â No , no , I got to get out . â
And he goes , â No , come down here . â
And then I said that I had asthma and that I could nât . . . .
And he said , â Just come down here a second . â
So I finally went down .
. . .
And he goes , â Does nât it feel better down here ? â
â And he was like holding me up because it is almost over my head .
And I went , â Yeah , but I better get out . ââ
She said she wrapped a towel around her , and Polanski jumped in the pool .
â I walked over and he goes , â Get in here . â â
Advertisement
She resisted again .
He coaxed her .
She said she swam the length of the pool , got out , went to the bathroom , put on her underwear and started drying off .
â I said I wanted to go home because I needed to take my medicine .
. . .
He said , â Yeah , I âll take you home soon . â
â I was going , â No , I think I better go home , â because I was afraid .
So I just went and I sat down on the couch â â in an adjoining bedroom .
Advertisement
She said he started kissing her and then pulled off her panties .
Gunson asked her if she felt â under the influence â at the time , and why .
â Yes . . . .
I can barely remember anything that happened , â she said .
â Is there any other reason ? â
â No , I was just kind of dizzy , you know , like things were kind of blurry sometimes .
I was having trouble with my coordination , like walking and stuff . â

She said he started performing oral sex on her and then moved to intercourse .
â He goes , â Are you on the pill ? â
And I went , â No . â
And he goes , â When did you last have your period ? â
And I said , â I do nât know .
. . .
He goes , â Would you want me to go in through your back ? â
And I went , â No . â â
She said a woman -- later identified as Nicholson âs then - girlfriend , Anjelica Huston -- came home and Polanski stopped briefly to talk to her through a crack in the door .
â I got up and put my underwear on and started walking toward the door .
. . .
He sat me back down again .
. . .
Then he started to have intercourse with me again and then he just stopped . â
On the drive home , Samantha said he told her â something like , â This is our little secret . â â

The grand jury deliberated just 23 minutes .
The panel returned with an indictment of Polanski on six counts : furnishing a controlled substance to a minor , lewd and lascivious act upon child under 14 , perversion , sodomy , unlawful sexual intercourse , rape by use of drugs .
â Lack of coercion â
Polanski pleaded not guilty April 15 , and the case was transferred to the Santa Monica courtroom of Judge Laurence J. Rittenband .
In a pretrial hearing , Polanski âs attorney , Douglas Dalton , indicated that he would delve into Samantha âs sex history and seek a psychiatric evaluation of her .
â The facts indicate that before the alleged act in this case , this girl had engaged in sexual activity , â Dalton told the media .
â We want to know about it , we want to know who was involved , when .
We want to know why these other people were not prosecuted .
And this is a thing we want to fully develop . â
The European media wanted to develop this too .
They went to Samantha âs school and house , talked to her friends , trying to learn more about the girl whose allegations threatened to bring down a veritable cult figure in Europe , where Polanski was not - so - secretly dating a 15 - year - old girl , Nastassja Kinski , with no public outcry , no arrest .
Samantha was cast as the temptress .

Her attorney told the court that Samantha did not want to go through a trial .
Things were looking bleak for Polanski as well .
Vogue Hommes denied that he had any assignment , according to his autobiography .
Anjelica Huston , who could put him in the bedroom with the girl , agreed to testify against him in exchange for a cocaine possession charge against her being dropped ( from the search of Nicholson âs home ) .
The day before trial was to begin in August , the attorneys announced Polanski would plead guilty to â unlawful intercourse with a minor â in return for dropping of the more serious charges .
Samantha âs attorney , Lawrence Silver , wrote the judge urging him to accept the plea deal .
He said his client âs goal was not to seek â the incarceration of the defendant , but rather , the admission by him of wrongdoing .
. . . â

â Whatever harm has come to her as a victim would be exacerbated in the extreme if this case went to trial , â he wrote .
â A member of the media last Friday in anticipation said this case â promised to be one of the most sensational â Hollywood â trials .
. . .
This is not the place for a recovering young girl . â
Rittenband accepted the plea deal .
Vannatter was furious that Polanski was avoiding a long sentence .
Dist .
Atty .
John Van de Kamp said in a statement that the plea achieved â substantial justice â without destroying the girl âs privacy .
The plea was the first step in scrubbing Samantha âs original allegations clean .
The crime was beginning to sound like something consensual , â making love , â as Polanski would describe it in his book .
Now he had to deal only with the public relations fallout of something he did nât even view as a crime .
Advertisement
But Polanski âs legal problems were not over .
Rittenband could sentence him to up to 50 years in prison , although no one expected that .
The sentence would likely depend on what the probation officer , Irwin Gold , recommended .
The probation report scrubbed the allegations even more .
A psychiatrist , Dr. Alvin Davis , who analyzed Polanski for the report , concluded there was â transient poor judgment and loss of normal inhibitions in circumstances of intimacy and collaboration in creative work , with some coincidental alcohol and drug intoxication . â
He described the â physical maturity and willingness and provocativeness of victim , and the lack of coercion by defendant and his solicitude concerning pregnancy . â
â Incarceration , â he wrote , â would impose an unusual degree of stress and hardship because of his highly sensitive personality .
. . . â

Gold ignored the most damaging parts of Samantha âs testimony and focused on the few quotes about her hazy memory .
He was clearly impressed by the tragedies Polanski had overcome .
â The defendant has not only survived , he has prevailed . . . and has become one of the leading creative forces of the last two decades . â
In a highly unusual passage , he gushed about Hollywood .
â Possibly not since Renaissance Italy has there been such a gathering of creative minds in one locale as there has been in Los Angeles County during the past half century .
. . .
While enriching the community with their presence , they have brought with them the manners and mores of their native lands which in rare instances have been at variance with those of their adoptive land . â
His conclusion : â It is believed that incalculable emotional damage could result from incarcerating the defendant whose own life has been a seemingly unending series of punishments . â

Judge Rittenband ordered Polanski to undergo a 90 - day psychiatric study at the state prison in Chino .
Both Gunson and Dalton understood that this would be Polanski âs punishment , according to declarations they signed recently .
Polanski reported to Chino on Dec. 16 .
He was released after 42 days .
The psychiatric report , made public in a recent appellate court filing , echoed the probation report .
â There was no evidence that the offense was in any way characterized by destructive or insensitive attitude toward the victim , â wrote Philip S. Wagner , Chino âs chief psychiatrist .
â Polanski âs attitude was undoubtedly seductive , but considerate .
The relationship with his victim developed from an attitude of professionalism , to playful mutual eroticism .
. . .
Polanski seems to have been unaware at the time that he was involving himself in a criminal offense , an isolated instance of naivete , unusual in a mature , sophisticated man . â
Advertisement
Rittenband called the report a â whitewash . â
He met in chambers with Gunson and Dalton on Jan. 30 to discuss the sentencing two days later .
He told them he wanted Polanski to do more time in prison -- and then leave the country , according to the attorneys â declarations .
Rittenband said he would send him back to Chino for 48 days to complete the 90 - day stint , then release him , if Polanski agreed to voluntary deportation .
If not , he would face a longer prison term .
Dalton relayed that to his client .
Polanski left the lawyer âs office , drove to LAX and bought the last seat on the next British Airways flight to London .
The banner headline in The Times the next day : â Polanski Flees ! â

Attorney decries judge
Rittenband called a news conference in his chambers .
â The crime to which Mr. Polanski pleaded guilty was a crime of moral turpitude , and that makes him subject to deportation , â he said .
â I feel he does not belong in this country . â
On Valentine âs Day , Dalton filed a motion that the judge should be disqualified for prejudice against Polanski .
He argued that Rittenband improperly used the psychiatric study to incarcerate Polanski , that he had no authority to compel his deportation , that his public statements violated the California Rules of Judicial Conduct , and that he was letting critical media coverage , angry letters and advice from friends influence him .
Dalton told the media that day that â there is a good possibility Roman would come back if another judge is assigned to the case . â
Rittenband â categorically â denied any misconduct , but removed himself from the case â to avoid needless delays â and to encourage Polanski to return .

Polanski opted to stay in France .
Six years into his exile , in his autobiography , â Roman , by Polanski , â he laid out his version of the night at Nicholsonâs .
â We dried ourselves and each other .
She said she was feeling better .
Then , very gently , I began to kiss and caress her .
After this had gone on for some time , I led her over to the couch .
There was no doubt about the girl âs experience and lack of inhibition . â
Polanski said he was surprised to learn later that Samantha had lied about having asthma .
â Why she did so baffles me to this day . â
A settlement is reached
On a quiet court day just before New Year âs Eve 1988 , an oddly named lawsuit landed at the Santa Monica courthouse : Jane Doe vs. R. Rpolanski .
Advertisement
Samantha Gailey , then 25 and living in Kauai , was suing the director for sexual assault and battery , intentional infliction of emotional distress , negligent infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment .
The court allowed the lawsuit to stand under the false name , Rpolanski , effectively hiding it from the public .
Many of the documents are now missing , and much of the case was handled outside of court by a private judge .
But when a panel of the 2nd District Court of Appeal weighed in on the case in February 1993 , the judges referenced some interesting points .
In a footnote , they said Gailey had asked Polanski for admissions that he gave her champagne and quaaludes , had oral sex with her and sodomized her .
Polanski asserted his 5th Amendment right not to answer on the grounds that the answers â may tend to be incriminating . â
The panel also said the trial judge in the civil case â found substantial evidence of oppressive conduct by Polanski and a strong likelihood that a jury would find despicable conduct on the part of Polanski . â

Polanski settled with Gailey on Oct. 12 , 1993 .
Handwritten on a record of that day âs court proceedings were circled notations : â 250,000 + 500,000 + maybe 500,000 , â and the words â Settled â and â Confidential . â
Polanski would apparently fail to live up to the agreement , because in late 1995 Gailey âs attorney was back in court trying to collect money .
He wrote that the confidential settlement required Polanski to pay her $ 500,000 by Oct. 11 , 1995 .
With interest , he now owed her $ 601,583.87 .
Polanski âs attorney in the civil case , David Finkle , says the matter was ultimately resolved , but would not specify how .
Advertisement
The next year Samantha publicly forgave Polanski .
Using her married name , Geimer , she went on the TV show â Inside Edition â in 1997 and described what happened to her .
Geimer repeated what she told the grand jury , saying she was crying and begging him to stop , but added that he â was nât forceful or mean or anything like that . â
â It was nât rape , â she said .
The same year Polanski âs attorney met with Gunson , the prosecutor , in the chambers of Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler to discuss how the criminal case could be resolved .
Geimer wrote Fidler , urging leniency for Polanski and saying it was her opinion â that the 42 days he has already served is excessive . â
But the negotiations fell apart .

Sympathetic documentary
The latest chapter of the saga -- the one that would lead to the arrest -- began last year with the HBO documentary , â Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired , â directed by Marina Zenovich .
The film looked like the ultimate boon for the fugitive director , focusing on the allegations of misconduct against Rittenband , who died in 1993 , and raising questions about what happened in the meetings with Fidler .
Dalton told the filmmaker that Fidler was ready to hold a hearing and let Polanski go without more time in custody , but wanted the hearing televised -- a condition Polanski would nât accept .
A court spokesman , Alan Parachini , called this a â complete fabrication . â
This dispute would become another sideshow to overshadow the events of March 10 , 1977 .
Much like the probation report , the documentary sanitized the core allegations , presenting selected bits of Samantha âs grand jury testimony interspersed with Polanski âs description of what happened .
Advertisement
Samantha : â He reached over and kissed me and I was telling him , â No , you know .
. . .
Keep away . â
Polanski : â She was nât unresponsive .
There was no doubt about her experience and lack of inhibition . â
Samantha : â I was kind of dizzy , you know , like things were kind of blurry .
I can barely remember anything that happened . â
The film delved into the allegations against Rittenband .
Dalton and Gunson recalled private meetings in which the judge told them what to argue at the sentencing hearing , even as his decision was already made .
Another prosecutor , David Wells , said he was constantly in the judge âs ear about the case and planted the idea of the psychiatric study at Chino .
Advertisement
Polanski âs attorneys jumped on Wells â statements as the key basis for a full - throttle push to have the case thrown out -- their first public move in 30 years .
They had now cleared every obstacle they could .
They had the victim on their side .
They had Wells .
They had Gunson saying the judge acted in bad faith .
They even had a transcript of the filmmaker âs interview with Richard Doyle , one of current Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley âs bureau directors , saying he believed Rittenband abused his authority .
( Doyle also said he thought Polanski âs crime was â extremely calculated .
. . .
I do nât think he had any intention of doing a photo spread of the girl . â )
They filed a motion for dismissal on Dec. 8 .
Judge Peter Espinoza said in February that Polanski needed to appear in court before he would hear the evidence .
He hinted the director might have a case .
â There was substantial , it seems to me , misconduct that occurred during the pendency of this case , â Espinoza said .

Polanski âs attorneys went to the appeals court in July with a petition to order the lower court to dismiss the prosecution .
â Despite feigning offense at Mr. Polanski âs absence from California , the district attorney has never sought extradition or other relief , knowing , of course , that such relief would require litigation of the misconduct in this petition , â they wrote .
On Sept. 22 , Cooley drafted a warrant for his arrest .
Polanski , now 76 , was arrested four days later while getting off the airplane in Zurich .
Four days after that , Wells told the media he made up the stories in the documentary about Rittenband .
â I âd like to speak of it as an inept statement but the reality is that it was a lie . â

Polanski remains in custody fighting his extradition .
His attorneys said he will go bankrupt if he is held much longer .
On Tuesday , Switzerland âs top criminal court rejected Polanski âs appeal to be released on bail .
He may soon be back in Los Angeles to answer what a nervous young girl said 32 years ago .

MEDICINE HAT -
In the good times , Peter Pleskie would look at his empty industrial yard as a sign of success for his oilpatch company .
These days , neat rows of excavators , trucks and other heavy construction equipment fill the CerPro Energy Services compound west of Medicine Hat , symbolizing his sudden reversal in fortunes .
CerPro was once a rising business star , rapidly expanding to a workforce of more than 300 people in less than four years as Canada âs oilpatch flourished .
An explosion of natural gas drilling earlier this decade drove demand for his construction business at well sites , gas plants and pipelines throughout southern Alberta and southeastern Saskatchewan .
â It seemed like there was going to be no end to the boom , â says Pleskie , a welder by trade .
This week , nearly $ 20 million worth of new CerPro equipment rolled off the lot for the last time , put on the auction block after the company was pushed into bankruptcy in late June .
The equipment sold for just $ 8.2 million .
â We powered through as hard as we could , â he says .
Pleskie âs troubles stem from a dramatic slowdown in Alberta âs natural gas business , driven largely by an emerging new resource : shale gas .
This â shale gale , â as renowned oilpatch author Daniel Yergin has termed it , is relentlessly moving across North America , driven by technology that has unlocked major stores of the fuel .
And every Albertan , whether they know it or not , is caught in a downdraft , from out - of - work rig hands and rural hotel operators to white - collar executives in downtown office towers and ailing patients lined up in hospital emergency wards .
The natural gas industry â long the bedrock of Alberta âs economy â faces major threats amid a fundamental shift south of the border .
Massive stores of shale gas , once beyond the reach of engineers , are now being successfully squeezed out from under Texas and other U.S. states .
Now Medicine
Hat , the unofficial heart of Alberta âs natural gas industry for more than a century , is being battered by this shale storm , along with dozens of other Alberta communities .
The abrupt slowdown in gas exploration is swelling unemployment rolls and bankruptcies , while choking off corporate profits and money flowing into government coffers .
Lower production and weak prices have slashed the provincial government âs take from natural gas to $ 1.9 billion this year , compared to more than $ 6 billion a year ago .
The Stelmach government now faces nearly a $ 9 - billion shortfall over the next three years due to the sharp drop in royalty revenues , led downward by natural gas .
The change underscores the fact that Alberta âs oilpatch is really about natural gas , which traditionally pumps more than two - thirds of the province âs resource revenues .
But the gas windfall is evaporating faster than anyone could have imagined .
â How quickly that geological advantage has turned into a disadvantage , â says Derek Burleton , chief economist with TD Bank , who authored a study this fall on pressures facing Alberta âs gas industry .
â The concern , and rightly so , is that this could persist .
This is nât just a one or two year thing . â
The stakes are high for Alberta âs 3.6 million residents .
The province âs natural gas fuels nearly $ 40 billion in annual production â more than one - tenth of the entire economy .
The threat that Alberta âs key export could be quickly displaced by cheaper gas closer to U.S. markets is high on the minds of provincial politicians .
â Seventy per cent of our royalties are in natural gas , so we âre exceptionally vulnerable when that âs down , â says Finance Minister Iris Evans .
â It âs a concern . . . we âre strategizing and meeting with energy players . â
The dominoes have already started to fall throughout Alberta âs petro- fuelled economy .
A glut of gas in North America means prices are down for the resource .
In turn , petroleum producers have slashed spending on gas , idling hundreds of drilling rigs , putting thousands of people out of work .
Each well generates about 75 jobs , from rig hands and service crews to truck drivers who haul water to the site .
Across Alberta âs rural communities , exploration companies are spending fewer dollars on hotels and restaurants .
Capital budgets are being pruned , and head office jobs in Calgary and Edmonton have disappeared in the fallout â such as 220 positions cut this week at Talisman Energy because the company is refocusing on U.S. shale gas plays .
The provincial government is feeling the blow on another front : falling tax revenues from unemployed citizens and weaker business profits .
All these factors are coming to a head in Medicine Hat , which proudly bills itself as Canada âs â Gas City . â
Like much of Alberta , the region âs jobless rate has doubled over the past year and sat at 6.6 per cent in October .
The number of Medicine Hatters receiving employment insurance has tripled in 12 months , one of the biggest jumps in the country .
Natural gas has long fed the city âs economic success , as Medicine Hat is located over one of Canada âs most prolific gas fields .
The city - owned gas company , Prodco , controls some 4,000 wells and the utility has delivered a steady dividend to municipal coffers over the years , subsidizing civic spending and keeping property taxes among the lowest in Canada .
Last year , the company took in $ 94 million , or more than $ 1,500 for every man , woman and child in the prairie centre .
But this year , the city âs $ 24 - million dividend takes up nearly all of Prodco âs total profits of $ 32 million .
If gas prices continue to wane , something must give .
â How do you sustain this , and how do you keep in business ?
That âs the million dollar question . . . particularly when the Americans have access to a lot of natural gas , â says Mayor Norm Boucher .
Just west on the Trans - Canada Highway in Brooks , another hub for energy service companies , a similar story is unfolding .
In the past year , Dave Zukowski laid off 35 employees â 70 per cent of his staff â at his fabrication shop , where they build drilling and oilfield equipment .
Nearly all are still looking for work , he says , meaning there are fewer paycheques to support local shops , restaurants and bars .
His daughter has also been trying to land work at the local hospital , where there âs a hiring freeze .
Instead , she can only volunteer and hope a job opens .
Local drillers expect another brutal year in 2010 .
Three years ago at the zenith of Alberta âs frenetic energy boom , companies punched 5,850 gas wells into the ground in southeastern Alberta .
Next year , that number is projected to reach just 1,120 .
â We created our own monster here and we do it every cycle , â says David Hemsing , of Quinterra Drilling , another Brooks - based operation .
â We have too many drilling rigs right now â and there will be casualties . â
In Medicine Hat , the downturn has already claimed Pleskie âs business .
This spring , CerPro was nearly $ 22 million in debt and prospects for work were dwindling .
Then the bank came calling .
â We were highly leveraged , but we were doing well until the downturn .
Then , there was just not enough work , â he says .
Too young to retire at 53 , Pleskie will probably try to start over again .
He now spends his time doing chores around his home , and playing with his grandchildren .
On a cold winter morning , he slowly manoeuvres his truck through the CerPro yard , watching auctioneer staff polish up equipment for the big bankruptcy sale .
He points to a graveyard of spare parts , steel pipes and oil tanks filling the 18 - acre property , carved out of cropland just a couple of years ago .
Surveying the 16,000 - square - foot shop , Pleskie sighs , recalling the hours he and others put in to construct the facility last year .
Soon , the building will be all that âs left of CerPro once bargain - hunters scuttle off with their new auction prizes .
â It âs sad to see where it is , but it âs Alberta , â Pleskie concludes .
â It took four years to get here , there âs no reason why you ca nât do it again . â * * *
An effort to cut costs helped Nick Steinsberger unlock a century worth of natural gas trapped in Texas shale .
In the mid-1990s , the petroleum engineer was working for Mitchell Energy , a mid-size U.S. independent producer looking for new supplies for its gas plant near Fort Worth .
Steinsberger was hunting for a way to squeeze gas out of the Barnett , a formation long known to geologists , but few thought hydrocarbons could be pulled from the concrete - like formations buried more than two kilometres underground .
The Texan experimented with several expensive oilpatch techniques to fracture the rock , a process that forces a mixture of fluids , sand and other particles underground to crack the formation â and help gas flow .
But natural gas prices were low , so he floated a cheaper plan to switch to mostly water and sand , instead of foams , gels and other material .
â My recommendation did nât really go over very well , â he laughs .
â They thought I was a moron or an idiot even for suggesting it . â
He persisted and in late 1996 sunk some test wells into the stubborn shale .
â They ended up giving me three and I screwed them all up , â Steinsberger says .
The following spring , he tried again and one worked like a charm on the northeast Texas prairie .
In short order , it produced more than a million cubic feet of gas a day , about eight times the total production of an Alberta shallow gas well .
Success in the Barnett would be fully realized a few years later , as Steinsberger and others pioneered techniques that combined horizontal drilling â moving sideways into the rock after hitting a certain depth â with multiple fractures , dramatically increasing production .
It would set the stage for a transformation in the U.S. natural gas industry , as new technology tapped a geyser of supply .
â Some call it a revolution , â oilpatch experts Daniel Yergin and Robert Ineson wrote last month .
â It was not a single eureka moment , but rather the result of incremental experimentation and technical skill . â
By 2002 , a land rush was picking up in shale properties in Texas .
The techniques quickly spread , and shale gas is now being developed from Louisiana to Pennsylvania and northeast British Columbia .
Alberta holds some shale gas deposits , but they are difficult to reach and there âs been limited development .
After years of falling American gas production â offset by rising Canadian imports â the U.S. now has a huge supply right under some of its biggest markets .
U.S. natural gas resources have jumped 60 per cent in the past four years alone â mostly due to shale gas finds .
â If anything , the trend suggests that âs likely to grow , not shrink , â says Sara Banaszak , senior economist for the American Petroleum Institute , the industry âs main lobbying organization in the U.S.
â It really changes the outlook for the United States .
Not just the size of the resource , but the variety of locations where the natural gas from shale can be found . â
One massive shale formation in particular , the Marcellus , sits right on the doorstep of high - demand markets in the U.S. northeast .
Canadian gas , which has fuelled about 20 per cent of U.S. demand , is now on the outside , displaced from the lucrative market .
The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates the shale resource could make the country self - sufficient in natural gas supply by 2030 .
While this may be good news for our southern neighbours , such a shift threatens the long - term viability of Alberta âs gas business .
Yet , there are still many questions about the longevity of shale plays , which come on strong but taper off quickly .
Production from a shale well can drop 65 to 90 per cent in the first year .
â They assume shale is this big monster that âs growing out of control , and it âs not , â cautions Richard Moorman , manager of strategic analysis at Southwestern Energy Company , a Houston - based shale gas producer .
U.S. shale producers also face growing environmental opposition amid concerns that rapid development could contaminate drinking water supplies due to the fracturing .
Some jurisdictions , including New York State , are looking at halting drilling near watersheds and other regulations that may limit future development .
Still , this explosion of supply is weighing heavily on gas prices , the main damper on drilling activity in Alberta .
After completing nearly 6,700 gas wells in the entire province last year , crews will likely work on fewer than 3,100 in 2009 , according to industry forecasts .
So far this year , natural gas prices have averaged around $ 4 a gigajoule , only half of the way toward profitability for most Alberta wells .
Put simply , shale wells are far more economic than the conventional natural gas wells that make up the bulk of Alberta âs geology .
â That âs where the threat to the Alberta industry is , â says Wilf Gobert , an independent energy analyst and chairman of Calgary Economic Development .
Alberta gas pools are â small reservoirs , they are small targets and they tend to be high cost and need high price , â Gobert adds .
Faced with such dollars - and - cents decisions , the province âs largest petroleum producers have cut Alberta spending and shut in gas .
EnCana Corp. , Canada âs largest natural gas producer , has shifted more money toward shale plays in Louisiana and Horn River , in northeastern B.C. The Calgary - based company drilled about 1,400 wells around Medicine Hat last year , down from 2,000 in 2007 .
â Alberta has lost some of its market share .
It âs share of the pie has shrunk over the past couple of years , â says Richard Dunn , vice - president of regulatory and government affairs for the company âs Foothills Division .
A well in southeast Alberta âs shallow gas may be cheap to drill â under $ 400,000 â but the production averages less than 150,000 cubic feet a day .
Shale wells in the company âs Haynesville , La. , play can cost $ 10 million , but pump out about eight million cubic feet a day .
U.S. shale is the major competitor for Alberta âs natural gas industry , say provincial officials .
â We have to accept the ( shale ) gas is there and it âs going to be found , â says Alberta âs Treasury Board president Lloyd Snelgrove .
The shale explosion south of the border also ripples through Alberta âs vast pipeline network , built to transport the province âs gas resources to U.S. markets .
Falling Alberta production now means less gas is moving through those pipes .
Operators like TransCanada Corp. , the country âs largest shipper , are musing about seeking a nearly 50 per cent increase in shipping costs on its main pipeline .
Higher tolls could ultimately lead to even less gas production .
Those tolling costs will likely come back down as volumes return â in part due to rising shale production in B.C. , say pipeline officials , although that might take three to five years .
But do nât expect activity to return to its frantic pace of the past few boom years , says TransCanada CEO Hal Kvisle .
â The structural shift that âs occurring in Alberta is deteriorating geological prospectivity , rather than the impact of U.S. shale gas .
That âs the real problem here , â he says .
â The chance of finding a big gas pool in Alberta are getting more remote all the time .
The geology is wearing out , it âs getting to be a tired basin , and this is nât really unexpected .
It âs just what happens after places are largely drilled up . â * * * Larry Campbell feels the repercussions of the shale gas revolution on two fronts .
Last fall , the Innisfail resident was laid off after a two - decade career selling drill bits .
He âs also been dealing with Alberta âs crowded hospitals as he helps care for his adult daughter Devie , who is struggling with complications from Chron âs disease .
Navigating through the province âs cash - strapped medical system to find a room has nât been easy .
â We âre keeping our fingers crossed that her kidneys do nât fail , â says Campbell , getting some fresh air in front the Medicine Hat Regional Hospital .
â We still do nât have a complete diagnosis .
We âve had quite a few doctors in Calgary and Medicine Hat . â
Devie started having trouble two months ago and was admitted to hospital in Medicine Hat , where she lives .
She had to be transferred to Calgary Foothills , but they waited three weeks to see a specialist .
Then she was moved back to Medicine Hat , where it seems just as busy .
The Gas City has long lobbied for an expansion of the health care facility , with about 325 hospital beds serving a growing regional population of about 120,000 .
No one questions the need .
The hospital has nât been renovated in more than 25 years and one wing has been mothballed .
Only one operating room is big enough to accommodate necessary modern equipment for some key procedures .
â I know Alberta is hurting medically , â says Campbell .
â Medicine Hat hospital covers a large area â southern Alberta into Saskatchewan â and they sure could use a bigger hospital .
â It âs a busy , busy place . â
Twenty - two months ago , as the clock ticked down on a provincial election call , the Stelmach government gave the green light to the badly needed expansion , delighting Medicine Hatters who had been waiting years for the news .
It was part of a string of spending announcements that included a half dozen new schools in Calgary and seven new long - term care facilities throughout Alberta .
At that time , the government was staring at an $ 8 - billion surplus thanks to an energy bonanza that seemed to overwhelm the province âs plans .
Now , it âs wrestling with the biggest deficit in Alberta history as natural gas revenues collapse .
The pressure is on .
The $ 280 - million hospital expansion in Medicine Hat was postponed this year due to the province âs money squeeze , along with funding for seniors â homes and other facilities throughout Alberta .
In Grande Prairie , previously announced plans for a new $ 250 - million hospital have bogged down due to the cash crunch .
In Fort Macleod , plans for a multimillion dollar police college have also been delayed .
And the province âs health board deficit could grow next year by as much as $ 1 billion as it continues to axe staff and trim costs .
Still , the workload grows at Medicine Hat âs hospital .
Nearby Brooks had to close its maternity ward recently , sending expectant moms an hour - drive down the highway to give birth .
Carol Secondiak , former chairwoman of Palliser Health Board who pushed for the expansion of Medicine Hat âs hospital , said the building was already out of space .
Now , it âs fielding more patients from a wider area .
Without more cash , though , the province says it ca nât afford to start building .
â What has been an overtaxed , overused facility has another 25,000 people thrown at it , â laments Secondiak , a nurse who runs her own Brooks - based medical business .
â The hospital is in dire need of expansion . â
It âs not just Alberta âs health care feeling the crunch .
Every provincial department is under the microscope , as the government tries to slash $ 2 billion in spending next year .
As the Rachel Maddow Show has recently showcased , on December 16th the Family Research Council sponsored a " Prayercast " event , attended by GOP luminaries including Senators Jim DeMint and Sam Brownback , and House Representatives Michelle Bachmann and Randy Forbes .
But FRC head Tony Perkins did not lead the prayer event .
That honor fell to Lou Engle , Founder of TheCall .
Besides leading the capstone stadium rally for pro-Proposition 8 , antigay marriage organizers last November 1 , 2008 at San Diego 's Qualcomm Stadium , Lou Engle could also be found , at a special ceremony at a Virginia Beach megachurch last summer , anointing and blessing GOP presidential hopefuls Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich .
Is Lou Engle the Republican Party 's new , semi-official prayer leader ?
IO might seem so , and that 's notable for many reasons - not the least of which is that Engle appears to condone , if not encourage , religious terrorism and has stated that homosexuals are gay because they are possessed by demon spirits .
In previous stories [ 1 , 2 ]
I 've detailed Lou Engle 's political extremity - video from a November 1 , 2008 TheCall event shows Engle onstage at San Diego 's Qualcomm Stadium calling for acts of Christian martyrdom to stop legal abortion and gay marriage .
Engle has forecast that legalized abortion will lead to a second American civil war and appeared , in the documentary " Jesus Camp , " alongside Becky Fischer - who specializes in evangelizing children and has stated she would like Christian children to learn to be as dedicated as Hamas suicide bombers .

Below is an extended excerpt from my December 17 , 2009 story
GOP Senators Appear on TV With Anti-gay , Anti-abortion Christian Martyrdom Advocate :
Is the GOP becoming the party of violent Christian martyrdom ?
Apparently , Jim DeMint , Sam Brownback , Michelle Bachmann and Randy Forbes were n't deterred by the fact that Lou Engle has publicly made statements which resemble rhetoric deployed during the 1990's , by leaders of the anti-abortion movement , that helped incite domestic terrorism .
But they were n't alone :
Engle , who has publicly called for acts of Christian martyrdom , could be found last summer blessing and anointing Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee at a Virginia Beach megachurch .
Engle represents a religious right tendency that had become so dominant that known potentates such as James Dobson and Tony Perkins travel to Engle 's TheCall events - such as the San Diego stadium rally which served as the capstone to the successful anti-gay marriage Proposition Eight push in California .
Engle 's religious movement has also played a significant role in inspiring , and even organizing , legislators who pushed the pending , draconian anti-gay legislation in Uganda that some have described as a " kill the gays " bill .
Lou Engle is a leader in a religious tendency , rapidly becoming the new face of the religious right , which welcomes women and minorities but features an ideology just as politically and ideologically extreme as that of the bigoted , nativist branch of the Christian right that Engle 's tendency will soon overshadow .
Engle has described his movement as an " underground church " and he has stated , in an interview for a documentary video about his movement ,
" Right now they have n't seen the true church .
There 's an underground church that the world has no idea that exists .
Once they get the stage , it 's over with . "
While the American left has heavily focused on the Tea Party movement , leaders in Engle 's arising tendency , which I 've described as the The Rainbow Right , wield major electoral influence with minority groups and can infiltrate Washington - based Democrat " centrist " , " common ground " efforts with ease .
Four of the Christian leaders appearing in the " PrayerCast " event alongside Brownback and DeMint played dominant roles in a two and a half hour , key motivational and planning conference call , held July 30th , 2008 , for leaders of the Christian right who organized the successful campaign to block gay marriage in Arizona , Florida , and California .
Those leaders are : Jim Garlow , Bishop Harry Jackson , Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council , and Lou Engle of TheCall .
Engle 's operation was so central to the California pro-Prop 8 drive that one of the four campaign timeline maps , distributed to members of that July 30th , 2008 conference call detailing major elements and events for the anti-gay marriage campaigns in AZ , FL , and CA , was dedicated solely to TheCall 's effort in California .
[ below : map / timeline for TheCall 's pro-Prop 8 effort in CA ]
Founder of TheCall Lou Engle has predicted that legal abortion will lead to a second civil war .
And , as I 've previously noted , the runaway hit documentary Jesus Camp , by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady , featured footage of an Engle appearance at Becky Fischer 's former summer camp for Christian children .
In Jesus Camp Fischer states her desire to indoctrinate children to be as dedicated as Hamas suicide bombers [ see here for relevant footage of Engle at TheCall and Fischer , from Jesus Camp ] .
Lou Engle 's son Jesse Engle specializes in casting out gay " demons " and has established a ministry in San Fransisco , which Lou Engle has described as a place " where the homosexuals boast the dominion of darkness . "
In the early 1980's , KKK and Aryan Nations strategist Louis Beam helped popularize a tactic known as " leaderless resistance " in which high profile propagandists would incite terrorist acts carried out by autonomous individuals and cell groups .
During the 1990's leaders of the Army of God , wielding militant anti-abortion rhetoric , helped inspire terrorist bombings of abortion clinics and the assassination of doctors who provided abortions .
Now , a decade later , one can hear such incitement coming from the stage at Lou Engle 's TheCall events , which Engle 's group holds in stadiums not just in the United States but around the world too , in Australia , Germany , the Philippines , Norway , England , Jerusalem and Brazil .
Over the last two decades , the American Christian right has gone truly global and established power centers in the developing world which now lend support to the long march , in the United States , towards extending Christian dominion over key sectors of society such as government , business and finance , education , media , and religion .
Engle 's role as leader of TheCall has now received some mainstream media notice but the source of his influence is still largely unknown .
Lou Engle serves , alongside Sarah Palin 's prayer group leader Mary Glazier , on the Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders , one of the key leadership groups wielding influence over a sprawling , global new incarnation of the religious right known as the New Apostolic Reformation .
As detailed in a recent Talk To Action report , Peter Wagner 's New Apostolic Reformation has played a major role in inspiring and organizing Ugandan legislators behind the draconian " kill the gays " bill before Uganda 's parliament .
Peter Wagner was advisor for Rick Warren 's dissertation for a Doctorate of Ministry from Fuller Theological Seminary .
In a mid-December statement from Rick Warren , Letter To Uganda 's Pastors , Rick Warren lied about his connection to Wagner and made strange disclaimers that would seem to have been in reaction to the December 4th , 2009 Talk To Action report and also to YouTube videos [ 1 , 2 ] from this author , showcasing Warren 's penchant for urging Christians to be as devoted to Jesus as the followers of Hitler , Lenin , and Mao were to their respective leaders .
In the unusual statement , Warren writes both the question , below ( in bold type ) and the response :
Brooklyn , New York is suffering a large outbreak of mumps right now .
There have been 600 cases either confirmed or suspected in the past few months .
Compare that to the fewer than 300 cases total on average in the entire United States over the course of a whole year and you 'll see that this is clearly a major outbreak .
Interestingly , the population affected is overwhelmingly comprised of orthodox Jews .
That surprised me ; I did n't know of any prohibitions against vaccinations in Jewish culture , and after some research have determined that there is none -- in fact , vaccinations appear to be taken very seriously in Jewish teachings , and there have been times that rabbis have allowed people to get vaccinated even on the Sabbath !
However , the report linked above indicates vaccination rates in that area of NYC are lower than the national average , about 80 % .
It 's not clear why .
[ UPDATE : I have been informed of an article online that indicates that many of the parents did not vaccinate their children ...
... because of their religious beliefs .
But local religious leaders said there is nothing in Jewish law that prohibits vaccination .
" That 's ridiculous , " said Rabbi David Eidensohn , a frequent Orthodox Jewish commentator on family issues .
" Any parent who does n't get their child vaccinated is being foolish and endangering the entire community . "
Swell . ]
A similar outbreak occurred in a Jewish community in Antwerp , Belgium in 2007 - 2008 .
In that case , a large number of the parents of unvaccinated children all went to the same physician , who " was opposed to vaccination " .
Nice work , doc !
A vaccination campaign was quickly set up to prevent the outbreak from spreading ; together with a high overall rate of vaccination in Antwerp ( 94 % ! ) this appears to have worked in stemming the tide of the outbreak there .
Most vaccination rates need to be at 90 % or higher to provide herd immunity -- where enough people are vaccinated that the potentially infectious disease in question basically does n't have a place to live .
Lower rates mean more people can host the bug , and an outbreak can occur .
Worse , the mumps vaccine ( usually given together with a measles and rubella vaccination , the so - called MMR shot ) has a somewhat lower immunization rate of 80 % effectiveness after one dose ( that is , 80 % of people receiving the shot develop immunity after that one dose -- which is why two doses are recommended ) .
That means herd rates must be higher to prevent outbreaks .
The outbreak in NYC has been traced to an infected child who was visiting the area from the UK .
Vaccination rates in the UK are lower , in large part due to the antivax scare started by Andrew Wakefield and his now - discredited study linking vaccines to other illnesses .
There have been over 6000 cases of mumps in the UK this year so far ( not even including the last quarter of 2009 ) -- 6000 , more than twenty times the cases we get in the US , and we have five times the population here .
All those thousands of kids suffering through mumps -- and potential deafness , encephalitis , meningitis , orchitis in boys , and ovarian swelling in girls -- because of the antivaxxers and their misinformation campaign .
The good news here is that enough people are vaccinated in the Brooklyn area to prevent this from becoming an epidemic .
It 's clear there would be many more cases if that were n't the case .
As always , do n't listen to the lies of the antivax movement .
Go to your board - certified physician an ask them about vaccinations , and do the research yourself .
Get the truth .

Last summer , the BBC tried to sneak " digital rights management " into its high - def digital broadcasts .
Now , generally speaking , the BBC is n't allowed to encrypt or restrict its broadcasts : the licence fee payer pays for these broadcasts , and no licence fee payer woke up today wishing that the BBC had added restrictions to its programming .
But the BBC tried to get around this , asking Ofcom for permission to encrypt the " metadata " on its broadcasts â including the assistive information used by deaf and blind people and the " tables " used by receivers to play back the video .
The BBC couched this as a minor technical change , and Ofcom held a very short , very quiet consultation , but was overwhelmed by a flood of negative submissions from the public and from technologists who understood the implications of this move .
Fundamentally , the BBC is trying to leverage its broadcast licence into control over the devices that can receive broadcasts .
That is , in addition to deciding what shows to put on the air , the Beeb wants the power to decide what kinds of tellies and set - top boxes will be able to display and record those shows â and it wants the power to control the design of all the devices that might be plugged into a TV or set - top box .
This is an unprecedented amount of power for a broadcaster to have .
As Ofcom gears up to a second consultation the issue , there 's one important question that the BBC must answer if the implications of this move are to be fully explored , namely :
How can free / open source software co-exist with a plan to put DRM on broadcasts ?
A brief backgrounder on how this system is meant to work : the BBC will encrypt a small , critical piece of the signal .
To get a key to decrypt the scrambled data , you will need to sign onto an agreement governed by a consortium called the Digital Transmission Licensing Administrator ( some of the agreement is public , but other parts are themselves under seal of confidentiality , which means that the public literally is n't allowed to know all the terms under which BBC signals will be licensed ) .
DTLA licenses a wide variety of devices to move , display , record , and make limited copies of video .
Which programmes can be recorded , how many copies , how long recordings can last and other restrictions are set within the system .
To receive a licence , manufacturers must promise to honour these restrictions .
Manufacturers also must promise to design their devices so that they will not pass video onto unapproved or unlicenced devices â only DTLA - approved boxes can touch or manipulate or play the video .
DTLA enforces these rules through a system of penalties for non-compliant vendors .
It also has the power to " revoke " devices after they are sold to you , so that the BBC 's signals will refuse to play on your set - top box if the DTLA determines that its security is inadequate and they pass it a revocation message ( even though you always used your box in accordance with the law ) .
With DTLA devices , the integrity and usefulness of your home theatre is subject to the ongoing approval of the consortium , and they can switch it off if they decide , at any time in the future , that they do n't trust it any more .
The entire DTLA system relies on the keys necessary to authenticate devices and unscramble video being kept secret , and on the rules governing the use of keys being inviolable .
To that end , the DTLA " Compliance and Robustness Agreement " ( presented as " Annex C " to the DTLA agreement ) has a number of requirements aimed at ensuring that every DTLA - approved device is armoured against user modification .
Keys must be hidden .
Steps must be taken to ensure that the code running on the device is n't modified .
Failure to take adequate protection against user modification will result in DTLA approval being withheld or revoked .
This is where the conflict with free / open source software arises .
Free / open source software , such as the GNU / Linux operating system that runs many set - top boxes , is created cooperatively among many programmers ( thousands , in some cases ) .
Unlike proprietary software , such as the Windows operating system or the iPhone 's operating system , free software authors publish their code and allow any other programmer to examine it , make improvements to it , and publish those improvements .
This has proven to be a powerful means of quickly building profitable new businesses and devices , from the TomTomGo GPSes to Google 's Android phones to the Humax Freeview box you can buy tonight at Argos for around Â£ 130 .
Because it can be adapted by anyone , free software is an incredible source of innovative new ideas .
Because it can be used without charge , it has allowed unparalleled competition , dramatically lowering the cost of entering electronics markets .
In short , free software is good for business , it 's good for the public , it 's good for progress , and it 's good for competition .
But free software is bad for DTLA compliance .
Free software is intended to be examined and modified by all comers .
Generally , the licence terms for free software require that it is licensed for public examination and adaptation .
It is literally impossible for a device to be both " open " and for it to prevent its users from retrieving keys hidden in its guts , or from changing the code that runs on it .
This , of course , is totally incompatible with the DTLA requirement to hide keys and prevent modification of code .
And so , when the BBC threatens to infect its high - def broadcasts with DTLA , it also threatens to remove free / open software from consideration for any device that can play , record , or manipulate the video that the licence fee pays for .
It means that you can't use a GNU / Linux phone to watch a show , or an open video player like VLC on your laptop .
It means that your kids can't use free / open video - editing software to cut some of last night 's news into a presentation for class .
It means that British entrants into the DTV device market can't avail themselves of the free software that their competitors all over the world are using , and will have to spend fortunes reinventing the wheel , creating operating systems and programs that do the same things as their free counterparts , but in such a way as to enforce restrictions against the device 's owner .
Ofcom is meant to guard the public interest in matters such as these .
If the public interest is to be upheld here , the BBC must explain how it intends to do the impossible : add DRM without banning free / open source development .
European legislators and countries struck a deal last night to introduce tough new energy - efficiency regulations for all electricity - using appliances and buildings within the next decade .
Most significantly , the European Union directive will require that nearly all buildings , including large houses , constructed after 2020 include stark efficiency improvements or generate most of their energy from renewable sources , coming close to " nearly zero " energy use .
European countries will also be required to establish a certification system to measure buildings ' energy efficiency .
These certificates will be required for any new construction or buildings that are sold or rented to new tenants .
Existing buildings will also have to , during any major renovation , improve their efficiency if at all feasible .
Buildings are responsible for about 36 percent of Europe 's greenhouse gas emissions , and stricter efficiency requirements have been sought for the past several years as absolutely necessary for the bloc to meets its goal of cutting emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
Other regions should take note , said Andris Piebalgs , the E.U. energy commissioner , in a statement .
" By this agreement , the E.U. is sending a strong message to the forthcoming climate negotiations in Copenhagen , " Piebalgs said .
" Improving the energy performance of buildings is a cost effective way of fighting against climate change and improving energy security , while also boosting the building sector and the E.U. economy as a whole . "
A second directive agreed on yesterday will expand the scope of efficiency labeling to all consumer products that use energy , eventually covering everything from hot water taps to vending machines .
Most prominently , all electricity - using appliances for the home will have to be accompanied by an efficiency rating -- from a green " A " to a red " G " -- in any advertisement that touts price or energy savings .
The rule is meant to raise consumer awareness of the gradient in energy savings available when purchasing televisions , freezers and washing machines , for example .
In the future , these labels will also be attached to industrial products , such as cold storage rooms , display cabinets or vending machines .
The labels will also apply to products that have indirect energy costs , including construction products like window glazing and frames , or exterior doors .
Striking a deal on the efficiency package has been one of the most important goals of the Swedish presidency of the European Union , which ends next month .
By strengthening efficiency requirements , Europe could reduce greenhouse gas emissions equal to 70 percent of its Kyoto targets and save each household about â¬300 a year in energy bill expenses .
Few hurdles now remain for the directives , which are expected to be formally approved by the European Parliament early next year .
Once adopted , E.U. countries will have two years to write the directives into their domestic laws .

DETROIT -- Nothing has changed with Detroit Red Wings defenseman Andreas Lilja 's status .
He continues to practice , but persistent headaches prevent him from playing .
" Right now , it 's starting to get on my nerves , " Lilja said .
" A couple of months I can take , but now , we 're passing on 10 months . "
Lilja has been out since Feb. 28 because of concussion - like symptoms .
He can't play until he is symptom - free for an extended period .
" I see our chiropractor .
I feel good every time I step out of his office and wake up the next morning and ( the headache ) is still there , " Lilja said .
" I do n't know what to do .
Maybe the best thing would be to just take off until it settles .
" It does n't get worse when I skate or work out .
It does n't matter what I do .
I could be home , laying on the couch and all the sudden get headaches .
Just have to figure it out . "
There âs a lot of dismay / rage on the left over Obama , a number of cries that he is nât the man progressives thought they were voting for .
But that says more about the complainers than it does about Obama himself .
If you actually paid attention to the substance of what he was saying during the primary , you realized that
( a) There was nât a lot of difference among the major Democratic contenders
( b) To the extent that there was a difference , Obama was the least progressive
Now it âs true that many progressives were ardent Obama supporters , with their ardency mixed in with a fair bit of demonization of Hillary Clinton .
And maybe they were right â but not on policy grounds .
( I still remember people angrily telling me that if Hillary got in , she âd fill her economics team with Rubinites ) .
So what you âre getting is what you should have seen .
And exactly what should we blame Obama for ?
Here âs how I see it .
I still believe that Obama could have gotten a bigger stimulus .
Yes , he needed some Senate â centrists â , but my read is that they were determined to take a slice off whatever he proposed â so he could have proposed more and gotten more .
It was very different from health care , where it was really about policy rather than essentially arbitrary numbers .
Obama could definitely have taken a harder line with banks .
Obama could also have done a lot more to change the discourse â less hope and change and let âs end the partisan bickering , more conservatives have the wrong ideas and we need to undo the damage .
But on health care , I do nât see how he could have gotten much more .
How could he have made Joe Lieberman less , um , Liebermanish ?
And I have to say that much as I disagree with Ben Nelson about many things , he has seemed refreshingly honest , at least in the final stages , about what he will and wo nât accept .
Meanwhile the fact is that Republicans have formed a solid bloc of opposition to Obama âs ability to do , well , anything .
Some of my commenters have argued that even with this bill Democrats may well lose seats next year â possibly even more than they would have without it .
Definitely on the first point ; on the second , I do nât think people realize just how damaging it would be if Obama did nât get any major reforms passed .
But in any case , that misses the point .
The reason to pass reform , even inadequate reform , now is nât to gain seats next year ; it is to pass reform , which will do vast good , during the window that âs available .
If it does nât pass now , it will probably be many nears before the next chance .
But back to Obama : the important thing to bear in mind is that this is nât about him ; and , equally important , it is nât about you .
If you âve fallen out of love with a politician , well , so what ?
You should just keep working for the things you believe in .

Portland , OR - 18 Nov 2009 : Today at SC 09 , the supercomputing conference , Today at SC 09 , the supercomputing conference , IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) announced significant progress toward creating a computer system that simulates and emulates the brain âs abilities for sensation , perception , action , interaction and cognition , while rivaling the brain âs low power and energy consumption and compact size .
The cognitive computing team , led by IBM Research , has achieved significant advances in large - scale cortical simulation and a new algorithm that synthesizes neurological data -- two major milestones that indicate the feasibility of building a cognitive computing chip .
BlueMatter , a new algorithm created in collaboration with Stanford University , exploits the Blue Gene supercomputing architecture in order to noninvasively measure and map the connections between all cortical and sub-cortical locations within the human brain using magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging .
Mapping the wiring diagram of the brain is crucial to untangling its vast communication network and understanding how it represents and processes information .
Scientists , at IBM Research - Almaden , in collaboration with colleagues from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab , have performed the first near real - time cortical simulation of the brain that exceeds the scale of a cat cortex and contains 1 billion spiking neurons and 10 trillion individual learning synapses .
Additionally , in collaboration with researchers from Stanford University , IBM scientists have developed an algorithm that exploits the Blue GeneÂ® supercomputing architecture in order to noninvasively measure and map the connections between all cortical and sub-cortical locations within the human brain using magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging .
Mapping the wiring diagram of the brain is crucial to untangling its vast communication network and understanding how it represents and processes information .
These advancements will provide a unique workbench for exploring the computational dynamics of the brain , and stand to move the team closer to its goal of building a compact , low - power synaptronic chip using nanotechnology and advances in phase change memory and magnetic tunnel junctions .
The team âs work stands to break the mold of conventional von Neumann computing , in order to meet the system requirements of the instrumented and interconnected world of tomorrow .
As the amount of digital data that we create continues to grow massively and the world becomes more instrumented and interconnected , there is a need for new kinds of computing systems â imbued with a new intelligence that can spot hard - to - find patterns in vastly varied kinds of data , both digital and sensory ; analyze and integrate information real - time in a context - dependent way ; and deal with the ambiguity found in complex , real - world environments .
Businesses will simultaneously need to monitor , prioritize , adapt and make rapid decisions based on ever - growing streams of critical data and information .
A cognitive computer could quickly and accurately put together the disparate pieces of this complex puzzle , while taking into account context and previous experience , to help business decision makers come to a logical response .
â Learning from the brain is an attractive way to overcome power and density challenges faced in computing today , â said Josephine Cheng , IBM Fellow and lab director of IBM Research - Almaden .
â As the digital and physical worlds continue to merge and computing becomes more embedded in the fabric of our daily lives , it âs imperative that we create a more intelligent computing system that can help us make sense the vast amount of information that 's increasingly available to us , much the way our brains can quickly interpret and act on complex tasks . â
To perform the first near real - time cortical simulation of the brain that exceed the scale of the cat cortex , the team built a cortical simulator that incorporates a number of innovations in computation , memory , and communication as well as sophisticated biological details from neurophysiology and neuroanatomy .
This scientific tool , akin to a linear accelerator or an electron microscope , is a critical instrument used to test hypotheses of brain structure , dynamics and function .
The simulation was performed using the cortical simulator on Lawrence Livermore National Lab âs Dawn Blue Gene / P supercomputer with 147,456 CPUs and 144 terabytes of main memory .
The algorithm , when combined with the cortical simulator , allows scientists to experiment with various mathematical hypotheses of brain function and structure of how structure affects function as they work toward discovering the brain âs core computational micro and macro circuits .
After the successful completion of Phase 0 , IBM and its university partners were recently awarded $ 16.1 M in additional funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) for Phase 1 of DARPA âs Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics ( SyNAPSE ) initiative .
This phase of research will focus on the components , brain - like architecture and simulations to build a prototype chip .
The long - term mission of IBM âs cognitive computing initiative is to discover and demonstrate the algorithms of the brain and deliver low - power , compact cognitive computers that approach mammalian - scale intelligence and use significantly less energy than today âs computing systems .
The world - class team includes researchers from several of IBM âs worldwide research labs and scientists from Stanford University , University of Wisconsin - Madison , Cornell University , Columbia University Medical Center and University of California - Merced .
â The goal of the SyNAPSE program is to create new electronics hardware and architecture that can understand , adapt and respond to an informative environment in ways that extend traditional computation to include fundamentally different capabilities found in biological brains , â said DARPA program manager Todd Hylton , Ph.D .
Modern computing is based on a stored program model , which has traditionally been implemented in digital , synchronous , serial , centralized , fast , hardwired , general - purpose circuits with explicit memory addressing that indiscriminately over - write data and impose a dichotomy between computation and data .
In stark contrast , cognitive computing â like the brain â will use replicated computational units , neurons and synapses that are implemented in mixed - mode analog - digital , asynchronous , parallel , distributed , slow , reconfigurable , specialized and fault - tolerant biological substrates with implicit memory addressing that only update state when information changes , blurring the boundary between computation and data .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The government has spent trillions to rescue the banking system from the brink of disaster , but the biggest cost may be the loss in the government 's credibility from an understandably distrustful and angry public , according to a quarterly report released Wednesday by the congressional watchdog over the bank bailout .
" The anger , cynicism and distrust created must be chalked up as one of the substantial , albeit unnecessary costs " of the Troubled Asset Relief Program , said Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the TARP , in a report to Congress .
Read the report .
Barofsky argued that the Treasury and other agencies have n't done nearly enough to be open to the public about what they are doing and why .
Other critics have an even - harsher appraisal .
" This administration has not gone anywhere close to far enough to reform the banking sector , " said former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer , in an interview on CNN .
" Tim Geithner had all the negotiating power in the world ; he did n't use it .
Tim Geithner continues to be the voice of Wall Street , not Main Street , " Spitzer said , referring to man who is now Treasury secretary and served as president of the New York Fed during last fall 's crisis .
In his report , Barofsky said the $ 699 billion TARP program had accomplished much of what it was intended to do when it was approved by Congress last October .
Of the $ 699 billion , $ 317 billion is still available .
The administration announced plans Wednesday to spend some of that money to boost lending to small businesses through community banks .
" There are significant signs of improvement in the stability of the financial system , " he said , adding that TARP and the other measures by federal agencies to shore up the foundations of the system " played a significant role in bringing the system back from the brink of collapse . "
Not all is well in the financial system or in the economy , he said , noting risks of increased foreclosures , rising unemployment and the threat from bad loans in the commercial real estate sector .
However , the successes must be weighed against the costs , which Barofsky said would be " substantial " in three broad categories .
The direct costs that can be seen on the government 's balance sheet , and two intangible costs that cannot be measured directly : the increase in moral hazard and the blow to the government 's credibility .
Barofsky spoke as congressional committees continued work on legislation that would reform and repair the way the financial system is regulated , in an attempt to make sure the financial crisis of 2007 , 2008 and 2009 cannot be repeated .
See full story .
On the direct costs , Barofsky said " it is extremely unlikely that the taxpayers will see a full return on their TARP investments . "
Although some of the banks have repaid the money they were given , with interest , some of the TARP programs , such as mortgage modification or the investments in General Motors and Chryslers and in American International Group Inc. will never be repaid in full .
The costs of moral hazard have yet to be tallied .
Much depends on whether regulatory reform legislation will find a way to eliminate the explicit taxpayer guarantee that big banks now enjoy .
" The firms that were ' too big to fail ' last October are in many cases bigger still , many as a result of government - supported and - sponsored mergers , " the report said .
( " Moral hazard " refers to the problem that any guarantee or insurance is bound to increase risky behavior , because the costs of failure will be paid by someone else . )
" Absent meaningful regulatory reform , TARP runs the risk of merely re-animating markets that had collapsed under the weight of reckless behavior , " Barofsky said .
Reform of the rating agencies is particularly crucial .
Barofsky reserved his strongest language for the third cost , the public 's growing distrust of government .
He said government 's ability to act in crises depends on its credibility with the market and with the public , whose political support was crucial .
" Unfortunately , several decisions by the Treasury ... have served only to damage the government 's credibility and thus the long - term effectiveness of TARP , " he said .
The belief that " Treasury is just too closely aligned with the interests of Wall Street are only reinforced by Treasury 's failures of transparency , " Barofsky said .
Thieves have stolen Lara Bingle 's $ 300,000 Aston Martin , bought for her last Christmas by her fiance , cricketer Michael Clarke .
While Clarke was in Melbourne yesterday celebrating Australia 's win in the Boxing Day Test match , it was the missing luxury car that Bingle - who starred in the controversial " Where the bloody hell are you " tourism advert - was yearning for .
Lara Bingle and Michael Clarke ... now without their Aston Martin .
" Aston GONE .... KARMA , " she wrote on Twitter .
" What a way to start a new year ... I want it back . "
Megan McArdle expresses a sentiment many people share when it comes to weighing the importance of Climategate to the larger questions about climate change :
I am thoroughly unimpressed with the belief that global warming scientists have been engaging in some kind of massive conspiracy to conceal the truth .
I agree with this , though possibly not for the same reason as McArdle .
To me , the problem appears to be partially a matter of semantic hesitancy :
We are loathe to assume a conspiracy theory because conspiracy theorists have given conspiracy theories a bad name .
To even hint that a broad conspiracy has occurred shifts the focus from the truth of the theory to the rationality of the person making such a claim Âand rightly so .
Almost all conspiracies are based on paranoia , gnosticism , and an irrational belief in the competency of individuals or organizations ( particularly the government ) to flawlessly pull off extraordinarily devious and complicated schemes .
Generally , modern conspiracy theories ( e.g. , Birthers , 9/11 Truthers , Trig Truthers ) are championed by people who have more of an emotional attachment to the truth of their theory than a concern for the truths of reality .
A more useful , less crazy , conceptÂand one that better accounts for the flaws and foibles of real human beings Âis needed to explain such situations as Climategate .
One such type of explanation is what I would call a â confederacy theory â :
A theory that explains an event as being the result of an alliance between well - intentioned persons or parties who allow their biases and motives to shape their actions in such a way that the results can be judged by the public to be evil , unlawful , treacherous , or surreptitious .
For an example of where confederacy theory may be a more apt explanation than an assumption of a conspiracy , consider Adam Smith âs famous quote :
People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices .
Assuming this claim is true , it makes more sense Âand is exceedingly more charitable Âto believe that the people do not intentionally contrive to do something evil or unlawful .
Instead , their complex relationship as confederates leads them to share certain biases , presumptions , and goals that align in such a way that makes it seem if they are intentionally attempting to cause harm or conceal truth .
Similarly , I do nât think we have to assume bad motives , much less a conspiracy , on the part of climate scientists to account for Climategate and other questionable claims about climate change .
As McArdle says , â [ T ] he actual worrying question about CRU , and GISS , and the other scientists working on paleoclimate reconstruction : that they may all be calibrating their findings to each other . â
This should only be â worrying â if you assume this is not already a systemic practice .
Such a realization is much less concerting if you startÂas I cynically do Âwith the belief that this is an implicit bias within peer review that is only rarely corrected for .
After all , if a climate scientist submits a finding that is out of the norm , the reviewer is likely to simple assume that that the finding is in error and reject the paper .
What reviewer is going to check the accuracy of thousands of pieces of data , the means by which they were collected , and the reliability of the model used , in order to determine whether a specific finding is Âas they already suspectÂan error ?
Additionally , why would they bother checking such a finding when it would not only cast doubt on their own research but would potentially put them outside the circle of confederates , lumped in with the â deniers â ?
No need , therefore , to suspect a â massive conspiracy to conceal the truth â when this simple confederacy theory will do :
That for well - intentioned climate scientists , Truth is , to paraphrase Richard Rorty , what your confederates let you get away with saying .

A study of 145 preschool children reports , for the first time , that when the concentrations of two common phthalates in mothers ' prenatal urine are elevated their sons are less likely to play with male - typical toys and games , such as trucks and play fighting .
The University of Rochester Medical Center - led study is published in the International Journal of Andrology .
Because testosterone produces the masculine brain , researchers are concerned that fetal exposure to anti-androgens such as phthalates -- which are pervasive in the environment -- has the potential to alter masculine brain development , said lead author Shanna H. Swan , Ph.D. , professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology , director of the URMC Center for Reproductive Epidemiology , and an expert in phthalates .
" Our results need to be confirmed , but are intriguing on several fronts , " Swan said .
" Not only are they consistent with our prior findings that link phthalates to altered male genital development , but they also are compatible with current knowledge about how hormones mold sex differences in the brain , and thus behavior .
We have more work to do , but the implications are potentially profound . "
Phthalates are chemicals used to soften plastics .
Recent studies have shown that the major source of human exposure to the two phthalates of most concern ( DEHP and DBP ) is through food .
These phthalates are used primarily in polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) , so any steps in the processing , packaging , storage , or heating of food that use PVC - containing products can introduce them into the food chain .
Phthalates are also found in vinyl and plastic tubing , household products , and many personal care products such as soaps and lotions .
Phthalates are becoming more controversial as scientific research increasingly associates them with genital defects , metabolic abnormalities , and reduced testosterone in babies and adults .
A federal law passed in 2008 banned six phthalates from use in toys such as teethers , play bath items , soft books , dolls and plastic figures .

In Swan 's study , higher concentrations of metabolites of two phthalates , di( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( DEHP ) , and dibutyl phthalate ( DBP ) , were associated with less male - typical behavior in boys on a standard play questionnaire .
No other phthalate metabolites measured in - utero was linked to the less - masculine behavior .
Girls ' play behavior was not associated with phthalate levels in their mothers , the study concluded .
Swan 's interest in phthalates stems from an investigation into the environmental causes of reproductive health problems .
Since 1998 she has led the federally funded , multi-center Study for Future Families ( SFF ) , which established a large database from which to explore various scientific questions about toxins .
The current study focused on a small sample of SFF mothers who delivered children between 2000 and 2003 .
The mothers provided urine samples around the 28th week of pregnancy .
The urine was analyzed for phthalate metabolites by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
Swan hypothesized that phthalates may lower fetal testosterone production during a critical window of development -- somewhere within eight to 24 weeks gestation , when the testes begin to function -- thereby altering brain sexual differentiation .
To explore the question , researchers reconnected with mothers from the SFF sample and asked them to complete a standard research questionnaire , called the Preschool Activities Inventory ( PSAI ) , for their children ages 3 1/2 to 6 1/2 years .

The PSAI is designed to discriminate play behavior within and between the sexes , and in the past has been shown to reflect the endocrine - disrupting properties of other toxins , such as PCBs and dioxins .
The PSAI addressed three aspects of play : types of toys children choose ( trucks versus dolls ) , activities ( rough - and - tumble play , for example ) , and child characteristics .
However , researchers were concerned about how the choice of toys available in any given household might skew results , so in addition they asked about parental views toward atypical play .
For example , the survey asked , " What would you do if you had a boy who preferred toys that girls usually play with ? "
The possible answers included " strongly encourage " ( him to play this way ) to " strongly discourage . "
The final survey scores are designed to reflect sex - typical play .
Higher scores meant more male - typical play and lower scores meant more female - typical play .
Researchers then examined boys play - behavior scores in relation to the concentration of phthalate metabolites in their mothers ' prenatal urine samples , finding that higher concentrations of DEHP and DBP metabolites were associated with less masculine play behavior scores .
Earlier studies by Swan and others have shown that phthalate exposure during pregnancy might affect the development of genitals of both male rodents and baby boys .
Scientists refer to this cluster of genital alterations as the " phthalate syndrome , " and research suggests that in rodent pups , the syndrome can have adverse consequences for later sexual development .
If endocrine disrupters such as phthalates can impair genital development and hormone levels in the body , the play - behavior study noted , then a deeper examination of how these chemicals impact the brain is warranted .

BUENOS AIRES , ArgentinaâA 38 - year - old former Miss Argentina has died from complications after undergoing cosmetic surgery on her buttocks .
Solange Magnano , a mother of twins who won the crown in 1994 , died of a pulmonary embolism Sunday after three days in critical condition following a gluteoplasty in Buenos Aires .
Gluteoplasty involves placing implants in the buttocks to make them appear rounder .
Fashion designer and friend Roberto Piazza said the procedure also involved injections , and the liquid " went to her lungs and brain . "
" A woman who had everything lost her life to have a slightly firmer behind , " he said .
Magnano's burial Monday was shown on Argentine television .
Dr. Gonzalo Cortes y Tristan said she arrived at his hospital with an acute respiratory deficiency .
Her condition deteriorated until she suffered the embolism .
Juan Carlos Seiler , former president of the Buenos Aires Association of plastic surgeons , told the Times of London that the doctor who performed the procedure might not have been " a real professional . "
ELDORADO , Tex . Â
A year and a half after the state authorities raided a fundamentalist Mormon ranch here , the first of a half - dozen leaders of the sect has gone on trial on charges that he had sex with an under - age girl who state officials assert was one of several wives assigned to him by church elders .
The trial , taking place in a makeshift courtroom in this rural hamlet , has opened a window on the polygamous world inside the Yearning for Zion ranch , the compound of log buildings built around a stone temple where the state contends that arranged marriages involving under - age girls were commonplace .
But the proceeding has also exposed the difficulties prosecutors face in proving sex crimes were committed at the ranch , since the young woman at the center of the case , like most of the female sect members , has not cooperated with the authorities .
The state âs case rests mainly on genetic evidence that links the defendant , Raymond M. Jessop , 38 , to a child born in 2005 to the 16 - year - old girl he was living with along with several other women .
University of Iowa researchers have found the existence of a new , rare inherited retinal disease .
Now the search is on to find the genetic cause , which investigators hope will increase understanding of more common retinal diseases .
The findings appeared in the Nov. 9 issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology .
The macula , located within the retina , is an area of high - resolution central vision that is needed to read or drive , for example .
This area is damaged in more common retinal conditions such as macular degeneration and can be damaged by diabetes .
" It is rare to find a new inherited eye disease that affects the macula .
We thought we had seen them all , " said the study 's lead author Vinit Mahajan , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences at the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine .
" This newly found retinal disease causes abnormal blood vessels in the macula , and these vessels are prone to bleeding .
This causes swelling or scars that ' black out ' or blur parts of the field of vision , " said Mahajan , who also is a retinal specialist with University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics .
The finding came about when one person in a family in the United States sought care for eye problems .
" If a doctor saw just one family member , they would probably call this macular degeneration .
We knew there was something different , and we had to examine the rest of the family , " Mahajan said .
The team assessed 20 extended family members who were not blind but had visual problems of different severities .
Some family members also had areas of central vision loss , and some family members had strabismus , a disorder in which the eyes are not aligned .
The University of Iowa researchers have presented their findings at international meetings of retinal specialists in Arizona , Florida and London .
The investigators are now working with researchers worldwide to determine if other people have this particular disease .
" Through our paper and by sharing pictures of what the affected eye looks like , we hope to find more people affected , " Mahajan said .
" We also will work to find the gene that causes the condition .
This information could be very useful in eventually preventing or treating this and other diseases that affect the macula . "
The advanced genetics research capabilities at the University of Iowa Carver Family Center for Macular Degeneration increase the likelihood of finding a gene , Mahajan said .
The study 's senior author was Edwin Stone , M.D. , Ph.D. , Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and UI professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences .
Stephen Russell , M.D. , UI professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences , also contributed to the study .
Houses :
Are you going to keep the home that you owned with your former spouse ?
Many women undergoing separation and / or divorce sell their home , the equity of which is split depending upon separation or divorce arrangements .
If you are maintaining your home or purchasing a new home , the mortgage may be your biggest expense .
Therefore , you want to ensure that the interest rate is advantageous .
It can make a significant difference on your savings .
Therefore , shop around before you select the first mortgage rate you see advertised .
Home Maintenance : Normal maintenance on a home is expensive enough .
When you need to make repairs , the cost can be really problematic !
Getting comparisons is the key hereâgetting and accepting only a single offer can be very expensive .
And , without other bids with which to compare it to , you wo nât know a valid cost .
You want a good price but you also need a competent handyman .
Check out the reputation of the service provider and the warranties that the company will offer to you .
Cars :
Take a look at the vehicle you presently own .
Do you have equity in a car that you no longer use frequently ?
Could you downsize and save money , not only in monthly payments but also in maintenance , insurance and operating expenses ?
Insurance for Health Care / Dental Coverage : Shop around , Choose an appropriate plan for you and your family based on the treatment ( s ) covered , availability of treatment recovery , etc .
If a subsidy is available , apply for it !
If you have nât been offered subscription in an employment health care plan , enquire as to the reason !
You may be eligible for the same !
Insurance for Automobile and Home Coverage :
As always , shop around .
Prices for the same coverage can vary by hundreds of dollars from company to company , so it pays to shop around .
Surf the net , ask your friends or call your state insurance department for ideas about companies and agents to contact .
Ask for Higher Deductibles .
By requesting higher deductibles on collision and comprehensive ( fire and theft ) coverage , you can lower your costs substantially ..
Take Advantage of Any discounts offered , i.e .
Low mileage discounts , central burglary alarm discount , etc .
If you are not informed of any discount , take the initiative and enquire what discounts may be available to you .
Lord , for what I am about to receive , I humbly thank You ...

The number of people over 65 is projected to increase to 23 %
The population of the UK will rise from 61 m to 71.6 m by 2033 if current trends in growth continue , the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) has said .
Just over two - thirds of the increase is likely to be related directly or indirectly to migration to the UK .
If the projected increase materialises , the population will have grown at its fastest rate in a century .
But one think tank said the projections were based on trends over the past few years that may not continue .
National population projections are produced every two years to provide an estimate of future population which is used for government planning for pensions and the welfare state .
The latest figures show that if current trends continue :
The population will grow by more than 10 m by 2029 , less than half the time it took to rise from 50 m to 60 m between 1948 and 2005
The population of pensionable age will rise by 32 % over the next 25 years to 15.6 m , with the number aged over 85 more than doubling to 3.3 m
In 2033 , there will be 2.8 people of working age for every person of state pensionable age - a fall from 3.2 in 2008
By 2033 , the population of England will be almost as large as the current populations of England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland combined .
The ONS figures suggest that 180,000 new immigrants will arrive every year for the next 25 years - and will have both a direct impact themselves on the population , and an indirect one if they go on to have children .
These are projections - it does n't mean things will necessarily end up that way
Tim Finch
Institute for Public Policy Research
But that number for new arrivals is 10,000 a year lower than the last ONS projection two years ago and immigration minister Phil Woolas said that showed the government 's points - based system was working .
" Today 's projections show that population growth is starting to slow down , the impacts of the radical reforms we have made to the immigration system over the last two years are working , " he said .
However , MPs Nicholas Soames and Frank Field , chairmen of the cross party group for balanced migration , said the UK was " on course for an unsustainable and unacceptable rise in population " .
" Over the next Parliament , at a time of public spending cuts , the government will have to find the money to pay for one million new immigrants - a city the size of Birmingham . "
They called on all major parties to promise " firm and effective " measures to keep the population below 65 m .
" If politicians want to rebuild trust and counter extremism , they must stop ignoring the public 's deep concern about this , " they said .
Shadow immigration minister Damian Green said a Conservative government would introduce a limit on the numbers allowed to come to the UK to work , " as well as other measures to fight illegal immigration " .
Sir Andrew Green , chairman of think tank Migration Watch UK , said the government was " in denial " and " really serious measures " were needed to bring immigration down .
" 70 % of the fastest growth rate in history is due to immigration , " he said .
" That is equivalent to the entire population of London in the next 25 years .
" The government 's own claim for the effect of their recent measures is an annual reduction of 20,000 .
Today 's projections show that net immigration must be reduced by 180,000 a year if we are to hold the UK 's population at 65 million . "
Impact of recession Guy Goodwin , ONS director of population statistics , stressed that the figures were not forecasts or predictions and did not " take account of new or future policy initiatives " .

GCC has a rather crazy syntax that I discovered tonight for the first time , and I thought I 'd share so you do n't have to dig for a half hour like I did to find out what it is and how it works .
The feature is compound statment expressions .
I came across it in the Linux kernel code in include / linux / percpu.h :
# define per_cpu_ptr ( ptr , cpu ) ( { ( void ) ( cpu ) ; ( ptr ) ; } )
The long and short of this expression is this - if you call per_cpu_ptr ( myptr , 5 ) , you will get myptr back .
But the macro to do this confused me , with no explicit return .
With a compound statement expression , as opposed to just a compound statement ( those things surrounded by curly braces ) , the last item in the block is used as the return value for the whole expression .
Thus , in the above expression , the value of ptr will be returned .
The key is including both the parenthesis and curly braces .
If you want to see a full example , check out the following ( working ) program .
#include < stdlib.h > # include < stdio.h > int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { int number ; char * string ; string = ( { " hidden " ; " shown " ; } ) ; number = ( { int a = 50 ; a += 50 ; a ; } ) ; printf ( " %s %d
" , string , number ) ; return 0 ; }
In an oped in today âs WSJ , Peter Wallison notes a fundamental inconsistency in the government âs defense of the AIG bailout :
Since last September , the government âs case for bailing out AIG has rested on the notion that the company was too big to fail .
If AIG had nât been rescued , the argument goes , its credit default swap ( CDS ) obligations would have caused huge losses to its counterpartiesÃ¢â¬ â and thus provoked a financial collapse .
Last week âs news that this was not in fact the motive for AIG âs rescue has implications that go well beyond the Obama administration âs efforts to regulate CDSs and other derivatives .
It âs one more example that the administration may be using the financial crisis as a pretext to extend Washington âs control of the financial sector .
The truth about the credit default swaps came out last week in a report by TARP Special Inspector General Neil Barofsky .
It says that Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , then president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , did not believe that the financial condition of AIG âs credit default swap counterparties was â a relevant factor â in the decision to bail out the company .
This contradicts the conventional assumption , never denied by the Federal Reserve or the Treasury , that AIG âs failure would have had a devastating effect .
Wallison is exactly right : Geithner cannot run around Washington , using arguendo ad AIG to justify ( a ) the bailouts , and ( b ) the need for mandatory clearing , more draconian capital requirements , and restrictions on derivatives , while at the same time saying that the financial condition of counterparties was an irrelevancy in the decision to assume AIG âs obligations .
These claims are impossible to reconcile logically .
If one is true , the other is not .
Period .
Wallison then traces out the implications of this inconsistency :
The broader question is whether the entire regulatory regime proposed by the administration , and now being pushed through Congress by Rep. Barney Frank and Sen. Chris Dodd , is based on a faulty premise .
The administration has consistently used the term â large , complex and interconnected â to describe the nonbank financial institutions it wants to regulate .
The prospect that the failure of one of these firms might pose a systemic risk is the foundation of the administration âs comprehensive regulatory regime for the financial industry .
Up to now , very few pundits or reporters have questioned this logic .
They have apparently been satisfied with the explanation that the â interconnectedness â created by those mysterious credit default swaps was the culprit .
But the New York Fed is the regulatory body most familiar with the CDS market .
If that agency did not believe AIG âs failure would have actually brought down its counterpartiesÃ¢â¬ â and ultimately the financial system itselfÃ¢ â¬ â it raises serious questions about the administration âs credibility , and about the need for its regulatory proposals .
If â interconnections â among financial institutions are indeed the source of the financial crisis , the administration should be far more forthcoming than it has been about exactly what these interconnections are , and how exactly a broad new system of regulation and resolution would eliminate or reduce them .
Right again .
If arguendo ad AIG is , as the old phrase goes , no longer operative , then what is the logical basis for this metastasizing regulatory framework ?
And make no mistake about it , AIG has been the alpha and the omega of the case for mandatory clearing , exchange trading of derivatives , and more onerous capital requirements .
It âs not just Geithner .
If anything , CFTC head Gensler has been even been more of a repeat offender , subject to the three strikes rule multiple times , as evidenced by his recent testimony before the Senate Ag Committee .
In that testimony , Gensler refers to AIG as â Exhibit A â for the case against OTC derivatives .
So . . . if even â Exhibit A â AIG âs financial condition posed no threat to its counterparties ( as would be necessary to make this â not a relevant factor â ) , what âs the need for a draconian restructuring of the financial markets ?
And if the Fed and Treasury were truly concerned of the fallout from an AIG collapse , why insist to an official investigation that this was not the case ?
Is this an attempt to maintain the fiction that Goldman and the other banks were totally safe and sound even during the maelstrom of the crisis , and did nât need the money ?
If not , give me a better explanation .
Wallison is quite polite when he calls Geithner âs conflicting stories about AIG â a lack of candor about credit default swaps . â
The Treasury Secretary has lied about AIG with probability one .
The only question is which of his statements is a lie .
I would wager that the â not a factor â statement is the dishonest one .
Hopefully Wallison is right in the second half of this judgment :
The administration seems to be using the specter of another financial crisis to bring more and more of the economy under Washington âs control .
With the help of large Democratic majorities in Congress , this train has had considerable momentum .
But perhapsÃ¢â¬ â with the disclosure about credit default swaps and the AIG crisisÃ¢ â¬ â the wheels are finally coming off .
Wallison âs call for a thoroughgoing explanation of â how exactly a broad new system of regulation and resolution would eliminate or reduce â interconnections is spot on .
In particular , as I have been saying over and over , and over and over , and . . . just how does creating a central counterparty among major financial institutions eliminate interconnections ?
Indeed , by concentrating failure in a single institution connected to all other major financial institutions , and which arguably operates at an information and incentive deficit relative to the dealers in an OTC market , mandated clearing arguably increases systemic risk .
To put it bluntly .
We ca nât have such an epochal change in the structure and regulation of such immense financial markets based on lies plus superficial and specious analysis .
But it is abundantly clear that that is the case , as Wallison âs piece succinctly demonstrates .

Now may be a good time to consider buying that new refrigerator , clothes washer or dishwasher .
Last summer , as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act stimulus plan , the Department of Energy announced that up to $ 300 million in federal aid would be given to states to run rebate programs encouraging consumers to replace their old appliances with new energy - efficient ones .
Under the â State Energy Appliance Rebate Program , â otherwise known as Cash for Appliances , each state was allocated an amount based on its population .
States were then supposed to determine qualifying products , set rebate amounts and submit their program plans to the Department of Energy for approval by Oct. 15 , with the aim of starting the rebates by the end of this year and early next year .
In recent weeks , as the Department of Energy has approved many of the programs , details of the state offerings have started to emerge .
By Tuesday , 51 of the 56 states and territories had won approval for their plans and received their money , according to a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy .
The programs offer rebates for products with Energy Star labels , denoting higher efficiency .
But details of the programs , including types of appliances included , rebate amounts , start dates , how rebates can be claimed and whether recycling of old appliances is required , vary by state .
In all cases , though , consumers should act quickly if they want to take advantage of the programs since each state is offering only a limited number of refunds .
New York âs $ 16.8 million â Great Appliance Swap - Out â program , for instance , which was approved last week , will give more than 170,000 rebates in total and start in February .
The New York rebates include $ 75 rebates for refrigerators and $ 50 rebates for freezers .
Consumers will be eligible for additional rebates if they document recycling of their older models or buy three - appliance packages ( rebate forms and instructions will be available here ) .
Other programs start earlier .
Wisconsin , for instance , will start giving cash - back rewards for qualifying appliance purchases on Jan. 1 via mail - in form .
Its more comprehensive , but sometimes smaller , rebates include $ 200 for boilers , $ 25 for dishwashers , $ 50 for freezers and $ 75 for central air - conditioners , air - source heat pumps , refrigerators and geothermal heat pumps .
The rebates in Wisconsin , which was allocated $ 5.4 million for its program , may last only until February , according to the state âs site .
To find out what your state is offering , check out the Department of Energy âs list of approved programs and details ( also outlined in the PDF below ) as well as your state âs energy department Web site .
Some appliance manufacturers and retailers like Sears are also keeping track of details of state rebate plans as they emerge and will help consumers submit the rebate forms in stores , when possible .
What do you think of these programs ?
Will you take advantage of them ?
Why or why not ?
What other tips do you have for saving on appliance purchases ?

While covering stories for NORML âs Daily Audio Stash , I âve noticed a trend lately in stories involving parents treating childhood mental health conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and autism .
( ABC âs Good Morning America , click link for video )
Given the many challenges involved in raising an autistic child , parents are willing to try a variety of potential remedies , many of which are controversial and unproven .
[ Meiko ] Hester - Perez made her decision to try giving her 10 - year - old son , Joey Perez , medical marijuana after his weight had become dangerously low due to his unwillingness to eat .
She said that at the time she began the approach , he weighed only 46 pounds .
But just hours after she gave him one of the pot-infused brownies , she said she could see a change â both in his appetite and demeanor .
She added that her son used to take a cocktail of medications , three times every day , for his condition .
He now takes only three , and he has a marijuana brownie once every two or three days .
â I saved my son âs life , and marijuana saved my son âs life â¦ â said Hester - Perez .
( New York Times ) Several Bay Area doctors who recommend medical marijuana for their patients said in recent interviews that their client base had expanded to include teenagers with psychiatric conditions including attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder .
â¦ [ Medical m] arijuana advocates maintain that it is also safer than methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) , the stimulant prescription drug most often used to treat A.D.H.D.
That drug has documented potential side effects including insomnia , depression , facial tics and stunted growth .
In Berkeley , Dr. Frank Lucido said he was questioned by the medical board but ultimately not disciplined after he authorized marijuana for a 16 - year - old boy with A.D.H.D. who had tried Ritalin unsuccessfully and was racking up a record of minor arrests .
Within a year of the new treatment , he said , the boy was getting better grades and was even elected president of his special - education class .
â He was telling his mother : â My brain works .
I can think , â â Dr. Lucido said .

My son J has autism .
He âs also had two serious surgeries for a spinal cord tumor and has an inflammatory bowel condition , all of which may be causing him pain , if he could tell us .
[ S ] ince we started him on his â special tea , â J âs little face , which is sometimes a mask of pain , has softened .
He smiles more .
Pre-pot , J. ate things that were nât food .
There âs a name for this : pica . â¦
His pica become so uncontrollable we could nât let him sleep with a pajama top ( it would be gone by morning ) or a pillow ( ditto the case and the stuffing ) â¦
Almost immediately after we started the cannabis , the pica stopped .
Just stopped .
J. now sleeps with his organic wool - and - cotton , hypoallergenic , temptingly chewable comforter .
Next , we started seeing changes in J.âs school reports . â¦
At one parent meeting in August ( J. is on an extended school year ) , his teacher excitedly presented his June - July â aggression â chart .
An aggression is defined as any attempt or instance of hitting , kicking , biting , or pinching another person .
For the past year , he âd consistently had 30 to 50 aggressions in a school day , with a one - time high of 300 .
The charts for June through July , by contrast , showed he was actually having days â sometimes one after another â with zero aggressions .
The anecdotal evidence keeps showing some remarkable results for some young patients in treating the symptoms of these mental health disorders .
However , it is important to note that it is , at this stage , just anecdotal evidence .
There is a paucity of studies researching the use of cannabis for these disorders in children and teens , owing in large part to the government âs placement of cannabis on Schedule I .
The only research generally allowed on cannabis in America is to show the dangers of its use , not its medical benefits .
At NORML , we are adamant about the ending of marijuana prohibition for all adults .
While we may quibble about the definition of â adult â being age 18 or age 21 , we are definitely in agreement that under age 18 , cannabis use should be limited strictly to medical cases with doctor âs supervision .
Cannabis is certainly not a harmless substance â no physically and mind - altering substance is â and there is some research data available showing potential detrimental mental health effects among young chronic cannabis users .
That said , medical use of cannabis for minors is still a thorny subject , even here at NORML .
We are reminded of our advisory board member , Dr. Lester Grinspoon , who monitored his pre-teen son âs successful use of cannabis during leukemia treatments .
Certainly youth medical marijuana use in that scenario â a child wasting away in pain dying from cancer â sets one end of the cost / benefit spectrum .
Clearly the benefits outweigh the risks .
But as we examine medical marijuana use for mental health disorders , especially where conventional drugs and behavioral therapies have already been proven successful , we reach the other end of the spectrum where the decisions are more difficult .
One thing on which we can all agree is that there needs to be much more medical research into this issue .
We encourage Congress and the President to take the advice of the AMA from two weeks ago which urged that â the Schedule I status of marijuana be reviewed with the goal of facilitating clinical research and development of cannabinoid - based medicines , and alternate delivery methods . â
Another point of agreement : arresting , fining , and imprisoning parents and doctors who are agonizing over health care decisions involving cannabis therapies for their children is unnecessary and cruel .

Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderThe Hill's Campaign Report : Biden on Trump : ' He 'll leave ' l GOP laywers brush off Trump 's election remarks l Obama 's endorsements Obama endorses Warnock in crowded Georgia Senate race The Hill 's Campaign Report : Trump 's rally risk | Biden ramps up legal team | Biden hits Trump over climate policy MORE is retreating on his commitment to pursue a controversial gun-control measure .
Holder âs statements , recently delivered to senators in writing , clearly indicate the Obama administration is in no rush to reinstate the assault weapons ban , which expired in 2004 .
ADVERTISEMENT
In response to written questions from Senate Judiciary Committee members , Holder adopted a much different tone on the ban than he did in February , when he said , â As President Obama indicated during the campaign , there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make , and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons .
â That comment attracted many headlines , but the nation âs chief law enforcement officer is now downplaying his earlier remarks .
Noting his February statements , Sen . ( R- Okla . ) asked Holder , â Is it still your intent to seek a reinstitution of the â assault weapons â ban ?
â Holder stressed that he was nât breaking new ground earlier this year .
His response to a reporter in February , Holder claims , is not akin to â call[ing ] for a new assault weapons ban , but rather restating the previously expressed campaign position on this issue .
â Regarding the administration âs next step , Holder stated , " The department is currently reviewing existing gun laws to determine how best to combat gun violence and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and others prohibited from possessing them .
" Holder 's response to Coburn is the latest in a series of mixed messages from Obama and his team after the president vowed during his campaign that he would seek to reinstate the ban .
The White House quickly distanced itself from Holder 's comments in February , but the president said during a press conference in Mexico City in April that he has " not backed off at all from my belief that the assault weapons ban makes sense .
" Obama acknowledged at the press conference that he was not " under any illusions that reinstating that ban would be easy .
" A bi-national panel of former government officials and scholars issued a report on Friday recommending the reinstatement of the assault weapons band .
It also called for a crackdown on the illegal export of guns to Mexico .
The new season of Doctor Who starring Matt Smith officially started filming yesterday .
The BBC released the first pictures of Matt Smith in costume as the Doctor , along with Karen Gillan playing his companion Amy Pond .
Notice Gillan âs shoes in the picture below .
It sure looks like she âs wearing David Tennant âs red Converse high - tops .
Wonder if that âs coincidence or a plot point .
Smith âs new costume is being described as â Science Teacher Chic â .
Since they originally described David Tennant âs look as â Geek Chic â , perhaps this is just an extension of that concept .
When I first saw Smith âs costume on Monday , it did nât sit well with me .
Now after some time has passed , it âs growing on me .
The 1950s styling is a nice contrast to Matt Smith âs youthful appearance .
It sort of works .
Additionally , Matt Smith has a very friendly face , which is encouraging .
If your initial reaction to Smith âs new costume is apprehension , then just consider how people probably felt the first time Tom Baker âs costume was revealed .
What âs up with the TARDIS appearance below ?
That design is straight out of the premier episode of the original series in 1963 .
Huh ?
Is the chameleon circuit going to reset or something ?
Have they changed the design inside as well ?
I guess we âll have to wait and find out .
I heard one person liken Matt Smith âs look to Crispin Glover âs George McFly in Back to the Future .
I ca nât say they were wrong .
â Amy â¦ you âre my density . â
A return to Bad Wolf Bay. Hmmmm â¦ curious .
I âm miserable that David Tennant is leaving the series .
However , that âs a reality us Who fans have to face .
With that said , I âm officially getting anxious for the new season in 2010 !
I ca nât believe how fast time has flown since they announced the abbreviated season five and Tennant âs departure !

It âs been 18 years since he passed away , but Miles Davis is still the biggest jazz artist on the planet .
If anything , the mercurial trumpeter casts a greater shadow now than he did when he was alive .
Tributes to his legacy are everywhere , from a huge exhibition of memorabilia in Paris to a 24 - hour temporary satellite radio station on SIRIUS Canada , to a series of concerts and tours led by former sidemen and followers , to books , to a Don Cheadle - helmed biopic that âs in the works .
On Tuesday , Sony will release a 71 - disc box set of Davis âs work .
The question arises :
At what point does the constant paying of tribute turn into fixation ?
And furthermore , is there a danger that in looking back at the career of someone who was always looking forward , the jazz world is ignoring the innovation of a younger generation ?
Certainly , from a commercial standpoint , Miles Davis is an easy sell to crossover audiences at a time when jazz is hardly a commercial force .
â John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman , I do nât think , have sunk into popular culture , â says AndrÃ© Menard , artistic director of the Montreal Jazz Festival , â but Miles âs sounds have percolated in most of rock and pop music , from what I hear all the time . â¦
He has this crushing presence in the world of music . â
Crucial to Miles âs appeal is his unique , enigmatic star quality .
Miles the man appears to have been as complex as his music : no two people remember him the same way .
Biographer Jack Chambers , who wrote the acclaimed two - volume set Milestones ( 1983 - â85 ) , calls the jazz legend â a miserable son of a bitch â and â a genuinely nasty man . â
Menard , who presented Miles âs concerts on four occasions , suggests that the trumpeter had a â concrete aura that was very hard to get through , â but that he was nonetheless â a gentleman . â
What everyone does agree on is that he took orders from no one , and that â up until two retrospective concerts at the end of his life â he never looked back , either at his own legacy or at that of his fellow jazz musicians .
Since his death , however , the jazz tribute project has become such a tradition that jazz itself has come to be seen as a â retrospective art form , â as Chambers puts it , where all â the commemorative extravaganza , concerts , CDs â come across as â a marketing ploy .
There âs an emphasis on looking back because some of the creative impetus is stuck back there . â
Part of the problem , for Chambers , is the â academic crust on the jazz world that was not there until the 1990s .
What âs missing for me is this raw kind of feeling that players could communicate in performance in days gone by . â
Davis himself dropped out of Juilliard after studying for a brief period there in the mid-â40s : â He always said he learned more from Dizzy Gillespie at night than he did from his professors in the daytime . â
While Davis might have turned his back on the formal study of music , his work will occupy jazz musicologists for generations to come : because he was such a pioneer â from cool jazz to hard bop to modal jazz to fusion with rock and funk â it âs almost impossible to get around him in any study of the genre .
Moreover , so great has his critical and commercial success been that it has tended to drown out the work of those around him â drummer Jimmy Cobb , for instance , the sole survivor of the Kind of Blue sessions , makes the news only when playing concerts of music from that one seminal album .
â The spirit of having to go backwards to be noticed saddens me , â says Toronto - based trumpeter Nick â Brownman â Ali .
However , he suggests , there is a way out : the key is not to â photocopy â Davis âs sound or his playing but to concentrate on his spirit of â fearlessness and irreverence . â
In his own recurring series of five - night tribute concerts , Brownman and a shifting cast of Canadian and American collaborators celebrate different phases of Davis âs music while attempting to use the frameworks â to be original and play like we live in 2009 . â
There âs always the hope that a new Miles Davis may emerge to lead jazz forward , inspired by the spirit , rather than the letter , of the original .
â It can be done , â Brownman asserts .
â But you have to be just as fearless as Miles was . â

The British armed forces , in a bid to stop criticism regarding uniforms supplied to troops in combat , have introduced a new field camouflage pattern intended to be suitable for use in both desert and vegetated terrain .
A thin MTP line of heroes .
The new pattern is based on the " multicam " developed for the US Army in recent years but never yet issued to regular American forces .
It will replace the standard brown / black / green Disrupted Pattern Material ( DPM ) uniforms as standard working dress in the army and parts of the other services over the next few years : specialist camouflage kit ( desert , arctic etc ) will remain in use as required .
The forces have had a vexing time with camouflage uniforms over the last decade .
With preparation time for the Iraq invasion of 2003 cut short for political reasons , many frontline troops crossed the border from Kuwait still wearing DPM more suitable for northwest Europe than the desert .
Over time , following much agitation in the press , the forces got this sorted out .
It became a rigid requirement that every serviceman or woman was fully clad in light desert kit on arrival in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Unfortunately , in the main theatre of British action today - along the banks and in the surrounding terrain of the Helmand river - this turned out not to be ideal .
A narrow " green zone " of irrigated farmland follows the river through the arid Afghan desert , and within the zone the lush vegetation causes a desert - camo'd trooper to show up much more than one in DPM .
Special forces .
You never saw me , right ?
This led some soldiers , whose tasks might be taking them in and out of the green zone several times a day , to wear a mixture of DPM and desert kit .
There was some ignorant press commentary , when this was first noticed , condemning the MoD for once again failing to get enough desert kit for all - but in fact the mix of uniforms was a matter of choice by the troops involved .
Plain white office paper could be the basis for efficient batteries .
Scientists have converted sheets of them into efficient electrical storage devices using ink loaded with carbon nanotubes .
This new spin on an ancient invention is the latest in a line of research striving to incorporate paper into batteries to reduce their weight , one of battery technology 's major shortcomings .
To trim weight , researchers have tried several approaches , including the use of thin films of materials laid down as inks .
The appeal of paper for centuries â its porous microscopic structure , which makes it ideal for holding onto inks â now intrigues researchers for modern applications , not to mention that paper is also a flexible , lightweight , affordable , well - established technology that is used everywhere and could be made from renewable sources .
To devise the novel paper batteries , materials scientist Yi Cui of Stanford University and his colleagues coated plain copy paper with black ink made with single - walled carbon nanotubes , which are electrically conductive pipes only billionths of a meter wide .
Positive and negative electrodes â cathodes and anodes â were then applied as slurries dried on the nanotube - impregnated paper .
( The cathodes were made from lithium manganese oxide nanorods , and the anodes made either from nanopowders of lithium titanium oxide or nanowires with cores of carbon covered with shells of silicon . )
The batteries were then dipped in an electrolyte of lithium hexafluorophosphate solution to connect the electrodes and sealed in a pouch .
In this setup the nanotubes collected current from each electrode .
" It provides a nice example of the combination of high tech with low tech , " says materials scientist John Rogers at the University of Illinois at UrbanaâChampaign , who did not take part in this research .
Close to conventional storage cells
These paper batteries , described online December 7 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , were as good as conventional ones in terms of energy storage and recharging - cycle life .
Based on their experiments , the researchers say that incorporating carbon nanotube paper into conventional rechargeable batteries could reduce their weight by up to 20 percent .
This reduction could help make electric and hybrid vehicles more feasible and could lead to longer - lasting mobile phones , laptops and other portable electronics .
" The fabrication of inexpensive , flexible and lightweight batteries could revolutionize portable electronics , " remarks materials scientist Francesco Stellacci of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who did not participate in this study .
At large scales , they could also inexpensively help solar and wind farms store what energy they generate , Cui adds .
The carbon nanotubes bonded very strongly to the paper , obviating the need for adhesives that decrease performance and significantly increase production costs , Cui and his colleagues note .
The battery could also bend and curl without losing its ability to conduct a charge and " can be easily laminated into flexible computers to power the devices , " he suggests .
The team noted in their paper that its technique is easily scalable for mass production , and that the ink could even be painted on with brushes , if desired .
Paper trail
These new devices are the latest in a series of paper batteries that have emerged in recent years .
For instance , in 2007 biopolymer expert Robert Linhardt of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N.Y. , and his colleagues made batteries with a composite of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and paper as the cathode , a lithium metal film as the anode and aluminum foil as the current collector .
They carried out experiments where sweat or blood operated as their electrolytes , suggesting they could find uses in bodily implants .
Nanotechnologist Maria StrÃ¸mme of Uppsala University in Sweden and her colleagues have also devised batteries with a paper made from seaweed .
Because such paper had 100 times more surface area than that made from wood , it can hold dramatically more power , they reported in the October 14 Nano Letters .
One concern about the new sheets is their electrical resistances , which are some 10 times or more than those of the metal foils used as current collectors in conventional batteries .
Such resistance slows the delivery of power .
Cui suggests incorporating metal nanowires into their devices to lower resistance , thereby helping provide more electrical oomph .
Another major obstacle to implementing these findings is the current high price of carbon nanotubes .
" However , carbon nanotube price will continuously drop as production ramps up , " Cui notes .
" The conductive paper concept can also be realized with other nanomaterials with potentially low cost , such as graphene . "
Back in 2003 Fox News ' chief - crazy - question - asker Glenn Beck asked fans to each send him a dollar towards his personal purchase of a Mercedes - Benz S600 .
Beck even set up a still - active - to - this - day PayPal account to facilitate donations .
Whatever happened to that ?

Mr. Beck 's got a litigious history , especially regarding certain questions asked about what he may or may not have done to a young girl in 1990 , so we 're not going to wade deep into allegations of hypocrisy here , but we find this interesting .
Based on the archives of Mr. Beck 's radio show , it seems that back in 2003 , he implored his fans to send him no more than $ 1 towards the " Glenn Beck New Car Fund " which would go towards buying himself a Mercedes Benz S600 .
Sounds an awful lot like that bogey man of socialism Mr. Beck is always trotting out to scare his viewers .
We 'd go even further in saying it smacks of old Soviet - era communism , wherein the many provide luxury for the few .
Especially when you look at his selected options :

This , of course , could n't be true , Mr. Beck being , above all , just a regular Joe common man fighting for truth , justice , and the American way , or something .
Begging for a Mercedes built by union labor in socialist Germany is the American way right ?
We were unable to determine if Mr. Beck ever made his modest $ 147,625 goal , but the Paypal donation link still exists linking to glenns-new-car-fund@glennbeck.com .
We 'd love to know if he ever got that shiny new car .

Al - Arabiya TV ( Dubai / Saudi Arabia ) : Imam in Sweden : If We Lined the Jews Up in One Row and Spat on Them , They Would Drown
Rockleigh , N.J .
THIS is only a test , I tell myself .
So I floor the gas pedal , fighting the instinct to hit the brakes , and aim straight at Bob , who is standing directly in front of me here in a North Jersey parking lot .
Before the front bumper of the Volvo I âm driving kneecaps the poor guy , there âs a warning beep , a flash of red lights above the dashboard Â and in an instant , a lurch , as the car comes to a stop .
I never touched the brakes .
Bob , you âll be relieved to know , is a test dummy and my target in the trial run of a new pedestrian - crash - prevention system to be introduced on the redesigned 2011 Volvo S60 .
The system is the latest development in what promises to be a new generation of safety systems that go beyond simply warning drivers of impending disasters Â it actually takes control of the car to prevent them .
In 2008 , 4,378 pedestrians were killed , and some 69,000 were injured , in traffic accidents in the United States , according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
That has provided a strong incentive for researchers to explore ideas like warning systems , external air bags and softer crumple zones that might lessen the consequences of cars striking people .
An excellent way to improve one 's skill as a rationalist is to identify one 's strengths and weaknesses , and then expend effort on the things that one can most effectively improve ( which are often the areas where one is weakest ) .
This seems especially useful if one is very specific about the parts of rationality , if one describes them in detail .
In order to facilitate improving my own and others ' rationality , I am posting this list of 11 core rationalist skills , thanks almost entirely to Anna Salamon .
Actually want an accurate map , because you have Something to protect .
Keep your eyes on the prize .
Focus your modeling efforts on the issues most relevant to your goals .
Be able to quickly refocus a train of thought or discussion on the most important issues , and be able and willing to quickly kill tempting tangents .
Periodically stop and ask yourself " Is what I am thinking about at the moment really an effective way to achieve my stated goals ? " .
Entangle yourself with the evidence .
Realize that true opinions do n't come from nowhere and can't just be painted in by choice or intuition or consensus .
Realize that it is information - theoretically impossible to reliably get true beliefs unless you actually get reliably pushed around by the evidence .
Distinguish between knowledge and feelings .
Be Curious : Look for interesting details ; resist cached thoughts ; respond to unexpected observations and thoughts .
Learn to acquire interesting angles , and to make connections to the task at hand .
Aumann - update : Update to the right extent from others ' opinions .
Borrow reasonable practices for grocery shopping , social interaction , etc from those who have already worked out what the best way to do these things is .
Take relevant experts seriously .
Use outside views to estimate the outcome of one 's own projects and the merit of one 's own clever ideas .
Be willing to depart from consensus in cases where there is sufficient evidence that the consensus is mistaken or that the common practice does n't serve its ostensible purposes .
Have correct models of the causes of others â beliefs and psychological states , so that you can tell the difference between cases where the vast majority of people believe falsehoods for some specific reason , and cases where the vast majority actually knows best .
Know standard Biases :
Have conscious knowledge of common human error patterns , including the heuristics and biases literature ; practice using this knowledge in real - world situations to identify probable errors ; practice making predictions and update from the track record of your own accurate and inaccurate judgments .
Know Probability theory :
Have conscious knowledge of probability theory ; practice applying probability theory in real - world instances and seeing e.g. how much to penalize conjunctions , how to regress to the mean , etc .
Know your own mind :
Have a moment - to - moment awareness of your own emotions and of the motivations guiding your thoughts .
( Are you searching for justifications ?
Shying away from certain considerations out of fear ? )
Be willing to acknowledge all of yourself , including the petty and unsavory parts .
Knowledge of your own track record of accurate and inaccurate predictions , including in cases where fear , pride , etc. were strong .
Be well calibrated : Avoid over - and under - confidence .
Know how much to trust your judgments in different circumstances .
Keep track of many levels of confidence , precision , and surprisingness ; dare to predict as much as you can , and update as you test the limits of your knowledge .
Develop as precise a world - model as you can manage .
( Tom McCabe wrote a quiz to test some simple aspects of your calibration . )
Use analytic philosophy : understand the habits of thought taught in analytic philosophy ; the habit of following out lines of thought , of taking on one issue at a time , of searching for counter - examples , and of carefully keeping distinct concepts distinct ( e.g. not confusing heat and temperature ; free will and lack of determinism ; systems for talking about Peano arithmetic and systems for talking about systems for talking about Peano arithmetic ) .
Two years ago Radio 4 reporter Simon Cox wrote in the Magazine about how he had traced the mastermind of an e-mail spamming scam .
It signalled the start of a legal case which has just seen the spammer ordered to pay a huge fine .
$ 70 a jar - the Manster pill
It all started with a bottle of pills .
They were the colour of bluebottles and as big as beetles .
In December 2007 I ordered the " Manster " pills from the Elite Herbal Website - advertised in an e-mail for their penis enlargement qualities .
I paid $ 70 for the promise of " new exciting horizons of sensual pleasure " .
I wanted to find the spammers who plague our inboxes with unwanted e-mails and Elite Herbal was the ideal place to start .
As well as Manster the site sold everything from diet pills to herbal Viagra and was part of the world 's biggest spamming operation .
Finding the men who ran it was n't going to be easy .
I decided to follow the money trail .
After various dead ends I managed to track a computer monitoring Elite Herbal orders to an IP address [ a unique code ascribed to each computer on the internet ] in Christchurch in New Zealand .
It belonged to Shane Atkinson .
When I called him he denied sending any spam e-mails : " It was n't me mate , we closed all that down years ago .
I 'm not controlling any computers , mate . "
Shane and his brother Lance were well known spammers who ran a global operation with another man , Jody Smith , in the US .
For years they had exploited the lack of anti-spamming legislation in New Zealand but the country had recently brought in new laws and the authorities were determined to shut down Elite Herbal .
Planned raid E - mails subsequently shown to me by law enforcement sources showed that shortly after my phone call Shane Atkinson had contacted his suppliers in India asking what was going on .
Super scam me - Simon Cox 's original report for the Magazine ' Spam gang ' boss faces $ 15 m fine I had already been in touch with them and they also wanted to know why a BBC journalist was asking awkward questions .
New Zealand 's Department of Internal Affairs had been planning to raid Atkinson 's house in early 2008 but following my phone call they were forced to act .
They raided Shane 's house in December and took away his computers .
It meant officers working over the holiday .
As one later told me I was n't their favourite journalist .
To make matters worse , the case led to headlines in New Zealand asking why a British reporter had got to Atkinson before the police .
One memorable interview with a radio station in Auckland began with the question " Why are the police here so crap ? "
You do n't get that kind of question from John Humphrys , so I fudged a reply and wrapped it up as quickly as I could .
It was n't long before New Zealand 's Department of Internal Affairs got in touch .
In early 2008 I received an e-mail asking if I could provide any material for the investigation into Shane Atkinson and the Elite Herbal spamming operation ?
An affidavit followed asking for as much information as possible .
Not surprisingly BBC producer Richard Vadon and I declined to hand over anything that would reveal any sources but after lengthy conversations with lawyers and the BBC 's policy advisers , we did give them some material which had already been in the programme .
Â£ 150,000 a month For several months everything went quiet .
I assumed my spam adventure was over .
Apart that is from the scores of spam e-mails I was still getting every day .
Still going strong - recent contents of a spam filter
Then in the autumn of 2008 two officers from New Zealand 's anti-spam unit flew over to visit me .
Atkinson was refusing to plead guilty and they wanted to know if I would testify should the case come to court .
I agreed , in principle uneasy at the prospect of appearing in the witness box .
All of this for a civil case , which at the most would mean Atkinson getting a fine .
In June , my police contact told me to put a date aside in my diary for late 2009 to fly to New Zealand as Shane was still intending to go to court .
Luckily I did n't have to make the trip .
Shane fell on his sword and agreed to pay a fine to settle his case .
It cost him NZ$ 100,000 ( approx Â£ 60,000 ) .
It was the same amount his brother Lance agreed to earlier in the year .
Not much when you consider one law enforcement official told me it was estimated the gang was making about Â£ 150,000 a month .
The Federal Trade Commission in America was also on the case .
They were targeting Lance and the man running the US end of the operation , Jody Smith .
Earlier this week the FTC announced Smith would turn over nearly all his assets .
They also imposed a $ 15 m fine on Lance Atkinson .
It sounded impressive but Lance had already been given a $ 2.2 m fine by the FTC in 2005 .
As he was living in Australia the US authorities could n't force him to pay .
Unless he is planning a trip to Disneyland the fine will remain a largely symbolic gesture .
The Elite Herbal website is no more .
It has been replaced by another .
Are Shane and Lance Atkinson still running spam e-mail operations ?
The authorities do n't think so , as they are keeping an eye on them .
Filters are getting better at blocking out spam but with 120 billion sent each day you only need a tiny percentage of buyers to make some serious money .
And what of the Manster pills .
I was tempted to try one , for research purposes obviously .
My producer , Richard , wanted me to but he was over - ruled by a far greater power - my wife .

CLEVELAND , Ohio -- Kenny Huang is a man who understands .
He speaks Mandarin , Cantonese , Japanese and English .
He has an undergraduate degree from a Chinese university and postgraduate degrees from two American universities .
He knows about roads , electrical infrastructure , used to work on Wall Street and soon will own pieces of basketball teams in both China and America .
He splits his time between Hong Kong , Guangzhou and the United States .
His perspective on the world , and specifically the way Americans and Chinese relate and can do business , is unique .
When he sees the Cavaliers and LeBron James he thinks big , grand long - term ideas .
Then he executes them .
On Monday Huang ( pronounced Hwong ) finalized his first significant deal for the Cavs .
Within a few weeks he 's expected to finalize a second , even bigger , one .
The weeks and months following that have his imagination flowing , too , and much of it is tied to the team 's international superstar .
James is already one of the most recognizable athletes in China , with an intention to grow his personal brand in the mega market exponentially .
The deals Huang are forming can help James do it in Cleveland , which is where the short - term interest of most Cavs fans relates to this developing plot .
With Huang standing over their shoulders , Cavaliers and Quicken Loans Arena President Len Komoroski and Xu Yan , the Tsingtao President of Global Marketing , signed a large multi-year sponsorship agreement at The Q Monday afternoon .
Tsingtao ( CHING - dow ) is China 's most popular beer company and one of its most well - known brands .
Sort of like Budweiser in the U.S .
By the end of the year , Huang will likely finish another deal , completing the purchase of a 15 percent stake in the Cavs , representing the first major investment by the Chinese in American pro sports .
That ownership deal , signed in May during the Eastern Conference Finals , will sell former Cavs Vice Chairman David Katzman 's 15 percent to a group led by Huang .
The NBA Board of Governors is expected to approve the purchase soon .
Though no figures have been disclosed , Katzman 's stake was worth around $ 56 million when he partnered with Dan Gilbert to buy the Cavs in 2005 .
Based on the team 's current estimated value , which is $ 476 million according to Forbes magazine , the share could now be worth as much as $ 70 million . " [ Gilbert ] is a very smart guy , I like smart businessmen , " Huang said in his first American interview since forming the agreement to purchase a stake in the Cavs .
" I think we 'll be good partners . "
The primary new partner , according to sources , is Albert Hung , a wealthy Chinese investor in numerous technology businesses .
Also believed to be in the group is Adrien Cheng , a young businessman whose family operates New World Development , a massive Hong Kong conglomerate of companies .
But Huang is the dealmaker , the key to bringing the parties together .
Where this impacts the Cavs and their fans is what an intensified relationship with China means .
Huang said there will be more Chinese sponsorships to come , just the beginning of the Cavs ' growth in China and , therefore , James ' growth in a marketplace he 's been working to capture .
With an estimated 300 million basketball fans , the chance to capitalize on the Chinese fan base is potentially even greater than in the U.S.
Which is why James has been trying to promote products there , especially through Nike .
" LeBron is a very smart man and he 's doing very well with his management team , " Huang said .
" I 'm sure they are looking into a lot of endorsement opportunities .
He already has a lot of credibility in China and now I 'm sure these deals happening will bring a lot of opportunities for him there . "
Huang said interest in the Cavs has exploded in China and they have surpassed the Houston Rockets , who have Chinese national hero Yao Ming , in popularity .
The Cavs are second to only the Los Angeles Lakers in overall profile .
This year there will be 34 games broadcast on Chinese television and there are Chinese media members based in Cleveland who cover the team .
Tsingtao is buying into that , spending to appeal to Chinese fans watching the games in addition to the American fans .
For the last month there has been a Tsingtao billboard on one of the basket standards at The Q and fans will notice more signage soon .
The beer is being sold at the arena .
" There 's going to be more similar - sized deals to come , " said Huang , whose has also arranged sponsor deals with the Rockets and New York Yankees in the past .
" This is a very small piece of all the business activities going on China right now and investment in foreign teams are part of the many possibilities that are happening .
It is n't a must - do deal , but it is a trend of businesses investing outside of China . "
Perhaps soon , if things fall into place as Huang believes , they 'll be investing in James as well .
At least in China 's eyes , James could have more fans playing in Cleveland with a high - profile team , than about anywhere else .
" He can be a superstar in China with the Cavs , " Huang said .
" He 's got the potential to have more Chinese fans and become more popular in China . "
Ohio âs Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich , a strident anti-war crusader , cited a report on the floor of the House of Representatives Tuesday which claims that US tax dollars used by defense contractors to bribe the Taliban in Afghanistan ultimately help fund attacks â on our troops . â
â U.S. contractors are paying U.S. tax dollars to the Taliban in order to protect the delivery of U.S. shipments of U.S. goods to U.S. soldiers so that our soldiers can fight the Taliban , â Kucinich âs press release sent to RAW STORY states .
ADVERTISEMENT
The congressman said â in an investigative expose , The Nation magazine reveals â how the U.S. funds the Taliban â and â with Pentagon cash , contractors bribe the insurgents not to attack supply for U.S. troops . â
Kucinich continued : â Another quote : â The real secret to trucking in Afghanistan is ensuring security on the perilous roads patrolled by warlords , insurgents , tribal militias and Taliban commandeers .
The American executive I spoke to was fairly specific about it .
The army is basically paying the Taliban not to shoot at them , â and then the Taliban uses that money to shoot at our troops .
What a racket . â
â Are we in Afghanistan to fight or to fund the Taliban ?
Or both ? â Kucinich asks .
From Aram Roston âs November 11 report for the Nation :
Welcome to the wartime contracting bazaar in Afghanistan .
It is a virtual carnival of improbable characters and shady connections , with former CIA officials and ex-military officers joining hands with former Taliban and mujahedeen to collect US government funds in the name of the war effort .
In this grotesque carnival , the US military âs contractors are forced to pay suspected insurgents to protect American supply routes .
It is an accepted fact of the military logistics operation in Afghanistan that the US government funds the very forces American troops are fighting .
And it is a deadly irony , because these funds add up to a huge amount of money for the Taliban .
â It âs a big part of their income , â one of the top Afghan government security officials told The Nation in an interview .
In fact , US military officials in Kabul estimate that a minimum of 10 percent of the Pentagon âs logistics contracts âhundreds of millions of dollars âconsists of payments to insurgents .
Understanding how this situation came to pass requires untangling two threads .
The first is the insider dealing that determines who wins and who loses in Afghan business , and the second is the troubling mechanism by which â private security â ensures that the US supply convoys traveling these ancient trade routes are nât ambushed by insurgents .

Ransoms also allegedly help fund attacks on NATO troops .
The UK âs Financial Times reported on November 14 :
Although the US military says only a fraction of its cargo is lost to insurgent attacks , commanders are concerned by a more insidious threat .
Taliban fighters have turned Nato âs huge logistics chain into a big source of funds by extorting money from hauliers and kidnapping their drivers for ransom , raising hundreds of thousands of dollars a year , the companies say .
The militants â ability to prey on supply lines on both sides of the border shows how the Afghan conflict fuels a self - sustaining war economy in which the boundaries between insurgency , organised crime and banditry are blurred .
As Barack Obama , the US president , considers whet - her to declare a fresh troop surge , trucking companies are wondering whether more soldiers will mean safer roads or bigger convoys for the Taliban to milk .
â Even a small boy can hold up a truck , â said Saboor Halamey , the vice - president of Mushtair Trading and Transportation Company , a Kabul - based haulier .
â It âs a big source of money for the insurgents .
â
The US relies on an array of private contractors in Pakistan and Afghanistan to provide the thousands of trucks needed to maintain its supply lines , presenting a soft target for insurgents in search of funds .

An October story in The New York Times only briefly noted the money the Taliban earns from ransoms and â protection payments . â
Eric Schmitt reported for the Times ,

A third major source of financing for the Taliban is criminal activity , including kidnappings and protection payments from legitimate businesses seeking to operate in Taliban - controlled territory , American authorities say .
The United States has created two new entities aimed at disrupting the trafficking networks and illicit financing .
One group , the Afghan Threat Finance Cell , is located at Bagram Air Base , north of Kabul .
The second group , the Illicit Finance Task Force based in Washington , also aims to identify and disrupt the financial networks supporting terrorists and narcotics traffickers in the region .
A Democratic senator believes that it might be best to pay the Taliban fighters to lay down arms .
In an interview with PRI âs The World , Senate Armed Services Committee chairman , Senator Carl Levin ( D - MI ) spoke about his plan â to pay Taliban fighters who renounce violence against the government in Kabul . â
ADVERTISEMENT
KATY CLARK : As we heard a minute ago , the US paid insurgents in Iraq to stop fighting American troops , and it worked .
Some 90,000 Sunni militants joined the Awakening Councils in exchange for about $ 300 a month .
Now Congress wants to use that strategy in Afghanistan .
The defense spending bill that President Obama signed yesterday includes a provision allowing the Pentagon to reward Taliban fighters who renounce the insurgency .
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin was behind that provision .
Senator Levin , how exactly is this going to work .
I mean , given an Afghan government and society that âs so rife with corruption , do nât you start getting into trouble when you offer money for allegiance ?
CARL LEVIN : Well , you sure have to be cautious , but there was plenty of corruption in Iraq as well , but they worked out a plan to provide this very small stipend to about 90,000 Iraqis to switch sides , and instead of fighting us , to protect their communities .
That âs what most of them are doing .
They âre involved in security protection work to see if they ca nât make their villages and towns safer .
About 10,000 of the 100,000 young Iraqis are actually in the Iraqi government now .
But we authorized the use of these commander funds , these emergency funds , for this purpose .
But it âs also essential that there be a plan .
We do nât have a plan yet .
One of the generals , NATO generals , is working on a plan .
We should have had this in place some time ago in my judgment .
It ca nât just be throwing money at the problem , but we have to have that money ready to go if and when , and hopefully it âs soon , the plan to do this is put in place .
CLARK : And who would be handing out the money ?
Would it be US forces or the Afghan government ?
LEVIN : That âs part of the decision that could be made in the plan .
We have nât written the plan .
What we âve authorized the funds is to help fund a plan which would be written by NATO .
CLARK : Well , some US commanders refer to the $ 10 Taliban , meaning that fighters are getting about $ 10 a day to take on the US troops .
Is that what Washington might be paying ?
LEVIN : It would be a modest amount .
We do nât set the amount .
We know it will be very little , because we know that the Taliban does nât pay much , but they pay .
It âs better than nothing for these young , desperate men .
We âre only talking here about the low level folks .
We âre not talking about Taliban commanders or those who are religious fanatics .
You âre not going to be able to get them to switch sides .
CLARK : It seemed as if many of these guys who are fighting US forces over there think that they âre actually winning , so why would they take $ 10 or $ 20 to stop fighting US forces if they think they âre really going to win the whole war there ?
LEVIN : Well , the Taliban commanders are nât going to stop .
The question is , whether or not the large number of local fighters would stop .
Those people who are making bombs , attacking our vehicles , because we âre there and because they âre paid to do that , the amount of pay they âre getting is very small , and we can quite easily compete with that .
Also , there âs some real risk that they âre taking .
A lot of these young fighters are getting killed .
They âre also on the outs , in many cases , with their own communities .
You know , the Taliban is hated in Afghanistan .
It is nât just Americans hoping to use money to win Afghanistan hearts and minds .
â British forces should buy off potential Taliban recruits with â bags of gold â , according to a new army field manual published yesterday , â The Australian reported in November .
Army commanders should also talk to insurgent leaders with â blood on their hands â in order to hasten the end of the conflict in Afghanistan .
The edicts , which are contained in rewritten counter - insurgency guidelines , will be taught to all new army officers .
They mark a strategic rethink after three years in which British and Nato forces have failed to defeat the Taliban .
The manual is also a recognition that the Army âs previous doctrine for success against insurgents , which was based on the experience in Northern Ireland , is now out of date .
The new instructions came on the day that Gordon Brown went farther than before in setting out Britain âs exit strategy from Afghanistan .
The Prime Minister stated explicitly last night that he wanted troops to begin handing over districts to Afghan authorities during next year â a general election year in Britain .

Another installment in the series : â Max Craps On About Writing . â
I âve written more bad fiction than you âve read .
I âm serious .
I âve done a hundred or so drafts of nine or ten manuscripts , and let âs not even start on the shorter stuff .
Read one of my books ?
Think it could have been better ?
Well that âs what they published .
That was polished .
After a decade of wrangling paragraphs for a living , I have decided : it âs always the book âs fault .
When your scene wo nât quite come together , your novel idea wo nât stay interesting , your main character refuses to fill out : it âs not because you lack talent .
It âs because your idea is stupid .
You âre trying to push shit uphill .
And you may be a good shit - pusher , with a range of clever and effective shit - pushing techniques , but still : it âs going to be hard , frustrating , and ultimately you âll discover you still do nât have your shit together .
I used to believe that an author needed an iron will .
Discipline , to forge through the bitter dark and emerge clutching a tattered , tear - stained first draft .
Now I think that âs a good way to lose nine months on a bad idea .
Because if you have any skill as a word - slinger , you can make a bad idea sound okay .
Not brilliant .
But mildly interesting , at least for a while .
Keep pushing that shit , though , and depression sets in .
That âs when you think : I âm not good enough .
Or : If I were more disciplined I âd finish this .
Or : I ca nât write .
Sure you can .
You just ca nât write this and stay interested , because it âs a stupid idea .
It âs predictable .
It âs been done .
It had one intriguing aspect and you tapped that out within the first three pages .
You do nât want to write this because your body is bone - bored of it .
A good idea excites you .
It makes each day of writing a little joy .
A good idea , when you peel it , has more good ideas inside .
It makes you feel clever .
It does nât need to be articulated .
It might sound silly when you try to explain it .
( Do nât try to explain it . )
But you know there âs something there .
It pulls you to the keyboard .
It spills words from your fingertips .
Some days , you lose your grip ; you wander from the path and lose sight of where you were .
But a good idea calls out to you .
A while ago I had The Block .
The way I got out of it was to write a page of something new every day .
The first week , I flushed out a lot of ideas that had been humming around the back of my brain , promising me they were brilliant .
They were nât .
I captured them one page at a time and set them aside .
The second week I wrote two things that were kind of interesting .
Not very interesting .
But not abominations , either .
It was possible to imagine that in some alternate universe of very low standards , they could become novels .
Not popular novels .
But still .
The third week , I wrote something interesting .
And I discovered I could write .
That the reason I âd been stuck was nât because I âd forgotten where the keys were .
It was because the story I was trying to make work sucked .
So that âs my advice to anyone mired in a story .
Do nât blame yourself .
You âre great .
It âs just that stupid idea .
In recent years , it had become as predictable as elections in North Korea â singer wins X Factor , singer 's debut single goes to No 1 .
So when Joe McElderry won the TV talent contest , he was no doubt confident he would celebrate Christmas at the top of the charts .
Alas for the 18 - year - old from South Shields , it was n't to be : a song almost his own age denied him the top spot after a successful online campaign .
Killing In The Name , an expletive - heavy rock song first released in 1992 by the Californian rock band Rage Against the Machine , won the battle for Christmas top spot on the basis of downloads only .
It sold about 500,000 copies last week , about 50,000 more than The Climb , McElderry 's earnest ballad .
Depending on your view , the Rage victory was either a delicious dismantling of the X Factor Christmas No 1 juggernaut or a cynical assault on the festive charts .
There was , though , some indignation when it emerged both records had links to Simon Cowell , the entertainment industry 's favourite pantomime baddy .
With the Rage track having been released by Sony , and McElderry 's by Cowell 's Syco , a Sony subsidiary , some claimed the high - waisted X Factor judge would emerge triumphant whichever act won the chart battle .
Rock fan 's campaign
But arguably the real victor here was a rock fan from Essex who started a Facebook group a month ago with the ( then ) pie - in - the - sky idea of usurping the X Factor winner from the no 1 slot .
Jon Morter , 35 , a part - time rock DJ and logistics expert from South Woodham Ferrers , near Chelmsford , decided it would be a bit of a giggle to start a campaign to encourage people to buy a record with pretty much the opposite vibe to the X Factor winner 's ballad .
While McElderry urges listeners to " keep the faith " , the Rage track is best known for its now - ironic refrain : " Fuck you , I wo n't do what you tell me . "
He had tried a similar wheeze last year , when he attempted to get Rick Astley 's Never Gonna Give You Up to the top of the Christmas charts .
Alexandra Burke , the 2008 X Factor winner , won that battle , but having succeeded in propelling Astley to " the lower echelons of the chart " , Morter was emboldened to try again .
This time , he was helped by the comedian Peter Serafinowicz , who on 15 December urged his 268,000 - plus Twitter followers to join in , and it snowballed from there .
By the time Paul McCartney and former X Factor winner Steve Brookstein had pledged their support , poor McElderry seemed doomed .
When the Guardian broke the news to Morter that he had won , he was initially lost for words .
" Oh bloody hell , " he said , as the consequences of what he had done became clear .
Composing himself , he said : " I think it just shows that in this day and age , if you want to say something , then you can â with the help of the internet and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter .
If enough people are with you , you can beat the status quo . "
But does n't he feel guilty about denying McElderry his first No 1 ?
" Umm. no , " he said .
" Not really .
At the end of the day he has had a Christmas no 2 with his debut single , which is still a phenomenal achievement . "
Gracious in defeat
Morter , a big Iron Maiden fan , said the choice of a relatively obscure Miley Cyrus cover for McElderry 's single helped the Rage campaign : " If he had released Do n't Stop Believing [ the Journey song McElderry sang in an X Factor heat ] we would have been dead and buried . " McElderry took his defeat graciously , saying : " Fair play to the guys who have organised the Facebook campaign â it's been exciting to be part of a much - hyped battle and they definitely deserve congratulations .
This time last year I never thought for one minute I 'd win The X Factor , never mind having a single out .
I 'm just delighted to be in the charts . "
Despite Cowell giving some pseudo - grumpy interviews , he phoned Morter on Saturday night to congratulate him on the campaign .
" He commended us on how we had marketed the campaign , and said if we won , he would be the first to congratulate us , " Morter said .
Rage Against the Machine have pledged to give all profits of the single to the homelessness charity Shelter , and will perform a free victory gig in the UK to thank those who bought their single .
McElderry is off on an Alpine skiing holiday to ponder his next move .
In what she might herself term a " shark - bait " piece in Salon , Lynn Harris asks : why does everyone hate mommies ?
Advertisement
Harris feels that , lately , there 's an unprecedented amount of vitriol directed at moms .
Maybe people were nicer to our moms , maybe people were n't .
In one way or another , our culture has always been weird about mothers .
Love / hate , Jocasta / Joan Crawford , supermom / " evil " stepmom , you name it .
But right now , in some circles , it seems we 're leaning toward hate .
Yes , even when you control for the anonymous online jerkwad factor .
And yes , even â perhaps especially ? â as more and more blogs , books , sitcoms and movies , successful or not , explore with unprecedented candor the experience of being a ( white , middle - class ) mother .
Advertisement
In Harris ' view , it 's no coincidence that this is all about women .
And it 's not only about " parenting , " either .
No , I am telling you , it 's about mothers .
( White mothers , generally , and usually urban ones â if in part because they 're out and about on sidewalks and subways , not cloistered in carpools and playrooms . )
You know them , or at least their epithets : " Stroller moms , " the " stroller mafia , " the particularly objectionable " stroller Nazis " â and while we 're at it , the " helicopter moms " and " sanctimommies . "

She adds ,
Women â still â are not " supposed " to take up space .
Mothers , in particular .
We are â still â supposed to remain in the background , doing whatever it is mothers do , smiling .
We grow a belly , we need a seat , we say " excuse me , please , " we speak up ( or , God forbid , blog ) , and we 've crossed the line , said or asked too much , become " entitled . "

Okay .
I love children .
I dote on babies .
I plan to have kids at some point .
I 'm not a child - hating grinch with a vendetta against " breeders , " as the haters would have it .
And yet , I totally get the mommy rage .
And Harris ' reaction is disingenuous :
It 's not about the kids .
It 's not even about the stroller - blocking .
It 's about the parents .
And as she makes very clear , it 's a self - selecting , moneyed , privileged and child - centric group of parents - a tiny percentage of the parents in this country and in the world at large .
Much of the baby industry may be geared towards this population , but it 's still a very small one .
Yes , I said parents .
Now , while I 'm well able to believe that there 's plenty of societal ambivalence coming out here towards women , this is an equal - opportunity resentment .
While it 's usually moms we see , when one does see an indulgent helicopter dad ( and do you ever ! ) it provokes exactly the same reactions .
I could spin you a little yarn about a father , an ill - behaved , angelic flaxen - haired child named after a jazz musician and the artisanal bread booth at the greenmarket , but there 's been enough snarking .
And the problem with satirizing such a population ( and again - it's a specific population , as Harris makes very clear ) is that it 's beyond parody .
Yes , there 's a class element here .
But , come on , it 's not just a class thing : if this were just a bunch of wealthy parents with nannies and fancy baby clothes , it would be a very different matter .
It 's the combination of smugness and obliviousness , Berkeley ethics funded by serious money , of campaigning for liberal politicians while complaining about nanny problems .
It 's people talking knowingly about the obliviousness of the 50s and Betty Draper 's terrible parenting and knowing they 're superior , while a toddler rolls on the floor under other coffee drinkers ' feet ( also this weekend ) .
It 's not that people just mind the strollers taking up the street ; it 's then getting mad when you wo n't move for those strollers .
In short , it 's the narcissism of single people , but expanded to fit a whole family .
As Neal Pollack told the Times , " ' I do n't think it 's a bad thing that people want to continue a semblance of their pre-parenthood lifestyle ... Going to rock shows and bars , he added , is " just what their lives were . ' "
This is really it in a nutshell : the sense some of these parents give is that they 'll have it all , on their terms .
There will be no concessions made : instead , the world will concede .

Harris brings up Park Slope , the nexus of all New York 's fabled mommy - snark .
There was a minor fracas in '08 when Union Hall , a bar and music venue in that neighborhood , asked moms not to bring strollers and mobile kids to the bar , because the space was not kid - proof and it was a legal issue .
Parents across the blogs were up in arms - so much so that the bar had to take it back .
This was , in some eyes , a good answer to Harris 's question .
In sum , no one reasonable hates parents .
What people do n't like is inconsiderate self - absorbed parents who expect the world to be reordered .
Of course , what 's hard is that defensive , self - righteous and oblivious parents are more than matched by total assholes on the other side of the aisle , who shout their kid -hate from the rooftops .
My initial reaction to Harris ' piece was , what ?
We do n't dislike moms !
And then I read the comments .
Here are a few , just from page 1 :
" we do n't want to hate you , but we will if you deserve it . "
" I resent that my choice to be child - free subjects me to condescension and pity , even though I 'm not the one taking up the whole aisle at Target with said SUV stroller and screaming , unruly brats named after medieval professions . "
" Quite simply I hate your baby . "
" Having children these days is something that highly uncreative women do to fill their lives .
PERIOD . "
" You write vapid , pointless articles about how hard it is to have a kid during the most wide - open , accepting and privileged time and place (s ) in history . "
" One child per person .
Period .
The right we all share is to ensure life for everyone not just our own . "

Helpful as these comments are , they do serve to underlie the total fruitlessness of this argument .
No one is backing down .
It 's like oil and water coming together , forming a translucent puddle on the internet .
Now , in some lights , that oil floating on top of the water is beautiful .
But most of us would rather step over it - and help our kids do the same .
" I hate moms , " sighed my friend Cora the other day .
We were pushing her one - year - old in a stroller .
And I knew what she meant .

Radioactive Waste German Company Sent Nuclear Material for Open - Air Storage in Siberia
The Western media reported last week on how the German company Urenco shipped nuclear material to Siberia , where the highly toxic waste was stored in containers in the open air .
The company has stopped deliveries and will store the material with higher standards in Germany in the future .
Adventure stories rarely come more epic than that of Knut Haugland , the Norwegian resistance fighter who died on Christmas Day at the age of 92 .
His exploits were already the stuff of legend even before he joined Thor Heyerdahl 's crew aboard his balsa wood raft , Kon-Tiki .
Together they not only conquered the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean using only the most primitive of technologies â but in doing so , they helped rejuvenate the crushed spirit of human endeavour in the bleak aftermath of the Second World War .
A heavily decorated commando who escaped three times from the clutches of the Nazis , his bravery and endurance gave rise to one of the most enduring legends of the Second World War â one retold in spectacular style in a Hollywood movie .
Yesterday Haugland 's successor as director of the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo , where thousands flock each year to relive the optimism and excitement of that intrepid voyage , announced that the former radio operator had succumbed to natural causes in a city hospital , closing the final chapter on an extraordinary life .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Haugland 's death , following that of Heyerdahl himself in 2002 , marks the passing of the last of the six - man crew that set sail from Callao in Peru in April 1947 , bound several thousand nautical miles for the far - flung islands of Polynesia based on little more than an anthropological hunch .
That journey set a new benchmark for modern adventurers , spawning an international best - selling book published in 66 languages and an Oscar - winning film in which Haugland played himself .
It also helped popularise Heyerdahl 's passionately held belief that the great oceans had been highways and not barriers for the movement of ancient seafaring civilisations .
Haugland 's role aboard the Kon -Tiki was that of radio operator , keeping the outside world aware of the raft 's stately progress during the long drift westwards on the currents off South America .
He had trained in the technology before the war and fought against the invading German forces until Hitler 's troops overran Norway in 1940 .
Under occupation the then 23 - year - old gave the impression of having settled down as an Oslo factory worker but was in fact a major figure in the Norwegian resistance movement .
His first brush with the Nazi authorities came in August 1941 when he was arrested but escaped .
In exile , he joined the Norwegian Independent Company , a celebrated band of patriotic Nordic fighters assembled under the auspices of the newly - formed British Special Operations Executive which was planning raids in occupied northern Europe .
Key to the British strategy was the establishment of a network of radio sets and operators allowing for the co-ordination of anti-Nazi operations .
The most famous of these became known as the Norwegian Heavy Water Sabotage â an ambitious raid on the Norsk Hydro Rjukan plant at Vermork .
The operation provided the sensational plot line for Anthony Mann 's 1965 film The Heroes of Telemark , starring Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris .
Appropriately enough it was being broadcast once again on the BBC yesterday as news of Haugland 's death was announced .
Yet Haugland was always unhappy with the depiction of events in the film and particularly the use of the word hero .
" I never use that word about myself or my friends .
We just did a job , " he said in one of his last interviews to mark the 60th anniversary of the raid .
" Forty - one men were killed and it could have been avoided .
Because of the loss of life you should n't glorify the story . "
The plan of action grew out of Allied fears that the Nazis were preparing to build their own atomic bomb .
One of the key components in the production process was deuterium oxide , otherwise known as heavy water .
The hydro plant at Vermork provided the Germans with a ready supply as a by - product of local fertilizer production capable of manufacturing 12 tons of the stuff a year .
Before the war the French had carried away much of the reserves but while the hydro plant was still operable the threat remained .
In November 1942 a forward party of four local resistance fighters , including Haugland , was parachuted onto the Norwegian wilderness from where they would ski to a base close to the plant .
It was their task to report back to the British after memorising the blueprint of the facility .
This first phase was codenamed Operation Grouse and was achieved successfully .
But the second phase â Operation Freshman â was a disaster .
Despite the harshness of the Nordic terrain and savage weather , the British planned to land two gliders packed with Royal Engineers and members of the 1st Parachute Regiment on a frozen lake .
They took off from Wick in Caithness pulled by Halifax bombers .
One plane and both gliders crashed with much loss of life .
The crew that were not killed outright were interrogated by the Gestapo before being put to death .
The failure not only alerted the Germans to the importance of the heavy water site , but also consigned the Norwegian advance party to a gruelling winter on the remote Hardanger Plateau where they were forced to endure temperatures of minus 20 F .
Food was so short they resorted to eating the contents of a reindeer 's stomach .
Haugland 's job was to keep in contact with the British using a radio he had fashioned from a stolen fishing rod and an old car battery .
Each morning at 1 am he would make contact , often unable to control the chattering of his teeth .
The final phase of the sabotage began in February 1943 .
Named after SOE head Sir Charles Hambro 's favourite grouse shooting moor , Operation Gunnerside saw a further six Norwegian commandos parachuted into the target area .
Luck played its part and the two groups were united , launching their assault on the now heavily mined and floodlit plant .
To bypass the exposed bridge which led to the plant they waded through snow and forded an icy river before scaling a sheer ravine side to reach their target via an old railway line .
In the end the cells producing the heavy water were blown up without a shot being fired .
The Norwegians made their way back to the plateau undetected , leaving behind a British gun to divert suspicion from the local resistance , including the mole working inside the hydro plant .
Three thousand Germans were involved in the hunt for the saboteurs and though it was revealed that the Nazi high command had not in fact been planning to build a bomb , the operation came to be regarded as a triumph of its kind .
After surviving this , the perils of the Pacific held little fear for Haugland .
He had first met Heyerdahl at a military training camp in Britain in 1944 where he had fled once more after another close scrape with the Gestapo .
Sufficiently impressed with the anthropologist 's powerful personality and controversial theories on Polynesian migration patterns , he agreed to join the expedition , taking a break from a military career which was to see him rise to the rank of lieutenant colonel before retiring from his position as head of the Norwegian Resistance Museum in 1983 .
In 1947 , the desire to sail across the Pacific baffled many in a world still mourning the deaths of thousands of mariners who lost their lives in oil - choked seas during the war .
Yet few could resist the spirit of resurgent individualism and heroic adventure which the Kon - Tiki project embodied , even if many were baffled by Heyerdahl 's devotion to the idea that New World mariners had populated Polynesia from the east rather than the west .
The raft itself was named after a mythical seafarer who , according to the Aymara Indians of Lake Titicaca in modern - day Bolivia , had set sail over the horizon never to be seen again .
Despite the reliance on primitive technology â the raft was built by the men on the dockside based on drawings dating back to the time of the conquistadores â the expedition allowed itself the luxury of a hand - cranked radio .
Haugland spent much of the 101 days at sea briefing the outside world .
The voyage came to a halt when the vessel was grounded on a reef off Raroia Island , part of the Tuamotu group , some 3,770 nautical miles from the Peruvian coast .
They were eventually rescued from the tiny islet after several days , and taken back to Tahiti by a French schooner .
An expedition which included Heyerdahl 's grandson duplicated the voyage in 2006 .
Ratchet & Clank Dev Debates Graphics vs. Framerate , ' Probably ' Not Making More 60 FPS Games
" There is virtually no advantage in sales or reviews of a 60 fps game versus a 30 fps game , " reads a blog post from Mike Acton , the studio's engine director .
" However it does appear that gameplay scores are also influenced by graphics scores .
i.e. Better looking games appear to be more ' fun ' to reviewers . "
Acton explained that " only a minority ... notice framerate as a significant issue of any kind " and noted that some players even view slowdown " as a reward for creating or forcing a complex setup ... as in , ' Damn !
Did you see that ?
That was crazy ! ' "
Though " framerate is still important to us " and " should be as consistent as possible and ... never interfere with the game , " Acton concluded that " it 's not on the same pedestal it was before " and " A Crack in Time will probably be Insomniac 's last 60 fps game . "
" The correlation with review scores is clear , " he added .
" When there is a clear choice between framerate and improved graphics , graphics should win . "
Curiously , Insomniac 's study also " found no direct correlation between gameplay scores and final scores . "
The independent developer has yet to formally unveil its next project , with a recent sign implying that the studio is readying a new Resistance entry .
Japan 's national debt stands at 170 per cent of GDP and measures are urgently required to bring that figure down , but there is anger that while the public is being forced to go without , it appears that the same rules are not being applied to politicians .
According to hopeful U.K. tech developers , the future of the computer chip is n't silicon , it 's plastic .
And the future of computing wo n't take place on a hard drive â it 'll be happening everywhere .

English engineers and economists alike have been extolling the virtues of plastic - based electronics , which have emerged as a fourth - quarter great hope for the U.K. economy .
One of the technologies people are most excited about is a method of printing circuits directly onto sheets of polyethylene terephthalate , or PET , one of the most common kinds of consumer plastic â it's what a majority of soda bottles are made of .
The plastic - circuitry proponents are quick to point out that traditional silicon chips , comparatively speaking , are expensive and laborious to produce , and that a circuit mapped on plastic is more durable than one etched in metal .
Moreover , the printing process used for PET circuits â a cousin to the kind of ink - jet printing most of us are familiar with â can be applied to almost any surface , plastic or otherwise .

Thus , if the industry takes off the way silicon chips did , we could get to the point where we have complex electronics not just in our computers and hand - held devices , but pretty much anywhere a manufacturer thinks would be a good idea .
Paul Smith , a lab manager at the Xerox Research Center of Canada in Ontario , recently spoke to CNN about the potential applications : " a little display on your prescription bottle that will warn you if you 've taken your medicine already , " or " hospital gowns where a display is in the fabric that provides up - to - the - second vital stats . "
A greater ubiquity of electronic displays , of course , would almost certainly mean a greater ubiquity of advertisements , not to mention an even higher number of information - and entertainment - based distractions than we currently live with .
Writing this week in Wales Online , Robin Turner speculated about the possibility of " breakfast cereal boxes " that broadcast " You Tube - like films and announcements " â because if there 's one conceptual marriage that makes sense , it 's cereal boxes and YouTube .

But there 's no reason to think we 'll see these changes anytime soon .
The British government recently launched a 28 million - pound ( or $ 45 million ) initiative to keep plastics development robust , but given the U.K.'s swelling national debt and political disagreement over how to jump - start the private sector , it may be hard for a while to move currency around for experimental - tech projects .
Even once R&D gets underway in earnest , we do n't know whether consumers will actually want to blanket their lives in circuitry .
And finally , it 's worth noting that PET tends to degrade somewhat in the manufacturing process , producing a residual compound that smells vaguely like fruit .
It 's one thing to live in a world where computer displays surround you at every turn , but if everything smells of fruit as well , it just might prove to be a deal - breaker .

maxes out new line of credit .
The state 's cash - flow problems are so dire that it took less than two weeks for government to tap the entire $ 700 million loan it had borrowed to help with short - term needs .
State Treasurer Dean Martin on Wednesday said that means the state will have to revert to some internal borrowing to keep money flowing in the state 's checking account .
The shortage developed when the Treasurer 's Office had to make a Dec. 1 payment of $ 389 million to the state 's schools , which exceeded the cash on hand .
To make up the difference , Martin borrowed $ 73 million from internal state accounts .
Those amounts will be replenished as tax collections roll in .
On Nov. 19 , the state finalized a loan agreement with Bank of America for $ 700 million , the first time since the Depression that Arizona has needed to turn to an outside borrower .

Matt Fecht - 2009 Detroit Marathon 3rd Place Finisher Views - 3898 6 Comments
RM : What has lead you to run marathons ?
MF : I think that I was built for the marathon .
I am not the fastest guy in the world ; I do nât have the gears that a lot of other runners have .
I have to just grind out the whole race and that fits into my character .
I feel that I am tough enough and fast enough to run with these guys in a race of this distance .
It kind of nullifies the leg speed of a lot of the best guys around .
Also I like the mental and physical test that it gives you .
You have to be tough not only physically but also mentally .
I enjoy pushing my limits to see just how good I can be .
I like to see just how tough I can be .
These things are big gut checks .
I ca nât see myself being as competitive in any other race .
RM :
In preparation for this year 's Detroit Marathon , what was your training like ?
When did you start feeling pain in your legs ?
MF : It started off in June with around 70 miles a week with no speed just some base mileage .
I then progressed to about 150 miles a week for a good 6 weeks from august till the middle of September .
I did most of the training on my own .
The weeks consisted of 3 workouts a week , Usually something like 3 by 3 miles and 8 by 1 mile and then some sort of tempo run for the workouts .
I ran long once a week something between 16 - 22 miles .
I run two times a day usually 10 in the morning and 12 miles in the afternoon .
I ran most of the workouts by myself , some of the workouts were done with the team at Wayne State , and a few early workouts were done with Nick Allen .
I have a 10 mile loop around my house that I would do every morning .
A typical day for me would be wake up at 5:30 go to Warren Mott High School and work out with my strength and conditioning coaches Russ Shifferd and Shauhen Tahrebandi .
Those guys really helped me workout what I needed to get in great shape for the marathon , with sport specific exercises .
After that I would be out the door to run 10 miles around Warren .
Time for a quick shower then to t sub in the classroom or work at the City of Warren doing odds and ends things .
Then off to practice with Wayne State for 12 more miles .
After that back to the City of Warren to work again .
Then about once a week I would go visit Dr. Kyle Ormsbee to get stretched out .
So that was a typical day for me during the training leading up to the race .
I started feeling pain in my foot about 3 - 4 weeks out of the marathon .
I made the decision that I would go through the race still .
I had put in all the work and wanted to make a go of it .
I never got x-rays on the foot I did nât want to see or hear what was wrong with it .
I was told I had a stress reaction in the 3rd and 4th metatarsals , and that there is a good chance that it could break during the marathon .
I weighed the risk and thought that I would be ok during the race .
The last 4 weeks of training were not very good .
I was babying my foot and really altering my training just to get through it .
I took some low mileage days , in hindsight should have taken some days completely off .
Just kept training and getting ready .
RM :
What made you continue to run through the pain , leading up to the marathon ?
MF : Just the fact of all the training that I had put in .
I had all the support of all my guys and girls at WSU and at home with family and friends .
I did nât think that it would end up as bad as it did .
I feel that with my personality and character that I would not let myself stop .
Probably a little bit of bull headed mentality .
I think that that is something that I have to learn from .
Taking time off when I need it .
I feel sometimes that since I do not have the talent of a lot of these guys out there I have to be tougher and get more days and more miles in order to compete with them .
It is a lesson that is hard to learn and to know when to push and when to take a break .
As a distance runner you are bred to embrace pain and love it .
Sometimes you need to learn to listen to that pain .
RM : How would you describe how the Detroit Marathon played out ?
Did you think about dropping out ?
Do you have regrets ?
MF : Well it played out in the first few miles like I thought it would .
Nick and Chad were running nice and easy for the first 5 - 6 miles and I was right with them for that part of the race .
I wanted to go out at 5:18 - 5:25 pace .
After the 7 mile mark they started to pick up the pace to faster then I wanted to go .
I thought that this was going to happen .
This is part of the reason I like to do workouts myself , at some point in the race you are going to be by yourself so I want to be prepared for it .
After they broke I kept my 5:20 pace .
It was pretty windy in the morning so it got tough after they broke but still was feeling real strong .
I came through the half in 1:10 something , right about where I wanted to be .
I saw some friends and family at around 15 miles , at that point I was about 30 - 45 seconds back of the leaders .
Still within striking distance .
Then I hit the 16 mile mark and at that point everything started going wrong .
I felt my foot break .
There was no doubt about it .
I knew it as soon as it happened .
My first thought was to keep going , it is just how I am wired , Tough through and gut things out .
I knew that I had a solid lead on 4th place so I wanted to keep going .
I kept running as close to normal as I could .
My pace was slowing to about 5:30 âs was trying not to think about the pain but it kept getting worse .
Right before mile 20 I was still only about 1:30 back of the leaders , I was pretty excited about that and tried to start back on pace but it was nât happening .
At 20 and a half I felt some more things breaking in my foot and at that point started to slow to about 6 flat miles .
The pain was really intense .
If I had not had so much help from my family and friends out there I would not have made it through .
My last 2 miles I think were about 14 minutes just could nât wait for it to be over .
I think I made it 2 steps across the finish and then just dropped to the ground .
I thought about dropping out I think 3 or 4 times per mile in the last 6 miles .
The pain was so intense and I could feel things keep breaking in those last few miles .
I had Kevin deBear and Dan Kapadia riding their bikes around and I saw them about every half mile and that helped to get me through .
They also wanted to make sure that I got medical help asap if I was going to need it .
If there was not money on the line and a podium finish on the line I think that I would have dropped out .
I think that to an extent I have a few regrets about continuing to run on the broken foot .
I am going to be out a lot longer than originally would have been .
Also not sure when I am going to be able to come back , or if I am going to be able to get back to the level that I was at .
So it is kind of scary to think about that .
I have asked myself that question every day was it worth it .
I figure at least I have a story to tell my kids one day .
And I think that the team at Wayne State has some new respect for me when I tell them to tough out a hard workout or place in the race .
RM :
What lessons have you learned that you will apply down the road ?
Barring you fully recover and are able to run marathons down the road , will you ?
MF : I think that I am starting to realize how far I can push my body .
I think that 150 miles a week right now with all the other things that I have going on in my life right now is probably a little bit too much right now .
With coaching and working two jobs it is rough to find the time to put in those kinds of miles right now .
I need to spend more time sleeping and relaxing .
With the way my schedule is right now it is just not possible to do that many miles right now .
I think that I have also learned that taking the first few miles easy in the marathon will help you to finish faster down the stretch in the last few miles in the marathon .
This past winter when I went and ran the Disney Marathon in Florida , I jogged the first 20 miles at 550 - 6 minute pace .
Then came in the last 6.2 miles at 515 pace .
I learned a lot that day just going out there and jogging .
I feel that I will definitely run marathons in the future .
The goal of making it to the Olympic marathon trials is still there .
If I have to take a year off to recover from this injury I am going to do that and come back as healthy as can be .
I know that I will recover from this it is just a matter of time .
The one thing I will not do this time is come back to fast .
I feel like I do not have to rush to come back from this .
The more time off the better and stronger I am going to come back .
RM : How have you enjoyed going from college distance runner at Wayne State to being an assistant coach ?
Is it tough not racing with the guys ?
MF : As you well know the transition from competition to coaching is a little bit difficult .
It has been an adventure .
I have learned a great deal with how to train and how to interact with a team .
Rick Cummins has been a tremendous help to me as a runner and as a coach .
I feel like I have really grown in the past 4 years as a coach and a runner .
The way the team reacts to what I say has changed a lot over the past 4 years .
In the first year or so there was not a lot of respect as a coach I was still seen as just one of the guys .
However , now there is a great deal of respect for me as a coach .
I think that it is something that you need to earn .
I think that rick also has a lot more trust in me and my ability as a coach as well .
It is definitely hard not to be out there racing with the guys .
As I sit there and watch the race it is tough not to want to put on the warrior uniform and get out there and help them .
I think the thing I miss most is just the team comradely .
We have a great team on the menâs and the women âs side , I really miss the team aspect of it all .
But it is also nice to be done and not have the pressure to have to go out and compete at the collegiate level .
I am happy that I have moved past that chapter of my running career and now have the ability to pursue my own running goals .
Matt Fecht was the 3rd place finisher in this years Detroit Marathon .
He crossed the finish line in 2:27.46 .
The interesting part for Matt was that he had fractured several bones along the way .
Read on to find out more about his painful adventure .
I think that I was built for the marathon .
I am not the fastest guy in the world ; I do nât have the gears that a lot of other runners have .
I have to just grind out the whole race and that fits into my character .
I feel that I am tough enough and fast enough to run with these guys in a race of this distance .
It kind of nullifies the leg speed of a lot of the best guys around .
Also I like the mental and physical test that it gives you .
You have to be tough not only physically but also mentally .
I enjoy pushing my limits to see just how good I can be .
I like to see just how tough I can be .
These things are big gut checks .
I ca nât see myself being as competitive in any other race .
It started off in June with around 70 miles a week with no speed just some base mileage .
I then progressed to about 150 miles a week for a good 6 weeks from august till the middle of September .
I did most of the training on my own .
The weeks consisted of 3 workouts a week , Usually something like 3 by 3 miles and 8 by 1 mile and then some sort of tempo run for the workouts .
I ran long once a week something between 16 - 22 miles .
I run two times a day usually 10 in the morning and 12 miles in the afternoon .
I ran most of the workouts by myself , some of the workouts were done with the team at Wayne State , and a few early workouts were done with Nick Allen .
I have a 10 mile loop around my house that I would do every morning .
A typical day for me would be wake up at 5:30 go to Warren Mott High School and work out with my strength and conditioning coaches Russ Shifferd and Shauhen Tahrebandi .
Those guys really helped me workout what I needed to get in great shape for the marathon , with sport specific exercises .
After that I would be out the door to run 10 miles around Warren .
Time for a quick shower then to t sub in the classroom or work at the City of Warren doing odds and ends things .
Then off to practice with Wayne State for 12 more miles .
After that back to the City of Warren to work again .
Then about once a week I would go visit Dr. Kyle Ormsbee to get stretched out .
So that was a typical day for me during the training leading up to the race .
I started feeling pain in my foot about 3 - 4 weeks out of the marathon .
I made the decision that I would go through the race still .
I had put in all the work and wanted to make a go of it .
I never got x-rays on the foot I did nât want to see or hear what was wrong with it .
I was told I had a stress reaction in the 3rd and 4th metatarsals , and that there is a good chance that it could break during the marathon .
I weighed the risk and thought that I would be ok during the race .
The last 4 weeks of training were not very good .
I was babying my foot and really altering my training just to get through it .
I took some low mileage days , in hindsight should have taken some days completely off .
Just kept training and getting ready .
Just the fact of all the training that I had put in .
I had all the support of all my guys and girls at WSU and at home with family and friends .
I did nât think that it would end up as bad as it did .
I feel that with my personality and character that I would not let myself stop .
Probably a little bit of bull headed mentality .
I think that that is something that I have to learn from .
Taking time off when I need it .
I feel sometimes that since I do not have the talent of a lot of these guys out there I have to be tougher and get more days and more miles in order to compete with them .
It is a lesson that is hard to learn and to know when to push and when to take a break .
As a distance runner you are bred to embrace pain and love it .
Sometimes you need to learn to listen to that pain .
Well it played out in the first few miles like I thought it would .
Nick and Chad were running nice and easy for the first 5 - 6 miles and I was right with them for that part of the race .
I wanted to go out at 5:18 - 5:25 pace .
After the 7 mile mark they started to pick up the pace to faster then I wanted to go .
I thought that this was going to happen .
This is part of the reason I like to do workouts myself , at some point in the race you are going to be by yourself so I want to be prepared for it .
After they broke I kept my 5:20 pace .
It was pretty windy in the morning so it got tough after they broke but still was feeling real strong .
I came through the half in 1:10 something , right about where I wanted to be .
I saw some friends and family at around 15 miles , at that point I was about 30 - 45 seconds back of the leaders .
Still within striking distance .
Then I hit the 16 mile mark and at that point everything started going wrong .
I felt my foot break .
There was no doubt about it .
I knew it as soon as it happened .
My first thought was to keep going , it is just how I am wired , Tough through and gut things out .
I knew that I had a solid lead on 4th place so I wanted to keep going .
I kept running as close to normal as I could .
My pace was slowing to about 5:30 âs was trying not to think about the pain but it kept getting worse .
Right before mile 20 I was still only about 1:30 back of the leaders , I was pretty excited about that and tried to start back on pace but it was nât happening .
At 20 and a half I felt some more things breaking in my foot and at that point started to slow to about 6 flat miles .
The pain was really intense .
If I had not had so much help from my family and friends out there I would not have made it through .
My last 2 miles I think were about 14 minutes just could nât wait for it to be over .
I think I made it 2 steps across the finish and then just dropped to the ground .
I thought about dropping out I think 3 or 4 times per mile in the last 6 miles .
The pain was so intense and I could feel things keep breaking in those last few miles .
I had Kevin deBear and Dan Kapadia riding their bikes around and I saw them about every half mile and that helped to get me through .
They also wanted to make sure that I got medical help asap if I was going to need it .

HOW MUCH ARE METEORITES WORTH ?
A GUIDE TO COLLECTING AND THE METEORITE MARKETPLACE
The fourth in a series of articles by Geoffrey Notkin , Aerolite Meteorites
Meteorite Collecting - The Early Days
When I was a little boy growing up in England in the late 1960s , my greatest treat was traveling up to London âs marvelous Geological Museum ( now part of the Natural History Museum , London ) to visit their mineral and meteorite collections .
At that time nearly all known meteorites were housed in universities and museums and private ownership was not commonplace .
What Are Meteorites ?
The pioneering American meteorite scientist Harvey H. Nininger opened his Meteorite Museum next to Route 66 in Arizona in 1946 and was one of the first people to start offering meteorite specimens for sale to the public .
A few of the natural history supply companies such as Ward 's Natural Science were also a source for meteorite specimens but , for the most part , space rocks were the domain of academia and a few eccentric collectors .
During the 1970s and early ' 80s bold enthusiasts such as Robert Haag , Allan Langheinrich , Marvin Kilgore , Blaine Reed and Edwin Thompson began turning their passion for space rocks into legitimate businesses and the modern world of meteorite collecting was born .
In the pre-Internet days , with no popular print publication aimed at the budding space rock collector , it was difficult to meet fellow enthusiasts .
The magazines Astronomy and Sky & Telescope would occasionally publish articles on meteorites ; sometimes a small ad for " Meteorites " could be found among the back pages of those publications and the early dealers mailed out newsletters and handmade catalogs to their small customer bases .
Today , space rocks are readily available from many different outlets and the quarterly Meteorite magazine caters to the space rock enthusiast , as does the monthly online publication Meteorite Times and the Meteorite Mailing List ( online listserve ) .
There are a number of people , like myself , who work with meteorites full time , and a multitude of collector / dealers who operate part time meteorite - related businesses in order to help underwrite the cost of expanding their own personal collections .
How Valuable are Meteorites ?
Meteorites are typically sold by weight .
The meteorite collecting community uses the metric system so weights are measured in grams and kilograms , and dimensions in centimeters and millimeters .
As is the case with most collectibles , the commercial value of a meteorite is determined by a number of factors including rarity of type , provenance , condition of preservation , and beauty or aesthetic appeal .
It is important to note that new and noteworthy meteorite finds should always be made available to the scientific community for study .
Once a meteorite has been analyzed and classified by academia , surplus specimens find their way onto the commercial market .
The process of acceptance into the official scientific literature actually adds commercial value to a meteorite .
Meteorite prices vary from one source to another but the numbers quoted here are typical of retail values in today âs marketplace .
Unclassified stone chondrites picked up by nomads wandering in the Sahara Deserts are readily available for about $ 0.50 / gram .
Attractive stones from the Gao - Guenie witnessed fall ( Burkina Faso , Africa , March 5 , 1960 ) can be purchased for about $ 1.50 / gram and a top quality one - kilogram specimen of the Campo del Cielo iron meteorite from Chaco Province , Argentina can be yours for about $ 400 .
The Russian iron Sikhote - Alin ( fell February 12 , 1947 ) is the largest single meteorite event in modern recorded history and individuals â meteorite specimens which landed as one intact piece , rather than exploding on or near the ground â are coveted by collectors because of their marvelous sculptural qualities and surface features .
A premium Sikhote - Alin specimen will carry a price tag of $ 2 to $ 3 / gram .
Pallasites are stony - iron meteorites packed with olivine ( the gemstone peridot ) and are particularly desirable when cut and polished because of the alluring color and translucency of the crystals they contain .
Prepared slices of stable pallasites such as Imilac ( Chile ) , Glorieta Mountain ( New Mexico , USA ) and Esquel ( Argentina ) are prized for their colorful gemstones and long - term stability , and will fetch between $ 20 and $ 40 / gram .
Meteorites are heavy , so a quality slice the size of a small dinner plate is worth thousands of dollars .
At the high end of the pricing scale are unusual types such as the diogenite Tatahouine ( fell June 27 , 1931 , Foum Tatahouine , Tunisia ) .
A prime specimen will easily fetch $ 50 / gram while rare examples of lunar and Martian meteorites may sell for $ 1,000 / gram or more â almost forty times the current price of gold !
Historic Meteorites
Some collectors are drawn to otherwise ordinary meteorites that have an intriguing history , such as the Beaver L5 chondrite â used as a doorstop in the Beaver County , Oklahoma jail during the 1940s â or the Claxton L5 chondrite which demolished a mailbox in Evans County , Georgia during the winter of 1984 .
Specimens that carry a unique provenance are also highly sought after by collectors , as they provide a link to the enthusiasts who have gone before us .
Harvey Nininger and his successor , Glenn Huss , painted small , meticulous collection numbers on their specimens , which were accompanied by American Meteorite Laboratory specimen cards .
A relatively common meteorite such as the Canyon Diablo iron ( Arizona , USA ) becomes highly collectible if it carries a Nininger number .
Major museums with extensive collections sometimes trade with meteorite dealers and hunters , in order to acquire new material .
A specimen with a label or number from the American Museum of Natural History in New York , or the Natural History Museum , London , for example , increases dramatically in monetary value as its terrestrial history travels with the specimen in the form of official documentation .
I know collectors who have paid hundreds of dollars for an otherwise unexceptional specimen purely because it came with a vintage handwritten label of great historic interest .
Falls Versus Finds
Meteorites that are seen to fall by credible observers are known as witnessed falls , while those that are discovered later , by chance , are known as finds .
Witnessed falls typically command higher prices than finds , and some meteorite collectors make a personal quest of acquiring an example of a meteorite that fell on their actual birthday .
It âs not always an easy task .
A single stone which fell in the western US on my birthday is locked up in a major museum collection and I may never be able to get a piece , though I do hold out some hope !
The famous Peekskill meteorite is an ordinary chondrite ( H6 ) with no special scientific interest , but a great example of how a remarkable story can add value to an otherwise unremarkable meteorite .
The fact that the 12.4 - kg Peekskill stone pummelled the trunk of a parked 1980 Chevy Malibu on the night of October 9 , 1992 makes it one of the most desirable specimens for collectors of witnessed falls .
While you could easily purchase another H6 chondrite for $ 1 / gram or less , a specimen of Peekskill will cost $ 100 to $ 200 / gram if you can find somebody willing to part with a piece .
Meteorite Identification
If you would like to learn about meteorite identification , and discover how to perform some simple tests at home , please visit The Aerolite Guide to Meteorite Identification .
Meteorites are very valuable both to the scientific community and to enthusiastic collectors .
So , if you think one landed in your backyard , be sure to get it checked out !
Aesthetic Meteorites
Some collectors , like myself , are drawn to aesthetically beautiful irons that have been forged by the elements during their fiery plunge toward our planet .
Melting in our atmosphere can mould meteorites , particularly irons , into fantastic sculptural shapes .
They may acquire features particular to meteorites such as regmaglypts ( thumbprints ) , orientation , flow lines , fusion crust , and in very rare cases natural holes .
Meteorites displaying good examples of some or all of these features command a premium price on the collectors â market .
How to Start a Meteorite Collection
There are almost as many ways to collect as there are different meteorites .
I have a good friend who only owns oriented meteorites ; another whose entire collection consists of meteorites he has found himself .
A colleague of mine in Phoenix specializes in meteorites from our home state of Arizona and another friend in Denver has a marvelous assortment of small perfectly fusion crusted individuals .
Others collect only witnessed falls , micro mounts ( small part slices in display boxes ) , thin sections , or pallasites .
Type collectors attempt to acquire one representative example of every known petrologic type â a formidable task !
The new collector may wish to start by obtaining one specimen from each of the three main meteorite groups : irons , stones , and stony - irons .
â Classic â irons such as Sikhote - Alin , Canyon Diablo , Odessa ( Ector County , TX , USA ) , Henbury ( Australia ) , are represented in most large collections and are all relatively affordable .
Stones such as Gao - Guenie , Gold Basin ( Mohave County , AZ , USA ) and Northwest Africa ( NWA ) 869 â a beautiful brecciated chondrite from the Sahara Desert â have been found in great numbers and modest sized specimens can easily be purchased for $ 50 to $ 100 .
Stony - irons , which include mesosiderites and pallasites are the rarest of the three main classes , but the Chilean mesosiderite Vaca Muerta and the Russian pallasite Seymchan are available at reasonable prices .
The more advanced collector may begin purchasing slices ( sections ) in order to show the interior structure of meteorites .
The Gibeon ( Namibia ) iron is very stable after cutting , displays a beautiful crystalline pattern when etched with a mild solution of nitric acid , and is a favorite among enthusiasts .
After a few years , most aficionados tend to develop an area of special interest and concentrate on collecting those meteorites that hold a particular fascination for them .
Explore the field , see what is available , talk to dealers and collectors , and do your research .
There are several good books that will help you learn about meteorites and meteorite collecting and I particularly recommend The Field Guide to Meteors and Meteorites by O. Richard Norton and Lawrence A. Chitwood , and The Art of Collecting Meteorites by Kevin Kichinka .

Meteorite Dealers :
Where to Buy a Meteorite A Google search for the phrase â meteorites for sale , â at the time of writing , produced 91,300 returns , so there is plenty of choice out there in cyberspace .
My most important piece of advice to all collectors , particularly novices , is this : know your source !
Meteorites are expensive and maintaining a good reputation as an honest dealer is vital in our business .
Many high value specimens are sold in extremely small part slices , particularly lunar and Martian meteorites .
A sub -gram fragment of a shergottite from the planet Mars may look uncomfortably similar to a blob of cement , so it is critical to know that you are purchasing from a reputable source .
There are plenty of fake and misrepresented meteorites out there , particularly on eBay , so always purchase from an established and experienced dealer who will stand behind the authenticity of his or her merchandise .
It can be amusing and slightly disconcerting to browse the meteorite lots on eBay .
It seems that every other offering is described as â awesome , â â simply the best , â or â museum quality ! â
True museum grade specimens are few and far between , so do nât believe everything you read in auction listings .
That being said , eBay can be a good place to build a collection of inexpensive meteorites but , I âll say it again , make sure you are purchasing from a vendor with a solid reputation .
The International Meteorite Collector âs Association ( IMCA ) is dedicated to maintaining high standards of integrity within the meteorite marketplace , and members display the IMCA logo on their websites .
As a condition of membership IMCA dealers must stand behind the authenticity of every piece they sell , so working with an IMCA - affiliated seller can be a good first step .
There are more meteorites available for sale today than at any time in history , so now is a great time to start your own personal collection of space rocks .

My secret santa sent me a tantalizing PM about how his or her gift would be " a careful synthesis of information amalgamated from your entire online presence . "
He or she went on to say " Though this information was sizable , it boiled down to one theme , one true love .
It is to this love that your present pays homage . "
The mystery surrounding this note has now been solved .
The stagnant air replaced with the warm , wonderful aroma of sizzling bacon .
Once a month .
For an ENTIRE YEAR !!!
As I anxiously await my first shipment of ARTISAN BACON from www.thepignextdoor.com, I am able to bide my time by drinking out of the commemorative " oink if you love bacon ! " mug and snacking on the BACON FLAVORED CANDY BAR !!
My excitement can barely be contained .
Let 's just hope I can survive this first bacon -less month .
Thank You Santa !!!
Wells Fargo & Co. said Tuesday that it would close 122 California bank branches as a result of its takeover of Wachovia Corp. last year , mostly Wachovia offices that are smaller and less prominently located than nearby Wells Fargo branches .
The closures are scheduled to occur in April as San Francisco - based Wells Fargo puts its name on the Wachovia locations in the state that are to remain open .
A casualty of decaying mortgage loans , Wachovia was teetering near collapse in October 2008 when Wells Fargo agreed to buy the Charlotte , N.C. , company in a deal brokered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
California was the only state in which the two banks had significantly overlapping retail franchises .
Even after the downsizing , Wells Fargo would have more than 1,000 branches in California , reflecting how it and Bank of America Corp. , which has nearly 1,000 California branches , have saturated the Golden State .
In that context , the planned closures do nât signal a loss of commitment to California by Wells Fargo , said banking analyst Bart Narter of the Celent consulting firm .
â It âs just doing what makes sense , â Narter said .
â When you âve got two branches across the street from each other , it âs natural to close one of them . â
Wells Fargo currently has 187 Wachovia offices in California .
Of those , 101 will be closed , said bank spokeswoman Jennifer Langan .
The company is also shutting 21 Wells Fargo locations .
All affected employees will be given jobs at other Wells Fargo branches if they want them , Langan said .
â We need all the customer - facing people we can get , â she said .
Employees were told of the branch closures Tuesday , and customers were to be notified later by mail .
Given the amount of overlap in the Wells Fargo and Wachovia branch networks in urban areas throughout the state , the closures appear to be on the light side , said Joe Morford , a San Francisco analyst who follows Western banks for RBC Capital Markets .
â This seems like a prudent , rational move , â Morford said .
â I think they could have closed more .
It shows how Wells Fargo values branches â as a way to establish bonds with customers .
One of the Wells Fargo branches to be closed is on Foothill Boulevard in La CaÃ±ada Flintridge , where customer Mauricio Hernandez , 37 , a contract painter , took the news in stride .
Hernandez lives in Palmdale , works in Pasadena and considers the La CaÃ±ada branch the most convenient to use .
He wo nât have to go far , however : A bigger Wachovia branch a few blocks away will become a Wells Fargo office .
â It âs easy to come to this branch , â he said , shuffling through paperwork in a white SUV in the Wells Fargo parking lot .
â I am going to talk to my banker to see what is going on . â
Hernandez said he switched to Wells Fargo eight months ago from Washington Mutual Inc. , which had been taken over by JPMorgan Chase & Co. as the banking system appeared at risk of melting down .
The WaMu deal made JPMorgan âs Chase Bank unit the third - largest retail bank in California , with about 720 branches , a spokesman said .
Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank unit is No. 4 with 377 branches , a spokeswoman said .

If you 're in Chicago , then you might want to head over to the Adler planetarium today , when they unveil an enormous 2.5 billion pixel mosaic of the Galaxy !
It 's composed of 800,000 separate Spitzer Space Telescope images ( I mean , c'mon , holy Haleakala , eight hundred thousand images ! ) stitched together .
The image was actually released last year , but the ginormous print version is premiering at Adler today .
The image above is one very tiny piece of the mosaic ; it was originally about 6000 pixels across , and I shrunk it down by a factor of 10 to fit it here on the blog .
And that is still only an eensy weensy piece of the whole thing !
Here is a massively ensmallened version of the entire mosaic :
[ Click to get a 2400 x 3000 version . ]
The images are in the infrared , well outside what the eye can see .
The colors represent IR light at 3.6 , 8 , and 24 microns ( depicted in the picture as blue , green , and red ) .
Different objects emit at different wavelengths : warm dust is red , while nebulae forming stars are yellow .
The diffuse green glow seen everywhere in the image is from complex organic molecules called PAHs , or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .
On Earth those are created when fossil fuels are burned ; in space , they are byproducts of stellar birth and death .
Not surprisingly , there is no single link to the whole survey .
However , all the tiles of the mosaic are available for download at the link above .
But be ye fairly warned , says I : each subimage is roughly 25,000 x 13,000 pixels !
This sort of image is more than a stunt ; big , splashy surveys like this give us a grand overview of the galaxy .
Telescopes like Spitzer , Hubble , Chandra , and so on usually get very deep , very detailed images , but of only a tiny fraction of the sky .
By taking all these images and stitching them together , we get an overview of the galaxy that can be used to do statistical searches , look for populations of objects , and perhaps most importantly , get context for objects to see what kind of environment they sit in .
The full mosaic is a stunning 2 degrees high -- four times the size of the full Moon on the sky -- by 120 degrees .
The Spitzer folks created a video ( hosted by my bud Robert Hurt ) to explain how it was done .
Also , something this size is almost too big for astronomers to probe in detail .
So grab yourself an image or two and surf around .
See what you find !
And if you are in Chicago , what are you waiting for ?
I 've been to Adler many times , and it 's one of my favorite planetaria .
Go see the giant scale model solar system , and the massive chunk of meteorite from Meteor Crater , Arizona !
It 's a wonderful place , and you 'll have a lot of fun .
Some favorites for today :
Some are unconventional choices , but seem to me they belong here because of ( a ) expanded song structures ( b ) lengthy themes and ( c ) harmonic or melodic experimentation .
This is by no means a definitive list !
Surprisingly , in some cases , those who identified themselves as Christian were more likely to believe these things than those who were unaffiliated .
( It should be noted that unaffiliated is not the same as nonbeliever .
Many are spiritual people who simply have nât found the right church , synagogue , mosque , coven , Ouija board club , or whatever . )
Furthermore , 16 percent of Protestants and 17 percent of Catholics said that they believe that some people can use the â evil eye â to â cast curses or spells that cause bad things to happen . â
I have to say that based on the looks my mother used to shoot me when I was misbehaving , that evil eye thing might have legs .
Since 1996 , the percentage of Americans who said that they have been in the presence of a ghost has doubled from 9 percent to 18 percent , and the percentage who said that they were in touch with someone who was dead has increased by nearly two thirds , rising from 18 percent to 29 percent .
For those keeping political score , Democrats were almost twice as likely to believe in ghosts and to consult fortune - tellers than were Republicans , and the Democrats were 71 percent more likely to believe that they were in touch with the dead .
Please hold the Barack - Obama - as - the - ghost - of - Jimmy - Carter jokes .
Heard them all .
Mark Boyle heats his caravan with a woodburner using disused pallets A meeting of self - styled " freegans " has taken place in Bristol , culminating in a meal assembled from waste food .
Freegan Mark
Boyle marked his first year of living without cash with a festival of " freeconomics " .
The event at Hamilton House , Stokes Croft , also featured the BBC's ' Roadkill Chef ' Fergus Drennan and author Andy Hamilton .
Mr Boyle , who forages for all his food , said he had had " an amazing year " .
The waste food meal fed 250 people .
Mr Boyle said : " It 's been the happiest year of my life , and I will continue indefinitely , so I do not see any reason to return to a money - orientated world .
I have no plans for using money next week or the week after
Mark Boyle
" It has been really liberating .
It does have challenges but I do not have the stresses of bank accounts , bills , traffic jams and long hours in a job I do n't enjoy . "
" Freeconomists " say their way of life is helping to save the planet from climate change and pollution .
Mr Boyle , an Irish - born former businessman , lives in a caravan at Timsbury , near Bath .
He says he has no plans to return to the cash economy in the immediate future .
' Wasteful society ' " I have no plans for using money next week or the week after .
I 'm going to have to take some time out and think how I 'm going to work this long - term , " he said .
" We live in a very wasteful society and part of it is we have no respect for the value of everything . "
He communicates from his caravan home via a solar - powered laptop with a wi-fi connection provided in return for doing odd jobs at a local farm .
The free meal - a three course banquet - was provided from food foraged from Bristol city centre 's shops and supermarkets .
As well as the meal , the Freeconomics Festival featured music , films , healing practitioners and swap meets .
Some of the power was provided by pedal - powered generators .

Knight Neversmiles of the Round Beerpong
Table here went and made himself a coat of chain mail armor out of pull - tabs from beer cans .
Although there may have been some pop-tops in there too , that would n't surprise me .
Anyway , he did a good job but there 's just no way you can look like a hard - ass wearing chainmail made out of pull - tabs .
I mean I could , but I 'd also ....
fill your eyes with that laser vision !
no disguise for my laser vision
ooh , when it gets through to you , it 's always new to you
my laser vision gets the best of you !
F*** yeah Foreigner .
Not you , Frenchie !
Hit the jump for a bunch of close - ups .
Beercan Tabs Chainmail Armor [ sadanduseless ]
Thanks to reado , who once made a suit of armor out of Capri - Sun pouches .
Sorry , I beg your pardon , did you say that you âve â seen it all ? â
This , sent in by Warren H :
NOW you âve â seen it all â
Surely it would nât be great if that thing hit a big bump ?
More importantly , did he think no - one would see him ?
Check out these pics and you âll find that the cops were nât too pleased with his vibe !
And THAT , my friends , is why I love this place !
WASHINGTON Â
An unusual holiday message began appearing this week in the nation âs capital on the sides of buses and trains .
â No god ? ... No problem ! â reads the advertisement featuring the smiling faces of people wearing Santa Claus hats .
â Be good for goodness â sake . â
Over the next two weeks , 270 of the ads will go up on city buses and trains in the Washington area as part of the holiday kickoff to campaigns sponsored by secular groups in cities around the country and abroad .
If last year was any indication , the signs are likely to spark a theological war of words .
â We do nât intend to rain on anyone âs parade , but secular people celebrate the holidays , too , and we âre just trying to reach out to our people , â said Roy Speckhardt , the executive director of the American Humanist Association .
â To the degree that we are reaching out to the godly , it âs just to say that you can be good without god .
So their atheist neighbor down the street should nât be vilified as though he is immoral . â
I first realized the existence of the other Moises Mendoza while I was attending Georgetown University a few years ago .
One day a student working at my college newspaper gingerly approached me .
â I do n't think you 're him , but I have to ask , were you ever in prison in Texas ? â she asked .
Let 's get this out of the way .
I 'm not on death row .
Stop with the e-mails , the dirty looks and the questions .
I 'm not Moises Sandoval Mendoza .
I'm a different Moises Mendoza â a law - abiding one .
Yes , we 're both 25 and we even ( sort - of ) look the same .
But I promise you , I'm Moises David Mendoza , so leave me alone .
In the world of the Internet it 's getting tougher for me to escape Moises Sandoval Mendoza 's shadow .
â¢ â¢ â¢
I have a problem .
I 'm a journalist so people search for me online all the time â sources , readers and even my friends .
But when someone Googles my name , bad things always pop up .
â Moises Mendoza is where he belongs .
He does not deserve a reprieve , â says the first link .
â Moises Mendoza â Texas Death Row Inmate , â says the next .
The third : â Moises Mendoza is one of the most violent , sadistic men I have ever encountered , and this death penalty is totally justified . â
Directly below that link appear two pictures of me right next to a bald - headed photo of Moises Sandoval Mendoza .
The man is a vicious killer whose birthday happens to be 15 days away from mine .
He murdered a woman in North Texas in 2004 by strangling her .
Then , he burned her body .
I know these details because after I started to get bombarded with questions about whether I was a killer who had been released from prison , I started to look into his story .
Somehow , by virtue of our names and the weirdness of technology , I feel a reverse kinship with him .
I badly want to separate myself from Moises Sandoval Mendoza but I know , no matter how hard I try , I 'll never be able to completely do it .
â¢ â¢ â¢
It 's not like people recoil in fear from me every single day .
But the questions do arise on a regular basis .
They might come from a source who 's trying to be funny : â You know , I did some research on you and did you realize there 's someone on death row with the same name as you ? â
I just say yes and move on to the next topic .
Once , a bank teller Googled me as I was opening an account .
She hurriedly walked away to get a manager .
You look vaguely like Moises Sandoval Mendoza , he pointed out .
Should I be in prison ?
A brief discussion resolved everything .
But the most annoying thing is receiving occasionally angry e-mails .
I remember one that called me a â stupid killer â and said I should rot with the devil .
I shook my head as I replied that I had never killed anyone in my life , although with all the silly things I 've done , maybe I am destined for hell .
Luckily I have n't gotten an angry phone call yet , but I 'm always half expecting one .
I think those who accuse me of murder have n't done their research , so I do n't take their anger personally .
But the confusion does get annoying .
And one day , a few years ago , I decided to do something about it .
I resolved to change my byline on stories to Moises D. Mendoza .
That way , people would see my middle initial was different from the killer , I reasoned .
It made no difference .
I still got the e-mails .
And , I decided , it was stupid to allow Moises Sandoval Mendoza to somehow influence how I lived my life .
Six months later , I changed my byline back to Moises Mendoza .
Two months ago , I had an epiphany .
Perhaps if I met Moises Sandoval Mendoza , if I could talk to this person who 's had this strange influence on my life , perhaps I could resolve my lingering frustration with him .
I sent an e-mail to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and I later got a reply .
Moises Sandoval Mendoza declined my request .
The rejection was for the best , I 've decided .
It 's not my fault a killer has my name and it would do me no good to enmesh myself further with his story .
In a way , his rejection has freed me .
I never have to meet him or see him face to face .
I can just keep explaining that I 'm not Moises Sandoval Mendoza .
Mendoza is a reporter for the Houston Chronicle .

The message boasted the hackers controlled the internet A group calling itself the Iranian Cyber Army has hacked Twitter and an Iranian opposition website , replacing it with an anti-American message .
Traffic to the social networking website was redirected for nearly two hours on Thursday night .
The opposition website mowjcamp.org remained disrupted on Friday .
The opposition in Iran have used the websites to publicise protests and accuse the government of rigging elections in June .
" This site has been hacked by the Iranian Cyber Army , " the message read .
BBC dot.life on the Twitter hack
The message , written in confused English , said the hackers had turned the tables on the US , who they criticise for sanctions on Iran .
" USA think they controlling and managing internet by their access , but they do n't , we control and manage internet by our power , " the message continued .
It ended on a seemingly polite note , telling visitors to " take care " , and the hackers added a winking emoticon .
The hackers left an e-mail address , but could not be reached for comment .
Inner workings
Reporting on the hack , technology website techcrunch.com recommended that Twitter users who have the same password for other websites like Facebook or their email should change them .
Twitter posted a blog on their website saying the micro- blogging service had been restored an hour and a quarter after the hack was first noticed .
The post said the hackers had gained access to the inner workings of the site and redirected visitors to their own website .
The website Mowjcamp.org is run by supporters of the reformist candidates who challenged Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June 's elections .
Both Twitter and Mowjcamp.org became a focal point for protesters during mass opposition rallies on the streets of Tehran , and the hundreds of arrests that followed .
Protesting Iranians posted pictures of the rallies , and the reaction of the Iranian riot police and pro-government militia , on the sites .
Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi have said elections in June were rigged against them .

WASHINGTON - Health officials tackling the global AIDS epidemic will meet in the United States for the first time in 22 years after President Obama lifted the ban on travel by people infected with HIV .
The International AIDS Society will hold its biennial conference of scientists , policy makers , and patients in Washington from July 22 to 27 , 2012 , Robin Gorna , the society âs executive director , said yesterday .
The Geneva - based group is the world âs leading independent association of HIV professionals , with more than 14,000 members from 190 countries .
An estimated 33.4 million people around the world have HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , and 2.7 million new infections and 2 million deaths occurred last year , according to the United Nations .
The AIDS Society aims to highlight US research and help end discrimination caused by the travel ban by returning the conference to the country for the first time since 1990 .
â This is a real moment in history to put an end to the AIDS crisis and we can only do that if we learn from each other , ââ Gorna said yesterday , on the eve of World AIDS Day , an international observance established by the World Health Organization in 1988 .
Obama said on Oct. 30 that he would let HIV patients enter the United States in an effort to remove the stigma from the disease and encourage more testing .
The AIDS Society had already settled on Washington as the 2012 conference site in anticipation of the White House repealing the travel ban , Gorna said .
The conference is expected to draw 25,000 people , she said .
It was last held in Washington in 1987 , two years after the inaugural event in Atlanta .
The 1990 meeting was held in San Francisco .
Twelve nations ban travel by people infected with HIV including China , which is reconsidering its policies as a result of the US decision , Gorna said .
Other nations include Malaysia , Qatar , Russia , Saudi Arabia , Singapore , South Korea , and the United Arab Emirates .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The White House says its review of a long - standing policy not to send condolence letters to the families of military suicide victims should " hopefully " conclude " shortly . "
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the president himself asked for the review , with Gibbs telling reporters at the White House briefing on Wednesday , " If the president did n't care , the policy would remain unchanged and unexamined . "
The protocol dates as far back as the Clinton administration .
But now , some military families , including the Keesling family of Indiana , believe the policy needs to be changed .
In June , 25 - year - old Army Spc. Chancellor Keesling shot and killed himself in Iraq .
His parents , Gregg and Jannett , eventually set up a memorial wall in their home , leaving space for what they thought would be a condolence letter from the commander in chief .
It never came .
Military officials told the Keeslings that only the families of troops killed in combat receive such condolence letters from the president .
The Keeslings then wrote to both President Obama and Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr .
In an October letter to Casey , Gregg Keesling explained why he wanted the policy changed .
" The lack of acknowledgment and condolences from the President , who our family admires greatly , leaves us with an emotional vacuum and a feeling that we his family have somehow [ made ] less of a sacrifice , " Keesling said .
Last week , in a speech at West Point , as Obama laid out his new Afghanistan strategy , he talked about signing condolence letters " to the family of each American who gives their life " in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In an e-mail to CNN after the speech , Gregg Keesling said those words stung .
" I hope they are not trying to distinguish between ' give ' and ' take , ' " Keesling said , adding , " It was a good speech , but [ I ] am just so shocked the president used that language .
It is hurtful to our family and the hundreds like us who has a soldier who has died by suicide in these wars . "
Asked to respond to Keesling 's comments , White House press secretary Gibbs said the first thing he and the president would say " is to thank that family for the courageous service [ that ] they exhibited on behalf of all of us in this country so that we might enjoy the freedoms that we have . "
Gibbs added , " Regardless of what happens , nothing lessens the amazing contribution and sacrifice that 's made .
I think that 's what the president would ... tell that family and would tell ... other families . "
Obama says US will pursue plane bomb plotters
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
President Barack Obama has pledged his administration " will not rest " until all those behind an alleged plot to bomb a US plane are brought to justice .
In his first public comments on last Friday 's incident , Mr Obama said he had ordered two reviews - of US terrorism databases and air travel screening .
The accused , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a Nigerian , had a visa and was allowed to fly despite being on a watch - list .
Mr Obama spoke after it emerged a wing of al - Qaeda had claimed the plot .
The US president said only the " quick and heroic actions " of passengers and crew had averted disaster .
Call to vigilance
The 23 - year - old accused , who is being held at a prison in the US state of Michigan , was restrained while allegedly trying to detonate a high - explosive device sewn in to his underwear .
We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt , dismantle and defeat violent extremists

Bomb suspect was on UK watch - list ' Jet bomber ' family tell of shock Q&A : ' Jet bomber ' case Mr Abdulmutallab is charged with attempting to blow up the Northwest Airlines Airbus A330 from Amsterdam , which had nearly 300 people on board , as it made its final descent to Detroit .
He has reportedly told FBI investigators that there are others just like him in Yemen who will strike soon .
Officials are said to be concerned there may be more al - Qaeda - trained young men in the country planning to bring down US planes , the BBC's Imtiaz Tyab reports from Washington .
Mr Obama , speaking at a military base in Hawaii where he has been on holiday with his family , said : " We will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable . "
Mr Obama said his administration had already taken steps to improve security , including extra air marshals and enhanced screening at airports .
Criticism Mr Obama said the people of America would not give in to fear , but added that its citizens should be vigilant .
The underpants reportedly had a packet of powder sewn into them

He added : " Those who would slaughter innocent men , women and children must know the United States will do more than simply strengthen our defences .
" We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt , to dismantle and defeat the violent extremists . "
US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on Monday airport systems had failed , and that a much - criticised earlier remark of hers that security had worked was taken out of context .
Shortly before Mr Obama spoke , al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the plot .
' War on crusaders '
In an internet statement , the group said it had co-ordinated the attack with Mr Abdulmutallab and only a " technical fault " caused it to fail .

Al - Qaeda group claims bomb plot
The group also urged the killing of Western embassy workers in the region as part of an " all - out war on crusaders " .
The website message said the attempted bombing was in response to US attacks against its operatives in Yemen .
Washington has stepped up military assistance to Yemen 's offensive against al - Qaeda militants .
US officials said at the weekend the accused had told investigators al - Qaeda operatives in Yemen had supplied him with the bomb .
The Yemeni government has confirmed that Mr Abdulmutallab lived in the country between August and December , after obtaining a visa to study Arabic there .
Officials said that there was " nothing suspicious about his intentions " to visit the country .
But his father , a top Nigerian banker , voiced fears to the US embassy in Abuja weeks ago that his son was becoming radicalised .
But officials did not revoke his two - year multiple - entry visa , which was issued in June 2008 .
Mr Abdulmutallab's name was added to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database , but not put on a no - fly list .

While I 've always known that the rightwing Washington Times was owned by the self - proclaimed Messiah and " Dear Leader " of the Unification Church , Rev. Sun Myung Moon , I do n't think I fully appreciated just how directly in control of the paper the Moonies actually were .
Nor did I fully appreciate how desperate the wingnuts must have been to give the appearance of " conservative " points of view seen emanating from a seemingly " legitimate " inside - the - beltway newspaper , even if it meant allying directly with a loony - tunes religious cult .
Well , so much for that self - delusion .
In any case , now that the wingers own both the Wall Street Journal and the bulk of the Washington Post , they can probably get by without the Washington Times if it comes to that .
A few selected on - point comments from the TPM story linked above , in which they post the first public statement from the Moon family ( which also now owns UPI ) , about the ongoing , whacked - out internecine family battle over the newspaper most - frequently quoted by Limbaugh , Hannity and all the rest ...
NowhereMan :
Were a " liberal , msm " newspaper of consequence owned by a foreign , religious nutjob , the wingers would have long since devoured the printed meal .
JohnGorenfeld :
Can you imagine what Sean Hannity would make of it if The Nation were owned by a billionaire cult leader whom evening news reports used to warn mothers about ?
Kinkistyle :
The whole idea that a major newspaper and new [s ] organization is owned and operated by a loony cult is just mind - boggling .
JohnGorenfeld :
Beltway folks may be jaded enough to yawn at the fact that a cult leader formerly mentioned in the same breath as Jim Jones is publishing the Washington Times ; raving about ending Christianity ; and arranging for bipartisan dinner parties where he claims to be the Messiah But most other people I have talked to find Moon 's ownership of the Times amazing .
It 's a living political cartoon of hypocrisy that ought to be at least as well known as the supposed evils of ACORN and George Soros .
Druidity :
The real surprise to me in this article is that Moonies own UPI .
I could n't care less about WT , I never read it and everyone knows where they lean .
But a lot of local and national papers carry the UPI stories .
Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , who was involved in all three papers , said astronomers thought that one - third to one - half of all Sun - like stars harbored such super - Earths orbiting at scorching distances much closer than Mercury is to the Sun .

In the 15 years since the first extrasolar planet was found , more than 400 have been detected .
The field is getting more intense as dedicated planet - hunting instruments like the Kepler satellite from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , due to report a new batch of such planets next month , get into the game .
Alan P. Boss , a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington , said of the planet hunters , â Give them a couple more years and they âre going to knock your socks off . â
Dr. Charbonneau âs planet , only 1.3 million miles from its home star , is distinguished by its relative coolness Â a consequence of the dimness of GJ 1214 , which puts out one three - hundredth of the Sun âs energy .
He and his colleagues had set out to search for planets around such stars , noting that they are more numerous and that it is easier to discern planets around them .
His planet - hunting equipment is a bank of eight telescopes called MEarth , pronounced â mirth , â on Mount Hopkins in Arizona .
Each telescope is only 16 inches in diameter , no bigger than those that grace the backyard of many amateur astronomers .
They monitor the light of 2,000 nearby stars , looking for the regular blips caused when a planet passes by , or transits .
In May , Zachory Berta , a first - year graduate student of Dr. Charbonneau , called the group âs attention to blips in the Ophiuchus star that seemed to be happening every 1.6 days .
If he was right , Mr. Berta said , the next transit would occur at 6 a.m. on May 13 .
Dr. Charbonneau was in Washington later that day preparing for a State Department dinner when he got a group e-mail message that began : â We have a winner .
Congrats Zach ! â
What does " googling " mean ?
Google can tell you .
The search giant has quietly rolled out Google Dictionary , which presents definitions and synonyms .
Exactly what you 'd expect from a dictionary .
In addition to Google 's own database of definitions , looking up a word on the Dictionary website provides a list of definitions pulled from a variety of academically authoritative sources ( oh , and Wikipedia ) .
It has a few cool features .
You can mark words with the star button and come back to them later , see a list of recent searches and switch to translator resources or dictionaries for other languages -- not to be confused with Google Translate .
Dictionary companies have expected Google would saunter into their realm any day .
Alex Zudin is the owner of Paragon Software , which works closely with Merriam - Webster , Oxford and other renowned keepers of language to build applications based on their data .
Zudin says that Google could provide a service in the low - level consumer market , but higher - ed students and professionals would still buy the unabridged versions .
" It will serve you until a certain level , " Zudin said over lunch on Wednesday about Google Translate , which was the company 's first step into the language space .
" It 's not enough to be precise . "
The company that might be hurt the most by Google 's new product is Answers.com .
Previously , the " definition " button at the top right of all Google searches for words would direct users to entries on the Wikipedia - like Answers.com site .
Now those links go to Google Dictionary , a less colorful , less cluttered interface .
So , what does it mean to " google " ?
According to the top result in Google Dictionary , taken from Princeton 's WordNet , the verb means :
search the internet ( for information ) using the Google search engine ; " He googled the woman he had met at the party " ; " My children are googling all day . "
Your children are googling all day ?
Yeah , us too .
[ Updated at 7:35 p.m. :
We should note that the aggregation feature previously existed on Google.com / dictionary and searches preceded by the search operator " define : . " ]

Why Happiness is Such a Struggle
Now , I do nât know all 6.5 billion of you out there , but of the few hundred people that I do know , I do nât know of anyone who does nât like to be happy .
I think we all have that in common .
Type â Happiness â into Amazon âs book search and you âll get over 350,000 results .
For some reason , humans have a lot of trouble being happy .
There âs no question that we all want it , so why are we so bad at it ?
With such universal demand , you âd think we âd have it figured out by now .
There seems to be some persistent force that keeps us unhappy .
It âs almost like humans have some curious fetish with dissatisfaction .
No matter how much we have in the way of resources and privileges , it is nât enough .
Even when we accomplish or acquire something that makes us feel happy , that feeling fades so quickly .
This human tendency towards unease has baffled and frustrated people for centuries .
Some of our behavior is so puzzlingly destructive and useless that we âve developed all sorts of bizarre explanations for it : evil spirits , angry gods , government conspiracies , and the most destructive fiction of all : the idea that there are good people and bad people .
I have a better explanation .
The Unhappiness Script
â All man âs miseries derive from not being able to sit quietly in a room alone â â Blaise Pascal
There is a force that keeps us unhappy .
And it âs somewhere between our ears .
It âs the way we âre built .
It âs in the blueprints .
It âs in our blood .
I âm sorry to have to be the one to tell you that .
But do nât worry , I promise I have good news too .
You see , we inherit a lot from our ancestors .
We get their DNA , their impulses , their thinking patterns , their values , their strengths and their weaknesses , whether they suit our lives or not .
Human bodies and minds still work in pretty much the same way they did thousands of years ago , before civilization , before high technology , before science .
Life was short , brutal and highly competitive .
If a caveman ever actually became happy with his possessions , with his social standing , or with what he had accomplished in his life , he was as good as dead .
Resources were too scarce ; survival required great amounts of effort and force .
If he were to begin to enjoy his life as it was , other people would take his food , his mate , his role in the tribe , and his possessions .
His more competitive , more desperate peers would beat him to everything he needed to survive .
There was no agriculture to produce food in abundance , no economy to provide affordable tools , no cradle of civilization to protect him .
For most of human history , happiness â as pleasant as it might be â was a deathtrap .
And guess what , your brain is calibrated this way too : away from happiness and towards insecurity .
Inside the oldest parts of our mind , something is always saying
â This is nât good enough .
You need X . Go get X , or you will die . â
This simple , ruthless script is programmed to drive survival at all costs .
It works exceedingly well for this purpose , but it also guarantees a life that is mostly unpleasant .
The more intense the dissatisfaction , the more incentive a person has to acquire something that promises to relieve that dissatisfaction .
Unhappiness is nature âs way of keeping people on their toes .
It âs a crude system , but it has worked for thousands of years .
But today , we do nât need to be so high - strung , and we certainly do nât need unhappiness to keep us alive .
In fact , now that civilization has made survival fairly easy for most of us , these ancient impulses are a scourge .
Our heads are full of obsolete methods for survival that today only serve to make us insecure and ungrateful .
A lot of our mental systems are completely outdated .
We operate as if our impulses are telling us the right thing to do , yet most of the time these impulses are not appropriate to our circumstances .
As a result , we go overboard when it comes to issues of security ( think Patriot Act ) , resources ( think oil wars and economic hysteria ) and romantic relationships , ( think of how devastating it is to be dumped ) just to name a few areas of imbalance .
A New Skillset
We are just not geared to be happy .
Knowing this , the picture looks bleak .
So what can we do about it ?
There is some hope .
Along with our impulses to hoard and loathe , we âve also developed some more advanced qualities that do benefit us today .
The development of compassion and respect helped people to identify with and care for others in their tribe , and get things done through teamwork .
Also promising is the still - emerging trait of nonjudgment .
It allows us perceive reality and respond to it without bias and the emotional pain of judging it as good or bad .
It allows for smarter , more objective decision - making , though it may not have given our ancestors the snap judgment needed to survive the day .
It would not have been terribly useful in the past , but it certainly is now .
Quality of life is almost solely determined by our ability to accept circumstances and respond to them regardless of their desirability .
The most potent of these newer qualities is , of course , love .
Love is a complete 180 from the archaic Unhappiness Script .
The possibilities for humanity in a love - based culture are astounding to think about .
There is so much to discuss about this relatively new , all - powerful human quality , so I will explore it in future posts , and not here .
Suffice it to say that love is a highly advanced human activity , and as a species , we âre just scratching the surface of its potential .
For those of us living amidst civilization , we are better served by a newer skillset .
Hoarding , dissatisfaction and paranoia are the crude old ways , and they just do nât fit us anymore .
Compassion , calmness and love are much more useful to us .
We âre in the middle of a transition from being a survival - focused species to a much more potent quality - of - life - focused species .
The problem of individual survival is no longer the main concern for most of us , the vast majority of our time .
Technology and civilization have made it easy to survive .
What we yearn for now is quality of life .
Yes we âre alive , but it is nât always so pleasant to be alive .
So now that quality of life is overtaking mere survival as the biggest concern for most people , the necessary â human skillset â is beginning to shift .
Most of us now have much less use for savage survival skills such as :
â¢ How to hoard resources
â¢ How to dominate and intimidate others
â¢ How to stop another race from advancing
and much more use for quality of life skills such as :
â¢ How to keep little things from getting to you
â¢ How to enjoy your work
â¢ How to keep a sense of wonder and possibility in your life
All of the skills and insights necessary for happiness are available to us , and now with the internet , they can be communicated more efficiently than ever .
Our biology may never catch up with us ; it âs very slow to adapt , but that âs okay .
Behavior and culture adapt much more rapidly .
Straightforward happiness skills are so universally beneficial and useful that they catch on quickly .
So yes , at the end of the day there is something in us that wants to be unhappy .
But hopefully now it is not so mysterious .
It âs a just simple program that keeps us wanting .
There are ways to deal with it , but even just being aware of the Unhappiness Script goes a long way .
No matter what skills we develop , our biology and psychology are hardwired to a large extent , so we always need to be aware that our brains are going to tell us to do stupid things sometimes .
We need to recognize these patterns and know how to deal with them when they arise , if we hope to be happy on a consistent basis .
Raptitude is a vehicle for helping each other to learn to do that .
I âll share what I know , I hope you will too .

In San Antonio Saturday , the game between the Spurs and Sacramento Kings was delayed by a bat that celebrated the holiday by swooping down onto the court late in the first quarter .
Some spooked players scattered from the court as the winged visitor entertained fans .
The Spursâ Manu Ginobili eventually swatted the bat with his bare hand , knocking it to the floor .
He then picked up the flying mammal and carried it off the court to the delight of fans .
No word on the fate of the bat , nor whether PETA might get involved .
The Spurs won the game without batting an eye â¦ 113-94 .

670 cc commercial wood chipper / shredder for sale .
Little bit of rust but works great .
Contact Joe - ***********@gmail.com
$ 4000 OBO From Me to ***********@gmail.com :
Hi Joe ,
Is the wood chipper still for sale ?
Thanks ,
Mike
From Joe ****** to Me :
Yes , I still have the wood chipper .
From Me to Joe ******:
I do n't have $ 4000 , but what I do have is $ 200 and a need for use of a wood chipper for about half an hour .
Would I be able to rent it from you for $ 200 ?
Mike
From Joe ****** to Me :
I do n't see why not .
What are you using it for ?
From Me to Joe ******:
Do n't worry about that .
So would I be able to swing by and pick it up in my truck , then bring it back about an hour later ?
I can leave my driver 's license as collateral .
Mike
From Joe ****** to Me :
First you need to tell me what the chipper is being used for or you can find someone else .
From Me to Joe ******:
Okay , I 'll try to explain my situation .
My cat just had a litter of kittens , and I can't get rid of them .
I tried giving them to my friends and putting ads online , but nobody wants them .
I even tried releasing them into the wild but they keep coming back to my house .
I can't stand these little fuckers pissing everywhere and clawing up my furniture .
So I figure my next option is to put them down .
I can't afford to have it done professionally , so I think a wood chipper would be the next most humane way .
I looked up your model and saw it has a 6 inch input , which I think will be perfect for me .
Mike
From Joe ****** to Me :
....................................... wow .
No .
From Me to Joe ******:
Why not ?
It is an easy $ 200 for you .
Ca n't you just pretend I took it to mulch some wood ?
Mike
From Joe ****** to Me :
No .
You are a sick sick sick sick sick person .
From Me to Joe ******:
I 'll give you $ 250 and throw in a free kitten ( not mulched , of course ) .
Plus , I thought about my plan some more , and I decided to put meow mix all around the input , and just leave the kittens near it .
That way , if they get shredded , it is their own damn fault , and my hands are clean .

What laptop does Richard Stallman use ?
A Dell , HP , maybe even an Apple ?
No â RMS uses a rather odd laptop , a netbook powered by the Chinese Loongson processor : the Yeeloong , a completely Free laptop .
From BIOS to operating system , this machine is completely open source .
Wired is running a very interesting article on the Loongson processor effort .
China , with its massive population , is a very interesting market for computer companies .
Only 25 % of China âs population has access to the internet , so it âs a massive growth market .
The Chinese themselves realised this too , and in order to not be dependant on foreign powers , they decided to develop their own processor .
This would become the Loongson , currently in its second generation .
The third generation , which will sport 4 cores and later 8 cores , will be released in 2010 .
Where it gets really interesting , however , is when you look at the software these Loongson chips are running .
Since it âs a MIPS chip , it ca nât run Windows
In other words , one of the biggest growth markets in the computing world might be conquered not by Intel and AMD âs x86 running Windows , but by a 64 bits MIPS chip running open source operating systems like Linux and the BSDs .
The key here , as Wired notes , is that Loongson - based devices will be much cheaper for Chinese buyers than Western x86 machines .
Of course , the Loongson chip still has a long way to go before it can compete performance wise with Western products , but progress is being made , and China is determined .
â The country is incredibly motivated for the project to succeed â it has become a cornerstone of the National High - Tech R&D Program embarked upon in 1986 , â Wired writes , â And we know that the Chinese are very good at leveraging economies of scale . â
Combine all this with the fact that the third generation Loongson chip will include specific instructions to speed up x86 - to - MIPS dynamic binary translation , and you can see that the Chinese are really taking this seriously .
Which is good news for all of us .
x 86 Needs competition .
The union representing Sydney bus drivers today apologised to commuters for a snap 24 - hour strike called for tomorrow , saying it has no alternative after the State Transit Authority walked away from negotiations .
The Rail Tram and Bus Union ( RTBU ) says award negotiations between bus drivers and the NSW government broke down three weeks ago , prompting drivers to walk off the job from 4 am ( AEDT ) tomorrow until 4 am ( AEDT ) on Saturday .
The NSW government will attempt to block the strike with a challenge in the NSW Industrial Relations Commission today .
" We 've been negotiating with State Transit now for about six months to try and get an enterprise agreement , " the union 's bus division secretary Raul Baonza told Macquarie Radio .
" About three weeks ago State Transit walked away from the negotiating table , so we do n't see anyway forward to get someone to talk to us .

Most distant object in universe
The fading infrared afterglow of GRB 090423 appears in the centre of this false - colour image taken with the Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii .
The burst is the farthest cosmic explosion yet seen ( Image : Gemini Observatory / NSF / AURA / D Fox / A Cucchiara / Penn State U/E Berger / Harvard U )
Astronomers have spotted the most distant object yet confirmed in the universe â a self - destructing star that exploded 13.1 billion light years from Earth .
It detonated just 630 million years after the big bang , around the end of the cosmic â dark ages â , when the first stars and galaxies were lighting up space .
The object is a gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) â the brightest type of stellar explosion .
GRBs occur when massive , spinning stars collapse to form black holes and spew out jets of gas at nearly the speed of light .
These jets send gamma rays our way , along with â afterglows â at other wavelengths , which are produced when the jet heats up surrounding gas .
The burst , dubbed GRB 090423 for the date of its discovery last Thursday , was originally spotted by NASA âs Swift satellite at 0755 GMT .

Within an hour , astronomers began training ground - based telescopes on the same patch of sky to study the burst âs infrared afterglow .
Some of the first observations were made on Mauna Kea in Hawaii with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and the Gemini North telescope .
Other telescopes later measured the spectrum of the afterglow , revealing that the burst detonated about 13.1 billion light years from Earth .
â It âs the most distant gamma - ray burst , but it âs also the most distant object in the universe overall , â says Edo Berger of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , a member of the team that observed the afterglow with Gemini North .
Stretched light
To gauge an object âs distance , astronomers measure how much an object âs light has been stretched , or reddened , by the expansion of space .
This burst lies at a redshift of 8.2 , more distant than the previous GRB record holder , which lay at a redshift of 6.7 .
Other astronomers have claimed to find galaxies at even greater distances â at redshifts of 10 and 9 , but those findings are still ambiguous , says Joshua Bloom of the University of California , Berkeley , who observed the afterglow using the Gemini South telescope in Chile .
Until now , the record holder for the farthest galaxy had a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of 6.96 .
The burst âs immense distance makes the now - dead star the earliest object to be discovered from an era called â reionisation â , which occurred within the first billion years after the big bang .
At that time , an obscuring fog of neutral hydrogen atoms was being burned off by radiation from the first stars and galaxies , and possibly also from the annihilation of dark matter particles .
â Watershed event â
â For astronomy , this is a watershed event , â Bloom told New Scientist .
â This is the beginning of the study of the universe as it was before most of the structure that we know about today came into being . â
The timing of the period of reionisation is still unclear , Bloom says .
If astronomers can find more gamma -ray bursts at even greater distances , they could use their spectra to determine how quickly the universe became transparent and what was responsible for the process .
â In principle , you can see very early times in the universe [ with GRBs ] , when everything else was too faint , â says Nial Tanvir of the University of Leicester in the UK , a member of a team that used the Very Large Telescope in Chile to make one of the first measurements of the distance of the burst .
Distant blasts could also help pinpoint the locations of faint GRB host galaxies that could be detected by space telescopes like the soon - to - be- refurbished Hubble Space Telescope or NASA âs infrared James Webb Telescope , which is set to launch in 2013 .
Sensitive and fast
But building up a picture of the early universe will require finding many more distant bursts , and progress in discovering distant bursts has been slow .
Swift has found 120 bursts with measured distances , but only three â including this one â date from the first billion years of the universe âs history .
That is in part because stars did not form at high rates in the very early universe , before a redshift of about 5 , and so they did not explode often as GRBs .
But it is also because infrared detectors that are both sensitive and quick enough to measure very distant , short - lived GRB afterglows have only recently begun operating .
As a result , astronomers may have missed out on identifying some of the most distant GRBs identified by Swift .
Berger hopes the discovery of this object will hasten the development of new telescopes that could discover such afterglows with even greater efficiency .
â As a single object , [ the burst ] is an amazing proof of concept , â says Berger .
â I think we âve shown that âs a worthwhile investment because [ distant bursts ] actually do exist . â
NASA is considering one such telescope , called the Joint Astrophysics Nascent Universe Satellite ( JANUS ) , for funding this year .

While everyone is glad to put 2009 behind them , 2010 could be an even tougher economic year for China .
To climb out of the global contraction , Beijing has engineered a property bubble characterized by oversupply in commercial real estate and unsustainable price gains for residential property .
The consequences of this will bite in the new year .
To soak up and justify this excess , China 's leaders are trying to stoke demand by accelerating the already epic urbanization trend , reducing constraints on migration and urban registration .
The leadership is betting on the connection between accelerated urbanization and consumption , ...

We have all read comics when we were young .
Many of us continue to read them due to their fascinating nature of conveying stories very easily .
But comics need not necessarily confine to the comedy genre .
Can they be used to communicate an issue , a cause or a fact ?
World Comics India , led by Sharad Sharma , is doing exactly that â using the power of comics to bring about a social change !
World Comics India is a collective of cartoonists , media persons and grassroots activists .
This organization makes use of comics to serve as a communication tool and as a mode of self - expression in remote areas of not only India , but many countries in South Asia .
Sharad Sharma , who leads World Comics India , is a cartoonist from Jaipur and has initiated numerous workshops where cartoons and comics are used to spread awareness .
A novel idea indeed , considering that comics can easily cut across language barriers !
One of their campaigns was the Girl Child Right Campaign which aimed to address the issue of female infanticide in the region of Western Rajasthan .
Here , they trained children and adults in comics making .
These trained people in turn created over 300 comics focused on the girl child âs rights .
World Comics
India then conducted a road - based tour with all this material which was distributed to various villagers and local leaders .
You can view some of their campaigns here : Grassroot Comics
Similarly , they had also initiated a campaign against corporal punishment in Uttar Pradesh .
Students of a school in Maharajganj used comics to spread awareness amongst teachers that punishment by beating is not really the right way to discipline children .
Details of their campaigns in UP available here : Uttar Pradesh campaigns .

Their website is comprehensive with a lot of material available for people and organizations to make use of .
For instance , the entire manual on how to go about creating these comics is available in both English and Hindi ( both files are about 2 MB each ) .
If interested , you can download a series of videos available on their website which showcases how the various campaigns were initiated and also on how World Comics India trains people in the art of comics making !

Apple âs release of its new operating system , dubbed â Snow Leopard â , is helping raise awareness of the plight of one of the world âs most endangered big cats , reports the Snow Leopard Trust , a group working to protect the real - life snow leopard in its mountainous habitat across Central Asia .
â This is a boon for wild snow leopards , â said Brad Rutherford , Executive Director of the Snow Leopard Trust , â Apple is helping to show the world the beauty and majesty of this rare creature . â
Rutherford says the software launch has made consumers aware that the snow leopard is indeed a real animal and encouraged some of Apple âs partners to support snow leopard conservation , including donating a portion of profits .
More than three dozen Apple Specialist stores from California to New York are helping the Snow Leopard Trust sell cub adoption kits ( specially priced for Mac âs new OS release ) to raise money for conservation .
Tekserve , an Apple Specialist retailer in New York , has decided to donate all the proceeds from the first 100 Mac OS X operating systems they sell .
A full list of participating Apple Specialists is available at www.applespecialist.com/adoptions.
â The launch of the new OS will hopefully put snow leopards front and center and drive people to find out more , â Rutherford said .
â We have a new donor match going on through October , â he continued .
â For all the Apple partners , anything they give will be matched â that means they can have double the impact for snow leopard conservation . â
The snow leopard ( Panthera uncia ) is one of the rarest and most elusive big cat species with a population of 4,500 to 7,500 spread across a range of 1.2 to 1.6 million kilometers in some of the world âs harshest and most desolate landscapes .
Found in arid environments and at elevations sometimes reaching 18,000 feet ( 5,500 meters ) , the species faces great threats despite its extreme habitat .
These threats vary across its range , but in all countries where it is found â Afghanistan , Bhutan , China , India , Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Nepal , Mongolia , Pakistan , Russia , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan and possibly Myanmar â the species is at risk .
In some countries snow leopard are directly hunted for their pelt , in others they are imperiled by depletion of prey , loss of habitat , and killing as a predator of livestock .
These threats , combined with the cat âs large habitat requirements , means conservation through the establishment of protected areas alone may not be enough save it from extinction in the wild in many of the countries in which it lives .

( 08/31/2009 ) Using camera traps , the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) has captured the elusive and rare snow leopard on film in Afghanistan for a second time .
The feline was caught on film in the Sast Valley in Afghanistan âs Wakhan Corridor .
The snow leopard is currently listed as Endangered by the IUCN .
The cat is also listed as protected under Afghanistan âs new endangered species list , which outlaws hunting it .
The IUCN estimates that only 100 - 200 snow leopards still survive in Afghanistan .
How to Save Snow Leopards
( 10/28/2008 )
The snow leopard ( Panthera uncia ) is one of the rarest and most elusive big cat species with a population of 4,500 to 7,500 spread across a range of 1.2 to 1.6 million kilometers in some of the world 's harshest and most desolate landscapes .

In some countries snow leopard are directly hunted for their pelt , in others they are imperiled by depletion of prey , loss of habitat , and killing as a predator of livestock .
These threats , combined with the cat 's large habitat requirements , means conservation through the establishment of protected areas alone may not be enough save it from extinction in the wild in many of the countries in which it lives .
Working to stave off this fate in half a dozen of its range countries is the Snow Leopard Conservancy .
Founded by Dr. Rodney Jackson , a biologist who has been studying snow leopard in the wild for 30 years , the Conservancy seeks to conserve the species by " promoting innovative grassroots measures that lead local people to become better stewards of endangered snow leopards , their prey , and habitat .

Mr Medvedev has sought reforms since the death of Natalya Estemirova Memorial , which has won the European Union 's Sakharov Prize , is one of the few human rights groups in Russia willing to speak out about cases of alleged kidnapping , torture and extrajudicial killings by Russian forces .
The European Parliament , announcing the prestigious award , said it was intended to signal that all such groups in Russia should be free to voice their thoughts without fear or violent reprisals .
Memorial chairman Oleg Orlov , who was cited personally by the awarding panel , said the prize inspired the organisation to continue working despite the constant setbacks and obstacles put in its way by the Russian government .
" It is very important for us .
It is a recognition of how important our work is , " he said .
" It assures us that we are moving in the right direction in these difficult times .
Sometimes we feel like giving up .
We work hard , but we fail to achieve any significant results . "
High - profile murders Memorial is the largest human rights group in Russia .
Its offices have been raided , it has been issued with lawsuits and some of its workers have been attacked and killed .
Natalya Estemirova , who worked for Memorial in Chechnya , was one of those victims .
If you compare it with the Soviet Union I think Russia today is a far more frightening place for human rights activists
Lev Ponomaryev , of human rights group Za Prava Cheloveka
In July this year she was abducted from her home , shot several times in the head and her body was dumped in a forest in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia .
Her attackers have so far not been found .
For Memorial , her death meant the end of its presence in the region .
It was too dangerous to send anyone to replace her .
But Natalya Estemirova is simply the latest in a string of high - profile murders and beatings across Russia .
Over the past three years - notably since the death of journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006 - others have died too .
Just two months ago Maksharip Aushev , who campaigned against abuses by security forces in the republic of Ingushetia , died in a hail of bullets fired from a passing car .
Natalya Estemirova was a vocal critic of human rights abuses in Chechnya Others include human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov , shot dead on a Moscow street , journalists such as Anastasia Baburova , also shot dead , and Zarema Sadoulaeva , head of the Chechen organisation Save the Generation , found shot dead with her husband in Grozny .
Za Prava Cheloveka , another Russian human rights group , is led by Lev Ponomaryev , one of the founders of Memorial and a Soviet - era dissident .
He concentrates on defending prisoners and highlighting their conditions .
Just this year he has dealt with a lawsuit , an attempted eviction by the Moscow authorities and survived a severe beating by unknown attackers .
" If you compare it with the Soviet Union I think Russia today is a far more frightening place for human rights activists , " he said .
" Then you could go to prison for a long time but they did n't kill people .
Now they kill human rights activists .
You might get a bullet in the head or you could be beaten like I was .
" I was beaten up by three men who silently kicked me in the head until I lost consciousness .
It turned out I had been watched and then ambushed .
It was no accident . "
Presidential backing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has spoken publicly of the need for non-governmental organisations to be respected and funded by the government .
He has also appointed the human rights ombudsman for a second term and created a new position of children 's rights ombudsman .
There is also a new draft law that aims to repeal some of the restrictions placed on NGOs during the presidency of current Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
Funding would be something that Memorial would be keen to see coming its way , but groups such as Memorial are often characterised by officials and sceptics as being Western - funded covers for spies - a trend sparked by comments made by Mr Putin himself several years ago .
" The government thinks that those who get money from abroad are suspicious and those that do n't are n't , " said Oleg Orlov .
" Who gets money from abroad ?
Human rights organisations who criticise the government 's human rights record .
These groups cannot get money from inside Russia . "
So a 50,000 - euro ( $ 72,800 ; Â£ 40,000 ) prize from the European parliament - although welcome on one level - will only feed official suspicion that Memorial fits into that suspect category .

Michaele Salahi did n't hesitate to post snapshots of her White House gatecrashing on Facebook , but perhaps she should have .
According to the New York Daily News , many of Salahi âs 11,914 - and - counting " fans " have rained insults on the " Desperate Housewives of D.C. " hopeful , calling her a " fame whore , " a " gold digger , " and a " silly , old cow . "
( Watch Obama advise caution when posting on Facebook )
Here , 7 more Facebookers who paid a heavy price for reckless posts :
The depressed beachgoer : Doctors in Quebec had decreed 29 - year - old Natalie Blanchard 's depression serious enough to qualify her for sick - leave benefits .
But Manulife , a Canadian insurer , cut Blanchard off last month after she posted Facebook photos showing her in a variety of gleeful poses , from catching rays during a beach vacation to clearly enjoying a performance by a Chippendales male stripper .
The sprightly bank intern : Kevin Colvin , an intern at the Anglo Irish Bank in Worcester , Mass. , told management he needed time off to deal with a " family emergency " in New York .
Later that day , he posted photos of himself , dressed as a fairy , attending a Halloween party â provoking his boss to email the shots to Colvin ( cc-ing the entire company ) with the portentous message " Hope everything is ok in New York ( cool wand ) . "
The real - life 007 : Sir John Sawers was due to be appointed chief of MI6 , Britain âs Secret Intelligence Service , when his wife posted Facebook photos in July 2009 revealing where they lived and who their friends were .
The posts were " a most distressing and unfortunate security lapse , " Reuters reported .
The conspicuously bored teen : Kimberley Swann , a 16 - year - old in Essex , England , was fired from her office job this past February after describing her duties as " boring " on her Facebook page , which her boss likened to a staff notice board .
" You should nât really be hassled outside work , " said the newly liberated teen .
The imbibing schoolteacher : Ashley Payne , 24 , lost her job as an Atlanta high - school English teacher last month after she posted European vacation photos in which she could be spied clutching what appeared to be an alcoholic beverage .
" I was nât doing anything illegal ... I was nât doing anything provocative , " says Payne , who is pursuing legal action against the school district .
The Sharpie - happy cheerleader : New England Patriots cheerleader Caitlin Davis was booted from the squad last month after the discovery of Facebook photos showing the 18 - year - old blonde drinking and posing next to a passed - out woman whose body had been defaced with obscene comments and a swastika scrawled in magic marker .
The ( supposedly ) reformed drunk driver :
While charging Erika Scoliere with drunken driving and reckless homicide in 2007 , a judge told the 20 - year - old that she could attend classes at the University of Dayton if she faithfully avoided parties and alcohol .
In June 2009 , police found Facebook photos in which Scoliere is clearly flouting the judge 's orders .
She has since been outfitted with a bracelet that monitors alcohol levels in her perspiration every hour .

Do we really have to be completely dependent on foreign oil , pollution , and unsustainable practices in order to have jobs ?
Really ?
During the April , 2007 , massacre that took the lives of 32 people , officials at Virginia Tech alerted their own family members that a gunman was on the loose , but kept the information from the student body for a full hour - and - a- half , the New York Times reported Friday morning .
The newspaper also stated that a revised report from the university showed that , in one case , officials with the school âs Policy Group released students in a residence from a lockdown and allowed them to attend class even as the shooter , Seung Hui - Cho , was still on the loose .
Two of the students who were released from lockdown were killed .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Times reports :
The report indicates that students who were initially locked down at West Ambler Johnston residence hall , where the spree began , were later released from the building by the police and allowed to attend their 9 a.m. classes .
Two of those students then went to class in Norris Hall , where they were killed by the shooter .
At least two members of the university âs Policy Group , which was assembled to manage the crisis , let their own families know of the first two shootings , in the residence hall , more than 90 minutes before the group warned the rest of the campus .
The new report also says that the university president âs office was locked down about 30 minutes before a formal warning was issued to the rest of the campus .
[ T ]he new report said the local police took more than half an hour longer than was initially believed to begin looking for a suspect , a fact first reported by The Richmond Times - Dispatch .
The new report also said university officials failed to contact the family of the shooter âs first victim , Emily Hilscher , for more than three hours , until after she had died .
Ms. Hilscher survived for some time after being shot and was transported to two different hospitals before she died .

When the new Irish budget is hailed as the toughest in the history of the state , this is no mean boast ; Ireland actually cut pensions as well as teachers ' pay in the austere 1920s .
Last Thursday , pensioners went relatively unscathed , but child and unemployment benefits were slashed and teachers suffered like their great - grandparents .
The main targets were public sector workers , whose salaries were savagely cut on a rising scale .
Even the lowest - paid will lose at least 5 % of their income , and the highest - paid 15 % â these cuts following on previous levies since the unravelling of public finances began last year .
The elements in Irish society who contributed most to that degringolade were bankers , property developers and Fianna FÃ¡il politicians , linked together in a steamy and incestuous embrace .
The bursting of the property bubble exposed the hopeless state of the banks â particularly Anglo - Irish Bank , which had grown like Jack 's beanstalk , manured by the crazy spiral of property " investment " .
Its directors practised systematic deception of shareholders and mind - boggling doctoring of accounts , awarding themselves hundreds of millions of undeclared loans .
None of this has been denied ; more extraordinarily , much was known at the time to the government 's supine so - called regulator .
When Sean FitzPatrick of Anglo - Irish was finally forced to resign a year ago under all sorts of accusations of crookedness , the best that Brian Lenihan , the finance minister , could express was " disappointment " .
There will be more than disappointment among the Irish nurses , teachers , civil servants and junior lecturers who are taking the brunt ; but the banks are on the floor and the property developers are desperately fighting off the spectre of bankruptcy as their Brobdingnagian loans are called in .
Dail deputies are targeted to a modest extent , sharing in the cuts to public sector pay .
Those ( including non-residents ) with incomes over a million are being levied â¬ 200,000 apiece , but this is generally agreed to be window - dressing , and income - tax bands remain unchanged .
If the rich are not being heavily soaked , this may be because they are now hard to find .
And yet only a decade ago there seemed to be so many of them .
As recently as 2007 , a Bank of Ireland survey presented the picture of 33,000 Irish millionaires and â¬ 800bn of domestic wealth sloshing around the country .
But the super - elite of the very rich constituted a tiny number .
Those who qualified as comfortably well - off have seen the values of their shares and houses decimated , and their children start to look abroad for jobs once more .
Meanwhile , inward investment has disappeared , factories close all around , and the Potemkin villages thrown up by fly - by - night builders manipulating sleazy planning permissions are beginning to decay untenanted .
Is Lenihan 's budget the confirmation of the post - Celtic Tiger hangover ?
Fianna FÃ¡il has certainly woken up with a headache .
The taoiseach , Brian Cowen , who as minister for finance under Bertie Ahern connived at vast tax incentives for friendly builders , now sees his own salary cut by 20 % .
Ahern himself has had the gall to hint publicly that things were all right on his watch : considering he had to be practically railroaded into resignation in the aftermath of a slew of financial irregularities in his personal accounts , this is â so to speak â rich .
Ahern , who apparently did not keep a personal bank account , relied on what were inelegantly termed " dig-outs " from moneyed friends .
What or who will dig out the national finances now ?
In previous economic crises , utter disaster has been averted by cross-party consensus on the need for hairshirt economies , and a kind of grim public acquiescence .
Despite looming industrial action , there are signs that this may also be the case now .
But what remains of the years that the locust has eaten ?
Ireland , if poor again , is still younger , sharper , less deferential ( particularly to the Catholic church ) and more entrepreneurial .
While boom governments scandalously ignored the health service and secondary education in favour of " prestige " projects ( more building ) , the arts and third - level education benefited , and these dividends may continue .
The government may have to rediscover Swift 's dictum that the wealth of a country is its people .
How far the " people " forgive the government for the way it has treated them remains to be seen .
The right wing have been saying this to us for decades , however I never expected fellow democrats to throw us under the bus by enabling this retrograde state .
If I do n't support the HCR bill coming through the senate apparently I 'm just being a stupid selfish woman and abortion is not a health issue anyway .
First we have the Hyde amendment directly targeting poor women with its obvious racial slant .
Passed by Congress in 1976 , the Hyde Amendment excludes abortion from the comprehensive health care services provided to low - income people by the federal government through Medicaid .
Congress has made some exceptions to the funding ban , which have varied over the years .
At present , the federal Medicaid program mandates abortion funding in cases of rape or incest , as well as when a pregnant woman 's life is endangered by a physical disorder , illness , or injury .
http://www.aclu.org/...
This was the first step in overturning Roe V Wade by fiscal means , if you have not got the money your rights are restricted .
Now we still have Stupak - Pitts in the House version of the Bill .
" Today âs vote in the House of Representatives in favor of the Pitts - Stupak amendment to deny women access to abortion in health care reform legislation is a direct attack on women 's right to make private health care decisions , " said Vania Leveille , ACLU Legislative Counsel .
" By prohibiting individuals who receive federal subsidies from purchasing private insurance plans that provide abortion care , even when they contribute to the cost with their own funds , members of the House have grossly distorted the meaning of health care reform . "
http://www.aclu.org/...
Its still hanging around on the street corner and has not gone away .
An aide to Rep. Bart Stupak ( D. Mich . ) coordinated opposition this morning to a Senate compromise on the place of abortion in health care legislation this morning with the Republican Senate leadership , the Conference Catholic Bishops , and other anti-abortion groups , according to a chain of frantic emails obtained this morning by POLITICO .
http://www.politico.com/...
The Church is still lurking in their frocks swinging incense and threatening eternal damnation , plus they are seriously messing with the first amendment of our constitution .
Now the Senate is proposing
Under the new abortion provisions , states can opt out of allowing plans to cover abortion in the insurance exchanges the bill would set up .
The exchanges are designed to serve individuals who lack coverage through their jobs , with most receiving federal subsidies to buy insurance .
Enrollees in plans that cover abortion procedures would pay with separate checks -- one for abortion , one for any other health - care services .
http://www.washingtonpost.com/...
This again goes against the findings of SCOTUS in Roe v Wade , that individual States cannot restrict access .
Again this is via the financial route .
So now when this Bill is voted upon it will go into committee to reconcile both the House and Senate Bills to go back to the House for a vote .
They may well have a deal in the Senate that costs more than the public Option version however the signals are coming from the House that this is not the end of the matter .
No matter what the deal will in the end be ; it is a retrograde step .
My other objection is that it is possibly over - riding of our constitutional rights by being forced to buy insurance from for profit companies
Under the bill , most Americans would be required to have insurance .
The penalty for violating this requirement could be as high as 2 percent of a taxpayer âs household income .
Penalties would total $ 15 billion over 10 years , up from $ 8 billion under Mr. Reid âs original proposal , the Congressional Budget Office said .
In the next 10 years , the government would also collect $ 28 billion in penalties from employers who did not offer health benefits to employees .
http://www.nytimes.com/...
Summary
The negotiations for lower drug costs were bartered away immediately by smooching up to big PhRMA .
Medicare extension was denied .
The Public option which would have made the buy in acceptable and fair was deleted .
The Insurance companies being almost impossible to prosecute for rescission are doing the happy dance .
That is one hell of a give away .
Why the delays in implementation they serve no purpose .
Forcing a buy in to for profit insurance may well turn out to be unconstitutional and threaten the whole Bill anyway .
Expect plenty of legal action probably by PhRMA and the insurance companies , the inbuilt delays and complexity of the Bill are setting up the perfect storm .
The return of the back street abortionist may well be on the cards ; with all the absolute horror that entails .
Now
I am being told that it is OK if I and 159 million others have to pay a gender supplement to be covered .
I am being told to shut up about my rights and my health by both sides of the aisle .
If you really believe 30 million more will receive affordable health care and will not be subjected to discrimination via pre-existing conditions and rescission your are living in cloud cuckoo land .
Therefore .
I know there is nothing I can do to prevent this horrible compromise its a done deal and some good may yet still come out of this however :
I cannot support this Bill nor those trying to flog me this dead horse .
I will move on to the next fight , and the one after but the fight still continues for Medicare for all .
No Avatar nor pictures today , its not a good day
Love
Alessandra .
Update :
Thanks for all the comments and thank you for reading my diary and my opinion .
Good , bad , derisory .
I always learn something from 99 % of them and if I was right all the time and 100 % of what I say was absolutely correct well :
Obama would n't be the President , and I really would n't want that job in a million years .
Let 's see how Health Insurance reform goes , its on its way for better or worse back to the House .
I still do n't like it for the above reasons , I hope sincerely that I am proved 100 % wrong .
Have a great day Kossacks .

How many cyclists does it take to power a hairdryer ?
The answer 's 18 , as one family discovered in a unique TV experiment
Until recently , much of Shelley Collins 's day was spent carrying out a familiar and somewhat tedious routine : traipsing around her three - storey town house after her husband and two children , turning off light switches , unplugging games consoles and turning the central heating down .
' It was a long - standing joke in our family that if I went out , I 'd come home to find the house looking like the Blackpool Illuminations , with every single light switched on for no reason other than it had n't been switched off , ' says Shelley , a primary school teacher , who lives in Cheltenham with her husband Andy , an IT consultant , and children Isobel , 15 , and Daniel , 12 .
' And it was n't just the lights .
Both my husband and children left their laptops on permanently , and every night the only person who would think to turn off the microwave and cooker at the switch - both have energy - draining LCD displays - was me .
Family challenge :
The Collins with some of the gadgets powered by cyclists
' My husband loved the house warm , too , and would leave the heating turned up to the max even when we were out .
Sometimes it would feel more like a sauna than an ordinary home .
' It 's not that I 'm obsessive about the environment , but I do n't see the point in wasting energy given what we 're all told about global warming .
' Our energy costs have also risen substantially recently , from about Â£ 60 a month for electricity to Â£ 80 , and a part of my attitude was about keeping costs down , too .
The battle I 've faced is how to get that message across to my husband and children . '
Whatever Shelley said to her family , it was not , admits Andy , a success .
He says : ' Shelley would go on at the children and me to turn things off , but I would just keep forgetting .
My worst offence in her eyes was to leave the fridge door open , something I did fairly often .
' My excuse was always that I 'm not naturally environmentally conscious .
For instance , I 'd always drive to the local shops even though they 're only five minutes ' walk away .
' I know the reasons I should walk , but it 's quicker and easier to just jump in the car . '
Today , Shelley 's family 's energy wastage is dramatically reduced .
The house is full of energy - saving lightbulbs and every night , all appliances are turned off at their switch .
The reason for this turnaround ?
Their participation in a unique experiment in which they spent 24 hours in a house powered not by the national grid , but by a so - called ' Human Power Station ' - 80 cyclists pedalling bikes adapted in order to generate electricity .
Experiment : ( from left ) Presenters Dallas Campbell , Liz Bonnin and Jem Stansfield in front of the Human Power Station , filmed for BBC1
The aim of the experiment was to illustrate in terms we can all understand - pedal power - just how much energy we use and to highlight the effort it takes to create the power we need , as opposed to simply flicking a switch .
The experiment , without doubt , provides food for thought .
The cyclists were not normal people , or even those used to participating in the hell that is a gym - based cycling ' spinning class ' , but instead were members of some of Britain 's most elite cycling clubs .
You might think they would find the task easy .
Yet simply powering a hairdryer relied on the efforts of 18 cyclists .
It took nine cyclists to power the toaster .
And boiling the kettle , something most of us do a number of times a day , requires the combined effort of 30 cyclists pedalling as fast as possible .
The list goes on : three cyclists for the television , 11 cyclists for the vacuum cleaner , 15 cyclists for the iron , 14 for the microwave , 17 for the washing machine , 24 for the oven and an astonishing 70 cyclists pedalling at full - pelt just to power the electric shower .
At one stage , when the family were simply doing what they would ordinarily do on a Sunday afternoon - the children were playing on the Wii , Andy was vacuuming , Shelley was cooking a roast , and yes , a few extra lights had been left on , the house was plunged into darkness as all 80 cyclists , despite pedalling full - tilt , were unable to keep up with the energy demands .
Energy experts Colin Tonks and Tim Siddall , the masterminds behind the experiment - featured on BBC1 tonight - and co-owners of Electric Pedals , a company that designs and builds human - powered lighting and music installations , say that the average person cycling on one of their bikes is able to produce only enough energy to power a single lightbulb or a small hi- fi system .
' We 're always asked how much power it 's possible to get from each bike - created using a simple dynamo attached to the rear wheel - and that depends on the rider , ' says Colin .
New values :
The Collins family said they changed their ways after the challenge
' An average human can maintain 40 to 50 watts for an hour , whereas someone like record - breaking Tour de France cyclist Lance Armstrong could maintain 400 watts for a couple of hours , which could provide adequate power for an electric drill or a 42 - inch plasma screen with games console . '
When the Collins family moved into the specially designed house , they had no idea what the experiment would be about .
They were told simply to act as normally as possible , and behave as if they were in their own home .
' We really had no idea our electricity use was being monitored at all , let alone generated by cyclists , so we were n't particularly careful , ' says Andy .
' The children were straight on to the games consoles provided and watching television .
' Shelley loaded up the washing machine , did some ironing , cooked a roast dinner and baked a cake .
And I made some coffee in the coffee machine , and forgot to turn the warming plate off for the rest of the day . '
The family were completely unaware that from the moment they flicked on the first light switch , the 80 cyclists based in a nearby warehouse began pedalling .
' The cyclists were grouped into ten teams of eight cyclists , to enable rests , ' explains Colin .
' Our peak output was about 12 kilowatts per hour , enough to run four kettles simultaneously and worth approximately Â£ 2 .
' Had the family been aware of what we were doing , they would have been able to arrange their electrical consumption so that they did n't use so much ( or so much of our cyclists ' energy ) .
But as what happened showed , we use electricity so thoughtlessly .
Pedal power : 80 cyclists took part in the event to power household appliances
' The first problem was that a number of the cyclists ' efforts were used up in maintaining what we call base power .
' When estimating how many cyclists we 'd need , we 'd factored in such things as lights being left on , but we had n't counted on things like the warming plate on the coffee machine being left on all day .
Supplying that limited who was available to provide power for other items the family needed throughout the day , such as the oven and the washing machine .
' But the real problem came in the afternoon , when the family started cooking , playing computer games and doing the vacuuming - all at once .
To attempt to keep up , we were in emergency mode , with nine groups pedalling at full - throttle , while one group rested for just a minute .
' Some of the riders were in absolutely agony , their legs were cramping , they were screaming in pain and sweating profusely .
' Still , the family used more energy than we could provide - the oven was on for nearly three hours - and eventually the power supply cut out .
' By the end of the day , the cyclists were completely exhausted , and these are all extremely fit people used to cycling very long distances . '
With the experiment complete , the family were taken to meet the cyclists who had powered their day .
Shelley says : ' I took one look at this group of people sitting on bikes and felt incredibly guilty .
They were all bright red with exertion , covered in sweat and a few were almost collapsed on the seats .
Energy :
Their peak output was 12 kilowatts per hour , enough to run four kettles
' They were all complaining about how much electricity we 'd used , when really we had n't done anything different to what we would normally .
' It 's been so hard for me to get the message about energy wastage through to the children , but the sight of all those poor people seemed to do it immediately .
' The children went red and apologised profusely , as did Andy , especially when he realised his error in leaving the coffee machine on all day .
I 'd say we were all completely stunned .
' Of course pedal power is not equivalent to generating electricity in power stations , but it provides a very clear reference point in terms of our own capabilities .
It hit home immediately how casual we'd all been about electricity , when in fact so much effort was required to generate it . '
Shelley says the experiment has had a profound impact on her family , and a light left on is not a problem she encounters any more .
' All of us know the little changes that make a difference , things like turning lights off , not leaving items on standby , buying energy - saving bulbs , and keeping the central heating down low , ' says Shelley .
' The question is whether or not you bother to do them .
We 've even bought a clear kettle so that you can see how much water is in it and only fill it to the level you need .
' In my family , I used to be the only person who tried .
Now , everyone makes a lot of effort .
It 's not easy to knowingly walk away from a light you have n't turned off when in the back of your mind there 's an image of 80 cyclists pedalling furiously .
' The experiment has changed our perspectives on energy , and where it comes from , for ever . '

Comments by Mike Adams , the Health Ranger
( NaturalNews ) A University of Wisconsin ( UW ) study has found that patients who receive computed tomography ( CT ) scans for various abdominal and pelvic conditions often receive a slew of additional scans that are unnecessary and that expose them to excess radiation .
The findings were presented at the meeting of the ( RSNA ) .
A typical CT scan involves taking images of the patient using an intravenous injection of an imaging chemical in order to contrast the image .
Occasionally it is helpful to take more than one image , but many times doctors will order multiple images unnecessarily .
In many cases , doctors are not being careful to assess the doses of radiation they are administering to patients .
Though they are supposed to take certain measures to accurately ensure that the radiation dosages are as minimal as possible while still achieving successful scans , Kristie Guite , M.D. , of UW emphasized that many doctors do not follow this principle .
Study coauthor J. Louis Hinshaw , M.D. , backed up this point by explaining that CT protocols are meant to be custom - tailored to a patient 's specific condition .
In a great majority of cases , a one - size - fits - all approach is taken that puts the patient at increased risk .
Dr. Hinshaw suggests that patients who are prescribed CT scans should ask their doctors about the risks involved .
They should also find out from the CT facility how many image exposures will need to be taken and if a lesser amount would suffice for their particular conditions .
These last few weeks have been huge for revelations about the dangers of medical imaging tests .
It 's not just CT scans , either : Mammograms are also under fire for exposing women to excess radiation and actually causing cancer .
Western medicine is strangely preoccupied with the desire to visually map physical tissues in the body as part of a diagnostic process .
Why is this so strange ?
Because most modern illnesses have nothing to do with the physical structure of tissues .
Instead , they are expressions ofof the body 's tissues and organs .
Some systems of medicine focus more on the functional relationship between organs than the physical , compartmentalized appearance of those organs , and they have far more success in helping patients without harming them .
For example , I know a Chinese Medicine doctor who can tell you more about your heart , liver and kidneys by simply feeling your pulse than a whole hospital full of CT scans and MRI machines.unless you 've suffered some sort of acute physical trauma such as being struck by a flying pitchfork or hit upside the head with a heavy stack of health insurance forms .
For most health conditions that exist today , medical imaging tests are not merely unnecessary , Medical imaging radiation is n't good for you .
Just one CT scan exposes you to as much radiation as .
Shockingly , And they fail to take medical imaging radiation into account when prescribing these procedures for patients .
The next time a doctor wants to subject you to medical imaging tests , ask WHY you need the test and WHAT the test might reveal that could be helpful to your physician .
You might also ask if there 's a safer alternative that could provide the same diagnostic information without the radiation shower .
And if you do n't believe me , just ask yourself this :
How come every time you get a chest X - ray , a mammogram or a CT scan , and only returns after the imaging is done ?
The reason , of course , is because they 're not stupid enough to hang out in the radiation zone and be exposed to the very same radiation they 've ordered for you .
You know things have gotten pretty ironic when it is the Libertarians defending Obama .
What was nât ironic was the attack from Fox News that prompted the defense â their article â Obama Shatters Spending Record for First - Year Presidents â ( which was promptly picked up by the Drudge Report ) :
President Obama has shattered the budget record for first - year presidents â spending nearly double what his predecessor did when he came into office and far exceeding the first - year tabs for any other U.S. president in history .
In fiscal 2009 the federal government spent $ 3.52 trillion â¦
That fiscal year covered the last three - and - a - half months of George W. Bush âs term and the first eight - and - a - half months of Obamaâs .
Then , hypocritically but not surprisingly , Karl Rove piles on with an editorial in the Wall Street Journal , where he has the chutzpah to accuse Obama of â engineering an unprecedented spending surge â .
Rove conveniently ignores that as Bush âs senior advisor , he was the engineer while Bush was increasing the national debt more than all the previous presidents put together .
But it did surprise me that it was an article on the Cato Institute website that points out the obvious lie being told by Rove and Fox News â that the fiscal year they are complaining about started in October 2008 , so â the vast majority of the spending for that year was the result of Bush Administration policies â .
Even if you blame Obama for the Stimulus Bill ( the need for which was caused by the economic collapse during the Bush administration ) , S - CHIP , Cash - for - clunkers , and other additional spending approved after Obama took office , then Bush is still responsible for 96 % of the spending that Fox News and Rove are blaming on Obama .

NEW YORK -- Mark Ingram dabbed his eyes , took a deep breath and tried to steady himself .
All set , he accepted the Heisman that completes Alabama 's trophy case .
The tough - running tailback turned tearful after winning the Heisman Trophy on Saturday night in the closest vote in the award 's 75 - year history .
Next , he 'll try to lead the most storied program in the South to a national championship .
Ingram finished 28 points ahead of Stanford running back Toby Gerhart .
The sturdy , 212 - pound Ingram took a moment to get composed before starting his speech .
Dressed in a dark suit with blue pinstripes , his voice wavered throughout .
" I'm a little overwhelmed right now , " he said .
" I 'm just so excited to bring Alabama their first Heisman winner . "
Ingram received 227 first - place votes and 1,304 points .
Gerhart got 222 first - place votes and 1,276 points , while Texas quarterback Colt McCoy , last season 's runner - up , received 203 and 1,145 .
Ingram said later he was feeling relaxed -- right up until the winner was announced .
" When he started reading that letter , my heart started beating and I could feel it beating real fast , " he said .
" When he called my name I was excited , then I saw my mom crying and it kind of made me break down , too . "
His father , a former Super Bowl star , was a few miles away .
Incarcerated on bank fraud and money - laundering charges , he watched his son's biggest moment on a prison television .
Nebraska defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh was fourth and Florida quarterback Tim Tebow , who won the Heisman two years ago , was fifth .
The previous closest vote in Heisman history came in 1985 , when Auburn 's Bo Jackson beat Iowa quarterback Chuck Long by 45 points .
Ingram won four of the six regions .
Gerhart took the far west and Suh won the southwest .
Alabama running back Mark Ingram became the third straight sophomore to win the Heisman .

" I appreciate the way he plays , " said Gerhart , who ran for 1,736 yards and scored 26 touchdowns .
" The passion for the game .
I 'm a physical guy , he 's a physical guy .
I feel we 're similar in a lot of ways .
I 'm proud of him and honored to be included with him . "
Ingram has been the backbone of Alabama 's offense , rushing for a school - record 1,542 yards , gaining 6.2 yards per carry and scoring 18 touchdowns .
And in his final chance to make a case for the Heisman , facing Florida 's then - top - ranked defense , Ingram ran for 113 yards and scored three touchdowns to punctuate his season .
The win sent the top - ranked Crimson Tide to the BCS national title game against McCoy and No. 2 Texas on Jan. 7 at the Rose Bowl .
" This is a great , special moment for me but at the same time you 've got to move forward , " Ingram said .
" We still have a national championship game to play in . "
Ingram hugged family members and Alabama coach Nick Saban after winning , and went to the podium .
As he searched for the proper words , several former Heisman winners standing behind him offered encouragement , saying " take your time " and " it 's all right . "
Ingram thanked everyone he could think of , including teammates , coaches , trainers , support staff , an intern and his school teachers .
He is the third consecutive sophomore to win the Heisman since Tebow became the first in 2007 and he will be the sixth winner in the last seven years to go on to play in the BCS national championship game .
Few college football teams can match Alabama 's history of success .
The Crimson Tide dominated the Southeastern Conference for decades .
With six AP national championships , only Notre Dame and Oklahoma have won more .
But at Alabama , it 's a coach who has towered over the program more than any player .
Bear Bryant led some of college football 's greatest players -- from Joe Namath to John Hannah , Ken Stabler to Ozzie Newsome -- but never had a player even finish in the top three of the Heisman voting over his more than three decades at Alabama .
" The legacy of Alabama football certainly had a void filled , " Tide coach Nick Saban said .
David Palmer , the shifty receiver and return man , was third in the Heisman voting in 1993 , the best finish by a Crimson Tide player .
If you think it 's bad here with swine flu ...
Third man dies of pneumonic plague in China as 10,000 are quarantined
Chinese authorities have put a whole town in quarantine after an outbreak of horrifying pneumonic plague .
Three men have died from the highly contagious disease , an even more powerful brother of The Black Death â the bubonic plague believed to have wiped out a quarter of the population of Europe in the 14th Century .
A dozen people in the stricken town of Ziketan have so far been infected .
The disease spreads fast and is passed from person to person by coughing .
Authorities in northwest China have sealed off the remote town of 10,000 people and begun a treatment and quarantine programme .
Outbreak :
Three men have died of pneumonic plague in Qinghai , China
Residents are terrified , shops have been shuttered , homes disinfected , face masks distributed , there has been panic buying and streets are deserted , witnesses reported .
The World Health Organisation said it was in close contact with Chinese health authorities and that measures taken so far were appropriate .
The first to die was a 32 - year - old herdsman whose name has not been given .
One of his neighbours , identified only as Danzin , 37 , was the second victim , dying on Sunday .
A 64 - year - old man was the third victim .
He was another neighbour of the first two people to die from the plague .
Another 10 people , mostly relatives of the first dead man , were infected and are undergoing isolated treatment in hospital in the town in Qinghai province , the official Xinhua News Agency said .
Pneumonic plague is one of the most virulent and deadly diseases on earth , usually fatal within 24 hours .
It attacks the lungs and kills nearly everyone who catches it unless they get rapid treatment with antibiotics .
A team of experts has been sent to the area and the local health bureau warned that anyone with a cough or fever who has visited the town since mid-July should seek hospital treatment .
The sparsely populated area is mostly inhabited by Tibetans and officials hope its isolation will help contain the outbreak .
Isolated :
The rural town of Ziketan has been placed under quarantine
A food seller named Han at Ziketan âs Crystal Alley Market said authorities have told residents to disinfect homes and shops and wear masks when they go out .
He said 80 per cent of shops in the town were closed and that the prices of disinfectants and some vegetables have tripled .
' People are so scared .
There are few people on the streets , ' Han said by telephone .
' There are police guarding the quarantine centre at the township hospital but not on the streets . '
Police checkpoints have been set up at a 17 - mile radius around the town and no one is being allowed to leave the area .
Officials have distributed flyers and made TV and radio announcements on how to prevent infection .
Authorities are trying to track down people who had contact with the men who died .
The situation in Ziketan was stable , according to an official at the local disease control centre , who said the measures taken were ' scientific , orderly , effective and in accordance with the law . '
WHO spokeswoman Vivian Tan said China reported the first death and 11 other cases to the organisation on Saturday .
Such an outbreak was always a concern , she said , but praised the Chinese for reacting quickly .
' When it comes to outbreaks of the plague it 's always quite worrying , but it looks like the authorities have got the situation under control , ' she said .
' This area is quite remote and the population is very small so this should make it easier to contain . '
Experts said the authorities were being very open â in contrast to previous cases .
Health officials in Qinghai have been concerned about pneumonic plague for some time .
In February , they said they had sent out 55 teams across the province to help monitor and control the disease .
First symptoms of pneumonic plague include fever , headache and shortness of breath .
In 2004 , eight villagers in Qinghai province died of plague , most of them infected after killing or eating wild marmots , animals that are related to gophers and prairie dogs .
You can restore the original location of a file that has been sent to the Trash very easily .
This quite literally sends a file that is within the Trash back to where it was originally stored on the Mac OS X file system .
Using the â Restore to Previous Location â feature is really easy , you âll need to open the Trash can and then do one of the following ( one is a keystroke , the other is a right - click option , both work the same however ) :
Keystroke : Select an item in the Trash and hit the Command + Delete keys to send that item to it âs location prior to the Trash
Contextual menu : Select the item and then Right - Click on the file within the Trash and select â Put Back â from the contextual menu ( see screenshot )
Both tricks work the same , here âs what the right - click context menu will look like :
This is limited to fairly modern versions of OS X ( think 10.6 and beyond , so yes it âs in OS X Yosemite 10.10 , and Mavericks , etc ) but how amazingly useful it is , it âs one of those tricks you want to know exists and it will undoubtedly save you time from navigating around deep file paths .
And yes , you can select one file , many files , or all the files in the Trash if you want to , it will put them all back in their respective original locations on your Mac .
It has been two weeks since Climategate revealed that some of the IPCC âs leading researchers have conspired to manipulate temperature data , hide data from other researchers , and bully those scientists who do not agree with them by interfering with the peer review process .
( If you have nât heard about Climategate , it might be because you are still watching ABC , CBS , or NBC .
Google â Climategate â , though , and you will get 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 web page matches . )
Supporters have claimed that there is nothing to see there â¦that the Climategate e-mails released to the world by a whistleblower just show how scientists normally work .
This is a particularly bad strategy , and the public knows it .
Scientists do NOT behave this way â¦at least not in my world .
Others have claimed that a few bad apples do not spoil the whole IPCC barrel .
Well , if it was nât for the fact that these are the core people who gave us the primary thermometer evidence of 20th Century warming ( Phil Jones ) , and the Hockey Stick temperature reconstruction which conveniently did away with the previous 10 or more centuries of natural climate change ( Michael Mann ) , I might be inclined to agree with them .
I will admit that it seems unlikely ( but not impossible ) that a reanalysis of the thermometer data will lead to a much reduced rate of warming in recent decades .
But my bigger concern is that the â it âs - OK - to - fudge â attitude pervades the entire IPCC apparatus .
These e-mails are from the observational side of the IPCC , that is , the research into temperature observations of the past .
What I am more concerned about , though , is the manipulation of climate models , which are used to predict the future state of the climate system .
Computer models are much easier to manipulate than real data , and one can get just about any answer one wants out of them .
Now that we have seen that the temperature observation guys â wanted â to get a certain result , it is reasonable to wonder whether the modelers are also incentivized to produce particular results .
I âm sure the hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into global warming research â money that would dry up if the threat evaporated â has not influenced their objectivity .
Now , trillions of dollars in global warming legislation are riding upon these model â black boxes â that relatively few people understand the inner workings of .
The models are so complex , with many adjustable parameters which have no known true values , that it is unlikely that they can ever be replicated by other researchers .
In case you had nât heard , reproducibility is a basic requirement of scientific research .
The IPCC has gotten around this problem by relying upon many modeling groups running different climate models .
The presumption is that the full range of warming estimates produced by 20 different climate models would surely bound the â truth â , that is , the true amount of warming that will occur for a given amount of additional greenhouse gas emissions .
But do these models really bound the problem ?
I âve been reminded recently that in science you really can not prove any hypothesis to be true ; you can only prove a hypothesis false .
How does this help us when it comes to model predictions of future warming ?
Well , if we can not prove whether a model that produces 2 , or 4 , or 6 deg .
C of warming is correct â¦can we prove whether a model that produces only 0.5 deg .
C of warming is false ?
If we build a model that produces very little warming â less than that produced by any of the IPCC models â is that model any less realistic in its behavior than the models that produce a lot of warming ?
In other words , how do we know that the IPCC models really do bound the problem ?
I suspect that one or more modeling groups have already done this , but the IPCC leadership probably nixed the idea of letting the public find out about it .
Maybe there is a disgruntled modeler out there who is now willing to spill the beans , just as happened with the Climategate emails .
We can call it Climategate II .
Of course , the IPCC turns the argument around , and shows us a few models which produce huge amounts of warming .
But as I âve said before , extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .
If a couple of their models suggest it is theoretically possible to have catastrophic warming , should I be any more concerned than , say , the possibility that a new particle accelerator used by nuclear physicists will suddenly cause the Earth to explode ?
While it would be easy to simply not build or use the particle accelerator , it is much more difficult to reduce global fossil fuel use by , say , 50 % or more .
In the wake of Climategate , I fully expect a renewed IPCC assault on our common sense using the climate models as their ultimate climate â truth â .
It will be claimed that the observations involved in Climategate are nât important anyway â¦it âs the computer models that are telling us what the future will be .
Yeah , right .
Millions of Americans are paying a high price for a safe place to put their money : extremely low interest rates on savings accounts and certificates of deposit .
The elderly and others on fixed incomes have been especially hard hit .
Many have seen returns on savings , C.D. âs and government bonds drop to niggling amounts recently , often costing them money once inflation , fees and taxes are considered .
â Open a Savings Plus Account today and get a great rate , â read an advertisement in the Dec. 16 Newsday for Citibank , which was then offering 1.2 percent for an account .
( As low as it was , the offer was good only for accounts of $ 25,000 and up . )
â They âre advertising it in the papers as if they âre actually proud of that , â said Steven Weisman , a title insurance consultant in New York .
â It âs a joke . â
Image caption Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is thought to have tried to cut ties with his family
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the 24 - year - old Nigerian man who has pleaded guilty to trying to blow up a transatlantic flight on Christmas Day 2009 , appears to have lived a life of privilege .
As the son of one of Nigeria 's most prominent businessmen he had access to international travel and a world - class education .
He has been described by one former British teacher as a dream student .
But people close to him have said he was increasingly showing signs of extremist views before his attempted act of terrorism .
After his arrest , his family told the BBC they had not heard from him since October 2009 .
US and Yemeni officials have linked him to radical cleric Anwar al - Awlaki , whom he is said to have met while in Yemen before the attack , and that he was trained for the attack in Yemen , by the Yemen - based Al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .
Having pleaded guilty at his trial in Detroit , he is set to face life in prison when he is sentenced on 12 January 2012 .
' Teacher 's dream '
He was very sociable , he comes from a wealthy background , he 's well educated ... the numbers do not add up Efemena Mokedi , Former classmate ' Smoke and screams ' on plane Father warned about son's views
Abdulmutallab's father , Alhaji Umaru Mutallab , said he had approached the US and Nigerian authorities to warn them about his son's views in November - weeks before the attempt to destroy the flight to Detroit .
Nigerian media quoted Mr Mutallab , an influential banker who is well connected in Nigerian politics , as saying his son first became radicalised while studying at the British School in Lome ( BSL ) , Togo .
Michael Rimmer , a Briton who taught him history , told the BBC Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had been " every teacher 's dream - very keen , enthusiastic , very bright , very polite " .
He had excelled in Islamic scholarship at the British school and gained a reputation for preaching to other students , said Mr Rimmer .
Mr Rimmer said his former student had always been " very religious " and occasionally aired opinions which were " a bit over the top " .
" In 2001 we had a number of class discussions about the Taliban .
All the other Muslim kids in the class thought they were just a bunch of nutters , but Umar spoke in their defence , " said Mr Rimmer .
But he assumed Abdulmutallab was " just playing devil 's advocate , trying to keep the discussion going " .
Contact severed
Between 2005 and 2008 , Abdulmutallab was enrolled on a course in mechanical engineering at the prestigious University College London .
Image caption Mr Mutallab had warned the authorities about his son's extreme views
The UCL engineering department has described him as a " well - mannered , quietly spoken , polite and able young man " , who " never gave his tutors any cause for concern " .
Yemeni officials have said he was recruited to al - Qaeda while in London .
But UCL and UK government officials have denied that his radicalisation took place during those years .
A former close friend of Abdulmutallab told the BBC he also believed he was recruited only after leaving the country in 2008 .
Qasim Rafiq , who knew the suspect for three years at UCL and preceded him as president of its Islamic Society , said he had shown no signs of violent extremism while living in the UK .
Media reports say Abdulmutallab lived in comfort during his studies , in an apartment in a smart neighbourhood of west London .
After graduating in 2008 , he told his family he wanted to continue learning , by moving to an Arab country to study Arabic .
His family told the BBC Abdulmutallab 's parents decided to send him to Dubai to study for a post - graduate degree in business management , thinking he would benefit from its cosmopolitan nature and would not be exposed to extremist influences .
Image caption Mr Abdulmutallab's family said they would co-operate with any enquiry
But despite his parents ' objections , he abandoned the course before it was finished , saying he was no longer interested and had found an alternative course in Yemen .
He said the seven - year programme would cost nothing and that it did not matter if his Nigerian passport expired - he would be able to obtain a Yemeni one .
When his mother contacted him to urge him to reconsider , Abdulmutallab told her not to get in touch again as he had found " a new life " and they no longer had any ties to him .
It was at this point , the BBC was told , that Mr Mutallab attempted to travel to Yemen to bring his son home .
He also sought help from the US , Nigerian and Saudi authorities , telling them he was concerned by his son's behaviour .
' Actionable intelligence '
The Mutallab family say they have had no contact with Abdulmutallab since October , when he was in Yemen .
They have since been told by US officials that he left Yemen , travelling to Ethiopia and Ghana and finally Nigeria , from where he embarked on his alleged bombing mission .
Despite being on a US terrorism database of 550,000 suspects , Abdulmutallab was not on shorter lists of people banned from flying in the country or subject to additional security screening .
He was able to fly from Lagos to Amsterdam and then board a plane bound for Detroit with high explosives - PETN and TATP - allegedly sewn into his underwear .
He tried to detonate the explosives by injecting chemicals into them , before being overpowered by passengers and crew .
He was badly burned in the process .
US officials said that after his arrest he spent several hours with the FBI and provided them with " usable , actionable intelligence " .
Abdulmutallab is reported to have told investigators he had links to al - Qaeda and had received his explosives in Yemen .
Yemen denies this , saying they came from Nigeria .
Last January he was indicted by a US grand jury on six charges , including the attempted murder of the plane 's 290 passengers and crew , and attempted use of weapons of mass destruction .
In October , Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty at his trial , reportedly saying he was " guilty of this count in US law but not in the Koran " .
During earlier court appearances he made several outbursts , shouting " Anwar is alive " and " Osama is alive " - apparently referring to his al - Qaeda recruiter killed in a drone strike , and Osama Bin Laden , killed by US forces in May .
He also pledged that militants would wipe out " the cancer US " .
His attempted attack led the US and other countries to boost security at airports around the world , including enhanced screening for travellers arriving from or through 14 countries considered to be high risk , including Yemen and Nigeria .
For congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , Afghan President Hamid Karzai âs announcement Tuesday that his country would need the US âs military support for another 10 or 15 years seems to have been the last straw .
The outspoken House representative says it was Karzai âs statement that prompted him to draft a resolution calling for a House vote on the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and Pakistan .
ADVERTISEMENT
â We should nât be there another 15 to 20 months , let alone 15 to 20 years , â Kucinich told the Cleveland Plain Dealer .
â When I âm in my district talking to people , nobody has come up to me and said we need to be in Afghanistan for the next 15 to 20 years .
They do say we need jobs , we need to protect our basic industry , we need education , we need to protect retirement security .
I âd like to see us start taking care of things here at home . â
Kucinich is circulating a letter ( PDF ) among congressional colleagues asking them to co-sponsor his resolution .
My bills , which would trigger a timeline for a timely withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and Pakistan , invoke the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and are intended to secure the Constitutional role of Congress , as directly elected representatives of the people , under Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution , to decide whether or not America enters into war , continues a war , or otherwise introduces armed rorces or material into combat zones .
Despite the president âs assertion that previous congressional action gives him the authority to respond to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , a careful reading of the Authorization of Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) makes cleat that the AUMF did not supersede â any requirement of the War Powers Resolution â and therefore did not undermine Congress â ability to revisit the constitutional question of war powers at a later date .
â We can not afford these wars .
We cannot afford the loss of lives .
We cannot afford the cost to taxpayers .
We cannot afford to fail to exercise our constitutional right to end the wars , â Kucinich said in a statement circulated among reporters on Wednesday .
Kucinich told the Plain Dealer he expects his resolution to land at the House International Relations Committee early next year .
If the resolution is voted down , he will ask to have it moved back to the floor of the House â a maneuver that earlier this year allowed him to debate the impeachment of former Vice President Dick Cheney on the House floor , the Plain Dealer notes .

During a visit by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to Kabul on Tuesday , President Karzai told the Pentagon chief that Afghanistan would need the US âs help in security matters for 10 or 15 years going forward .
President Obama âs plan to start withdrawing troops in July 2011 has sparked concern in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan that the Taliban could sit out the surge and attack a pared down force in 18 months â time .
â For 15 to 20 years , Afghanistan will not be able to sustain a force of that nature and capability with its own resources , â Karzai told a news conference .
â We hope that the international community and the United States , as our first ally , will help Afghanistan reach the ability to sustain a force . â

My answer was based on my reading of Frank âs books Crazy for God : How I Grew Up as One of the Elect , Helped Found the Religious Right , and Lived to Take All ( or Almost All ) of It Back and Patience with God : Faith for People Who Dont Like Religion ( or Atheism ) .
In the Huffington Post Frank sums up his feelings towards those who claim to be â moderates â seeking â common ground â in an â Open Letter to the â Respectable â Evangelical / Republican Party Leadership â :
When have you all â the respectable leaders â stood up and denounced and called out your haters ?
You the â moderate â evangelical leaders and â respectable â Republican leadership have nurtured the beast of ignorance in your bosom .
Now it âs about to bite you â big - time .
Your willfully ignorant followers are inflicting the rest of this country with the image of hate , intolerance and sheer stupidity on a level that is hard to believe .
One senses that Frank feels an almost desperate need to undo the tone of a movement he helped start .
Having played a role in birthing the Religious Right , he now takes on the role of the whistle blower , who feels called to expose the underbelly of this missional monster .
Like a former mobster turned FBI informant , Frank knows where all the bodies are buried because he was one of the ones who had a hand in creating this Tim Burton - esque horror show that he feels bears scant resemblance to the person and teachings of Jesus Christ .
I can sympathize with Frank âs anger .
As a religious satirist , who covers Christian carnage for a living , I âve seen the dangers of what happens when Christians believe that they can use their proximity to power and money in the service of enacting God âs will here on earth .
The Lord âs Prayer asking God that â Thy will be done â is replaced by â God bless my will . â
All too often , they get co-opted into serving the idols of power and money by deceiving themselves into believing that their desires are in sync with Jesus â call for their lives .
In skimming though the comments from my interview with Frank on the God âs Politics blog , I was struck by the degree of anger directed towards him .
On one level , I understand this outrage because whenever I shoot someone âs sacred cow , they tend to moo very loudly .
But the level of vitriol generated by Christians in a post - Obama era has reached such a level of animosity that the quiet voice of reason appears to have been silenced .
But lest anyone feel the Republican party has de-evolved into a Palin - esque parade of lipstick loonies , Frank sounds a warning bell to be wary of the elite power brokers operating well under the religious radar .
For example , one does nât hear much outrage from Christian organizations following Jeff Sharlet âs reports linking the Family to the anti-gay legislation being proposed in Uganda .
Regardless of how one interprets select Pauline verses and a few lines from Leviticus , how can anyone claim to follow the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth and yet turn a blind eye with others are murdered simply on the basis of their sexual identity ?
Along those lines , given these recent revelations coupled with the C Street scandals , how can any religious leader continue to participate in the Family âs National Prayer Breakfast scheduled with a clear conscience ?
Christians can long for that day promised in the Book of Revelation when the lion lies down with the lamb but in the meantime , they need to be careful because these lions of industry dine on lamb chops .
In Patience with God , Frank speaks to those who have grown weary of such power plays .
They want to believe but can no longer buy into this unbiblical bunk .
To these spiritual seekers , Frank offers his account of how he left the spiritual faith of his childhood to embrace the mysteries of the orthodox faith .
Through his story , Frank encourages other Christians to embark on a similar journey of self - discovery to see where God may be speaking to them these days .
Also , secular readers of Frank Schaeffer âs fiction wo nât come to his post - evangelical nonfiction work with such preconceptions .
Hence , his books can be read in two different ways : from the â inside â ( where the rage against him is found in the evangelical community ) and from the â outside â ( where he is perceived as a novelist of well - received books like Portofino , Zermatt and Saving Grandma , ) Either way , Patience with God serves as a powerful witness in helping turn down the white noise generated by both conservative Christians and the New Atheists , so that we can create a space to actually dialogue with each other .

I first spotted this guy âs tweets a few weeks back .
Rather than taking himself to a quiet corner to find out if the torrent of links people sent him , pointing out his mistakes , actually contained anything he might find interesting , he just came back with yet more received opinion and the usual stuff about being â evolved from â and â believing in â .
You honestly canât make this stuff up .
It âs both comedy genius and utterly terrifying .
Think about it .
This guy is actually entitled to vote !
Starchasr : @MovingToMontana Cmon ?!?!
Listen to what evolution claims â¦ How can you seriously question my sanity for not believing it ?
Original Tweet : http://twitter.com/Starchasr/statuses/6667263721
Yeah , because magic man impregnating his own mother before he was born to save us from sins he created us with is so much more appealing in the credibility stakes .
Starchasr : @ MovingToMontana
I do I read the bible â¦.. Evolution is a confusing theory I expect much more from a â proven fact . â
Original Tweet : http://twitter.com/Starchasr/statuses/6665347486
Can you IMAGINE the response I might have solicited from him had I asked to which â proven facts â in the bible he was referring ?
Starchasr : @MovingToMontana
But at least we dont think our ancestors were potatoes â¦.
Evolution vegetables in every way â¦
Original Tweet : http://twitter.com/Starchasr/statuses/6662595187
This is one of those , â I know how evilooshun works because I once watched a creation science ministries video about it on my Alpha course â non-argument that could only come from someone who has exactly zero clue what taxonomy is .
In a way it actually serves as a useful reminder that we âre not always dealing with people who have all the necessary information at their disposal .
It âs actually a very sad indictment of the education system , in certain parts of the world .
It âs also a commentary on the kinds of TV and radio media which passes for science programming these days .
A far cry indeed from the days of Jacob Bronowskiâs â The Accent of Man â and the embarrassment of riches contained in David Attenborough âs BBC wildlife programmes .
Of course , you ca nât simply blame the media for a general lack of intellectual curiosity among the gabbling masses .
There will always be a certain percentage of the population who would prefer to take their opinions intravenously .
I âd love to think @Starchasr might give himself at least another string to his bow , if he is serious about debating the evidence for evolution with people .
In that light I âve suggested this reading list to him , but I rather suspect his only retort will be to assume I did nât read any Christian literature in the 14 years I was an evangelical .
Such is life .
Sigh .

WWII Japanese super - sub found by divers off the coast of Hawaii
Two Japanese submarines designed to carry bombers to strike U.S. coastal cities in World War II have been found on the seabed off Hawaii .
They had been captured by the U.S. Navy when Japan surrendered in 1945 but were sunk deliberately the following year after the Soviet Union demanded access to them .
This was because the U.S. had learned a vast amount of information from the submarines and did not want the technological secrets falling into the hands of the Soviets , their former ally .
Discovery : A computer - generated image of the I -401 submarine , which has been found on the seabed off Hawaii
The bombers , which could each carry an 800 kg bomb , sat in a hanger and were launched by catapult
Deck guns on the I -401 sub are still visible
The Imperial Japanese Navy 's I -401 was located in March 2005 by a team from the National Atmospheric Administration but it has taken a further four years for them to find her sister vessel , the I -201 .
As the war progressed Japan had become acutely aware of its weakness in surface ships .
It therefore decided to concentrate on its submarines and created these underwater aircraft carriers .
Three Aichi light bombers , which could carry an 800 kg bomb , could be stowed in a hangar on the deck and they would be launched by a catapult .
The aircraft were fitted with floats , which allowed them to land on the water once they returned from their missions .
The Japanese wanted to use the superior I - 201 - which could approach the surface of the water , prepare and launch aircraft within minutes - to launch rats riddled with plague as well as insects carrying cholera , dengue fever and typhus .
But with the bacteriological weapons not ready in time , the target switched to the Panama Canal .
Japan surrendered , however , before the attack could be carried out .
Dr Hans Van Tillburg , the maritime heritage co-ordinator for the national Marine Sanctuaries in the Pacific Islands , said : ' If you look at a sub like the I - 201 , it was nothing like anybody had in the Second World War .
It had a streamlined body and conning tower and retractable guns .
' It looks more like a Cold War sub .
And it predates the cruise missile concept . '
With a crew of 144 it carried enough fuel to travel 37,000 miles and was triple the size of contemporary submarines .
Wreck : A close up shot of the conning tower of the I -401 remains .
The vessel was designed to launch aircraft to bomb the U.S .
Hunt for the Samurai Subs will be shown today on National Geographic channel at 9 pm .

Rivals on the dating scene could make one feel closer to God , according to new research that suggests one 's religiousness may be more closely related to mating strategies than previously known .
In experiments with 269 college students , researchers found that both men and women apparently felt more religious when they saw attractive potential competitors .
Social psychologists had volunteers view dating profiles of either attractive men or women and told them these were fellow students participating at an online dating site .
They were then asked to rate , on a 10 - point scale , the extent to which they agreed with statements like , " I believe in God , " " We'd be better off if religion played a bigger role in people 's lives , " and " Religious beliefs are important to me in my everyday decisions . "
The volunteers appeared more religious when exposed to attractive members of their own sex .
" While we do n't doubt there are many reasons people are religious , our current findings suggest that people do vary in religiosity depending on the perceived mating market , " said researcher Yexin Jessica Li at Arizona State University in Tempe .
What 's going on
The findings , detailed online Nov. 1 in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , suggest that people may adjust their religious feelings to support their current romantic goals .
Past research had suggested that information about the local dating pool can influence one 's behavior â exposure to attractive members of one 's own sex can reduce one 's feelings about one 's own attractiveness .
" It 's our belief that religious behavior is linked to several different psychological mechanisms , but one plausible function of religious sanctions on sexuality is to maintain and defend a low - promiscuity , monogamous lifestyle , " said researcher Douglas Kenrick at Arizona State University .
" For that lifestyle , an abundance of attractive competitors is a threat . "
" Our guess at this point is that seeing attractive members of one 's sex makes it less likely that you will be able to play a fast and loose mating strategy , because the competition is likely to be too tough , " Li said .
As such , the researchers conjecture that people might become more religious when rivals are present since religion often involves rules that police sex .
Alternatively , people might say they are more religious to be more attractive , maybe exploiting a different niche to find mates .
" We are proposing a new way to look at religion â as a strategy to advance evolutionary goals , " Li said .
" This opens an exciting new line of research to explore in terms of the link between evolution and religion .
There are many potential ways to go from here , but we are especially interested in looking at different domains of risk - taking and decision - making . "
Criticism expected
These findings dovetail with others from the researchers suggesting that people 's feelings about premarital sex , abortion , and birth control â about mating and its potential consequences , in other words â " were more predictive of their church attendance than other classical religious attitudes , such as their beliefs about whether stealing or lying are right or wrong , " Li said .
The scientists added that especially religious people might not change their views at all regardless of how attractive rivals might be .
Moreover , they suggested responses could vary across religions , since each might have different notions regarding sex .
" We feel that perhaps most vocal criticism we will get for this research will be a moral one , " said researcher Adam Cohen at Arizona State University .
" Some people do not like thinking about something as personal as religiosity as a mating strategy . "
Social psychologist Ara Norenzayan at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , who did not take part in this research , noted that one issue these findings raise is that " if religiosity is a commitment device for both sexes , what would stop impostors who are not really religious to fake religiosity to attract mates ?
And it would be very interesting in the future to see if increases in religiosity lead to more interest from the opposite sex .
Another interesting question is whether the higher levels of religiosity lead to a shift from short - term mating strategies to long - term â that is , more interest in stable relationships . "

Vor einem gut gefÃ¼llten GroÃen Saal in der Volkshochschule Erlangen hielt Dr. Colin Goldner den ErÃ¶ffnungsvortrag der 4 .
MedienpÃ¤dagogischen
Woche des Instituts fÃ¼r Medienverantwortung , die sich in diesem Jahr dem Themenkomplex â Medien und Religion â widmet .
Unter dem Titel â Der Dalai Lama , die CIA und das neue Feindbild China â wurde mit dem so manchem Klischee Ã¼ber den tibetischen Buddhismus , seine â Heiligkeit â dem Dalai Lama sowie einigen Vorstellungen Ã¼ber historische AblÃ¤ufe im letzten Jahrhundert aufgerÃ¤umt .
Ohne chinesische Politik zu idealisieren , konnte Goldner in der insgesamt 2 1/2 - stÃ¼ndigen Vortrags - und Diskussionsveranstaltung darin Ã¼berzeugen , dass das Medienbild eines durchwegs friedliebenden Dalai Lama eine Medieninszenierung darstellt .
Eine , bei der Medien teilweise Macher , teilweise aber auch Opfer von Propaganda sind , wie man etwa anhand der PR - AktivitÃ¤ten der NGO Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy ( TCHRD ) sehen kÃ¶nne , die vom CIA - nahen National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) aus den USA finanziert werde , so Goldner .
Neben der Abgrenzung des Tibetischen Buddhismus vom sonstigen , schilderte Goldner eindringlich die Erziehung eines Menschen - und Naturbildes bei tibetischen MÃ¶nchen wie BevÃ¶lkerung , die der Vorstellung einer â Liebe zu SchÃ¶pfung und Friedfertigkeit â spotten .
Der Autor des Buches â Dalai Lama â Fall eines GottkÃ¶nigs â ist darum der Meinung , dass die Free Tibet - Bewegung wesentlich differenzierter an die Frage nach der â Befreiung wovon ? â herangehen mÃ¼sse : in Bezug auf BevÃ¶lkerungsentwicklung , Anerkennung des Tibetischen als offizielle Staatssprache der Volksrepublik China und medizinische Versorgung sei die sog .
â chinesische Besetzung â eher von Vorteil .
Nach einigen Seitenhieben auf tibetische wie chinesische Medizin , den Lamakult auÃerhalb Tibets , der die jahrhundertelange Ausbeutung des einfachen Volkes durch den Klerus vÃ¶llig ignoriert , und den Verweis auf die Besitzstandswahrungsversuche des aktuellen Dalai Lama , lÃ¶ste vor allem der Hinweis auf die rituellen Missbrauch junger MÃ¤dchen durch hohe Geistliche EmpÃ¶rung im Publikum aus .
Goldner beschrÃ¤nkte sich darauf , diesen als angeblich notwendigen Schritt fÃ¼r Lamas zur Erreichung einer hÃ¶heren Widergeburtsstufe oder der Durchbrechung des Rades der Wiedergeburt zu erwÃ¤hnen und stellte sie in eine Reihe mit weiteren frauenverachtenden Praktiken und Ansichten weltweit , vor allem aber im arabischen Raum .
All diese MissstÃ¤nde fÃ¼hren bei den westlichen Regierungen nicht dazu , die jeweiligen Verantwortlichen nicht zu unterstÃ¼tzen â das GeschÃ¤ft scheine wichtiger .
Dies sieht er auch in Bezug auf die stÃ¤rker werdende Wirtschaftsmacht China , die im Wechselspiel westlicher Interessen immer wieder mal mehr mal weniger am Pranger der Geschichte stand .
Zuletzt im Vorfeld der Olympischen Spiele 2008 â ein Musterbeispiel fÃ¼r Medienmanipulation und MissverstÃ¤ndnisse .
Goldner , wie auch JÃ¶rg Becker und Michel Collon in Frankreich , zeigte auf , wie etwa Pressefotos von nepalesischen Soldaten fÃ¼r Chinesische ausgegeben wurden und andere BildverÃ¤nderungen ihren Weg bis in Die Zeit fanden .
Formuliert wurden in den bÃ¼rgerlichen Mainstream - Medien durchwegs Behauptungen , die die Verantwortung fÃ¼r die Krawalle eindeutig der chinesischen â Besatzungsmacht â zuordneten .
Der einmal gesetzte antichinesische
Frame zog sich durch die gesamte Berichterstattung Ã¼ber die olympischen Spiele hindurch : Kein AushÃ¤ngeschild eines vermeintlich unabhÃ¤ngigen und eigenstÃ¤ndig recherchierenden Journalismus .
Einige im Publikum erinnerten sich an das damalige Medienspektakel und den Umstand , dass ausgerechnet Tibet - begeisterte Urlauber mit Handyaufzeichnungen im Internet auf die massiven Manipulationen hingewiesen hatten .
Insofern hat der Dalai Lama 2008 den Deutschen Medienpreis gar verdient erhalten , denn ein Medienprofi scheint er zu sein .

Damit hatte die MedienpÃ¤dagogische Woche , die in Kooperation mit der vhs Erlangen und durch die UnterstÃ¼tzung durch Katholische Erwachsenenbildung , Interkulturellen Rat , Kultur - und Freizeitamt , BÃ¼rgerstiftung und Bund fÃ¼r Geistesfreiheit Erlangen sowie der GrÃ¼nen Liste ermÃ¶glicht wurde , einen wÃ¼rdigen Auftakt gefunden â die Diskrepanz zwischen Medienbild und Faktenlage konnte kaum grÃ¶Ãer sein .
Gespannt darf man auf die Fortsetzung am Donnerstag ( 19.11 . ) sein , die sich dem Thema â Fundamentalismus auf dem Vormarsch â verschrieben hat .
Im Rahmen einer Podiumsdiskussion wird der Frage nachgegangen , welche Fundamentalismen in den Medien Aufmerksamkeit erhalten und welche nicht oder zumindest weniger .

( NaturalNews ) Welcome everyone .
I 'm the Health Ranger , Mike Adams .
Today we 're talking about the dangers of chemicals in your tap water .
Thehas done a study , and they 're reporting today that all kinds of chemicals are found in your tap water , and this time we 're not talking about lead , mercury , pesticides , synthetic hormones , or anything like that .
Today we 're talking about pharmaceuticals in your water .
( This article is a transcript of the audio program Health Ranger Report # 19 , which is available at https://www.naturalnews.com/Index-Podcasts.ht...
Sounds pretty crazy does n't it ?
But it 's true .
Pharmaceuticals are now found in 24 major metropolitan cities .
I mean the water supplying those cities is contaminated with pharmaceuticals .
Not just one or two either , but six different pharmaceuticals so far Â that 's what has been found Â including anti-depressant medications , anti-seizure medications , anti-inflammatory medications , painkillers , even caffeine .
Yes , there is caffeine in the water .
You do n't even need to drink coffee in the morning anymore !
Get up ; slam some tap water , and you have your chemicals for the day !
Well , that 's just an exaggeration of course .
They 're not found in large amounts in the water , and we 're going to talk about that over the next few minutes Â talk to you about the dangers of these chemicals found in the public water supply and reveal what you can do to protect yourself from these chemicals .
All that 's coming right up .
All right , let 's start with what has been found in the water and how it got there .
That 's a big question , and when I have been talking with people about this , they 've asked me , " Hey Mike , how do these drugs get in the water supply ? "
Well , to understand that you have to understand where your water comes from .
Now this might be kind of a scary talk , actually .
If you know where your water comes from you may not want to drink it anymore .
In fact , I think anyone drinking out of the tap is probably not well informed yet .
We 're going to help you get informed here in the next few minutes .
Here is how the water really works .
Many cities take their water from the rivers .
Now , this is where you get your water , and they just treat it .
So whatever actually comes downstream to those cities is put into their municipal water supplies .
Now many consumers have the misconception that these cities actually remove all the dangerous chemicals and substances from the water before they put it into the pipes that go into your kitchen and your bathroom and your home .
That 's not true .
They do n't remove everything .
Sure , they remove the dirt , the sand , and the leaves but they do n't even remove microorganisms and bacteria .
No , that 's not their job .
They do n't remove them .
They just kill them .
Their only job is to sanitize the water so that what you get is drinkable .
It will not kill you , but it 's not clean .
They use chlorine for that usually .
They dump chlorine chemicals into the water ; chlorine kills the microorganisms , and then you end up drinking chlorine and dead bacteria at the tap .
Kind of a scary thing , I know .
I warned you this section could be a little strange , but we have not even gotten to the scary part yet .
The scary part is that you see the city upstream Â the one that 's maybe a hundred miles upstream that 's sending water your way .
Well that city is taking all the raw sewage from all the people who live in that city Â whatever is flushed down the toilet , which includes pharmaceuticals , caffeine , and toxic chemical products including toxic consumer products .
All that stuff ultimately is dumped into the river .
Sure , it 's treated first .
There is some minimal treatment necessary .
They 're not just going to release raw sewage right into the river .
To see that you have to go to China or other countries , but in the United States we do n't just release raw sewage .
They treat it , and then they take that treated sewage and dump it in the river .
That goes downstream , and that goes right into the intake valves of the next city downstream .
That city then takes that same water into their water treatment facility , and then they clean out the particles and add chlorine .
They serve that up to their citizens .
What you 're drinking , if you live in a city that 's downstream from any other city , you 're drinking -- I kid you not -- recycled urine from the city upstream .
I told you it would sound gross , but look , I do n't hold back here , okay ?
You 're going to get the blunt information from me .
This is how it really works .
You 're drinking recycled urine .
You do n't even have to go onto the space shuttle and be a NASA astronaut in order to drink recycled urine .
They do that in space , of course , to conserve water , but we do the same thing right here in the United States to conserve water as well .
I mean where are these cities going to get their water ?
They have to get it from the river that 's flowing downstream .
Whatever is in that river ends up in your water , and that 's how we have pharmaceuticals now being found in the water supply in scary combinations .
Now I know there are many experts out there who say , " Well , look .
The levels of these pharmaceuticals are not alarming .
They 're only being found in parts per trillion in some cases .
Very tiny amounts Â you could call them micro-doses of these pharmaceuticals Â that cannot possibly harm anybody ; could it ? "
That 's what they 're saying .
Well , it 's interesting .
If you look at the history of conventional medicine and the history of the chemical industry , is n't it just one case after another of experts telling you that these chemicals are all safe ?
No , it could n't possibly harm you !
Mercury is perfectly safe , they used to say .
It could n't possibly harm you .
Let 's use it for fillings and put it in your mouth .
Yes , do n't worry about it .
They would say lead is perfectly safe .
Do n't worry about that either Â so they have led gasoline .
For decades , when cars were driving around they were putting lead into the air and people were breathing the lead and children were having problems .
That 's why they finally came up with unleaded gasoline to get rid of the lead problem .
We were told Teflon was safe , right ?
Now we know if you heat the Teflon pan too much , it releases fumes into the air .
It will kill parrots .
Yes , if you have a parakeet or a parrot in your house and cooking with Teflon and if you get that pan too hot , you will kill the bird .
That 's how dangerous some of these chemicals can be .
We have a long history in this country of experts Â so - called experts Â telling you how safe all these various chemicals are : " Do n't worry about it .
Oh , go ahead and take Vioxx .
Take these anti-inflammatory drugs .
Take these Cox II inhibitors they call them .
Do n't worry about it ; you 're going to be perfectly safe .
" Yes , sure you are if you do n't die from it .
Yes , the ones who are left alive are probably okay , but what about the ones who died ?
Dr. David Graham once testified that one drug approved by the FDA killed more Americans than were killed in the entire Vietnam War .
Think about that for a minute .
One pharmaceutical killed more Americans than the amount who died in the entire Vietnam War .
That 's over 50,000 Americans , and then the FDA turned right around and said , " Oh that 's not too dangerous .
Not dangerous enough to ban , let 's keep selling that drug .
Let 's keep it approved .
" You see , that 's the kind of attitude we get from regulators and industry these days .
No chemical is too dangerous for the masses even if it kills 50,000 or 60,000 Americans .
You know what they say ?
" What about all the people it helped ? "
That 's what they say .
It might have saved 10,000 lives they say .
Do you know what it really did ?
It saved 10,000 shareholders for those pharmaceutical companies .
That 's what it did .
It made them rich .
Of course , the people who died do n't complain , do they ?
Getting back to the water , now we have pharmaceuticals in the water .
Of course , you 're being told that it 's all perfectly safe Â do n't worry about it .
Here 's the catch Â no one has ever tested these in combination .
You see , they can say that one of these drugs in micro - doses is perfectly safe .
They can say that another one is perfectly safe , and they can say that a third one is safe because maybe they 've tested one at a time .
No one in the entire world Â not in any industry Â no one has ever tested what happens when you combine these drugs .
What about the combination Â the toxic pharmaceutical cocktail that we 're now feeding essentially to infants , children , pregnant women , senior citizens , voters Â we 're feeding this intoxicating liquid now to all these people in society because it's in the water supply .
What kind of impact will that have on you , your family , your friends , and your community ?
No one knows .
It 's a grand experiment .
No one knows what 's going to happen .
Every time you turn on the tap and drink some water or every time you use tap water to make soup , you 're cooking some soup and you 're filling up the pan with tap water .
Every time you take a shower or a bath , you 're either absorbing or swallowing trace amounts of different pharmaceuticals that you 're never even given a prescription for .
Is n't that interesting ?
I mean if you went out to a pharmacy and you said give me all these drugs , and I do n't have a prescription , they would look at you as if you were crazy .
If you insisted on it , they might call the police and say that 's illegal .
You cannot have these drugs without a prescription , but you can go home , turn on the tap , and get all those drugs without a prescription .
In fact , without any kind of medical examination whatsoever , and that 's the scary part .
Why are we now dosing tens of millions of Americans with pharmaceuticals when these have never been prescribed to those people ?
They do n't need these medicines .
In fact , the medicines might harm them .
I mean if you give these dangerous pharmaceuticals to people who do n't have a need for them , they 're going to be harmed , right ?
The side effects kick in , but again the critics are saying , " Do n't worry , these drugs are only present in very small amounts . "
That 's when we started talking about the combination .
What happens in humans when you combine all of these drugs in trace amounts Â micro-doses , and you just let them keep consuming this ?
Especially the infants , the children , and the expectant mothers Â what happens ?
Well , the truth is it's a grand medical experiment now being played out on the American people , and it 's being done without their consent .
You did not volunteer for this medical experiment .
You were volunteered through no fault of your own .
Yes , that 's right .
You 're subjected to this without any consent on your part , and that 's part of the crime here , I believe .
Now normally who is responsible for keeping our water safe Â the Environmental Protection Agency , right ?
The EPA is supposed to regulate these dangerous chemicals .
They 're supposed to say you have to keep lead out of the water , and there is only a certain tolerable level of chlorine or mercury or cadmium or other pollutants .
Well , guess what they 're saying about these trace levels of pharmaceuticals in the water ?
Guess what they 're saying now ?
It does n't matter .
They say , " Do n't worry about it .
We 're not going to regulate it .
There 's no guideline .
There 's no limit . "
They 've said essentially nothing .
I think technically they 've said some things like , " Oh we might be concerned about this . "
But they 've done nothing Â no action , just talk .
That 's disturbing because when we look at what happens downstream to the other living organisms that are impacted by the run-off from modern civilization , we see some very alarming things happening .
For example , the amphibians Â the frogs downstream Â some of those frogs are now growing dual sex organs .
They 're part male and part female , and they cannot reproduce , not surprisingly .
This is a problem .
What if our next generation of children , because they 're consuming this water and they 're being exposed to toxic levels of these pharmaceutical chemicals , begins to have infertility problems ?
What if they have disfigured sex organs like those that we have seen in the amphibians downstream ?
Is that a possibility ?
Of course it is .
We already see it happening to other animals downstream .
We have dead zones in the oceans now everywhere where a river empties out of North America and goes into the ocean , like in the Gulf of Mexico for example Â it's a dead zone .
Fish can't even live there .
There is no life except , of course , algal blooms , which are large populations of algae , right ?
They can live there , but everything else is killed .
Nothing else can survive .
A lot of that is agricultural runoff , but it 's probably also at least partially due to the pharmaceutical runoff that we 're now talking about -- the pharmaceutical pollution .
You know why we have this problem now anyway ?
It 's because Big Pharma Â that means all the pharmaceutical corporations Â is pushing its pills onto everybody for conditions that make no sense .
They 're inventing diseases just so they can sell pills to people .
They really are .
These conditions like Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder Â they try to diagnose all these kids with ADHD , so they can put them on drugs .
And do you know what drugs those are ?
Those are amphetamines .
They used to be called speed when you could buy them on the street Â when they were illegal street drugs .
Now they 're being prescribed to children and , of course , the kids are taking those drugs , and when they go home and they use the restroom and they flush the toilet , trace amounts of those drugs go right into the water supply , and they go downstream .
That 's what is contaminating the next city down the line .
This is where it 's coming from .
We 're a nation of over - drugged people , and the drug companies are trying to push more pills onto us all the time .
They 're trying to tell us we 're all diseased .
They even say that being pregnant is a disease .
They say that having a cholesterol number that 's too far off of their number is a disease .
Hogwash Â that 's nonsense , scientific nonsense .
I know people with high cholesterol numbers who are perfectly healthy .
They 're athletic .
They eat right .
They just have high cholesterol because there 's a difference in their genetics .
A difference in their biochemistry Â the drug companies are trying to say those people are diseased .
They 're trying to say that you 're diseased .
They will find something wrong with you Â trust me .
You go in and have a lab test done , and they read a bunch of numbers out on a piece of paper for you .
They will find one number or more that they say is a disease .
Yes , your blood sugar is too high .
Your blood pressure is too high !
Your blood cholesterol is too high .
Oh , do you feel lonely ?
Do you feel shy ?
Do you ever miss someone ?
You must be depressed .
You must need an anti-depressant .
Here take these pills !
They 're happy pills .
They will make you happy .
Keep taking them .
Keep flushing them down the toilet , and let the people downstream drink them after you .
That 's what they 're saying and that 's what is happening in this country now .
We have a country that is intoxicated .
A country polluted with so many medications that it 's now in the water .
It 's now to the point where if you water your lawn , you 're actually putting pharmaceuticals on your grass .
It 's true .
I mean it's to the point where if you 're a farmer and you 're watering your cattle , your chickens , and your pigs , you 're actually giving them micro-doses of pharmaceuticals .
This makes no sense .
Has n't someone noticed that this has all gone too far ?
There is really no need in human biology for all of these pharmaceuticals .
We were not born with a deficiency in pharmaceutical chemicals .
That 's what the drug companies want us to believe Â that from the moment we 're born , we need more drugs , and you 're supposed to take more drugs as a child , and then as a teenager , and then as an adult , and then as a senior citizen .
The only time you 're allowed to stop taking pharmaceuticals is when you die Â even if you die from taking the pharmaceuticals , by the way .
That 's what they 've sold to us .
It 's a huge fraud .
But they 've sold it to us , and many people have bought into it .
That 's why our water is polluted .
Now we 're going to talk about solutions Â how can you protect yourself from these dangerous chemicals in the water ?
What can you do on a practical level ?
What can you do to protect yourself ?
Okay , the first suggestion is do n't drink tap water .
I hope you 're not drinking tap water anyway because there are other scary things in there beyond pharmaceuticals .
I mean those pipes are for delivering dish water , okay , in my opinion Â dish water , maybe bath water , certainly toilet water but not drinking water .
If you want to drink some water , you should be drinking water that 's filtered , and we will talk about filtration or distilled , or you should get water that 's actually from a natural source like spring water .
Now , do n't be fooled into buying Dasani and Aquafina Â those are bottled water products that are actually made by Coca Cola and Pepsi .
Yes , they got into the water business too because it 's profitable , but do you know what they use for their water source ?
It 's actually written right on the bottle Â tap water .
Hard to believe is n't it ?
Dasani and Aquafina made by Coca Cola and Pepsi are made from tap water .
Yes , they just turn on the tap , and you get the same water that they use .
Of course , they filter it , and they add some additional minerals into it .
Then they bottle it , slap a nice plastic colored label on the bottle , and hike up the price about 10,000 % over the cost of the water .
It looks a lot nicer , but it 's still based on tap water , which could mean , by the way , and I do n't know this for sure , but it could mean that those bottled waters still contain trace levels of the very pharmaceuticals that we 're talking about being pollutants .
It 's possible .
I do n't know for sure .
I would be interested to know .
If I find that out , I will share it with you , but if they 're using tap water , it makes sense that we should be reasonably concerned about the possible contamination of those bottled water products with the trace amounts of pharmaceuticals that thehas already found in the municipal water supplies , right ?
That all makes sense .
In addition , by the way , Coca Cola , Pepsi , and lots of other soft drink companies , they use tap water in their bottling facilities .
You could be drinking a can of soda that 's made with water and high fructose corn syrup and phosphoric acid and all these other ingredients .
Guess what ?
That beverage could be made from the same tap water that 's contaminated with pharmaceuticals too .
In fact , you could be drinking a beer , and that beer could be made from the same contaminated water .
You have to be very careful about what you 're drinking these days .
You do n't know what 's in it .
These companies , by the way , are not even testing for the presence of pharmaceuticals in the water .
They 're not even testing for it according to a statement that was published by the .
Do you know why they 're not testing for it ?
They do n't want to see it .
First , they think the levels are too low to be of any concern .
Secondly , if they do n't test for it , then they cannot discover that it 's there .
I mean why bother ?
Until this becomes a bigger problem and there is more pressure from the public or from investors , they 're not going to waste their time sounding the alarm on what may or may not be in their water .
Step
One is do n't drink tap water .
Step
Two is if you want to drink tap water , filter it first .
Now I know that buying bottled water for drinking purposes is very expensive if it 's natural water like spring water from a natural source .
That can get very pricey .
It 's a couple of bucks a bottle and if you 're drinking that every day , you 're going to burn through some cash .
It 's a lot more economical to use a water filtration system .
Now there are many different water filters on the market .
There is one that I like called " Aquasana . "
You can check that out online .
Oh , by the way do n't forget to check out the rest of the website , and you can actually research some of these issues .
Just type in the search box : " water filters " or " water contamination " or any of these other topics .
You get a whole slew of articles on that subject , so be sure to use that resource .
Aquasana is a brand that I like .
You can buy other brands at stores .
There are consumer level products that you can just screw on to your kitchen faucet .
Those help Â they definitely remove many contaminants .
The thing is I do n't know for sure whether they remove all the pharmaceuticals or not .
I mean we know they remove mercury and lead and lots of other contaminants , but those are heavy metals .
Those have a completely different chemical composition from pharmaceuticals .
I am not sure that they 're going to be a total solution for you .
I am going to find out by the way .
We 're going to interview someone from Aquasana , and we 're going to get answers on this and share them with you so that you can make an informed decision about the best way to protect you and your family from these dangerous pharmaceutical pollutants now found in the water .
Until then Â until we know all the facts , one thing we do know for sure Â this is basic common sense Â we know that filtered water is going to be cleaner than non-filtered water .
You do n't have to be a genius to figure that out , right ?
Filtered is better so get your self a water filter even if it's not a super high - end one .
One that you can afford is better than one that you cannot afford and do n't have .
Get what you can afford .
Put it in place and start protecting yourself .
Many people ask me , " Hey Mike , should I get a shower filter too ? "
I say yes , you should definitely get a shower filter because the water coming out of your shower is hot , right ?
Heat opens up the pores in your skin , and that allows your skin to absorb all the chemicals coming out of that shower faucet .
Whatever is in that water is getting absorbed into your skin and going into your blood stream .
Guess what is in the water in most places Â chlorine .
Chlorine is linked to bladder cancer .
Yes , that 's one more reason you should not go swimming in pools that are treated with chlorine by the way .
It 's linked to an increase in bladder cancer .
Chlorine is a poison .
That 's how it works .
That 's how it actually kills microorganisms because it poisons them .
It kills them , and it 's not very good for human biology either .
If you 're showering , then you 're getting doses of chlorine in your skin and in your blood .
The best protection from that is a shower filter .
And again , I am not pushing any particular brand , and I do n't own stock in any water filter companies or anything like that .
Just do your research ; find a good quality filter , and put it in place .
I am interested in you protecting your health Â protecting your family .
I do n't want to see any of you get bladder cancer from the dangerous chlorine that 's found in the water supply .
By protecting yourself with that filter , by the way , you may at the same time be protecting yourself against the pharmaceuticals that are now found in the water , and actually a lot of other chemicals too .
I definitely shower with a shower filter , and I think you should too .
Get that one and put it into place .
Now with that discussion , many people might ask what the real risk is .
Is there really a risk here ?
Are these drugs dangerous in the levels ?
We do n't know , do we ?
Some critics might say , " Hey Mike , you 're scaring people for no reason .
No one really knows if there is any risk . "
Well that 's my point .
That 's exactly my point .
No one knows Â the risk is entirely unknown .
No one has ever done the research .
There is no scientific data on this .
No one can tell you that it 's safe , can they ?
Not a single person Â there is no scientist , no doctor , no expert , no government regulator who can tell you that all these chemicals in your water in combination are perfectly safe for your health .
They cannot say that unless , of course , they 're just lying to you , which they 're probably very likely to do .
Many people seem to do that for a living .
They love to lie to you about the safety of their dangerous chemicals .
I 'm here to tell you it 's an unknown risk , and should n't we as consumers avoid unknown risks if possible ?
Should n't we reduce our exposure to those risks ?
I think so , and we 're going to have more discussion about this .
We 're going to talk about the real nature of unknown risk and why these people are lying to you about this issue .
Again , some more ideas about what you can to protect yourself and your family .
By the way , I want to take a moment and just thank you for reading .
I am here to serve my audience Â to give you the information that you need to be an informed and skeptical consumer .
You see , I do n't have a boss .
That 's right .
I do n't work for any company .
I have been doing this for years , and I live a very healthy lifestyle myself .
I have worked to help hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of people lead a healthier life and to teach them how to be consumers that are more skeptical .
You should be skeptical and not trust what the corporations are trying to tell you .
Do n't trust what the government is trying to tell you either .
Their regulators are corrupt , and we will talk about that in more detail at a later time .
I will prove to you how the FDA is corrupt and in fact , in my opinion , criminal in its negligence .
How the USDA is corrupt and even criminal when it comes to issues like Mad Cow Disease .
And today , we 're talking about the EPA Â the Environmental Protection Agency Â and how it 's negligent in protecting consumers from dangerous chemicals found in the water supply .
There are many people who go around society and they just believe whatever the authorities tell them .
Those people , I am sorry to say , are foolishly behaving .
They do n't know just how much these corporations and these government regulators are working to exploit them and misinform them .
That 's right , many consumers are actually misinformed .
They 're told exactly the opposite of what is true .
When a chemical is dangerous and might kill them , they 're told that it 's perfectly safe , and they should eat all they want .
When the economy is falling , the housing bubble is crashing , and the future of the U.S. dollar is at risk , people are told not to worry about it .
Put all your savings in dollars !
Buy now !
It 's the same fraud .
Government regulators and corporations are so often in the business of misinforming consumers .
I consider myself a spokesperson for countering that Â for speaking out for the people , supporting the people , and showing them how they can be skeptical , well - informed consumers on a variety of issues .
Of course , we focus on health , natural health , and health freedom .
Thanks for continuing to read .
I promise to do my best to keep bringing you valuable information that you can use to protect your health .
Now , let 's continue with this unknown risk situation here .
When you have many pharmaceuticals in the water supply as have now been discovered and when you have them in combination , many regulators say , " Do n't worry ; it 's an unknown risk .
No one knows .
It has never been proven dangerous .
" Well , I have a question for you .
Do you drive around at night in your car with your headlights off , because that 's an unknown risk too .
I mean do you really drive around a corner on a tall cliff where there is a large drop off with your headlights off because you like unknown risks ?
Of course not Â but that 's what they 're telling you to do .
They 're telling you to go ahead and drink this , eat that , put this on your skin , use that , take these drugs , take these pharmaceuticals , take this radiation , and take this chemotherapy .
They 're telling you to do all these things , and they 're saying do n't worry .
It has never been proven dangerous .
That 's what they 're saying .
It 's like driving around with your headlights off .
I think that 's foolish .
I think if you 're going to navigate in this world Â whether you 're navigating the roads at night or navigating your own health journey Â whatever you 're navigating , you should do it with your headlights on .
You should be informed .
You should have all the information possible to make the best decision about how to enhance your health , how to reduce your exposure to toxic chemicals .
That 's what we 're talking about here Â exposure to toxic chemicals .
Now it 's only common sense that the human species Â the human race Â is actually designed to drink pure water , rainwater , or water that is not contaminated with toxic chemicals Â water that is pure and natural .
Water with maybe just a few natural minerals in it because it came from the rocks in the streams and the rivers through which the water flowed .
If that 's what humans are supposed to drink , then anything that deviates from that probably is not good for you , right ?
If you take pure water and you start putting toxic chemicals in it , it makes common sense that it becomes less and less healthy , right ?
If you start putting mercury , lead , cadmium , or radiation , or if you start putting some kind of salt into it , or PCB 's or pesticides , then it 's probably not as good for you as the pure water .
It would only make sense that if you find pharmaceuticals in the water , it 's probably not as good for you as the pure water .
The question is well , how much ?
How bad is it exactly ?
And again , no one knows the answer to that .
So the EPA says since we do n't know , we will say it 's fine .
Where have you heard this before ?
You have heard this from the FDA , right ?
You 've heard it on issues like aspartame Â the artificial chemical sweetener in diet sodas .
They say well we do n't really have any data that aspartame is dangerous .
Actually they do .
They just rather sweep it under the rug .
They 're just not really looking at that data .
They have it .
They 're claiming we do n't really have the data ; therefore , it must be safe .
This is amazing logic .
I mean if you demonstrated this kind of logic in a 10th Grade math class you would get an " F . " The FDA applies this logic to the entire population .
Do n't worry , the FDA is in charge , and they 're here to protect you .
Yes , just like the EPA when it comes to your water .
Do n't worry , these chemicals are fine .
What can you do now to make a difference to help resolve this issue , help protect not only your family , but also your fellow human beings against this pollution ?
I think you can call your representatives at the state level , at the federal level .
You can call them up , and you can express your displeasure with this whole thing and say , " I am not happy about the fact that there are pharmaceuticals in my water .
" That 's a reasonable statement , do n't you think ?
Maybe they will start to look into it .
If enough people call , they will start to look into it .
Do that .
Let your voice be heard .
Do n't sit around and just let these companies put chemicals in the water without any kind of response from the public .
We have to stand up for these things .
We have to fight back .
We have to shout out our truth and say , " Hey , we deserve to have clean water .
Not water that 's contaminated with pharmaceuticals !
Take that stuff out or stop putting it in the water in the first place .
"
We 're going to look more closely at fluoride at a later time .
That 's crazy stuff .
It 's not even natural fluoride by the way .
It 's a synthetic chemical .
It 's a byproduct of the pesticide and fertilizer industries , and they put that into the water on purpose .
It 's incredible what they do .
The next thing you can do is you can call your local water treatment facility , and you can demand that they run tests and inform you about what they find in the water .
If their test finds that there are pharmaceuticals in their water , then you should request that they find a way to take those pharmaceuticals out .
Find a way to give you cleaner water .
You 're paying for the water after all ; should n't it be clean ?
You can apply pressure as a consumer .
You can do all these things , and you can spread the word .
Talk to others about this issue .
Say , " Hey did you know you should not drink out of the tap because there are pharmaceuticals in the tap water .
Did you know that ?
" Tell your friends .
Tell your neighbors .
Tell your co-workers .
Make sure people are aware of this issue and how important it is to avoid tap water now .
It 's amazing what they 're doing to our water in this country .
You see it 's not just the pharmaceuticals .
It 's also the fluoride and the other things that they allow in the water supply .
The EPA says , " Oh yes , you can have these levels of these contaminants in the water , and it 's all perfectly safe .
" It reminds me of the fact that the water supply is considered a target for terrorism .
I mean they 've said this in Washington ; the terrorists could dump poison into the water supply , and they could poison tens of millions of people very easily that way .
I think , why they would bother ?
America is already poisoning the water supply with pharmaceuticals and fluoride and other chemicals like chlorine .
I mean we 're poisoning ourselves .
The corporations are the chemical terrorists of our water supply .
They do n't even need terrorists from anywhere else to harm Americans .
Our own companies are already harming us by our own failed regulators .
We 're being harmed right now .
You have to stand up .
Join me and join others .
Check out the rest of this website .
We 're going to do some reporting on this .
Join us in standing up and demanding cleaner water and in demanding that the EPA regulate pharmaceuticals as environmental pollutants .
That 's the only way we 're going to be able to take control of this issue , protect ourselves , and protect our children from these dangerous chemicals now found in the water supply .
Thanks for reading and stay tuned .
We 're going to have some interesting issues coming up to help you be empowered , safe , healthy , and protected against what these corporations and government officials are trying to do to you .
Yes , stay informed .
That 's how you protect yourself .
Talk to you then !

There has been speculation he intends to have plastic surgery to clear up scars from the attack and on Tuesday his spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti seemed to confirm this when he said : " He 's in fine form and just needs to get a few things fixed after the attack .
I talk to him every day and he 's more determined and positive than ever . "
TORONTO , Canada â
On the face of it , little connects Canadian democracy with roadkill .
Yet the year ends with concerns about both .
Wildlife experts raised the alarm last week about the number of grizzlies being killed by trains barreling through national parks in the Rocky Mountains .
A report by Parks Canada counted 63 grizzlies killed in an eight - year period , most of them by trains and most of them females of cub-rearing age .
The slaughter is much greater , and involves all kinds of wildlife , when collisions outside the Rocky Mountain parks are included .
At about this time last year , while riding a train across Canada , a conductor told me bull moose during rutting season are particularly vulnerable .
They âve been known to charge trains head - on .
The impact is hard enough to jolt the front car , but the results are predictably unfortunate .
â The last thing that went through that moose âs mind was its ass , â the conductor said of one incident he witnessed .
Canadian democracy these days is looking a bit like that moose .
The force bearing down on it , according to political analysts here , is Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his Conservative government .
Harper is reportedly threatening to start the New Year the way he ended the last one â with Parliament prorogued .
That means the legislature that governs the country would be shut down , at Harper âs request , and reopened at a time when the prime minister finds it more convenient politically .
Last year , Harper had Parliament shut down to save his minority government from opposition parties that had banded together to throw him out of power .
This time , Ottawa is buzzing with talk he âll suspend it to prevent further delving into concerns that Canada may have committed war crimes in Afghanistan .
At issue is how the Harper government handled the transfer to Afghan authorities of suspected insurgents captured by Canadian soldiers in 2006 and 2007 .
The evidence suggests Canada continued transferring detainees even after receiving repeated warnings â from allies , the Red Cross and its own officials in Kabul â that they were likely to be tortured .
That would contravene the Geneva Conventions .
For weeks , the Harper government shot back by questioning the patriotism of critics .
Defense Minister Peter MacKay then saw his main line of defense â that not a single prisoner turned over by Canadian soldiers can be proven to have been abused â shot down by Canada âs top general .
General Walter Natynczyk , chief of the defense staff , acknowledged two weeks ago that a prisoner had in fact suffered abuse after being transferred to Afghan police in 2006 .
He also released a report suggested it was common knowledge among Canadian soldiers that detainees were abused .
The revelations resulted in the House of Commons voting for the release of uncensored government documents to a Parliamentary committee studying the issue .
The documents would show whether the government was indeed warned of detainees being tortured .
Citing national security concerns , Harper has made clear he wo nât hand over uncensored documents , even though the committee could review them in sessions closed to the public .
Opposition parties smell a coverup .
Thus the showdown : Opposition parties are considering court action to seize the documents , and Harper is thinking of suspending the pesky Parliament once again .
It âs a long way from the prime minister who came to power in 2006 promising transparency and accountability .
Instead , he âs become far better known for using police officers to stop reporters from asking questions , for issuing a secret handbook to Conservative Members of Parliament on how to disrupt committee meetings , for banning civil servants or Conservative election candidates from giving interviews , for treating stimulus tax dollars like Conservative party funds , and for restricting the role of government watchdogs .
A common accusation is that Harper has turned the prime minister âs office into a U.S. - style presidency , with none of the checks and balances south of the border .
Control is a top priority .
Richard Colvin , the Canadian diplomat who says he repeatedly warned Ottawa that Afghans were abusing detainees , noted recently that Canadian officials in Kabul were told â they should not report information , however accurate , that conflicts with the government âs public messaging . â
The attitude seems to extend beyond Parliament .
Two weeks ago , the Harper government cut off funding to KAIROS , an aid group made up of Christian churches , because of its criticisms of the Israeli government .
It cut funding to the Canadian Arab Federation months earlier for the same reasons .
Concerns about democracy add to suspicions that a Harper government â already seen by many urban voters as rural - based , God-fearing , climate change - denying and anti-gun control â has worse in store if it ever forms a majority .
This time last year , analysts were writing his political obituary .
Today , he âs Canada âs most formidable politician .
But when the normally stern Harper forces a smile , there are still Canadians who ca nât help but react instinctively â they brace for a mugging .
His spin doctors tried to soften his image during the past year .
They gave him woolly sweaters to wear and sat him at a piano during a gala to sing the Beatle âs tune , â With a little help from my friends . â
His support rose briefly into majority territory â helped by the startling ineptness of his main political rival , Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff .
But Harper âs handling of the torture allegations dragged it back down .
In the next federal election , likely sometime in 2010 , Canadians will decide whether democracy has been unacceptably reduced to a moose head - butting a train .
Cancer is the number two cause of death in the United States , killing over 550,000 people annually according to the American Cancer Society âs 2009 Cancer Statistics report .
Although there has been significant progress in the treatment of cancer over the past 20 years , the overall five - year survival rate is still only 66 % .
Some of the causes for this high mortality rate include tumor identification and classification , late diagnosis , and incomplete or inadequate treatment â all of which lead to poor patient outcomes .
The majority of promising new cancer therapies target selected cancer - activated biochemical pathways .
To maximize the clinical utility of these new therapies , researchers must identify and understand the molecular characteristics of each patient âs tumor , and to obtain as much diagnostic and prognostic information as possible for each patient .
Enter nanomedicine .
Led by Elena Rozhkova , scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy âs ( DOE ) Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago âs Brain Tumor Center have developed the first nanoparticles that seek out and destroy glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) brain cancer cells without damaging nearby healthy cells .
Nanomedicine , an offshoot of nanotechnology , refers to highly specific medical intervention at the molecular scale for curing disease or repairing damaged tissues , such as bone , muscle , nerve , or brain cells .
Nanoparticles â anywhere from 100 to 2500 nanometers in size â are at the same scale as the biological molecules and structures inside living cells .
Cancer detection using nanoparticles shows great promise as a therapy for certain types of cancer .
And the U.S. National Institute of Health ( NIH ) is taking nanoparticles very seriously .
The NIH has established a national network of eight Nanomedicine Development Centers , which serve as the intellectual and technological core of the NIH Nanomedicine Roadmap Initiative .
Dr. Rozhkova âs solution involves chemically linking titanium dioxide nanoparticles to an antibody that recognizes and attaches to GMB cells , reports Science Daily .
When they exposed cultured human GMB cells to these so - called " nanobio hybrids , " the nanoparticles killed up to 80 percent of the brain cancer cells after 5 minutes of exposure to focused white light .
The results suggest that these nanoparticles could become a promising part of brain cancer therapy , when used during surgery .
GMB is a particularly nasty form of cancer that often causes death within months of diagnosis .
Titanium dioxide nanoparticles , a type of light - sensitive material widely used in sunscreens , cosmetics , and even wastewater treatment , can destroy some cancer cells when the chemical is exposed to ultraviolet light even without the use of antibodies .
However â until now â researchers have had difficulty getting nanoparticles to target and enter cancer cells while avoiding healthy cells .
Titanium dioxide is not the only nanoparticle that shows promise in cancer therapy .
Gold nanospheres â nearly perfectly spherical nanoparticles that range in size from 30 to 50 nanometers â are being used to search out and " cook " cancer cells .
The cancer - destroying nanospheres show promise as a minimally invasive future treatment for malignant melanoma , the most serious form of skin cancer .
Melanoma now causes more than 8,000 deaths annually in the United States alone and is on the increase globally .
The hollow gold nanospheres are equipped with a special peptide that draws the nanospheres directly to melanoma cells , while avoiding healthy skin cells .
After collecting inside the cancer , the nanospheres heat up when exposed to near - infrared light , which penetrates deeply through the surface of the skin , explains study co-author Jin Zhang , Ph.D. , a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California in Santa Cruz .
This procedure is a variation of photothermal ablation , also known as photoablation therapy , a technique in which doctors use light to burn tumors .
Since the technique can destroy healthy skin cells , doctors must carefully control the duration and intensity of treatment .
It âs basically like putting a cancer cell in hot water and boiling it to death .
" This technique is very promising and exciting , " says Jin Zhang .
" It âs basically like putting a cancer cell in hot water and boiling it to death .
The more heat the metal nanospheres generate , the better . "
Photoablation therapy can be greatly enhanced by applying a light absorbing material such as metal nanoparticles to the tumor .
However , many materials show poor penetration into cancer cells and limited heat carrying - capacities .
These materials include solid gold â as opposed to the hollow nanospheres used by Dr. Zhang and his colleagues .
Other materials such as solid nanorods lack the desired combination of spherical shape and strong near - infrared light absorption required for effective photoablation therapy .
Dr. Zhang and his colleagues worked with the hollow gold nanospheres â each about 1/50,000th the width of a single human hair â to develop more effective cancer - burning materials .
Previous studies by others suggest that hollow gold nanospheres ( nanoshells ) have the potential for strong near - infrared light absorption .
However , until very recently , researchers have been largely unable to produce them successfully in the lab .
The following video shows how light - absorbing gold nanoparticles can also use epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFR ) sites for cancer cell detection with simple white light :
NIH expresses the hope that nanomedicine â including the use of nanoparticles and eventually nanobots ( see the h+ article " Nanobots in the Bloodstream " in Resources ) â will allow scientists to build new devices for a wide range of biomedical applications .
According to the NIH Roadmap , such technology would be used for â detecting infectious agents or metabolic imbalances with novel , tiny sensors , replacing â broken â machinery inside cells with new nanoscale structures , or generating miniature devices that search for , and destroy , infectious agents . â
A second phase for the NIH nanomedicine program was recently approved .
â Centers will continue to expand knowledge of the basic science of nanostructures in living cells , will gain the capability to engineer biological nanostructures , and then will apply the knowledge , tools , and devices to focus on specific target diseases , â reports the NIH Roadmap .
The idea is to apply â acquired fundamental knowledge â such as the experimental results obtained using titanium dioxide nanoparticles and hollow gold nanospheres to actually treat disease .
Such targeted cancer therapies may ultimately ease the despair of millions of cancer victims worldwide .

I hesitate to even call Green a paedophile .
It is true he had some children , his girlfriend did most of the really young ones , but it occasionally showed up .
[ Kinsey ] would always check it .
Nobody ever knew that he had observed .
I think you will find that nobody , in any documentary , ever mentions it .
That I am the first one that ever told you ?
Or told anybody .
It is guarded like a secret .
There is no reference to it anywhere , let alone in print .
Even in the documentaries .
If you and your family are hooked into the Mainstream Managed Media , you , no doubt , already have noticed the enormous campaign underway to promote Kinsey , the new movie about the world 's most famous " sex scientist . "
Led by the New York Times and the television giants -- Fox , ABC , NBC , CBS , PBS -- the massive media onslaught is once again making the name of Alfred C. Kinsey a household word .
Kinsey is being touted as a surprise favorite to bring home the Hollywood gold in the upcoming Oscar sweepstakes .
The tragedy -- and outrageous travesty of justice -- in all of this is that these media giants are aiding and abetting the cinematic transformation of an infamous , despicable child - sex criminal into a noble hero .
Kinsey 's fraudulent use of statistics and his unethical " research " methodologies to promote his perverse sexual agenda are well documented .
It also has been public knowledge for quite a few years now that Kinsey and his researchers knowingly , willingly , and enthusiastically sponsored , supported , and engaged in the most horrid criminal sexual abuse of children .
I say this is " public knowledge " in the sense that the documents and admissions concerning the Kinsey sex crimes against children are in the public realm .
But " the public " is largely ignorant of this information because the pro-Kinsey , pro-hedonist media have censored this information in the interest of protecting and furthering the so - called Sexual Revolution .
By willfully continuing this cover-up of Kinsey 's record and by elevating him to virtual sainthood , they have become willing accomplices to his unconscionable crimes .
Following the FormulaStarring Liam Neeson , the intellectuals ' glamour guy , Kinsey 's early scenes show the young Alfred being badgered by his domineering father ( played by John Lithgow ) , a lay Methodist preacher who , naturally , fits the negative Hollywood stereotype of a rigid , sexually repressed , religious bigot .
In spite of this terrible handicap ( according to the movie ) , young Alfred heroically overcomes the religious inhibitions that are keeping him sexually stunted .
And in the process , he also liberates the libidos of a generation , throughout America and the world .
Thanks to Kinsey , we are told , universal ignorance and fear of sex were conquered .
Here is a small sampling of the accolades being heaped upon Kinsey : * A.O. Scott , New York Times : " I can't think of another movie that has dealt with sex so knowledgeably and , at the same time , made the pursuit of knowledge seem so sexy . " *
Mike Clark , USA Today : " makes Kinsey a complex hero ... one of the year 's better movies . " *
Michael Rechtshaffen , Hollywood Reporter : " boasts exceptional lead performances and lovely writing . " *
Lou Lumenick , New York Post : " it 's as purely entertaining as it is thought - provoking and timely . " *
Peter Travers , Rolling Stone : " knockout of a movie .
" Contrast these adulatory bouquets with the savage treatment dished out over the past year to Mel Gibson and his inspiring movie , The Passion of the Christ .
Many of the same reviewers who viciously attacked The Passion as " obscene , " " pornographic , " and " sadistic " are absolutely in love with Kinsey , even though these derogatory adjectives accurately describe Kinsey , the movie , as well as Kinsey , the man .
However , far more important than the glowing reviews of Kinsey have been the print and broadcast promotionals posing as legitimate news stories .
The major media organizations have used the movie 's release as a hook to showcase and promote the Kinseyite gospel of unrestrained sexual " liberation . "
Something is very fishy here .
According to Yahoo Weekend Box Office Actuals , Kinsey only opened in five theaters nationally on November 12 .
Yet it has had huge publicity , including tens of millions of dollars worth of free media hype , by selected Kinsey - friendly reviewers , editors , and reporters .
The producers and directors of Kinsey know that the message in their movie is completely at odds with the concern for morality that so many voters expressed in the recent election exit polls .
They know that Dr. Kinsey was the celebrated leader of the revolution that has , in a brief time span , almost undone the moral fabric of our nation .
They do not want the American public to make the connection between the Kinseyite view of sexuality - - now - dominant among our media mavens and intelligentsia -- and the societal woes that are dragging us into the cesspool and toward national extinction .
They have not allowed Kinsey critics like me to preview the movie .
As I reported in a previous article for THE NEW AMERICAN , " Promoting Kinsey , Censoring Grandma , " November 15 issue , I twice journeyed to Los Angeles to attend previews of Kinsey , only to have the showings cancelled once the studio execs learned I was in the audience .
They were not about to allow film critics to preview their celluloid sex propaganda , only reliable pro-Kinsey cronies .
This , undoubtedly , is also behind Fox 's marketing strategy to open in so few theaters .
Their plan is to build media buzz and unstoppable momentum for the movie before Kinsey critics can see it and expose their idol 's abominable record .
The Kinsey CultThe Madison Avenue blitzkrieg surrounding Kinsey , the movie , is an attempt to repeat the successful campaign to popularize Kinsey , the man , over half a century ago .
Kinsey 's two landmark books , Sexual Behavior in the Human Male ( 1948 ) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female ( 1953 ) , claimed to be scientific studies documenting the sexual attitudes and practices of the average , normal American man and the average , normal American woman .
In truth , Kinsey 's books are really about his own perverse passions and habits .
They did not represent an honest sampling of normal males and females , but were slanted to obtain the results he desired by including large samplings of prostitutes , convicts , homosexuals , pedophiles , and other reprobates .
When I bring up Kinsey 's indefensible sexual crimes against children , Kinsey 's defenders are wont to object that there is no " proof " that Kinsey himself , personally , raped and sodomized any of the children involved in his research .
By the same token , we have no proof that Hitler , Stalin , or Mao personally murdered any of the millions of their victims .
However , the evidence for Kinsey 's posthumous indictment is overwhelming .
One of Kinsey 's main associates and co-author , Paul Gebhard , admitted in a British television documentary that he , Kinsey , and their fellow researchers knowingly collaborated with criminal pedophiles .
In the British production , Kinsey 's Paedophiles , Gebhard , a former director of the Kinsey Institute , states : " It was illegal and we knew it was illegal , but it 's very important to study childhood sexuality ....
" Gebhard ( played in Kinsey by Timothy Hutton ) also confirmed , in a 1992 phone interview , that several pedophiles timed child sexual acts with stop watches , " at our suggestion . "
Gebhard said that " we would ask them to watch it , and take notes , and ... report back to us . "
One of these " researchers " was a notorious pedophile whom the Kinsey " scientists " identified only as " Mr. X " or " Mr. Green . "
According to Kinsey co-author ( and sex partner ) Wardell Pomeroy , Mr. X had committed immoral acts with over 800 children .
Dr. Gebhard informs us that Mr. X had also committed unnatural acts with men and animals .
" This was just the kind of " expert " who really turned Kinsey on .
Kinsey biographer James H. Jones writes that " Kinsey considered Mr. X not merely a sexual phenomenon but a scientific treasure . "
Kinsey colleague Vincent Nowlis says that Kinsey looked on Mr. X as a " hero " because " the guy had the courage and the ingenuity and the sexual energy and the curiosity to have this fantastic multi- year odyssey ... and never get caught .
" Unspeakable CrimesTable 31 in Kinsey 's own book , Sexual Behavior in the Human Male , clearly shows that babies as young as two months were criminally sexually abused .
Gebhard , in his seminar with fellow sexologists Masters and Johnson , admitted that what he , Kinsey , and their associates were involved in was " definitely coercion . "
However , Gebhard justified these activities with the claim that " coercion is acceptable in the interest of encouraging research participation .
" Paul Gebhard wrote to me in 1981 .
I had asked where the Kinsey Institute had gotten these children .
Who were the adult " researchers ? "
He answered : " Some ... were parents , mostly college educated .
A few were nursery school owners or teachers .
Others were homosexual males interested in older , but still prepubertal , children .
One was a man who had numerous sexual contacts with male and female infants and children and , being of a scientific bent , kept detailed records of each encounter .
" The Kinsey Institute has refused to release the names of these child rapists .
All of the successive directors of the Kinsey Institute -- Kinsey himself , Paul Gebhard , June Reinisch , John Bancroft , and now , current director Julia Heiman , have perpetuated the cover - up .
Kinsey and his associates were guilty of unethical practice and would have been legally at risk of prosecution ( as they well knew ) even if they had only been guilty of encouraging and covering up the child sex crimes of Mr. X / Mr. Green and their other pedophile collaborators .
The impression given by the Institute is that Kinsey only availed himself of the pedophiles ' " research " in the interest of furthering " science . "
He is , therefore , supposedly insulated from moral or criminal culpability because the deeds were done by others somewhere else , and he was merely recording it for science and posterity .
However , Kinsey 's biographers and associates all agree that Kinsey was the ultimate " hands - on " scientist .
He was never satisfied with merely reading the research reports of others .
From this character trait as well as abundant evidence , it is , I believe , almost certain that Kinsey participated directly in some child sex crimes .
In fact , it turns out that his co-author and fellow pornography performer , Paul Gebhard , has acknowledged that on at least one occasion a mother brought her four - year - old girl to Kinsey so that he could observe the girl engage in sexual acts with her teddy bear .
Well , there is a slight slip into criminality here , no ?
Then there is the testimony of Dr. Clarence A. Tripp , a photographer / pornographer at the Kinsey Institute , who worked closely with Kinsey for many years .
In the documentary , Kinsey 's Paedophiles , Tripp was asked : " But if Kinsey states something as a fact , can we be certain that he observed it himself ? " Dr. Tripp responded : " Almost always ....
He wanted to see everything .
This is a hands - on scientist ....
But he had to see it to really believe it .
" Concerning Kinsey 's involvement with Mr. X / Mr. Green , the admitted mass rapist of 800 infants and children , Tripp said : " Kinsey had contact with all [ the pedophiles ] that he could find .
It 's true that nobody would he trust as much as Green . "
However , it appears that Kinsey even checked up on ( and observed in action ) his " hero , " Mr. X / Mr. Green .
Tripp went on to say : A Presidential Apology to the VictimsKinsey 's " research " was funded , principally , by the Rockefeller Foundation and the National Research Council .
Other sponsors such as the Russell Sage Foundation , Ford Foundation , and other tax - exempt foundations ( as well as Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner ) have joined the Rockefeller radicals in pouring millions of dollars into the Kinsey campaign to normalize sexual abnormality .
Additionally , our tax dollars , in the form of government grants , also have gone directly into funding the Kinsey Institute 's perverse agenda , and our tax dollars are at work on another Kinsey movie , soon to be released on PBS 's American Experience .
However , instead of allowing Rockefeller , Ford , the Kinsey Institute , and the puppet press to popularize the most infamous child - sexual molester in western history , I would like to urge a formal apology from President George Bush to the child victims of Kinsey 's bogus studies .
There is strong precedent for such a presidential apology .
Bill Clinton presented a formal apology to the Tuskegee syphilis victims ( 1932 - 1972 ) and radiation victims ( 1944-1974 ) .
President Ford issued such an apology to the victims of the CIA LSD experiments ( 1947-1972 ) .
The guilty offenders were medical doctors and scientists and their staffs , who used their prestige , authority , and government funding to deliberately and illegally experiment on the minds and bodies of innocent , non-consenting adults .
The Kinsey Institute 's pedophile team was guilty of deliberate sexual torture of children and was financed by state monies and by federal funds .
Moreover , despite decades of their covering up these crimes , the Kinsey Institute continues today to receive federal funds for its " scientific " studies on sexuality , pornography , and the like .
Such a formal presidential apology could smash the Kinsey sexuality paradigm and open the floodgates to investigations and legal challenges that could shake the foundations of the sex industrial complex -- from the Kinsey Institute itself to Planned Parenthood to the massive pornography industry .
Warner Music 's Royalty Statements : Works Of Fiction
from the too - much - joy dept
Back to my ridiculous Warner Bros. statement .
As I flipped through its ten pages ( seriously , it took ten pages to detail the $ 62.47 of income ) , I realized that Warner was n't being evil , just careless and unconcerned -- an impression I confirmed a few days later when I spoke to a guy in their Royalties and Licensing department I am going to call Danny .
I asked Danny why there were no royalties at all listed from iTunes , and he said , " Huh .
There are no domestic downloads on here at all .
Only streams .
And it has international downloads , but no international streams .
I have no idea why . "
I asked Danny why the statement only seemed to list tracks from two of the three albums Warner had released -- an entire album was missing .
He said they could only report back what the digital services had provided to them , and the services must not have reported any activity for those other songs .
When I suggested that seemed unlikely -- that having every track from two albums listed by over a dozen different services , but zero tracks from a third album listed by any seemed more like an error on Warner 's side , he said he'd look into it .
As I asked more questions ( Why do we get paid 50 % of the income from all the tracks on one album , but only 35.7143 % of the income from all the tracks on another ?
Why did 29 plays of a track on the late , lamented MusicMatch earn a total of 63 cents when 1,016 plays of the exact same track on MySpace earned only 23 cents ? ) he eventually got to the heart of the matter : :" We do n't normally do this for unrecouped bands , " he said .
" But , I was told you 'd asked . "
When I caught this mistake , and brought it to the attention of someone with the power to correct it , he was n't just befuddled by my anger -- he laughed at it .
" $ 10,000 is nothing ! " he chuckled .
If you 're like most people -- especially people in unrecouped bands -- " nothing " is not a word you ever use in conjunction with a figure like " $ 10,000 , " but he seemed oblivious to that .
" It 's a rounding error .
It happens all the time .
Why are you so worked up ? "

For years we 've all heard the stories about how bad the major labels are at accounting for royalties they owe bands .
There have certainly been a large number of lawsuits from artists claiming that this rather opaque accounting system is used to hide money from musicians , with various multi-platinum selling musicians claiming they never saw a dime of royalties from their albums , thanks to major label accounting .
This is , of course , rather amazing in this day and age where technology allows for amazingly accurate accounting practices -- even for massively complex operations .
But , then again , these are the major labels we 're talking about , and they 're often proud of their technical cluelessness Still , it 's quite interesting to see a blog post , sent in by Quentin Hartman and written by the singer for the band , Tim Quirk .
Quirk is in an interesting position .
Having been a moderately successful major label artist who is now an executive at digital music company Rhapsody , he 's seen different sides of the business -- and in his must - read blog post , he details the absolute fiction that is a royalty statement from Warner Music Group -- leading to the flat - out false claim thatearned a grand total of $ 62.47 in digital royalties over five years across their three Warner albums .
You really should read the whole thing , as it's quite detailed about how the major labels view most bands on their roster .
As you hopefully know , with a major record label , the band gets an advance to record the album .
From then on , the label no longer pays the band anything .
Even though the band accrues royalties on albums sold , those royalties simply go towards repaying the advance .
Most label bands never fully repay the advance , and are thus considered " unrecouped . "
Thismean ( as record label defenders will claim ) that such bands were money losers for the label .
The labels still take their own hefty cut from any album sales .
They justhang onto the tiny fraction of album sales that are officially designated for the actual musicians .
Basically , what Quirk notes , is that whether through malice or indifference ( or a combination of both ) , the general major label attitude towards " unrecouped " bands is that the accounting is meaningless , so they do n't even bother .
That means they make massive mistakes -- such as the time Warner just happened to make a $ 10,000 mistake in Warner 's favor , and then mocked Quirk for even caring about such a measly sum .
Now , when it came to digital revenue , for most artists , Warner apparently does n't even bother to tell artists what their digital royalties are .
They 're unrecouped , so it does n't matter in the minds of Warner execs .
Quirk , by nature of also being an industry exec was able to ( thanks to a chance meeting at a conference and 13 months of waiting ) get Warner to agree to detail his digital earnings .
But , because the band is unlikely to pay off the nearly $ 400,000 in " unrecouped " advance money , basically Warner did a slipshod job of it all .
What this tells you is that Warner either has no serious accounting system to track this sort of thing or has mastered the art of obfuscating everything and purposely acting like their accounting department is run by six - year - olds .
I 'm not sure which is scarier .
Now , Quirk is reasonably clear that he 's just as likely to attribute all of this to a combination of indifference and incompetence than to malice -- and there 's nothing to indicate otherwise .
But , you do have to ask how seriously anyone can take any of the ridiculous numbers that Warner Music Group or the RIAA toss around concerning the music industry and " losses " due to " piracy " and such , when it can't even put together an accounting system that can track ( let alone accurately count ) the most basic information that it is contractually obligated to both track and report .
It also should highlight , for any bands who still actually think signing a major record label contract makes sense , how little regard major labels like Warner Music Group actually have for most of the artists on their label .
As Quirk notes in discussing the $ 10,000 error : So , perhaps , the next time that Warner Music claims that it deserves $ 22,500 for a " pirated " song , someone will point out that according to Warner Music 's own accountants , such numbers are really just a " rounding error " and there 's no need to pay them .
Somehow , I get the feeling that Warner Music will take a different view on such numbers about then .

The mystery of the Nexus One continues to grow ever deeper , but we can pretty much confirm Google 's planning to sell something under that name : the search giant filed an intent - to - use trademark application for " Nexus One " on December 10th , and in order to be granted the trademark registration it 'll have to use the mark in commerce at some point in the future .
Now , do n't get too carried away -- sure , that could mean free unlocked GSM Android sets for all , but it could also just mean Google 's planning to sell the Nexus One as its next - gen Android Developer Phone .
Considering everything we 've heard points to the device being limited to T - Mobile 3G , we 'd say the developer phone theory is still the most likely , but it 's all up in the air until Google provides a sample of the Nexus One mark being used in commerce to the USPTO -- or , better yet , announces something official .
Ruh roh .
As we 're sure you 're aware , the " Nexus " name is a riff on Philip K. Dick 's Nexus - 6 replicants in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? and ultimately in Blade Runner -- and his estate is none too pleased that Google 's using it without permission .
According to the New York Times , Dick 's daughter -- who is in charge of licensing his work -- was never told of Google 's plans , and she 's contacted the lawyers now that she 's found out .
We 're guessing Google can still make nice though : she says she would have been open to an agreement had contact been made earlier .
So ... let 's get on that , guys .

Ross Rubin , Executive Director , Consumer Technology , The NPD Group " At first glance just a VCR that had its tapes switched for a hard drive , TiVo reached beyond its hardware and service to become that rarefied generic verb describing a how we watch television , wreaking havoc with how broadcasters and advertisers thought about programming .
The company knew from the beginning that its idea was huge , but it 's never been able to capitalize fully on its revolution as cable companies have pushed generic competitors .
Moving beyond the DVR , TiVo is now home to a wide range of interactive TV services , but has been stymied by its low subscriber base . "

Though multitouch itself was n't exposed to the public at large until January 2007 when Apple unveiled the original iPhone , the speed at which multitouch has proliferated and spread across the technology world in the last three years is incredible .
The first thing everyone asks about a new touch phone is " does it have multitouch ? "
Why is this ?

I do n't think it would be overstating the case to assert that mobile broadband -- specifically , 3G , but soon LTE , etc. -- is nearly as transformative a technology as the internet itself .
I 'm sure a lot of people would vouch for the iPhone ( 1st - gen , 3G , or 3GS , take your pick ) as the most important piece of tech in the last decade , but I 'd argue that Apple -- and all smartphone makers , for that matter -- would not have had a clear path to making smartphones a viable mass - market consumer product without being able to fulfill a basic expectation and need for speedy data access .

Editor 's take
Line started in 2000 with PowerShot S100 , which retailed for $ 599 with 2 megapixel sensor and CF storage .
We 've no personal attraction to Canon , but it 's tough to argue the importance of the PowerShot Digital ELPH range during the noughties .
First emerging in early 2000 , the 2 megapixel S100 sparked a revolution in the point - and - shoot arena by enabling the ( mildly affluent ) Joe and / or Jane to afford a pocket - sized digital camera with image quality that was more than passable -- and even today the lineup is as significant and well - respected as the day it was introduced .
The line took handheld cameras to a new level of thin ( borrowing heavily on the already - popular ELPH line of fashion - forward film cameras ) , and starting with the SD100 model in 2003 it also helped kick start the SD obsession that carries on today .
Various manufacturers have attempted to achieve the same level of success by jacking up the megapixels and slimming things down as much as humanly possible , but when you think P&S , you probably think Canon first ( and for good reason ) .
My first experience with the Digital ELPH came in early 2005 , when I was gifted with an SD200 .
Turns out that unboxing would lead to a lifelong obsession -- or should I say love / hate relationship -- with the Digital ELPH .
I 've since donated my SD200 to my dear mother , and it 's still pumping out reasonably decent photographs to this day .
I can't say the same about the pair of SD850 ISs that I 've owned , both of which are currently sitting on a shelf of defunct gadgets after being dropped onto hard surfaces ( and in turn , obliterated ) during trips to Montreal and Philadelphia , respectively .
You 'll notice that my own clumsiness did n't stop me from purchasing the exact same camera to replace my first shattered SD850 IS , and I can say with some degree of certainty I 'll pick up a Canon to replace it .
Probably something a little more me - proof , though .
Released in January of 2001 with a starting price point of $ 2,599 , the original TiBook boasted a 15.2 - inch widescreen display , a 400MHz PowerPC processor , 128MB of RAM , and a 10 GB hard drive .
Along with objects of desire like the iMac , iPod , and iPhone , the titanium PowerBook G4 stands as one of those pivotal moments in Apple design history -- a moment when everyone ( even non-fanboys ) had to take notice .
The laptop broke away in more than just basic design ; while it did eschew the previous G3's curved , black plastic housing , it also set the stage for widescreen displays as a standard , brought slot - loading drives to the masses , and transformed the idea of a laptop from mere business accessory to object of desire .
Since 2001 , the look and feel of Apple 's portable computers has evolved , but still remains closely linked to this category - shaping design ; a testament to the power of good looks .
In 2001 I could n't even dream of fantasizing about imagining that I might find enough money to buy one of these , but a much more successful friend had no problem dropping nearly $ 3 k on the day Apple made them available .
While playing one of our many Myth II tournaments at his house I remember marveling at how smooth the graphics were on the TiBook ( the game was a bit old by then , but still crawled on a G3 I 'd bought second - hand ) .
I never managed to scrounge up the dough for the titanium version of the G4 PowerBook , though eventually I scored its replacement , a 15 - inch aluminum model that I used all the way into my early days at Engadget .
released in 2001 for $ 199 ( $ 99 upgrade price ) and minimum system requirements of a 233MHz processor , 64MB of RAM , 1.5 GB of disk space , and SVGA display .
released as " public beta " in 2001 for $ 29 ; final 10.0 version released later that year for $ 129 .
Preloaded and set to boot by default with the release of OS X 10.1.2 in 2002 .
Minimum 10.0 system requirements were a G3 or G4 processor , 64 MB of RAM , and 800 MB of drive space , although the " recommended " configuration was 128MB of RAM and 1.5 GB of storage .
Both Microsoft and Apple started out the decade by offering customers a fresh start -- Windows XP brought the entire Windows family onto the vastly more stable NT kernel , while OS X represented a dramatic wholesale change for the Mac .
It took OS X some time to become a usable daily OS , but XP quickly became everyone 's favorite version of Windows -- so much so that it 's still being sold on netbooks to this day .
Sure , you can argue about how much Apple and Microsoft openly riffed on each other 's ideas as the decade wore on -- some in - window file previews here , a little fast user switching there -- but you simply can't deny that XP and OS X each set a new standard for computing .
If you had found me right after I 'd installed OS X Public Beta for the first time in 2001 and told me how dramatically the OS would change over the next decade , I 'm not sure I would have believed you .
There was a gigantic difference in feel between installing Windows XP and OS X Public Beta -- with XP you got that fun sense of having a whole new computer , fast and ready to take on whatever you could throw at it , while with OS X you just sort of stared at the huge icons and wondered , " Now what ? "
It was clear Apple had a lot of work left to do -- although by 10.3 or so I 'd deleted my Classic partition and was n't looking back .
But hold up : OS X 10.3 looks and feels dated by today 's standards , while XP looks and feels like .
.. XP .
Where Apple did an fantastic job of relentlessly improving and iterating OS X over the past decade , Microsoft set the bar so high coming out of the gate that the biggest threat to Windows 7 is the installed base of XP users who are still happy with their machines .
That 's pretty amazing .
Released on October 23 , 2001 , with 5GB of storage that held 1,000 128 kbps MP3s , a two - inch black and white screen , a mechanical scroll wheel surrounded by four buttons , and FireWire connectivity only .
It was n't the first MP3 player , and it certainly was n't the cheapest , but the original iPod radically reshaped the idea of how digital music should work .
With a dead - simple interface , compact ( for the time ) minimal good looks , and seamless integration with iTunes combined into one package , the iPod instantly got everyone 's attention -- and when the iTunes Music Store launched in 2003 , it became unstoppable .
While the dedicated PMP category is starting to fade in the face of smartphones and the iPod itself is transforming into something entirely different with the iPod touch , it 's the original iPod that started this whole crazy gadget thrill ride .
It 's hard to imagine that there was a time when people had no idea how to use an iPod .
I distinctly remember teaching my friends how to use my brand - new 2G in the car right after I 'd first gotten it , and it just did n't take very long at all -- unlike the Rio players I 'd had before , which no one could figure out and always ended up on the floor .
Now , of course , there are dock connectors everywhere , iTunes is the biggest music retailer in the world , and the iPod and music seem like an afterthought to the iPhone and apps , but man -- I 'll still take a first - gen iPod loaded up with the Clash and the Afghan Whigs and blaze down Lake Shore Drive in my old Mustang any day .
Released in 2002 for $ 299 , the original TiVo Series2 featured a 60 GB hard drive that recorded 60 hours of SD video at " basic quality . "
Later units would come down in price to $ 149 , add more storage , and eventually feature dual tuners .
TiVo had launched the DVR category with the original Series1 in 1999 , it was n't until the Series2 came out in 2003 that things started to blow up : prices came down , the addition of USB ports brought networking to the table , and dual tuners were ( finally ! ) added in 2006 .
Sure , the cable companies completely drank TiVo 's milkshake soon thereafter , but the Series2 was fundamentally so much better than the competition that cable and satellite providers are still playing catch up -- sure , the TiVo Series3 and TiVo HD now support HD recording and offer an array of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Video on Demand , but the TiVo experience is still fundamentally the same .
Whether or not TiVo can continue to survive without some radical changes has been an open question for some time now , but the Series2 will forever live on as the archetypical DVR for an entire generation .
TiVo hacking is still quite popular , but it 's settled into a nice little groove -- people know what 's possible with the current hardware and software , and they 're trying to perfect it .
That 's nothing at all like the excitement around the Series2 when it first launched -- I remember anxiously digging through Linksys USB - to - Ethernet adapter boxes at Best Buy , trying to find specific serial numbers that indicated a supported chipset so I could put my new Series2 on the LAN and just poke around to see what was what .
The first time I ever downloaded a show onto my computer ?
Heaven ... until I had to let the transcode process all night so I could put it on my iPod .
We 're still a long way from the perfect cable box , but TiVo 's been the closest for the longest -- I just hope it can stay alive long enough to get to the finish line .

As mobile phones , now priced within reach of most folks , began to reach some sort of ubiquity , and smartphones were stepping into the realm of real usability , Motorola did something ... different .
It built an object of desire that just happened to be a phone .
The RAZR V3 was unlike anything before it , seemingly carved out of aluminum , a sliver of a thing .
It did n't even matter that the feature set was a little dated at the time of introduction , or that it was oddly oversized when opened and held against the face -- even the $ 500 price seemed appropriate in the face of such visceral attraction .
But then the price started to fall .
What was once an object of distant , decadent desire was within reach for a new class of people , and every slash in price seemed to increase the handset 's popularity exponentially .
I remember the first RAZR ad I saw on TV , which showed the phone flying through the screen , violently slicing whatever lay in its path .
When it at last came to rest and I realized I was staring at a phone , I exclaimed this improbable fact to everyone in the room and knew I wanted it for my own .
I finally purchased the phone the next year , after a short , painful time spent with the N - Gage QD .
It survived my first year as an Engadget editor , an attempted mugging , and even embarrassing subway rides next to other members of the 110 million - strong RAZR club , all of us tapping away on our little Java applets ( mine was a Tetris clone ) and dreaming of nothing better .
If I suddenly had no use for a smartphone , I 'd switch back to my old battered V3 in a heartbeat .
Released in 2003 , the Treo 600 sported a 144MHz ARM CPU , 32MB of RAM , 160 x 160 color display , VGA camera , Palm OS 5 , SD slot , and came in both GSM and CDMA variations .
As a reader of Engadget , you probably know that our interest in Palm ( and its smartphones ) goes way back ... back to our roots .
In 2004 , site founder Peter Rojas spoke to the New York Times about the Treo 600 , explaining what happened when leaked photos of the device emerged online .
In his words , " People were going crazy . "
Seriously .
You may not realize it , but before the iPhone was even a twinkle in Apple 's eye , the Treo line of smartphones had already been fulfilling the earliest promises of Moore 's law and convergence -- they were really the original " do everything " devices that fit in your pocket ( well , kind of ) .
The Treo 600 and its follow - up -- the 650 -- truly set the stage for many of the innovations we take for granted these days ; mobile web and email , touchscreen interfaces , built - in ( and video capable ) cameras , developer communities providing scores of applications , and easy desktop syncing .
The Treo set up the pins , and modern smartphone makers are just knocking them down .
I missed the boat on the 600 , but could n't wait to get my hands on the 650 .
After a long series of disappointing encounters with dumbphones , I decided I really needed something more attuned to my special needs as a tinkerer .
The idea that I could install whatever launcher I wanted , check Engadget while I was having lunch , or play TurboGrafx - 16 games in a waiting room was fairly mind - blowing to me .
The dream of the magical , changeable box became more concrete than ever before with the introduction of these devices .
And just as the iPhone has become largely about the apps , the Treo was attractive not simply because of the platform itself , but the community that had risen up around it .
Applications like Butler , the aforementioned TG16 emulator , and powerful utilities like LauncherX showed the possibilities of an open , active developer base matched with the right hardware .
Despite the advances we 've seen in the years since the Treo 600 made its way into the world , the basic concepts behind these devices remain largely the same , and the blueprint can be traced right back to Palm .
Released in 2005 , $ 399 pricetag , 20GB HDD , DVD drive , 34 million + sold .
There were many reasons to doubt the Xbox 360 upon its launch .
It was n't Microsoft 's fault , they 'd made a good first effort with the Xbox , and Halo was clearly a juggernaut , but the PS2's overwhelming success made Sony look nigh invincible in the space .
Once the specs started pouring in for the PS3 like 1080 p games , Blu-ray , and PSX / PS2 backwards compatibility , the Xbox 360 was starting to sound like the Dreamcast of its generation .
But then it was n't .
It beat the Wii and PS3 to market by a full year , managed to keep a price point that was significantly lower than the PS3 , and as previously promised PS3 exclusives started to migrate to the increasingly intrenched 360 it was clear that Microsoft had pulled off a major coup .
If it had merely been a cheaper , earlier version of the PS3 it might 've eventually fallen by the wayside , but Microsoft 's audacious approach to charging people to play online with Xbox Live Gold actually ended up as the console 's greatest strength , and a key to its staying power .
You do n't remember a console for the chips inside or the case design , but the games you played .
For me those games were Gears of War and Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare .
I bought the 360 in 2006 , and always felt a little out of step with what my friends were playing -- particularly as the catalog has ballooned in 2008 and 2009 .
But these two games forged the perfect intersection with my Xbox Live friends list .
I spent untold hours hopping from match to match with a group of peers , shouting cries of despair into my wired headset as I continually fulfilled my role as " the weakest link " on my team .
Those two games were everything I 'd ever tried to emulate growing up with a game of laser tag , a pair of walkie talkies or an elaborately constructed Lego battlefield , and I got to share them in real time with real people thanks to technologies so complicated and market forces so beyond me that I 'd really prefer not to even think about them .

When Apple released the first iPod in 2001 , mobile phones were very different animals than they are today -- there may have been a vague sense that we 'd someday do a significant portion of our computing from our pockets , but the industry possessed neither the technology nor the vision to make it happen .
Over the years , PDAs and phones inevitably started to merge en masse ; Treos and BlackBerrys helped defined the term " road warrior " ( much to the chagrin of businessfolk who 'd valued their personal time ) and geeky segments of the consumer market started to hop on board .
The " ah - ha " moment , though -- the turning point that would transform smartphones from niche accessories into must - have status symbols -- would ultimately take a fundamental rethinking of the genre , and that 's exactly the sea change the iPhone provided .
Of course , the industry saw the merger of the iPod and the cellphone coming from a mile away , but by the time the iPhone was officially unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9 , 2007 , virtually every prediction and false " leak " was hilariously incorrect -- proof that it took a deep realignment of the way the world thought about mobility to make the device possible .
The rest , as they say , is history : as we close out the decade , full touch is the new black , finger - friendly UIs are virtually required , and world - class industrial design is a given .
The game has changed .
I remember the introduction of the iPhone like it was yesterday : Team Engadget was holed up in a dingy , smelly hotel conference room south of the Las Vegas Convention Center in the thick of CES while our then - Editor - in - chief , a guy called Ryan Block , had taken a quick jaunt up to San Francisco to cover Macworld live .
I can't describe the feeling in that room , the feeling I had as I was preparing our iPhone announcement post -- my heart was pounding .
It was as though we knew what to expect and had absolutely no idea what to expect at the same time .
It 's something I have n't felt before or since , and I think most of the editors here would tell you the same .
For a device -- any device -- to create that kind of emotion in a room full of jaded gadgetheads is pretty amazing , and I 'm honestly not sure we 'll ever experience it again .
Not with Apple , not with anyone else .
It 's not that there wo n't be incredible phones introduced year after year after year -- there will -- it was the culmination of years of speculation coupled with the feeling that the entire game had just been rewritten in a profound way .
Released in 2008 , $ 549 for 8.9 - inch display , 12GB SSD , 1GB of RAM , was available with both Windows XP and Xandros Linux .
Where the Eee PC 701 and its Xandros Linux OS was aimed at kids and " housewives " ( seriously , an ASUS representative said that at the time ) , the succeeding Eee PC 900 was the realization that netbooks had wider market appeal when preloaded with Windows XP .
Whether it was business - minded folk or just those looking to connect to the web on - the - go on a device larger than a smartphone , the small and very affordable laptop made a lot more sense than anyone ever could have imagined .
The 900 series was officially launched in April 2008 and though Intel 's future Atom platform was still being developed by those silicon " rockstars " at Intel , the 2.2 - pound mini-notebook had an 8.9 - inch display , Intel Celeron M processor and 12GB of flash storage ( an odd pairing of one 4 GB SSD and one 8 GB SSD ) .
ASUS sold more than a million units in the first couple of months which resulted in global shortages of the liliputian laptops .
In the U.S. the 900 was the first netbook to be sold at Best Buy .
Shortly after the 900's worldwide success and the release of Intel 's Atom CPU , all major laptop manufactures brought netbooks to market with 9 or 10 inch displays .
It is funny to think that the word netbook was n't even around when I first got my hands on the Eee PC 900 ( us crazy kids called them mini- notebooks back then ) .
For the first few months , I took my " cute laptop " ( as people would remark ) everywhere .
And the fact that I could fit it in my purse never seemed to get old .
Though I like imagining that my first few months with the 900 was all rainbows and butterflies , it really was n't .
I hated the small touchpad and its rock - solid mouse bar and I could n't stand the cramped keyboard and screen .
It was those frustrations that ASUS and others took note of and improved in today 's ever - so - popular 10 - inch netbooks .
The New York Times recently included the word netbook on its Buzwords of 2009 list ; there 's no mention of the Eee PC 900 , but it silently takes the credit for jump - starting a whole new category of mobile computers about two years ago .
Automotive News reports the just - revealed Fiat Doblo will be sold stateside as either a seven - seater with windows or a panel van to take on the Ford Transit Connect .
My name is Ram , my Doblo is full of ugly ?
According to AN , it 's due to join the recently re-branded Ram brand of trucks for the 2012 model year , there 's no official word on which engines will make it to this country .
Production will remain in Turkey , indicating we wo n't get a 700 HP V8 version or even the Sebring 's terrible 2.4 - liter that manages to produce no power , yet freakishly poor fuel economy .
Instead , we 'll likely get Fiat 's own 95 HP gasoline engine even though we 'd really rather like to have the choice between one of Fiat 's passable Multijet diesel engines , which will be offered in European Doblos in 90 , 105 and 135 HP forms .
Please Santa , make them bring it in with a manual transmission .
In Europe , small vans like this ( the Doblo is based in the Focus - rivaling Fiat Grand Punto ) are workhorses for small businesses , large families and urban delivery men , pushing interior space to the limits of the vehicle 's footprint to deliver lots of space inside compact proportions .
That combination of utility , fuel economy and the ability to fit into a parking space has to be experienced to be believed .
After driving a diesel - equipped Transit Connect around London for six months , I 'll never be able to settle for the poor size - to - capacity ratio of a pickup American - style minivan ever again .
Here 's the press release :
World premiere New Fiat DoblÃ² : meet the ' family space '
Meet the new DoblÃ² , the Fiat car that is all about space .
A space to be shared with family and friends : a liveable space for people who travel and love to be in company ; for people who choose the DoblÃ² as a partner for leisure or work .
A vehicle designed to meet a need for functionality and comfort that makes the most of interior space and can accommodate up to seven people .
An authentic ' family space ' that can rely on top - class safety , economy and respect for the environment .
Compared to the previous version that sold approximately one million units , the new model has been completely revamped in terms of style , engines and technical specifications .
These aspects make the new Fiat DoblÃ² the " best in class " both in terms of space and in terms of reduced emissions .
All this has been achieved through the use of a new platform , more passenger space ( with a wheelbase of 2755 mm , the biggest in its segment ) , a roomy 790 litre luggage compartment , reduced CO2 emissions ( 129 g / km with the 1.3 Multijet 90 HP engine , the lowest in its category ) , standard safety features and highly modular interiors with seats that can be folded and tilted .
Style and comfort
The look is very cutting - edge .
With a central shield and side bumpers that are perfectly integrated with the body , the front end blends protection and sophistication while the pronounced wheel arch and sloping shoulder contribute to the vehicle 's strong and agile look .
The tailgate 's essential lines emphasise the accessibility and size of the generous load compartment ; clear , sparkling light clusters and expanses of glass give the new DoblÃ² a touch of elegance .
The interiors have also been designed to offer functionality and create attractive , welcoming environments through combination of colours , materials and trims .
Smart solutions for the best use of on - board space , such as a range of storage compartments and flexible interiors , offering up to 7 places , will satisfy the needs of those who make the DoblÃ² a car to be enjoyed with family or friends .
Environment and economy
The Fiat DoblÃ² will offer 4 power units at its launch : a 95 HP petrol engine and three diesel Multijet engines , 90 , 105 and 135 HP , which will later be joined by a Natural Power engine with dual fuel system ( petrol and methane ) and an additional diesel engine with Dualogic robotized gearbox .
All units are lively and offer smooth torque delivery .
They are remarkable for driving satisfaction , excellent performance , low noise levels , low operating costs ( fuel consumption and maintenance ) and also for their reliability and eco-friendliness .
The range is available with Euro 4 and Euro 5 versions and offers a Start & Stop device as standard , which cuts off the engine temporarily when the car is stopped to guarantee reduced fuel consumption and emissions .
Safety
To ensure optimum dynamic behaviour , comfort and active safety in all road surface and load conditions , the vehicle has been equipped with innovative mechanical features including a bi-link rear suspension system available with various component calibrations depending on vehicle application .
The DoblÃ² 's consistent and predictable road - holding is also guaranteed by the use of state - of - the - art electronic devices for stability control , namely ABS with electronic brake force distribution EBD and , above all , ESP complemented by a hill - holder system that helps the driver during Hill starts and comes as standard on this model .
The vehicle has been designed and built to achieve the highest levels of passive safety , due to a body with crumple zones , front air bags and innovative front side bags .
The latter offer protection for both head and chest .
The vehicle also offers technical solutions and equipment that create optimum comfort conditions and help keep attention on the road : these include an automatic climate control system with distribution to rear seats , cruise control , parking sensors , a built - in Blue& Me hands - free system and a " Blue&Me TomTom " navigator .
The DoblÃ² Cargo , also new , is at the top of the professional vehicle category
The new Fiat DoblÃ² is joined by the new DoblÃ² Cargo which has been designed to take its place at the top of its category in terms of performance and functional characteristics .
It offers a more roomy load compartment than the previous model : square , regular , fully exploitable and equipped with sliding side doors and generously - sized rear doors to make light work of loading and unloading operations .
Record - breaking statistics ( interior length up to 2.2 metres , width between wheel arches of 1.23 metres , volume from 3.4 to 4.2 cubic metres , payload from 750 to 1000 Kg , combined fuel consumption of 4.8 litres / 100 km and range of 1250 Km with the 1.3 Multijet engine ) ensure that the new vehicle can offer substantial benefits in terms of optimisation and reduction of running costs .
The range finds expression in 7 different body types : short and long wheelbase van , high top van , short and long wheelbase 5 - seater combi ; a particularly appealing and brand - new short and long drop - framed version can be easily and cheaply converted for specific trades ( refrigeration chambers , fixed and tilting flatbed trucks ) .
The new models are due to be launched from mid-January 2010 , but it will be possible to order the vehicles from the end of November in Italy and from December in other European markets .

Astute submarine arrives at Faslane on the Clyde
HMS Astute sailed into the Clyde and up the Gareloch to Faslane
The Royal Navy 's biggest and most powerful attack submarine has arrived at Faslane on the Clyde .
HMS Astute , which measures nearly 328ft ( 100 m ) from bow to stern , set sail from Barrow in Cumbria for its first sea trials on Tuesday .
The vessel can be armed with 38 torpedoes and missiles - more than any previous Royal Navy submarine .
It sailed into the Clyde and up the Gareloch to its new home at the Scottish naval base .
Inside the submarine Astute The BAE Systems - built vessel is due to go into full service next year .
It will be able to circumnavigate the entire globe underwater and advanced nuclear technology means that it will never need to be refuelled .
With the arrival of Astute I cannot think of a more exciting time to be a submariner
Commodore Chris Hockley
Commander , HM Naval Base Clyde
The submarine 's arrival on the Clyde marks the beginning of a process that will see Faslane become the UK 's sole operating submarine base over the next decade .
After touring the Astute , the Minister for Defence Equipment and Support , Quentin Davies , said : " This is a significant milestone for Astute as she arrives for the first time in her homeport of Faslane .
" The Astute class of submarines will deliver a step change in capability for defence in terms of anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare , protecting the deterrent , providing land attack and intelligence gathering .
" Astute will now begin a set of sea trials ahead of her full acceptance with the Royal Navy next year . "
Floating jetty First Sea Lord , Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope , said : " The Astute Class is truly next generation .
" They are immensely powerful vessels and they will form a key part of our future programme , giving the Royal Navy the versatility and technical excellence needed to operate successfully across the globe . "
Commodore Chris Hockley , the naval base commander at HM Naval Base Clyde , said : " There has been significant investment and preparations made over several years to prepare us for this occasion .
" The Clyde will become a centre of specialisation for submarines , and , of course , submarine training .
" With the arrival of Astute I can not think of a more exciting time to be a submariner . "
The Royal Navy has already spent Â£ 150 m on new accommodation for submariners at Faslane .
In May a new Â£ 150 m floating jetty , the length of two football pitches , was installed at the base to provide berths for the six Astute - class submarines which will eventually be based there .

" How does it become a man to behave toward this American government to - day ?
I answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it . " -- Henry David Thoreau
To me , this quote from Thoreau expresses the only rational , moral and humane stance that a citizen can take toward the vast and brutal machinery of the American imperial state in our time .
The crimes of this state are monstrous , and mounting .
But what is worse is that these crimes are not aberrations ; they are the very essence of the system -- they are its goal , its product , its lifeblood .
And what is this crimeful essence ?
Matt Taibbi described it well in a recent article :
Our Western society quite openly embraces war as a means of solving problems , and for quite some time now has fashioned its entire social and economic structure around the preparation for war .
I believe this is an indisputable fact .
Decades of historical evidence give it proof .
The last three decades especially have seen the relentless acceleration of this systemic evolution .
The quality of life for ordinary Americans , those outside the golden circle of the elite and their retainers , has decayed immeasurably â and measurably .
Stagnant wages .
Degraded infrastructure .
A poisoned food chain .
Whole communities -- with all their social , political , cultural and family networks -- gutted by the heedless flight of capital to cheap labor ( and slave labor ) markets abroad , and by the dissolution of an embodied economic life into the shadow - play of high finance , the ghostly manipulation of numbers that produces nothing of value except gargantuan profits for a very few .
A bonfire of public amenities , making daily life harder , harsher , constricted , diminished .
Ever -growing social and economic disparity , shrinking the circle of opportunity .
Two million citizens behind bars , in prisons overflowing with non-violent drug cases â nightmarish institutions given over to gangs , neglect , punitive regimens and private profit .
Yet this long , grinding process of diminishment and degradation has been accompanied by a never - ending expansion of the war machine into a dominant position over almost every aspect of American life .
Not even the ending of the Cold War slowed this excrescence ; defense budgets grew , new enemies were found , there were new missions , new commands , new wars .
The ruling elite of American society were â and are â obviously willing to let the welfare , prosperity , opportunities and liberties of the common people sink deeper and deeper into the mire , in order to finance a system structured around war , with all the attendant corruption , brutalization and accrual of authoritarian power that war brings .
This is the system we have .
It âs right out in the open .
There is a deep - rooted expectation â and not , alas , just among the elite -- that the world should jump to America âs tune , by force if necessary .
And when , for whatever reason , some part of the world does not jump â or bump and grind â to the Potomac beat , then it becomes a â problem â that must be â solved , â by one means or another , with , of course , â all options on the table , â all the time .
And whether these â problems â are approached with blunt , bullying talk or a degree of cajolery and pious rhetoric , the chosen stance is always backed up with the ever - present threat of military action , up to and including the last of those â options â that always decorate the table : utter annihilation .
This is not even questioned , must less debated or challenged .
America âs right to intervene in the affairs other nations by violent force ( along with a constant series of illegal covert activities ) â and to impose an empire of military plantations across the length and breadth of the entire planet â is the basic assumption , the underlying principle , the fervently held faith shared by both national parties , and the entire elite Establishment .
And if you want to have the necessary instruments to maintain such a state of hegemony , then you must indeed structure your society and economy around war .
Many nations â all vanished now â have done this .
The Roman Empire was one .
Nazi Germany was another .
At great cost to the economic , social and political life of ordinary Germans , Adolf Hitler geared the state to produce the war machine necessary to assert the dominance in world affairs which he felt was Germany âs natural right .
One of his chief aims was to procure enough â living space â and natural resources in Eastern Europe to compete with America âs growing economic might .
The Holocaust of European Jews was , for all its horror , just a preliminary to the greater â ethnic cleansing â to come .
As historian Adam Tooze reminds us in The Wages of Destruction , the Nazis had drawn up detailed plans for the extermination â by active mass murder and deliberate starvation â of up to 40 million East Europeans .
Today , we all recognize the inhuman madness behind this hegemonic ambition .
We shake our heads and say , â Whatever evils we may be accused of , we have never and would never do such a thing . â
Perhaps .
But leaving aside for a moment the millions â millions â of African slaves and Native Americans who died in order to procure the living space and natural resources of North and South America for European peoples , it is clear that most Americans â the elite above all â can easily countenance the deaths of , say , more than one million innocent Iraqis , or upwards of three million Southeast Asians , without any disturbance in their sense of national righteousness , their bedrock belief that the United States has the natural right , even the duty , to assert its hegemony over world affairs .
The mass murder in Iraq , the horrible slaughter in Vietnam and Cambodia , the direct involvement in the massacre of hundreds of thousands of people in Indonesia , Latin America , and the Iran - Iraq War â to name just a few such operations carried out within the last generation â are regarded as actions which , however " mistaken " some might feel them to have been , were undertaken in good faith , to " preserve our way of life " from this or that imminent , overwhelming threat to our very national existence .
[ Which was , of course , the same reasoning Hitler used to justify his militarism : the urgent need to protect the German people from maniacal , irrational , bloodsworn enemies bent on their total destruction . ]
And let us not forget that American war planners also drew up detailed plans involving the extermination of tens of millions of East Europeans in " first strike " nuclear attacks â plans which they often urged national leaders to put into practice .
And even today , the constantly asserted vow to keep the nuclear option " on the table " at all times means that every single action or policy toward a " problem " nation carries with it the explicit threat to kill millions of people â to outdo the Holocaust in a matter of minutes .
Can one really look at such plans and attitudes , and at the towering , Everest - like mountain of corpses produced by American polices â just in the last generation â and say that there is not also a form of inhuman madness behind this hegemonic ambition as well ?
Is this really a system that one can be associated with honorably in any way ?
What should we think about a person who wants to lead such a system , who wants to take hold of the driving wheel of the war machine , to use it , to expand it , to accept all of its premises , to keep all of its horrific " options " forever on the table , to feed it and gorge it and coddle it and appease it at every turn , while millions of their own people sink further into degradation and diminishment ?
Should n't someone who knowingly , willingly , eagerly bent all of their energies toward taking power in such a system instantly and irretrievably forfeit our regard and support ?
Should we really give such a " leader " the benefit of the doubt , cut him some slack , be ready to praise him when he or his government momentarily behaves in a normal , rational or legal manner ?
Should we grimly insist that he is the only choice we have , that his heart is probably in the right place , and that all we can do is try and cajole him into being " better " ?
II .
In the light of these considerations , it is astonishing to see what has been the main reaction of many leading progressive writers to Barack Obama 's murderous escalation of the imperial war in Afghanistan and the dirty war in Pakistan .
While voicing their " disappointment " with the decision , they have reserved most of their scorn not for the man who has ordered this new tranche of mass death and inhuman suffering , but for those who have accused Obama of " betrayal . "
No , that 's not a joke .
The new progressive line on the escalation seems to be this : " We knew all along he was going to do it , so what 's the big deal ? "
That has been the chief response from such high - profile progressives as Digby and Joan Walsh .
They seem far more worked up about the fact that some people ( such as Tom Hayden , Gary Wills , and others ) are accusing Obama of " betrayal " than they are about the thousands of innocent people who will die from Obama 's decision , and the long - reverberating evil , at home and abroad , this escalation will engender .
Both Digby and Walsh are at great pains to establish how savvy they have been about Obama from the very beginning .
For example , Digby writes : " I never had any illusions about where he and most of the other Democrats were headed with the " Good War " narrative .
It always ends up the same way . "
She ridicules Hayden for declaring , during the campaign , that " all American progressives should unite for Barack Obama , " and for now being disappointed that the president is not " the second coming of Gandhi , Houdini and Jesus Christ , " as Digby scornfully describes Hayden 's earlier belief .
Fair enough .
It 's true that Obama made no secret of his intent to escalate the wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and anyone who did n't expect him to do so was being wilfully blind , or naive .
On the other hand , what these savvy commentators fail to note is that Obama has already escalated the Af - Pak war , earlier in his term -- an escalation as large as Bush 's " surge " in Iraq .
And obviously , this effort did n't work ; hence the latest " strategic review " that led to Obama 's fateful West Point speech .
So although Obama did promise to escalate the Af - Pak conflict during the campaign , he did not promise to keep doing it , over and over , even in the face of obvious failure .
Thus it is not inherently " silly " or irrational for an Obama supporter like Hayden or Wills to feel betrayed by this second escalation , and by the transparently specious rationales that Obama offered for it .
But let 's leave that aside .
For the main issue regarding the escalation is not whether Tom Hayden is silly or if he was too gushing or naive in his earlier support of Obama ; the main issue is the actual reality of this murderous course .
And here , we come to the matter of the progressives ' self - proclaimed savviness .
Digby and Walsh and other savvy progressives say they knew all along that Obama was going to embark on a horrific policy which would inevitably result in the needless death of innocent people , the further war - profiteering corruption of our own political system , and the exacerbation of extremism , hatred , strife and destabilization around the world .
Yet they still stretched every nerve and sinew exhorting people to vote for him in the presidential election .
Indeed , the entire campaign thrust of these savvy , realistic , pragmatic progressives could be summed up in one oddly familiar line : " All American progressives should unite for Barack Obama . "
And even as she denigrates Tom Hayden â who at least put his actual body and liberty on the line to oppose an unjust war in Vietnam , taking to the streets in direct action against the state , which then put him on trial as part of the " Chicago Seven " â Digby herself wrings her hands and says we all had no choice but to vote for Obama .
There was only him and Hillary , then only him and McCain ; what else could we do ?
Even if we knew â as Digby and Walsh say they knew â that Obama was going to murder people , destabilize the world and continue the Empire 's monstrous Terror War , we had no other choice but to vote for him .
No other choice .
What else could we do ?
Aside from the third parties offering alternatives to what Digby calls " a moderate [ Democrat ] and a doddering right wing fool with his ignoramus running mate , " one wonders if our progressives have ever heard of Thoreau -- who , like Hayden , put his actual body and liberty on the line to disassociate himself from a system he regarded as deeply immoral ?
In any case , according to our progressives , not only was there no choice but voting for Obama , there is no justification now for criticizing him for doing what we savvy people knew he was going to do .
Anyone who , like Hayden and Wills , is now breaking ranks with Obama over Afghanistan is just " having a fit , " and being " silly " and " puerile . "
No , it seems that the only thing that responsible , savvy progressives can do now is keep faith with the president â keep up our contacts with the Administration , keep our feet " inside the tent , " keep our savvy listservs going -- and " push [ Obama ] to better solutions , " as Walsh tells us .
I find all of this remarkable .
Again , it 's not that Digby , Walsh and others are uncritical of Obama 's decision .
Walsh declares herself " deeply disappointed , saddened even " by the escalation , and Digby thunders , or rather , sighs , that she wishes " Obama had changed his mind on Afghanistan , and argued for him to do it . "
She will even " continue to do so " â that is , argue for Obama to change his imperial mind .
To argue , appeal , petition , and encourage the leader to better solutions .
But obviously there will be none of that civil disobedience stuff that silly - billy Tom Hayden and his ilk pulled in their time .
In fact , Digby seems to slam Hayden directly for the " silliness " of his " behavior " in " his heyday " â that is , when he was taking direct action to try to stop an immoral war .
She says of his denunciation of Obama 's betrayal : " It 's this kind of behavior that has given liberals a bad name since Hayden was in his heyday . "
Well , we all need to mind our behavior , of course , just as our parents sternly admonished us .
So by all means , let us not be indecorous in our opposition to murder and corruption .
Let us not be intemperate in our resistance to evil .
And for god 's sake , let us not be silly or " have fits " in our dissent against atrocity , deceit and destruction .
I hold no special brief for Tom Hayden , who over the years turned into a standard hack politician , nor do I endorse every point of his new dissent .
But if he is using what is left of his notoriety to speak out against this monstrous war and its escalation â for whatever reason , even a baseless sense of " betrayal " â then I say more power to him .
What on God 's green earth does it matter if someone says they feel " betrayed " by Obama 's decision or not ?
In the light of the death and destruction to come , how could that possibly be important ?
And how could defending Obama against this charge of betrayal be such a major concern â for people who say they oppose the decision and decry its consequences ?
But this is the kind of schizophrenic reaction -- " the president is a murderer / we must vote for the president " -- that is bred by the acceptance of an inhuman system .
Thus we see these strange diversions among our leading dissidents ( " Silly old Hayden ! " ) , these partisan splittings of infinitesimal hairs ( " our guy is 2 % less evil than their guy , so we have no choice but to vote for him " ) .
We also see the strange phenomenon , among almost all leading progressives , of leavening criticism of the system with praise for any " constructive " actions or decisions its leaders might produce .
For example , Glenn Greenwald recently set out some recommendations on how rational citizens can avoid " the behaviors that turned the Right into a dissent - stifling cult of personality erected around George W. Bush . "
Greenwald noted several ways in which right - wing activists muted any ideological or philosophical objections they might have had to a specific Bush policy â his vast expansion of the federal government , for example , which should have been anathema to movement conservatives â and instead rallied blindly around the Leader , no matter what .
He then detailed â and rightly condemned â some of the many , many instances when progressive activists have done the same with Obama , and makes the unassailable argument that the justice of a particular cause ( public health care , gay rights , torture , civil liberties , etc. ) should far outweigh any partisan worries about Obama 's political standing .
Most of his recommendations were common sense ; their general thrust is somewhat along the lines of an approach examined here on the day after the 2008 election : " WIBDI ( What If Bush Did It ? ) : A Prism for the New Paradigm . "
Or you can even boil it down further , as Bob Dylan did more than 40 years ago in a single memorable phrase : " Do n't follow leaders , watch the parking meters . "
But at the head of these suggestions , Greenwald puts this :
If Obama takes action or makes a decision that you think is good and constructive , say so and give him credit .
Today is December 7th , a day that will live in infamy as the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor that ushered the United States into the second World War .
During the war , almost every comic shifted to a wartime footing , with covers of our heroes kicking the crap out of Nazis and fighting saboteurs in the pages within .
But in at least one case , superheroes did a lot more .
See that cover to the right ?
That âs the cover of a special edition of Superman , based on issue # 33 of the regular series that was produced for the U.S. Army .
The Army had a problem at the time â they were drafting thousands of men a year , but many of them had no education to speak of , with large swaths of them functionally illiterate , and they were expected to operate complex machinery pretty quickly .
They had to learn how to read , and fast .
The troops also needed cheap and portable entertainment , something that could be carried through the battlefields of Europe and Asia .
So with the cooperation of National Periodical Publications , the forerunner to DC Comics , this edition was produced by the War Department with simplified dialogue and word balloons .
Hundreds of thousands of copies were distributed to GIs , and it helped them learn to read and to pass the time .
And of course , copies of the comics were handed out to kids in faraway lands , as gestures of goodwill .
A total of 23 issues were produced in this manner and these rare variants are among the first examples of using comic books to teach , not just entertain .
So we were nât surprised when a study came out last week showing that comics can be used to improve literacy .
The United States government has known it for decades .

Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh , 58 , was taken to The Queen 's Medical Center in Honolulu after complaining of chest pains on Wednesday .
Close
As news broke Wednesday night of radio show host Rush Limbaugh 's hospital visit due to chest pains , many of his political counterparts on the left put down their ideological swords and wished him well on Twitter .
" All best wishes to Mr. Limbaugh tonight , for a full and speedy recovery , " wrote MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow .
Mediaite 's Rachel Sklar cautioned Rush 's detractors : " No stooping to wishing him ill , people ! ( Karma . ) "
Salon 's Joan Walsh : " I can't enjoy the news of Rush Limbaugh 's illness .
Is there something wrong with me ?
He has a family .
Are n't we better than that ? "
And radio show host Alan Colmes said that " we wish him well . "
There were others who were n't quite sure how to react .
Mother Jones 's David Corn begrudgingly offered this : " Rush , you 've slimed me in the past .
But , I suppose , good luck to you , too . "
But earlier , Corn wrestled with how to react to Rush 's illness given Limbaugh 's own reaction to the medical fortunes of others .
" Resist the snark about Rush 's rush to the hospital ? " asked Corn .
" Yeah .
But remember what he said about Ted Kennedy . "
Corn provided a link to a Huffington Post article that referenced a March Limbaugh show in which " Limbaugh suggested that Sen .
Ted Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) would be dead by the time health care reform legislation passes .
' Before it 's all over , it 'll be called the Ted Kennedy memorial health care bill . ' "
Wonkette chimed in with a characteristically cheeky , " RUSH LIMBAUGH is in ' serious condition ' at a Hawaii hospital , and we shall save the Death Jokes until he earns them the old - fashioned way . "
Still , from less prominent corners of the Twitter - verse , there was a steady drip of joy expressed at Limbaugh 's misfortunes .
The humor website TheFullGinsburg.com wrote , " No one wants Rush Limbaugh to die .
But they do want his doctors to fail , " and a quick thumb through Twitter 's # Rush hashtag reveals other wishes of ill health upon Limbaugh .
Republicans expressed outraged at some of the reactions .
" Someone should build a Twitter list of all those who have expressed hatred for Limbaugh tonight so their presence can be known , " wrote Republican strategist Patrick Ruffini .
" I remain at a loss at how politics becomes so personal that many cheer for Rush 's death , " said " Morning Joe " co-host Joe Scarborough .
But , turning the tables , some conservatives had fun with the idea that if only it were a liberal in the hospital ...
" I 'd donate a heart to keep Rush alive , " wrote blogger Dan Riehl .
" Just need a knife and a liberal close by . ; ) "
From news.com.au it seems bullying those who have an unpopular opinion about climate issues is nât limited to the Climategate actors .
Clive Spash resigns from CSIRO after climate report â censorship â
SCIENTIST
Clive Spash has resigned from the CSIRO and called for a Senate inquiry into the science body following the censorship of his controversial report into emissions trading .
Logo and photo from csiro.au
Dr Spash has lashed out at the organisation which he said promoted self - censorship among its scientists with its unfair publication guidelines .
He said he was stunned at the treatment he received at the hands of CSIRO management , including boss Megan Clark , and believed he was not alone .
â I âve been treated extremely poorly , â he said .
â There needs to be a Senate inquiry .
â The way the publication policy and the charter are being interpreted will encourage self - censorship .
â It âs obviously happened before at the CSIRO â and there âs issues currently . â
Last month , Dr Spash accused the organisation of gagging him and his report â The Brave New World of Carbon Trading â and restricting its publication .
The report is critical of cap and trade schemes , like the one the federal government is seeking to introduce , as well as big compensation to polluters .
Dr Spash advocates a direct tax on carbon .
The CSIRO said the report was in breach of its publication guidelines , which restrict scientists from speaking out on public policy .
But it provoked accusations the CSIRO was censoring research harmful to the Government .
Under intense pressure , Dr Clark publicly released the report on November 26 but warned Dr Spash would be punished for his behaviour and his refusal to amend it .
â I believe that internationally peer - reviewed science should be published or , if Dr Clark wishes to have her own opinion , then she should publish her own opinion , â Dr Spash said , who has been on sick leave .
â I âve been to the doctor under extreme stress . â
He had been ordered not to speak to the media while working for the CSIRO , which originally headhunted him for the job .

Continuing with Australian Skeptics awards , they are giving out a new award in honor of Fred Thornett , a skeptic who died earlier this year .
The first recipients of The Fred , given to outstanding promoters of reason , are David and Toni McCaffery .
The McCafferys are heroes of mine .
Earlier this year , their four week old infant daughter lost a battle with pertussis .
Yes , whooping cough .
She was too young to be vaccinated , and because the antivaccination movement is strong in their area , vaccination rates were low , and the herd immunity was in turn too low to help little Dana .
When this grieving couple was shrilly and mercilessly attacked by Meryl Dorey and the AVN , the McCafferys fought back .
They went on TV , they gave interviews , and they told the truth : their daughter died from an easily preventable disease , and that people like Dorey and the AVN are a public health menace .
Mind you , this was mere weeks after their daughter had died .
If I had been in that situation ( and every parent , including me , has nightmares about it ) , I probably would have curled into a little ball and shut the world out .
But not Toni and David .
They spoke up .
They also created a website in honor of Dana , to make sure her story gets told .
They have been astonishing examples of what humans can achieve , even when dealing with something that must have been too heartbreaking to bear .
The Australian Skeptics have a video of the award ceremony .
Richard Saunders tells me there was not a dry eye in the house , and just watching it -- just writing about it now -- chokes me up .
To Toni and David : I am so , so sorry you were eligible for this award , but I am very , very glad you two have done what you 've done .
Congratulations .
And may your story save more lives than the AVN and its ilk can endanger .
The case of Mortgage Lender Implode - O - Meter vs. Mortgage Specialists Inc ( MSI ) has reached the New Hampshire Supreme Court .
MSI has demanded Implode - O - Meter reveal the identity of one of its sources in a defamation case and Implode - O - Meter refuses .
Please consider New Hampshire Suit Challenges Mortgage Blogger 's Use of Anonymous Sources
The New Hampshire Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday in a lawsuit that calls into question the legal protections available to independent Web sites that cover news .
The case involves mortgage lender Implode - Explode , a Las Vegas - based site launched in 2007 that publishes stories about the meltdown of the mortgage industry .
The dispute began in November 2008 when The Mortgage Specialists Inc ( MSI ) won a temporary injunction requesting that a confidential document , " 2007 Loan Chart , " be removed from Implode - Explode 's site , ml-implode.com .
MSI also requested the identity of the source and of a commenter , " Brianbattersby , " who they allege made defamatory comments about the company and its president .
Implode - Explode removed both the loan chart and the comments , but refused to either provide the identity of their anonymous sources or promise to refrain from posting the document again in the future .
Unsatisfied , MSI pressed for a permanent injunction against the site and won the case in a New Hampshire Superior Court in March 2008 .
Aside from those facts , nearly everything else about the case remains in dispute .
During their extended 15 - minute presentations before the court , the two lawyers called on precedents from Dendrite International v. Does and The New York Times v. United States to argue their claims of anonymous sources and confidential documents , and what constitutes a real journalist .
Jeremy Eggleton of the Orr & Reno , the firm representing Implode Explode , spoke first , calling the injunction a case of prior restraint and a violation of the " basic principals of the First Amendment , " that , " tramples on the rights " of his client to speak freely .
Alexander Walker of Devine Millimet & Branch , speaking for MSI , dismissed the First Amendment concerns as a red herring in the case .
" This is not the Pentagon Papers , " he said .
" They [ Implode Explode ] are not journalists . "
According to Sam Bayard , a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard , and assistant director of the Citizen Media Law Project , the potential impact of any decision is the shortage of case law dealing with these issues in an online context .
" As we are moving online and our journalism is going online , " he said , " this could have a big impact . "
If the court rules against Implode , Bayard also cited the precedent - setting New York Times v. United States as an example of the concern .
In today 's environment , The New York Times would post the Pentagon Papers Web - first .
If MSI 's claim is upheld , he said , it would be as if " two days later the government came along and filed an injunction " and then the papers were removed as if they never existed .
Fraud Charges Against Mortgage Specialists
The New Hampshire Banking Department has received nine consumer complaints about The Mortgage Specialists in the last few years , but it was the department 's routine check of the business that led to fraud charges .
The Mortgage Specialists was issued a cease - and - desist order it must respond to within 30 days , according to department spokesman Rich Arcand .
The company , which received the order last week , could face $ 200,000 in fines and revocation of its license .
Banking Department staff visited the main office in Plaistow a few weeks ago to perform an examination that is routinely administered every 18 months , Arcand said .
When the department asked for 20 files stored at a site within a 10 - minute drive , it took more than four hours for employees to return with the folders , according to the cease - and - desist order .
Documents were missing from all the files , but the department said it later found some of them in a bin waiting to be shredded .
The department found customers ' signatures had been photocopied and attached to new documents , the order said .
Two broker fee agreements and an application for a federal mortgage loan were also altered .
The Mortgage Specialists could n't provide two requested files of canceled loans , and the Banking Department said it also found those files in the shred bin .
The Massachusetts Division of Banks was just finishing its own routine examination when it uncovered the use of unfair and deceptive practices , such as inflating borrower income , according to the cease - and - desist order the state issued yesterday .
" The division 's temporary cease - and - desist order requires The Mortgage Specialists to place all remaining loans with a qualified lender or broker with no loss to consumers and forbids the company from initiating any new mortgage loan transactions , " spokeswoman Kimberly Haberline said .
The charges include 14 counts of fraud , 20 counts of incomplete records , 15 counts of dishonest and unethical practices , and three counts of destruction of records .
Scandal - tainted N.H. mortgage co. gets to keep Mass .
license
A scandal - tainted home - loan firm that 's using Red Sox knuckleballer Tim Wakefield as a pitchman should be thrown out of the mortgage game , some Bay State lenders say .
Home - loan executives are blasting regulators ' decision to let Plaistow , N.H. - based The Mortgage Specialists Inc. stay in business despite allegedly forging client signatures and dumping incriminating records .
Massachusetts and New Hampshire regulators OK'd a settlement under which Mortgage Specialists will keep licenses in both states but pay $ 725,000 in fines .
The firm - which admitted no wrongdoing - will also hire outside auditors to review records back to 2005 , as well as going forward for up to three years .
The deal comes after state inspectors allegedly found Mortgage Specialists had cut-and - pasted customer signatures onto some documents instead of getting real sign - offs .
In one case , a client who applied for a 30 - year mortgage allegedly wound up with a much - more - costly 40 - year loan - apparently without the person 's knowledge .
Another loan application reputedly inflated a woman 's 2005 income to $ 99,000 , even though she made just $ 17,700 as of 2007 , according to court filings .
Inspectors allegedly found many suspect documents in a shredding bin after Mortgage Specialists took four hours to produce files stored just 10 minutes away .
Mortgage Specialists President Michael Gill has a controversial history .
Outside of the loan business , Gill is one of thoroughbred racing 's most successful horse owners , winning millions of dollars in purses .
He 's even netted an Eclipse Award , the industry 's top honor for owners .
However , tracks in New York , Delaware and elsewhere have partly or fully banned Gill 's horses over the years amid speculation that his animals received performance - enhancing drugs .
Gill has denied such charges , but one of his horses did test positive for the substance benzylpiperazine at Boston 's Suffolk Downs in 2001 .
Six years earlier , New Hampshire racing officials banned Gill for three years after a horse he trained came up positive for the drug clenbuterol .
Here are some additional statements I can give .
(1) Our belief is the " brianbattersby " forum comment now removed from the site was substantially true .
We do not think we should have to censor it or disclose who the person is .
(2) We have received substantial , additional highly - detailed information from a person or person(s ) who clearly was at the company or close to it while fraudulent activities were going on , and is attempting to leak them .
However , we no longer can release this information thanks to the lower court 's ruling and the general air of " shoot the whistleblower " surrounding this case .
(3) The Loan Chart that MoSpec is claiming is " secret " is not only not secret according to the law ( NH banking regulations state only that the Banking Commission can't release the info ) , but our best information is that it was actually sent openly to MoSpec investors .
So MoSpec themselves would be the " leaker " .
After all , it is merely their production volume , and theoretically , any company MoSpec sells or brokers loans to would have a copy of that chart .

Point # 2 above is in all likelihood the real reason for this " SLAPP " suit .
Verizon Wireless has replied to the Federal Communications Commission 's letter of inquiry about its super - sized early termination fees for smart phones .
The bottom line : $ 350 ETFs are good and good for you .
" This pricing structure enables Verizon Wireless to offer wireless devices at a substantial discount from their full retail price , " the telco 's 13 - page statement ( with 64 pages of documents ) explains .
" By reducing up - front costs to consumers , this pricing lowers the barriers to consumers to obtaining mobile broadband devices .
It thus enables many more consumers , including those of more limited means , access to a range of exciting , state of - the art broadband services and capabilities . "
Budget busters ?
Verizon is responding not just to the FCC 's probe , but to the Senator on Capitol Hill who 's been raising a ruckus about this issue since 2007 .
Earlier this month Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) introduced a bill to put the kibosh on " budget - busting " ETFs , as she calls them .
The proposed law would ban early fees that exceed the cost of the handset to the provider minus the purchase price paid by the consumer at the start of the contract .
No surprise then that Klobuchar hit the roof when Verizon announced in November that its early fees for the termination of " Advanced Devices " ( smart phone ) contracts would double from $ 175 to $ 350 .
These gadgets include the BlackBerry Curve , Storm , and Pearl , the Motorola Droid , LG Dare , Palm Centro , and various netbooks made by Hewlett Packard and Gateway .
The new ETFs comes with a new pro-rating system â ten dollars sliced off the fee each month â that still leaves quitters paying over 100 bucks , even if they terminate at the very end of the two - year deal .
Klobuchar sent a letter to Verizon president and CEO Lowell C. McAdam calling the hike " anti-consumer and anti-competitive , " and asked the FCC to probe the telco about the move .
And so the agency did .
The Commission appears to like sending out these sort of letters , having just completed an inquiry of Apple 's rejection of Google Voice for the iPhone .
Much of Verizon 's response details how it lets consumers know that they 're staring at a $ 350 ETF in the face ( store disclosures , receipts , the sale confirmation letter , etc ) .
But a big chunk of the statement is a defense of the practice in general .
Mobile service companies have long argued that early fees subsidize the difference in cost between what the company pays the manufacturer of a phone , and the retail price for the device that it offers consumers .
Verizon says that this " cost differential " â " the difference between the amount Verizon Wireless pays manufacturers for the device and the price it charges to customers on term contracts " â is double for " advanced devices " than what it is for " basic devices . "
Verizon also had to hike its advanced device ETFs , the letter claims , because it costs more to advertise and sell them .
" It takes more time ( and hence increases the cost to Verizon Wireless ) for sales and customer care representatives to handle customer inquiries regarding the complex advanced features and functionalities of Advanced Devices , " the company explains .
And then there 's Verizon operating expenses and investments in broadband networks :
" The $ 350 ETF does not fully compensate Verizon Wireless for all these costs , particularly for customers who terminate at a relatively early point in the contract term , but it helps the company recover at least a portion of them . "
Browser bait ?
The FCC letter of inquiry also expressed concern about a feature prominent in some of these Verizon networked devices : the company 's Mobile Web browser , for which Verizon charges a usage fee .
The service offers more or less what you can expect from a free Yahoo !
account â e-mail , news , weather , sports â except at a usage rate .
If you do n't subscribe to a prepaid or unlimited data bundle , the cost is $ 1.99 per megabyte or a " fraction thereof , " as VZ puts it , of monthly data use .
" Is there a minimum data amount or level of access that triggers charges , and if so , what is that amount or level ? " the FCC letter asked .
" Is it correct that customers are charged for minimal , accidental usage by customers using these phones ? "
Verizon says the answer to the second question is no â or at least sort of no .
Non-prepaid or data plan customers who navigate to Mobile Web 's home page are not tithed .
" If the browsing session ends there without the customer navigating to another webpage , " the response explains , " the customer will not incur charges for Mobile Web browsing . "
So presumably some wanderers will get dinged for clicking those " another webpage " links .
But the statement does n't really answer that first question about the minimum data charge , so we still do n't know how much .
The FCC 's letter referenced a column by New York Times tech writer David Pogue , which includes a complaint from a Verizon customer about the feature .
" The phone is designed in such a way that you can almost never avoid getting $ 1.99 charge on the bill , " the consumer wrote .
" If you open the flip and accidentally press the up arrow key , you see that the phone starts to connect to the web .
So you hit END right away .
Well , too late .
You will be charged $ 1.99 for that 0.02 kilobytes of data .
NOT COOL . "
Verizon responds that some of these mobiles can be configured to avoid that Web- connection feature , " but this option is not available on all Mobile Web capable devices . "
When all is said and done , it is unclear where this goes now .
Do Verizon 's pricey new ETFs exceed Klobuchar 's cost - of - handset minus purchase price formula ?
And behind the scenes of this discussion is a debate about whether the FCC should take the regulation of ETFs away from state governments and courts â a move that the telcos have supported and consumer advocates opposed .
Klobuchar 's bill would not override any state level regulations affecting early fees .
It 's currently awaiting discussion in the Senate Commerce , Science , and Transportation commiittee .
A Subaru WRX STi pulls a semi stuck in the snow -- Click above to watch the video
Somewhere in the snow that 's falling all over the northern hemisphere , a tractor - trailer got stuck on some slushy ice and snow , blocking a city street .
That helpless semi was then strapped to a Subaru WRX STI , and the little engine -- and AWD -- that could , extricated the truck from its predicament .
That 's cool enough on its own .
Yet , what we really want to know is the backstory â did someone say " Do n't worry about a wrecker .
If you see a blue sedan with gold wheels and a giant wing , and it growls , that 's all we need ... " ?

BAGHDAD Â
The Iranian government said Saturday that an oil field that its troops occupied a day earlier was on its side of the border with Iraq , despite Iraqi claims to the contrary .
A group of about 11 Iranian soldiers seized a portion of the remote Fakka oil field in Maysan Province in southeastern Iraq early Friday , according to Iraq .
Government officials in Baghdad said they had summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest the military action , but diplomatic efforts had so far failed to resolve the dispute .
Ramin Mihman - Parast , a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry , denied on Saturday that Iranian soldiers were occupying an Iraqi oil field , said the Iranian state news agency .
Falcon
Heene was never in the balloon and was found hiding at home
A US couple who triggered a major alert by claiming their son was adrift in a helium balloon have been ordered to pay the $ 42,000 ( Â£ 26,000 ) rescue bill .
The Colorado couple reported in October their son had been carried away by the balloon - causing a media drama .
Six - year - old Falcon
Heene was finally found hiding at home .
It later emerged the hoax was a bid to secure a TV deal .
Falcon 's parents have pleaded guilty to a number of charges and face a sentencing hearing on Wednesday .
Their lawyer , David Lane , said on Tuesday that Richard Heene and his wife Mayumi had been ordered to pay restitution for the emergency services ' rescue efforts .
Mr Lane said the Heenes cannot afford to pay the $ 42,000 bill .
Sentencing hearing
Falcon 's parents are due to be sentenced at a hearing in Colorado .

Richard Heene has admitted attempting to influence a public servant .
Mayumi
Heene admits false reporting to the authorities .
Although the charges are punishable by jail terms , it is expected they will receive probation orders .
Millions of television viewers were gripped by live coverage of the drifting weather balloon which was feared to have Falcon on board .
Police carried out an intensive search for the boy after the balloon landed about 40 miles ( 64 km ) north of Denver and was found to be empty .
But it then transpired that the child was hiding at home and days later the couple were accused of the elaborate hoax - apparently an attempt to secure a deal for a reality TV show .

Mr Higazy was detained months after the 2001 attacks
An Egyptian man has received a $ 250,000 payout from the FBI because of the way he was treated following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks .
Abdallah Higazy , 38 , sued the bureau , saying he had been unjustly criminally charged and imprisoned for 34 days .
He had been accused of lying to investigators about an aviation radio found in his hotel room in New York .
Mr Higazy said he told conflicting stories about the radio because he had been intimidated by an FBI agent .
He asserted that the agent shouted at him , lied to him and threatened to endanger his family .
A judge approved the settlement payment in July 2009 .
Mr Higazy was studying at the Polytechnic University in Brooklyn on a US government - funded scholarship and staying at the Millennium Hilton Hotel near the Twin Towers .
He was detained in December 2001 when he returned to reclaim his belongings from the hotel which he had left when the hotel was evacuated during the attacks .
' Traumatic memory '
Mr Higazy had acknowledged in court that he had served in the Egyptian Air Corps and had expertise in communications .
The aviation radio found at the hotel could be used to communicate with planes and monitor pilot conversations .
He was freed in January 2002 after another hotel guest , a pilot , told hotel officials the radio belonged to him .
Mr Higazy 's lawsuit against the FBI agent that questioned him was initially thrown out by a lower court judge but was reinstated in 2007 by the Court of Appeals in Manhattan .
When he was released he married an American and returned to Egypt , where he lives in Cairo and works at a school , according to his lawyer Jonathan Abady .
" He was entirely innocent and was coerced to the point where he confessed to participation in the crime of the century .
Had the pilot not returned to retrieve the radio , he [ Higazy ] might still be in prison , " Mr Abady said .
He said that Mr Higazy was pleased to put the ordeal behind him but that the ordeal was a " traumatic memory that will never leave him completely " .
An admission of liability or fault was not part of the FBI agreement .
US government lawyers on the case have declined to comment .

Throughout their all - out campaign to stop health care reform , Republican leaders have relied on questionable forecasts from the Lewin Group , a subsidiary of insurer UnitedHealth Group .
Now , another study funded by UnitedHealth has some unwelcome news for the GOP braintrust : the red states they represent are the unhealthiest in the nation .
Following on the heels of the Commonwealth Fund 's 2009 Scorecard of state health care system performance , the United Health Foundation 's report is just the latest confirmation that health care is worst where Republicans poll best .
As Forbes noted :
The annual ranking looks at 22 indicators of health , including everything from how many children receive recommended vaccinations , to obesity and smoking rates , to cancer deaths .
The diagnosis is n't pretty for Republicans committed to denying the health care their constituents need most of all .
The 2009 rankings ( above ) reveal that nine of the top 10 healthiest states voted for Barack Obama in 2008 .
Conversely , 9 of the 10 cellar dwellers backed John McCain in 2008 ; four years earlier , the 15 unhealthiest states voted for George W. Bush for President .
With Vermont topping the list and Mississippi bringing up the rear , Americans would do to listen to Dr. Howard Dean and not Governor Haley Barbour when it comes to the health care debate .
Vermont ranked first this year thanks in part to its low rate of obesity , high number of doctors and a low rate of child poverty .
New England in general sets a benchmark for the country , the report found .
All six New England states are in the top 10 .
These states have favorable demographics and an excellent public health infrastructure , including a large number of doctors per capita .
Eight of the 10 bottom - ranked states are from the south , with Mississippi coming in dead last for the ninth consecutive year .
Mississippi has a sky - high death rate from heart disease and high infant mortality .
In general , residents of these states are more likely to be smokers or to be obese , the report found .
They also have worse health insurance coverage , fewer physicians per capita and live in areas with high violent crime and more child poverty .
As it turns out , Mississippi residents are n't merely the sickest in the United States .
They are also plagued by the worst state health care system in America .
In October , the Commonwealth Fund released its 2009 state health care scorecard .
There , too , Mississippi led the Republican south in providing dismal health care .
Again , while nine of the top 10 performing states voted for Barack Obama in 2008 , four of the bottom five ( including Arkansas , Mississippi , Oklahoma and Louisiana ) and 14 of the last 20 backed John McCain .
( That at least is an improvement from the 2007 data , in which all 10 cellar dwellers had voted for George W. Bush three years earlier . )
In theory , their steadfast opposition to the health care legislation before the Senate should present a double quandary for the Republican leadership in Congress and in the states .
After all , their residents not only need health care reform desperately .
As it turns out , the funding for it would come in part from blue state taxpayers .
As the Washington Post noted in May ( " A Red State Booster Shot " ) :
Health - care reform may be overdue in a country with 45 million uninsured and soaring medical costs , but it will also represent a substantial wealth transfer from the North and the East to the South and the West .
The Northeast and the Midwest have much higher rates of coverage than the rest of the country , led by Massachusetts , where all but 3 percent of residents are insured .
The disproportionate share of uninsured is in the South and the West , the result of employment patterns , weak unions and stingy state governments .
Texas leads the way , with a quarter of its population uninsured ; it would be at the top even without its many illegal immigrants .
As it turns out , health care reform spending would be little different from the overall pattern of red state socialism .
That is , red state residents disproportionately benefit from the steady one - way flow of tax dollars and earmarks spreading the wealth from Washington to their states .
Of course , no amount of data will stop Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell warning of a " government - run " plan that " that denies , delays , or rations health care . "
After all , with his home state 's 41st and 45th place rankings in resident health and health care performance , McConnell 's nightmare future is Kentucky 's horror story present .

STATEN ISLAND , N.Y . --
Teachers , do n't read this .
And if one of the Jersey Shore cast members was your student , you probably should n't admit it .
Having made a splash on the MTV television series " Jersey Shore , " three of the cast members from the reality show last night made another kind of splash on The Jay Leno Show .
A belly flop .
In a gameshow - like setting with three podiums and buzzers , Staten Island native Mike " The Situation " Sorrentino , Pauly D , and Snooki answered questions most elementary school students would ace .
Not so for this orange tan crowd , however .
Starting off , Leno asked about first grade history .
" Now this should be an easy one .
What year did we first celebrate our independence ? "
Leno asked .
Sorrentino confidently answered 1767 .
" No , close , " Leno said .
" It 's nine more than what you said before . "
After an extended period of looking at each other , Leno offered help .
" Do the math -- you need pens and pencils ?
Add nine to 1767 . "
Mike answered 1775 to laughs from the audience .
When Leno asked Snooki where the UN is located , she answered " United Nations . "
" Yeah , where is it ? " Leno prodded .
" I 'll give you a hint , you live there . "
Snooki : " Albany "
Leno : " No . "
She finally answered New York to much applause .
Snooki also called Vice President Joe Biden " Vice President Crone " and identified Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi as singer Lionel Ritchie .
Nobody was able to identify Richard Nixon and Pauly D. answered " Elvis " when Leno said " This guy from Hoboken , New Jersey , was known as ' Old Blue Eyes . '
Another history lesson came from the presidency of Ronald Reagan .
When Reagan said , " Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall .
What wall was he talking about ? "
Leno asked .
" The dam , " Snooki replied , adding the dam in Denver when asked further .
But perhaps the best line came from Snooki when a picture of former Vice President Dick Cheney was shown on the screen .
She was able to identify him , but when Leno asked what his job was , her reply made Leno laugh .
" I thought he almost shot Bush , " she said .
In the end , Sorrentino won with 8 points ahead of Snooki's 7 and Pauly 's 6 points .
Most of the points , however , came after a few wrong answers and hints from a mocking Leno .
Is this a new Radiohead song ?
The track was posted to the Radiohead fan site At Ease , and it certainly bears all the hallmarks of the band âs recent works .
So far , nothing has been confirmed , but that surely must be Thom Yorke on vocals ?
If it âs not , someone has perfected an uncanny impression of him
The band members recently announced they might not stick to releasing songs in the traditional album format , and this release of â These Are My Twisted Words â could be the shape of things to come , with new Radiohead material mysteriously surfacing on the Internet , causing fans to question whether it âs really them or not .

Good news for Canadians who can't seem to get a decent internet plan for home .
Rogers has unveiled a 3G station for residential use dubbed the Rocket Hub , and with it a number of jet propulsion - related puns that we 'll be taking painstaking measures to avoid .
It boasts 7.2 Mbps HSPA , WiFi and ethernet out , and voice calls over UMTS .
Makes sense since it 's riding an Ericsson W3 x core .
The Upfront cost of hardware has n't been disclosed yet , but plans start at $ 35 Canadian .
Launch date ( okay , we could n't resist ) is sometime later this month .
A Japanese brewer has come up with a beer that 's truly out of this world -- one made with barley grown from a line of seeds that once orbited the Earth aboard the International Space Station .
Sapporo Breweries Ltd. said Monday orders had flooded in for the special edition of 250 six - packs of its new " Space Barley . "
The company says the amber brew was made from the fourth generation of barley seeds that had spent five months in the Russian laboratory on the ISS .
" We have received orders from 2,000 people by Sunday .
We believe this shows people 's interest is high , considering the rather high price for six bottles , " said company spokesman Yuki Hattori .
Some would call the price astronomical -- a six - pack retails at 10,000 yen ( 110 dollars ) , or almost 20 dollars per bottle .
Sapporo said it will keep taking orders for the beer until Christmas Eve , December 24 , then select the lucky customers through a computer lottery , with proceeds to be donated to educational and research projects .
The beer is the fruit of joint research with Russia into growing edible plants in space to prepare for a future when humans can spend extended periods of time out of this world -- and when they might like a cold beer after a space walk .
Sapporo teamed up with a biologist at Japan 's Okayama University who has been part of the Russian space project to grow edible plants in space .
Barley can thrive in tough environments , such as at high and low temperatures , and is rich in fibre and nutrients , making it ideal for space agriculture .
Researchers found no differences between Earth - grown and space barley .
" Some people may expect the space beer to taste very different , but its selling point is that it's the same , " Hattori said .

When it comes to the MPAA , Universal is finding that things are n't simple .
The group 's Classification and Ratings Appeals Board on Wednesday denied the studio's appeal of an R rating for its new Nancy Meyers romantic comedy " It 's Complicated , " throwing a potential marketing hurdle in the film 's path .
The MPAA 's ruling cited " some drug content and sexuality " for the film about a love triangle among upper - middle - class suburbanites .
Those familiar with the board hearing said the inclusion of a scene featuring " pot - smoking with no bad consequences " was key to the decision .
The comedy , set to be released Christmas Day , features a comic scene in which characters played by Steve Martin and Meryl Streep smoke pot for the first time in several decades .
The studio has decided not to cut the scene -- it is , incidentally , one of Martin 's few showcase scenes -- and will release the film with an R rating .
Universal declined to comment .
The rating is unlikely to directly impact the demo expected to turn out for the movie .
" It 's Complicated " is aimed at an older female audience , and even teenagers who might see it are likely to go with someone older and not with packs of friends .
It is n't " Twilight . "
But the rating could signal to some filmgoers that the movie 's content is mature , which could in turn deter them from seeing the film .
( In some cases , particularly with films aimed at a younger male demo , an R rating can actually be used to a movie 's marketing advantage , but this is n't one of them . )
The decision mattered enough to Universal to appeal the decision , with studio chief Adam Fogelson traveling to the board hearing on the West Coast and Martin conferenced in via webcam from New York , where the movie was set to hold a premiere Wednesday night .
The decision also lands in the cross hairs of a larger debate over marijuana , with authorities in California cracking down on marijuana growers and medical dispensaries .
Meyers ' comedies , which usually include middle - aged female characters and tend to skew older , have never garnered an R before .
The fate of " It 's Complicated " is key for Universal , which with just a few exceptions has endured a string of box - office disappointments this year .
Meyers has the track record to offer executives hope of a breakout :
Her last film , the Jack Nicholson - Diane Keaton romantic comedy " Something 's Gotta Give , " earned $ 228 million worldwide .

Barker was also jailed for raping a girl in a separate case
The boyfriend of Baby Peter 's mother has been attacked in prison .
Steven Barker , 33 , is not thought to have been seriously hurt in the attack by another inmate at Wakefield Prison on Friday , a prison spokeswoman said .
Barker was jailed for 12 years for allowing or causing the death of Peter Connelly along with the boy 's mother Tracey Connelly and lodger Jason Owen .
The spokeswoman said he had been treated in prison and the assailant was in the segregation unit .
Barker is also serving a life sentence , with a minimum term of 10 years , after being convicted of raping a two - year - old girl .
A prison spokeswoman said : " On the morning of 11 December , a prisoner at HMP Wakefield was assaulted by another prisoner .
" Thanks to the prompt and professional action of officers at HMP Wakefield who intervened , this situation was brought under control almost immediately .
" The prisoner who was assaulted received treatment in the prison 's healthcare wing and the assailant is currently in the segregation unit . "
Seventeen - month - old Peter Connelly had more than 50 injuries , including fractured ribs and a broken back , when he was found dead in a property in Tottenham , north London , in August 2007 .
Korriban , originally known as Pesegam during the reign of Xim , was the sole planet in the Horuset system , located across the galaxy from Koros Major .
It was the original homeworld of the Sith species and a sacred planet for the Sith Order , housing the tombs for many ancient and powerful Dark Lords of the Sith , and containing tremendous dark side power .
After the Hundred Year Darkness , the remaining Dark Jedi interbred with the Sith species and ruled the Sith using their Force powers .
After the Great Hyperspace War , Korriban was abandoned and became a barren world .
It was the site of two Sith Academies , and became the headquarters of the One Sith .
It was close to Bosthirda and was located on the Nache Bhelfia and Kamat Krote hyperspace lanes .
History
Infinite Empire
This remote , forbidding planet was the original homeworld of the Sith species .
The Rakata invaded Korriban in an attempt to integrate the world into the Infinite Empire , intending to harvest slaves from the planet to be used for Rakatan projects , such as the Star Forge ( 30,000 BBY ) .
The sole artifact to survive this era was the ancient Star Map , around which the tomb of Naga Sadow was later built .
The Rakata were eventually forced off the world after the Sith King Adas led his people against them .
Adas died in the battle , and thus , despite this victory , the Sith society crumbled , and , in the ensuing centuries of strife , the Sith relocated to Ziost , leaving Korriban as a graveyard world .
Sith Empire
The Sith Empire was founded in approximately 6,900 BBY by exiled fallen Jedi fleeing the Battle of Corbos , which concluded the Hundred - Year Darkness .
The fallen Jedi landed on Korriban .
Using their training in the Force , the fallen Jedi amazed the Sith and elevated themselves to god - like status on Korriban , becoming the rulers of the Sith people .
As years passed , and interbreeding occurred between the Fallen Jedi and the Sith , the term â Sith â came to mean not only the original inhabitants of Korriban , but also their fallen Jedi masters .
Until the rise of Naga Sadow , the existence of the Sith Empire was unknown to the Galactic Republic .
Under the pall of Sith magic , this desolate world became more hellish and dangerous .
The Sith Lords erected huge palaces and burial complexes to honor their fallen Dark Lords .
Circa 5,000 BBY , the planet became an endpoint of the newly - formed Daragon Trail hyperspace lane , when it was discovered by Gav and Jori Daragon .
This event triggered the Great Hyperspace War .
After the fall of the Sith Empire , the planet lost much of its prominence in the galaxy , eventually falling off the galactic starcharts for a thousand years .
Old Sith Wars
Korriban was resettled prior to 3,993 BBY by Dark Jedi survivors of the Exar Kun War , and was home to the new settlement of Dreshdae and a Sith training academy .
In 3,993 BBY , as part of the Great Hunt , Duron Qel - Droma and Shaela Nuur died on the planet , failing to cleanse it of terentateks .
The planet became the sector headquarters of the Czerka Corporation .
Darth Revan and Darth Malak visited the planet on their quest to discover the Star Forge .
After losing his memory , Revan visited the academy again in 3,956 BBY on his quest to re-discover the Star Forge for the good of the Republic .
Seeking the Star map in Naga Sadow âs tomb he passed the tests and then confronted Uthar .
With the death of Master Uthar Wynn , the academy âs headmaster , and Darth Malak himself at the hands of Revan in 3,956 BBY , the Sith Order collapsed into a civil war ( which took place 3,956 - 3,950 BBY ) which decimated the Sith Order .
It took the Republic a couple of years to send an expeditionary force to Korriban ( around 3,954 BBY ) in order to deal with any potential Sith who might attempt to take up the mantle of Dark Lord .
They found a planet nearly in ruins â barren and lifeless as a result of the then unknown civil war .
It was assumed by the commanders of the Republic task force that the remnants of the Sith turned on each other , vying for what little power remained .
It was also said that Revan had always intended to return to Korriban one day to subdue any would - be Sith insurgents , but he then disappeared .
However , the Republic discovered evidence that several Sith Lords did manage to escape the planetary conflagration , fleeing to remote corners of the galaxy .
After the fall of Darth Malak , the ancient tombs within the Valley of the Dark Lords were plundered by grave - robbers .
Each tomb was once infused with history and heritage of the old Sith Empire , containing great mysteries and powerful relics of the Force .
Many broken , charred corpses littered the plains of Korriban during this time , virtually all that remained of the Sith who once inhabited the world .
However , their malignant spirits remained , ready to confront any who disturb their rest by way of their guardian - familiars , the Hssiss .
In the chaos following the Jedi Civil War , which nearly destroyed the Jedi Order , Jedi Master Lonna Vash used Korriban as a hideout .
She was eventually trapped and killed by Sith Lord Darth Sion in the ruins of the academy , and then used as bait to lure the Jedi Exile into Sion âs hands .
After escaping the trap , the Exile discovered the long lost tomb of Ludo Kressh .
Retaking Korriban was a priority for the Sith Empire , when it re-emerged during the Great War .
They retook the planet and re-established the Sith Academy .
Fauna
Due to the planet âs harsh terrain ( or the power of the dark side ) , Korriban âs native fauna was both vicious and cunning , such as the fierce terentateks .
The bat - like Shyracks lived in great numbers in caves on the planet .
Tuk âata , sometimes called Sith hounds were also fairly common , particularly in the Valley of the Dark Lords .
Dark side dragons , or Hssiss , could be found on Korriban , though as semi-aquatic creatures , they were quite rare .
Wraid were also found on Korriban .
There is evidence that , at one point , the planet was home to an ape or primate - like species , although by the time of Naga Sadow the species was long extinct .
Though it is possible that the primate - like species was somehow connected to the Sith species , no conclusive link between this species and the Sith species was known .
The highly venomous pelko bug was an insect native to the planet â its venom had a potent numbing effect and was used in Sith training sabers by the Brotherhood of Darkness during the end of the New Sith War .
Behind the scenes
Though Ziost was established as the original Sith homeworld in The Golden Age of the Sith , many sources described Korriban as the Sith homeworld .
It was the â public â capital world of the Sith Empire during the era of Darth Revan , but was a mausoleum - world for millennia beforehand and would return to such a state not long after .
The controversy was put to rest in the article Evil Never Dies : The Sith Dynasties by Abel G. PeÃ±a , which clearly established the Sith originating on Korriban and relocating the capitol to Ziost before the arrival of the Dark Jedi exiles during the Hundred Year Darkness , though the Dark Jedi exiles themselves landed on Korriban .
From the article : Evil Never Dies : The Sith Dynasties
Without Adas â unifying influence , wars once again raged for rule of the Sith people , with the reigning combatants arrogantly claiming the title of Sithâari , and eventually forcing a relocation of the Sith capitol to the planet Ziost .
Eventually , almost two - dozen millennia after Adas â death , a proper successor to Adas seemed to come at last .
Known in Republic space as the Exiles , traitorous Jedi defeated in a galactic war called the Hundred - Year Darkness arrived on Korriban and cowed the Sith people with their astounding Force abilities , lightsabers , and superior technology .
The word korban means sacrifice in the Hebrew and Malay languages .
It is used in the Torah or Old Testament when referring to the fiery sacrifices the high priests made to God .
This may be a connection to some of the violent sacrifices the Sith Lords made to gain and in attempts to gain power .
If the course of human history is any model , then the wheels are already turning on Earth 's sixth mass extinction , thanks to habitat destruction , pollution and now global warming , a scientific analysis of millions of years of data revealed Friday .
The study of the fossil and archaeological record over the past 30 million years by UC Berkeley and Penn State University researchers shows that between 15 and 42 percent of the mammals in North America disappeared after humans arrived .
That means North American mammals are well on the way - perhaps as much as half way - to a level of extinction comparable to other epic die - offs , like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs .
Anthony Barnosky , a UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology and co-author of the study , said the most dramatic human - caused impacts on the ecosystem have occurred in the last century .
" We are seeing a lot of geographic range reductions that are of a greater magnitude than we would expect , and we are seeing loss of subspecies and even a few species , " Barnosky said .
" So it looks like we are going into another one of these extinction events . "
The analysis by Barnosky , research associate Marc Carrasco and Penn State 's Russell Graham was published this week in the scientific journal PLoS ONE .
It compares the extinctions of mammals in North America after humans arrived 13,000 years ago to the five mass extinctions on Earth over the past 450 million years .
The least severe of those extinctions wiped out the dinosaurs 68 million years ago and killed off 75 percent of the species on the planet .
Add human impact
Although humans clearly did not have anything to do with the previous extinctions , many scientists are afraid that global warming and other environmental problems caused by the ever - increasing human population could have similarly catastrophic consequences .
" Here we are again , astronomically increasing the number of humans on the face of the globe , plus unusual climate change , " Barnosky said .
" That seems to be a recipe for extinction that we saw in the past , and we are seeing again . "
The work , which was supported by the National Science Foundation , looked at the number , distribution and range of every mammal from shrews to mammoths in the area of the continental United States between 500 years ago and 30 million years ago .
Previous research has shown that most mammal extinctions in North America , Australia , Europe and Northern Asia have occurred within a few thousand years after the arrival of humans .
This study puts that data into historical perspective , providing the percentage of animals that went extinct during certain time periods compared with other epochs .
50 gone in 2,000 years
Humans reached North America about 13,000 years ago and more than 50 species disappeared over the next 2,000 years , including mammoths , saber - toothed cats , giant ground sloths and other large animals , according to the study .
The arrival of humans coincided with the end of the last ice age , but the study pointed out that 38 other ice ages had occurred in North America over the past 2 million years and there were no comparable die - offs during the others .
" The only difference is that 13,000 years ago , humans appear on the scene , " Carrasco said .
" The bottom line is , mammals in general were able to deal with these changes in the past .
Only when humans arrive do the numbers fall off a cliff . "
There is , nevertheless , reason for optimism , Barnosky said .
The number of extinctions has leveled off over the past 10,000 years , he said , and it is not too late to prevent a resurgence .
" If we redouble our conservation efforts , we can stem the tide of extinctions and have those species around in the future , " he said .
" There is a bit of urgency here .
By demonstrating that we have already lost 15 to 42 percent of mammalian diversity , the question is , do we really want to lose any more ?
I think the answer to that is pretty obvious . "
Future studies are expected to analyze the extinctions that occurred 40,000 years ago , when modern humans emerged from Africa into Europe and Asia .
Some responded furiously and it was thought that dozens of MPs were preparing to refuse to co-operate with his requests .
As Sir Thomas had no legal powers , it was unclear what would happen if they did .
Mickey Mouse gets a makeover in Epic new video game - and this time Disney 's giving him a dark side
He âs best known as the cheerful and friendly cartoon icon of the Walt Disney Company .
But Mickey
Mouse is set for a makeover â and it looks like the loveable character is headed for the dark side .
Epic Mickey is set for launch on Nintendo âs Wii console next year and will feature the mouse as you âve never seen him before .
Rebrand : Mickey Mouse 's makeover sees him ' naughty ' and more rat - like in his appearance in the game , set for release next year
Loveable :
The new Mickey is less soft and cheerful than his most recent predecessor
The new platform game is intended to establish the character alongside computer game heavyweights including Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog .
â We âve pulled Mickey out of the world of cartoons which is where he belongs and feels comfortable and safe and we pull him into a world we call the Cartoon Wasteland , â game designer Warren Spector told The Guardian .
The game sees Mickey plunged into an apocalyptic - looking world where the formerly squeaky - clean mouse comes face to face with past Disney characters eclipsed by his fame .
Oswald the Lucky Rabbit is the chief inhabitant , a predecessor to Mickey who was abandoned in a dispute with Universal Studios .
In Epic Mickey , Oswald resurfaces as bitter and envious of the mouse âs popularity .
A disembowelled , robotic Donald Duck also features , as does a â twisted , broken , dangerous â version of Disneyland âs
It âs a Small world .
Although cantankerous and cunning , Mickey âs character is above all a hero who must solve problems to stop the Phantom Blot overlord and revive the wasteland .
In an added twist , the more destructive his behaviour , the more the famous mouse begins to resemble a rat .
Mr Spector said : â Mickey is never going to be evil or go around killing people .
â [ But ] I wanted him to be able to be naughty â when you âre playing Mickey you can misbehave and even be a little selfish , â he added .
Apocalyptic :
The wastelands of Epic Mickey are a far cry from the usual Disney landscapes
Turmoil : Mickey is plunged into a world that needs saving
How he was : Mickey in his 1928 debut in Steamboat Willie
The surprising move to reinvent the mouse comes following a decline in merchandise sales for the character .
Although worth $ 5 bn this year , the decline is a result of the changing tastes of a new generation of cartoon fans , who have grown up with Nickelodeon and Pixar .
It âs hoped the makeover will make the mouse appeal to the modern broods of texting , technologically savvy children who currently make up the markets .
â There âs a distinct risk of alienating your core consumer when you tweak a sacred character , but at this point it âs a risk they have to take , â said Matt Britton , a managing partner of Mr Youth , a New York brand consultant firm .
Mickey Mouse made his debut in Steamboat Willie in 1928 .
The character , which was originally voiced by Walt Disney himself , has evolved through various costume and anatomical changes throughout the years , although all retained his cheerful and happy demeanour .
News of Mickey 's rebrand comes as China finally gave the green light for Disneyland to build a Disney theme park in Shanghai â after 20 years of negotiations .
It is hoped Shanghai Disneyland â which is expected to cost around $ 4 billion - will unlock a giant new market for Mickey and his fellow characters .
Oregano oil is widely known as nature 's potent defense against harmful organisms .
Not only is it highly respected within the natural health community , it is also widely studied by the scientific community for medical use .
The research and analysis of oregano oil has encompassed many topics .
Oregano oil has extremely high levels of free - radical - fighting antioxidants â agents that protect the body .
Oregano oil also provides vitamins and minerals like vitamins A C , and E complex , as well as zinc , magnesium , iron , calcium , potassium , copper , manganese and niacin .
Oregano oil may provide support for respiratory health , skin health , athlete 's foot , yeast infections , and harmful organisms .
What is Oregano Oil ?
Length : 2 minutes
Research on Oregano Oil
Studies have shown its usefulness against Candida albicans , Aspergillus mold , staph , vaginal imbalance , pseudomonas , and listeria .
A study from the US Department of Agriculture showed that oregano essential oils presented potent action against Salmonella and E.coli .
[ 1 ]
Other research holds the same , stating that oregano oil is such a powerful agent that it can be used to preserve food .
Studies from the Department of Food Science at the University of Tennessee and the University of the Algarve found that similar results for oregano 's power against pathogenic germs [ 2 ]
A recent study from the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at Georgetown University Medical Center stated the following regarding the role of essential oils for infections :
" New , safe agents are needed to prevent and overcome severe bacterial , viral , and fungal infections .
Based on our previous experience and that of others , we postulated that herbal essential oils , such as those of origanum ( oregano oil ) ... offer such possibilities . " [ 3 ]
In an article published by Science Daily , oil of oregano was found to be effective in killing Staphylococcus bacteria . [ 4 ]
Another study published in the journal , Experimental and Toxicologic Pathology found that oregano oil could lower the negative effects of induced colitis in rats and opens the door to new ideas about its benefit to the colon and liver .
More Health Benefits of Oregano Oil
Resistant to redness and swelling
Might help relieve congestion
Supports regular menstruation and reduces the effects of menopause
Calms sensitivities to environmental irritants
Potent antioxidant capacity â through neutralizing free - radicals , oregano oil slows the process of cellular deterioration , thus slowing the process of aging
Rosmarinic acid , a component of oil of oregano , is an antihistamine , and a more powerful antioxidant than vitamin E
Promotes digestion by stimulating the flow of bile in the digestive organs
Supports normal fungal balance
Action Against Harmful Organisms
A recent study on the activity of multiple essential oils against harmful organisms found that both oregano and thyme oils showed the strongest activity .
Oregano oil might help discourage the growth of enteric organisms [ 5 ] .
A 6 - weeks study on individuals with organisms found that supplementation with 600 mg of oregano oil daily led to a complete disappearance of the harmful organisms .
It may also protect us against a wide variety of infiltration within the body , as well as the physical environment .
This includes round worms , tapeworms , bed bugs , lice , fleas , and mosquitoes .
Which Oregano Oil
Is the Best ?
I have used oregano oil for many different things over the years and highly recommend you keep some in your natural medicine cabinet .
When researching oil of oregano products to buy , be sure to look at the amount of Carvacrol it contains , and also try to buy organic when possible .
Oregatrexâ¢ is the oregano oil product that I use and recommend for everyone .

Governance by those who do the work .
Spider - Man may be a masked superhero , but he still needs a face for when he âs that Peter Parker chap â and Sony are really taking their time in deciding whose face that will be .
Their Spider - Man reboot was announced at the beginning of this year , and since then a Captain America - style rumour campaign has seized control of the internet .
Now , though , we have Sony âs list of top five contenders for the role ( thanks to Deadline ) .
The studio reportedly spent Friday going through all of their auditions tapes , and boiled the list down to :
Aaron Johnson , Anton Yelchin , Logan Lerman , Andrew Garfield , Jamie Bell .
Few surprises there , what with pretty much every one of those names having been stuck to the role in the past few weeks let alone months .
The big question remains , though â just who will bag Spidey ?
Johnson would be an interesting choice considering he pretty much played Peter Parker in Kick - Ass ( the perfect audition tape for Spidey , surely ? ) .
Meanwhile , Logan Lermon sort of looks exactly the same as Johnson , except American â¦
Naturally , we âre going to go all patriotic ( despite yesterday âs balls up ) and lay our loyalties with Jamie Bell and Johnson .
And that âs the last we âll say on the matter until Sony actually cast somebody .

Elizabeth Schulte reports on how a growing number of families are finding themselves hungry and homeless in cities across the country , according to a new report .
MAJOR CITIES across the country -- including places largely known for their wealth and abundance -- are becoming centers of hunger and homelessness .
Requests for emergency food assistance increased a staggering 26 percent last year in cities across the country , according to the recently released findings of the U.S. Conference of Mayors ' Hunger and Homelessness Survey .
This is the largest average increase in demand in the last 18 years .
The survey , based on reports from 27 major cities across the U.S. , found that three - quarters of them reported an increase in family homelessness .
The rising number of families out on the street was a striking number , even as several cities reported that rates of individual homelessness had stayed the same or even declined .
Half of the cities included in the survey reported that the demand for food assistance increased by 30 percent or more .
In Hennepin County , Minn. , which includes Minneapolis , there was a 49 percent increase in requests for food assistance , centered in the metropolitan area around the state 's biggest city .
The food stamp programs is stretched to its limits -- it was n't " designed for this kind of event - - a middle - class loss of jobs , " Bill Brumfield , Hennepin County 's area director of human services and public health told the Minneapolis Star Tribune .
Denise Jourdain , recently laid off from a non-profit organization , described going to a Catholic Charities food shelf in Minneapolis to apply for food stamps , after putting it off for three months .
" The fear of not having enough food " drove her there , she told a reporter .
" What if I do n't have a job at the end of the month ?
I have to do this . "
The U.S. Conference of Mayors ' report found that 22 out of 23 cities reported an increase in people requesting food assistance for the first time .
Nashville reported a 74 percent increase in first - time requests , Seattle had a 30 percent increase , and Los Angeles and Detroit recording 10 - 15 percent increases .
According to the mayor 's report , people who a year ago were donating meals are now requesting them :
Six cities reported that middle - class families that used to donate to food pantries are now going there to seek assistance .
The increased demand among middle - class families has created new challenges for food pantries .
San Francisco opened five new pantries over the past year to serve those newly seeking assistance as a result of the recession .
The city launched an aggressive media campaign to promote these pantries because many people were unaware that assistance was available .
Dallas reports that middle - class families seeking assistance are unfamiliar with accessing social services , generally wait too long before trying , and are more vocal about conditions and circumstances surrounding some aspects of accessing social services .
Hungry people are also visiting food pantries more often .
Providence , R.I. , reported that " people used to coordinate their pantry visits with food stamp distributions .
Now people are coming back sooner because their food stamps do not go as far due to the rising costs of food . "
When asked for reasons behind the increase in hunger among their citizens , 92 percent of cities surveyed said unemployment was the primary cause , followed by high housing costs ( 60 percent ) and low wages ( 48 percent ) .
Thirty - two percent of cities cited high medical costs as a top cause of hunger -- a big increase from 2008 , when just 8 percent of cities reported medical bills as a leading contributor to hunger .
FAMILIES , RATHER than individuals , are becoming the new face of homelessness in the U.S. San Francisco , Sacramento , Nashville , Dallas , Boston , Kansas City and Charleston all reported double - digit increases in family homelessness .
In Norfolk , Va. , where the number of homeless people increased 15 percent over the past year , the homeless population has changed , according to Linda Jones of the Union Mission Ministries there .
There are more women and younger people who are becoming homeless , Jones explained to the Virginian - Pilot .
At the mission , men sleep on the floor of the lobby , and women sleep in offices or hotel rooms -- nearly 300 people every night .
That number is a 10 percent increase over a year ago .
Norfolk was already hit hard in 2007 , when a Ford truck assembly plant closed .
Now , times are even tougher .
Private donations to Union Mission have declined 23 percent in 2009 , Jones said .
Last year , the organization provided 2,500 boxes of food to families during the holidays , and this year , only 1,000 boxes are available so far to meet an even greater need .
Norfolk 's crisis is commonplace .
City governments have been forced to be creative to keep up with the demand for places to spend the night .
Seven cities in the mayors ' survey described converting office buildings into temporary shelters to try to keep up with demand .
Several cities , including Detroit , Los Angeles and Nashville said that new tent cities for homeless have sprung up , and other cities like Sacramento and Des Moines reported that existing tent cities were growing larger .
The mayors ' report added feedback about new or recently expanded federal programs that target hunger and homelessness as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- the formal name for President Barack Obama 's stimulus legislation earlier this year .
Officials in many cities stated that funds received through programs like the Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Emergency Food and Shelter Program helped meet growing demand .
Nevertheless , the acute needs of the hungry and homeless far eclipse what the federal government has so far been willing to provide .
Some 14 cities in the survey -- about half -- said that shelters had to turn away people because there were n't enough beds .
In Los Angeles , officials cited a survey of homeless people that found just 13 percent of respondents had tried to access a shelter within the last 30 days .
Of that small minority who did seek a place to spend the night , some 68 percent were turned away because there was nowhere for them to stay .
The Obama 's administration 's stated commitment to providing stimulus money to address the increase in hunger and homeless is welcome .
But it 's a far cry from the enormous sums of federal money given to Wall Street and the Pentagon .
Washington has to start devoting money to help lift workers out of the crisis , not simply leave them scrambling to survive on the streets .
Boffins in Switzerland have warned that increasingly powerful computer processors are set to guzzle the entire world electricity supply by the year 2100 .
They say that only 3D myria - core chips can save the day .
Getting on top of Moore 's law .
" Industry âs data centres already consume as much as 2 % of available electricity , " says John R Thome of the Ãcole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) .
" As consumption doubles over a five - year period , the supercomputers of 2100 would theoretically use up the whole of the electrical supply ! â
According to Thome , the answer is to expand on today 's multicore processors by building three - dimensional arrays of cores - rather than just laying them out on a sheet .
Boffins at the EPFL have allied with others at the EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule in ZÃ¼rich ( ETH Zurich ) and from IBM's Swiss lab at RÃ¼schlikon to conduct the CMOSAIC project , which is aimed at delivering processors with as many transistors per cm 3 as there are neurons in the human brain .
IBM has just come on board the Swiss government - funded effort .
According to Thome and his colleagues , 3D processors will be much more energy - efficient than ordinary flat ones , so bowling out the issue of using up all the world 's power supplies .
But they 'll still heat up - and air cooling wo n't be good enough .
The boffins plan to build their 3D devices with a network of 50 - micron cooling pipes running through them , about the thickness of a human hair .
The pipes will carry liquid coolant , which will be heated into a vapour by the hot cores .
It will then be condensed , cooled and recirculated .
The assembled Swiss boffins expect to see their first 3D integrated circuitry going into supercomputers around 2015 , and the first ones fitted with the new liquid - chill gear in 2020 .
There 's more on the CMOSAIC project here . Â®

Daily Beast founder âs commentary : â Palin âs outrage is calculated â
By Tina Brown Founder , editor of The Daily Beast
Now that Palin has stopped pretending to be a politician â there âs been zero effort in any interview so far to leave the EQ stuff behind and divert to a policy message â the abdicated Alaskan governor is back to being as appealing as she was when she first made her debut at the GOP convention at John McCain âs side .
( Admit it :
We loved her at first when she thumbed - over - the - shoulder the now famous crowd - pleaser â The governor âs private plane ?
I put it on eBay ! ) .
With Oprah , she was once again fun when she shafted Levi Johnston , that feckless dope of a near - miss son - in - law .
She was wonderfully sly when , the next day , Barbara Walters on Good Morning America gravely quoted McCain adviser Steve Schmidt âs assessment that as VP she would have been an unmitigated disaster .
With a roguish smile , Palin responded , â That sounds like Steve Schmidt ! â
And the appearance of her genuinely fond - seeming teenage daughter Willow with her younger sister â cute as can be Piper , who told Barbara it was â sad â when her mother was criticized â gave us , for the first time , a whiff of authentic Palin family feeling . âª
- snip -
Vodpod videos no longer available .
My only regret in this recent series of star turns was Palin âs denunciation of the current Newsweek â cover to her Facebook following as â sexist . â
That âs the boring old fake - gravitas Sarah speaking .
The Newsweek cover shot , a months - old Google chestnut from Runner âs World of sassy Sarah in shorts , did nât show much journalistic enterprise on the magazine âs part , but you can hardly call it sexist .
No one cried sexism when New York magazine took a photo of fallen Gov. Eliot Spitzer and added the word â brain â with an arrow to his crotch .
And circa 1994 we were all happy to ogle Bill Clinton in his running shorts and never called out the media âs ethical judgment .
If you do nât want the moment captured on film , do nât show up in sporty hot pants for a photo shoot .
But Palin , like Carrie Prejean , is savvy enough to know that umbrage is a great Day 3 story when you are running the media marathon . âª
Indeed , her â hurt â retaliation is probably doing the same thing for Newsweek âs sales as what she suggests an appearance on her old foe Letterman âs show would do for the sales of her book ( hint , hint ) .
Everyone is someone else âs catalyst for selling something these days .
And right now , by golly , Sarah Palin is out there selling herself .

| POLITICO Staff Dems move to sack superdelegates
Democrats are moving to eliminate from the party 's national convention the superdelegates , the elected officials and party leaders whose role in the presidential nominating process came under intense scrutiny in last year âs closely - contested primary .
Those superdelegates provided , for a time , a lifeline to then - Sen .
Hillary Clinton 's flagging campaign , and the effective end of their independent role would be a major step toward reshaping the Democratic Party â and its internal politics â in President Barack Obama 's image .

A group created by the Democratic National Committee to examine the role of the superdelegates , the Democratic Change Commission â steered by the Obama campaign 's top delegate counter , Jeff Berman â held a conference call Wednesday to recommend that these unpledged delegates cast their votes based upon the electoral results of their states rather than on personal preference .
The recommendations of the commission , co-chaired by House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri , will now go before the DNC âs Rules and Bylaws Committee .
While the elimination of superdelegates is nât likely to have any impact in 2012 , when the party is all but certain to renominate President Obama , commission members say it will help democratize future presidential primaries .
" I think the goal here was to get away from what felt like almost a disenfranchisement at some point in time to the voters and to the caucus members in the various states , â McCaskill said .
The move follows an epic 2008 Democratic primary process in which all 50 states and the territories cast votes in a race that was effectively deadlocked between Obama and Clinton .
For a time , there was grave worry among some in the party that the superdelegates , who were not bound by their states â votes , could decide the nomination in favor of a candidate who received fewer elected delegates from primary voters and caucus - goers .

Despite this , fear of our fauna and marine life peaked very early in the year , after two men were mauled in the space of two February days at two favourite aquatic haunts - Sydney Harbour and Bondi Beach .
Navy diver Paul de Gelder was first , losing his hand and right leg after being attacked by a bull shark during an underwater exercise .
Days later , a great white shark locking its jaws around the left arm of Glenn Orgias while he was surfing at Bondi at dusk .
The attacks , and intense media coverage , prompted the NSW Government to launch its " shark action plan " .
But despite the hysteria , there were no shark - related fatalities in 2009 , according to a Taronga Zoo spokesman .
The zoo maintains the Australian Shark Attack File .
There were a number of other " encounters " , including bites and grazes .
Life was more perilous where crocodiles roamed .
The Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Service recorded two croc fatalities in the territory this year .
Eleven - year - old Briony Goodsell was swimming with other children at Black Jungle Swamp , southeast of Darwin , in March when she was taken by a saltwater crocodile .
A month later , 20 - year - old Keith Parry was killed by a four - metre crocodile while swimming in the Daly River .
" I only saw its big head and then heard a splash , " his sister was reported as saying .
Less seriously , reptile handler Tracey Sandstrom was attacked by her two - metre saltwater crocodile , Snappy , during a Christmas party earlier this month in Victoria .
The irukandji jellyfish - the size of a peanut with a sting that can kill - reared its tiny ugly head this month , but took no lives in 2009 .
An encounter with the jellyfish is known to cause victims to double up in agony , with the pain starting in their lower back and stomach and spreading to their legs , before inducing uncontrollable shivers and vomiting .
Earlier this month , a 29 - year - old man ended up in intensive care in a Queensland hospital after reportedly diving into the deadly jellyfish 's tentacles .
He was wearing a full - body stinger suit when he plunged head - first into its stingers .
Two days ago , the winner of Tourism Queensland 's " Best Job in the World " was stung .
Ben Southall wrote on his blog on Tuesday that he had a minor brush with the irukandji while jet skiing in the Whitsundays , in north Queensland .
" I was feeling pretty hot and sweaty , had a headache and felt pretty sick too with pain in my lower back and a tightness in the chest and a really high blood pressure . "
Despite their reputation , funnel - web bites have caused no fatalities since the availability of anti-venom in the 1980s , said Mary Rayner , general manager of the Australian Reptile Park .
The park milks venom from the spiders and delivers it to CSL Limited , which creates the anti-venom .
But two serious funnel - web bites this year stood out in her memory , both early on this year , because they showed spiders did not discriminate based on age .
An 84 - year - old Central Coast woman became one of the oldest spider victims after she was bitten on the toe , Ms Rayner said .
Days later , a three year old boy was bitten at his Newcastle home .
Both were treated with anti-venom and survived .
" The little three - year - old boy came in [ to the reptile park ] soon after to have a look at all the spiders , " she said .
Snake bites - commonly carried out by tiger and eastern brown snakes - killed about half a dozen people last summer , some of which were in the early part of 2009 , Ms Rayner said .
There were also a number of serious but non-fatal bites , in both rural and metropolitan areas .
A three - year - old boy was bitten by a 2.5 - metre brown snake while playing in a river north - west of Sydney in January , although he survived .
Days earlier , a young boy was bitten at St Marys after trying to pick up a black snake which he thought was a stick .
Also in January , an experienced reptile handler at Australia Zoo was bitten by a king brown snake , while in June a snake bit a cleaner at the Myer department store in Lonsdale Street , Melbourne .
After weeks of dry and hot conditions , followed by rain , the numbers of snakes and spiders now out and about and looking to mate was on the rise , Ms Rayner said .
In 2009 , animals also brought on death through the spread of disease .
Almost 200 Australians died as a result swine flu , a strain of influenza that gripped the world with fear this year .
Lesser known , the mosquito - borne virus Murray Valley encephalitis killed a Northern Territory farmer - 58 - year - old Theofilis Maglis - in March .
The hendra virus , a rare virus spread from bats to horses and then to humans , also killed Rockhampton vet Alister Rodgers this year .
Dr Rodgers was the second vet and fourth Queenslander to die from the virus , after veterinarian Dr Ben Cunneen , 33 , passed away following an outbreak of Hendra in Brisbane in August last year .
The bond market is starting to show signs of concern over budget deficits and the corresponding supply of treasuries .
Please consider Treasury Yield Curve Steepest Since at Least 1980 After Auction .
Treasuries fell , with the gap in yields between 2 - and 30 - year securities reaching the widest margin since at least 1980 , after a $ 13 billion offering of 30 - year bonds drew lower - than - forecast demand .
The so - called yield curve touched 372 basis points , the most in at least 29 years , as the bonds drew a yield of 4.52 percent .
The so - called yield curve has widened from 191 basis points at the end of 2008 , with the Fed anchoring its target rate at a record - low range of zero to 0.25 percent and the Treasury extending the average maturity of U.S. debt .
Treasury officials on Nov. 4 announced a long - term target of six to seven years for the average maturity of Treasury debt and said the department wants to cut back on its issuance of bills and two - and three - year notes .
The shift to longer - maturity debt has raised concern that investors will demand higher yields to offset the risk of inflation as government spending drives the deficit to a record $ 1.4 trillion .
â The market is continuing to worry about the massive amount of Treasury issuance that âs going to hit the market well into next year , â said Ian Lyngen , senior government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford , Connecticut .
â In the very short term , part of it is going to be supply accommodation . â

- The Great Retrace
From President Obama on down , Americans are hoping Friday 's stronger - than - expected November jobs report marked the beginning of the end of our national unemployment nightmare .
Looking beyond the November jobs data , Shedlock says the odds of the unemployment rate coming down anytime soon are remote .
As confident as he is about the grim outlook for jobs , Shedlock was very reticent to make market predictions in the accompanying video , taped Friday evening at Minyanville 's annual Holiday Festivus in New York City .
In a subsequent email , Shedlock was more willing to take a position , as is more typical of the opinionated blogger :
" In the absence of a war outbreak in the Middle East or Pakistan -- and / or Congress going completely insane with more stimulus efforts -- I think oil prices are likely to drop , the dollar will strengthen or at least hold its own , and the best opportunities are likely to be on the short side , " he writes .
" 2010 is highly likely to retrace most if not all of the â reflation ' efforts of 2009 .
If things play out as I suspect , 2010 will be the year of the great retrace as the economic recovery disappoints . "
IS THIS MV Agusta 's 675 cc triple , spied in testing earlier this week at Almeria circuit , Spain ?
Visordown brought you spy shots of the much - rumoured middleweight being road tested in Italy .
See the images here .
Three months on , it looks as if the company are stepping up their test programme , despite the fact Agusta has been put up for sale by its owners , Harley - Davidson .
The 675 was expected to make its debut at this year 's Milan show .
Now that the hoopla surrounding Sarah Palin âs book tour has somewhat subsided , it âs time to figure out just what âs so important about it .
Only a few glimmers of reality have surrounded the coverage .
For my money , Max Blumenthal , Saturday Night live , and Levi have it all figured out â and Billy Graham has allowed himself to be co-opted .
Simply put , many people , conservative and liberal alike , have underestimated Sarah Palin .
She is a one woman wrecking crew .
Blumenthal âs take on Palin in his TomDispatch.com article is striking for his focus on her destructive ability .
By the time this book tour is finished , she will have succeeded in splitting the republican party , solidifying a new hard right religious base , and making enough money to turn Alaska into the New Jerusalem .
I âm only jesting about one of these pronouncements ; but the fact is , Palin is nât about rebuilding .
She âs about destruction .
There is a reason she was called â rogue . â
Leave it to Saturday Night Live to once again capture the essence of Sarah Palin .
In a deft mashup of the film 2012 and campaign clips , the destruction that ensues from the election of Sarah Palin as president in 2012 seems to be a prophecy that rivals any armageddon scene the Left Behind series could ever create :
Max Blumenthal destruction thesis is correct , but it needs a little beefing up .
The havoc caused by Sarah Palin âs imagined election as president is a hint at what she âs all about today .
Palin âs belief and worldview is not about creation and building , its about destruction and dominion .
Destruction of what is â Evil â and building up for the â kingdom â ; that is , a government run by Christians and Christian principles , and vetted by conservative hard - line beliefs , not theology .
In order to have that happen , the current order , especially the Democrats â version of government order , has to fail .
What most liberals , Christians included , do nât understand , is that destruction paves the way for a new order ordained by God according to this belief system .
Palin and those who ascribe to these fundamental beliefs regarding â bible prophecy â know that destruction must come , and violence has to occur .
( Matt 11:12 ) Those who want to wrestle for â God âs Kingdom â will have to be forthright , plainspoken , and not about building bridges .
Sounds like Sarah Palin to me .
Couple Palin âs mission with the tea parties , and well , you get the picture .
Whatever you think about Sarah Palin , you have to admit , any way it goes , the dice have rolled right by her , even when it seems she has crapped out .
Palin may have taken a hit for quitting the governorship , but hey , when you âve got your own tour bus like Brent Michaels in â Rock of Love â with your picture painted on it , who would nât quit Alaska and smelling like salmon ?
Besides , she âs not even riding the bus , she âs flying to each location for the most part , in a gulf stream jet just like Creflo Dollar and other word of faith folks .
Being welcomed with signs greeting her as â Queen Esther â I imagine is pretty exhilarating .
Palin âs audience and a meal with Billy Graham while on tour confers top notch spiritual affirmation and legitimacy to the â Queen Esther â moniker .
I happen to know that recently Graham âs people kept a well - respected scholar of American Religion waiting in Montreat , citing Graham âs poor health .
Palin however , sashayed right into an audience with the Reverend , and a dinner invite !
Having Franklin Graham add that â Daddy feels God was using her to wake America up , â fits right in with that â Queen Esther for such a time as this â spiel .
Graham âs imprimatur on Palin âs religious status will go a long way with her followers .
The icing on the Palin party cake , perhaps , was hearing Pat Robertson describe her book on the 700 Club as â This is one gorgeous cover , this picture is unbelievable . â
Both evangelical icon and Pentecostal media mogul have placed their seal of approval upon her .
This book tour , however , has settled in my mind once and for all a discussion I had last year about whether Palin was an evangelical or a Pentecostal .
I am going to stick by my original pronouncement and say Pentecostal most emphatically .
Palin âs articulation of her testimony in the book , letter to baby Trig from â God â written in her own hand , and the altar call at the end of the book point to her mystical , miraculous bent , much more suited to Pentecostals and Charismatics , than evangelicals .
Palin âs brand of testimony linked with affirmations , of God âs hand in her life , says more than any erroneous statements about policy .
She speaks in a language her people can understand .
I have never seen her more articulate than when the 700 Club âs David Brody interviewed her .
Of course it could have been clever editing , but I doubt it .
Religious language is what Palin is most comfortable with , and the pithy statements she puts out about â Death panels â or last year âs quip about Obama â Pal ân around with Terrorists â have stuck in her followers â minds .
The statements do not have to be true , only spoken with authority .
I probably sound like chicken little at this point ; after all , how destructive can anyone be who is less than articulate on general matters and who quit the governor âs post ?
Very .
Let me explain my rationale .
Many people have tried to place Palin in several categories : Beauty Queen , Evangelical woman , ditzy brunette , and other reductionist gendered figures .
Yet everyone has forgotten the goddesses .
Some were virginal , while others represented fertility and motherhood , like Isis .
Still others were about sexuality , like Astarte .
But some were destructive , like Kali .
That âs Sarah Palin .
Goddess of destruction , with Diana the huntress , and Astarte thrown into her mix .
Goddesses of destruction have plans â¦ plans to lay waste to all they see .
You might think of Sarah as a Christian â goddess â sent by the Lord to cleanse and purge the country for the small town folks that she professes to know , be , and love .
Except in the Christian tradition , there is only one God .
That tweaks the goddess analogy a bit .
Fortunately for Palin , there are a host of Biblical characters , and for a white Christian woman of public stature these days , being labeled a modern day â Queen Esther â is good for book sales and self - promotion .
Being labeled â Queen Esther â is better than having to own up to being a one - woman wrecking crew .
Like Queen Esther , Palin was picked from McCain âs Vice - presidential beauty contest , and perhaps singlehandedly destroyed McCain âs chance for the presidency .
She upended the good evangelical narrative by having her pregnant daughter on the political stage with Levi the Baby Daddy , who is now Levi the Playgirl Centerfold .
She quit a good paying job as governor , a job that gave her political credibility to finish a book , get paid even more money , and go on a book tour .
These are not the actions of someone you can easily peg , but they are the actions of someone who believes that they are â called by God , â and savvy about their calling .
She is Sarah the barracuda , that mean girl who âs cute , loves God , and oh yeah , tells you everyday you are going to hell .
Think of the movie Saved , and you get the picture .
We âve all known that girl , and most of us wanted to see her turn into a pillar of salt .
But no matter how much she messes up , lies , and obfuscates , she still manages to get people to love and believe in her .
For Republican candidates in the 2010 election , they are damned with her support , and damned without it .
What a predicament !
There is however , one person who stands in Palin âs way : Levi Johnston .
Everyday he is alive , taunting Palin on several television shows with â she knows what I have on her â is a day she cannot completely relax and bask in her fame .
Even if what Johnston says is suspect , the fact that he does know something about their home life , and is vocal about what he knows can only make Palin nervous .
The tit - for - tat snarky comments between Palin and Johnston are both funny and sad , and the tantalizing â there are some things that I know ( about Sarah ) that are HUGE â is a scimitar hanging over Palin âs carefully coiffed hair .
His recent comment that Palin called her down syndrome baby â retarded â is either a big FAIL on his part , or an indictment of her mothering skills .
No matter what he says for now , most of his criticisms and reveals are not sticking .
Yet it âs the mere mention of Levi that causes Palin âs eyes to darken ominously , and to stutter .
For all of the accolades , prophecies , and groveling of political operatives , it may be left to a young playgirl model to give the definitive word on Sarah Palin .
I do hope , however , he remembers that his son âs grandmother can field dress a moose .
The US is planning retaliatory strikes in Yemen against al - Qaida over its attempt to blow up a transatlantic flight on Christmas Day .
American officials say intelligence efforts are focused on identifying and tracking down those who plotted to put Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on the plane with enough explosive in his underwear to bring down the Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam .
But they warn that finding those responsible is unlikely to be swift and say that identifying other " high - value " al - Qaida targets for retaliatory attack would also be a priority .
" First we have to find out who put Abdulmutallab on the plane with the bomb , " said a US official working alongside intelligence organisations .
" He 's providing some leads and we 're not dealing with an unknown quantity here .
We 've been watching and listening to what goes on in Yemen and we may have pieces of the puzzle already and just need to fit it together .
" If and when we identify them then we plan how to deal with them .
Who they are is one thing , where they are is another .
If they 're still in Yemen and we can get a lock on them then it wo n't be too difficult to know what to do .
But they know who they are and wo n't be standing out .
After that we can move with the president 's authorisation .
I do n't think there 's much doubt that authorisation will be forthcoming , but no one should think all of this is going to happen overnight . "
The official acknowledged that there was likely to be political and public pressure on Barack Obama to strike back at al - Qaida , particularly with Republican opponents breaking with the usual solidarity on national security issues to accuse him of weakness and making America vulnerable to attack .
" The people we want are the ones who put Abdulmutallab on the plane .
Until we can get them there are other high - value targets that will make the point that attacking America does not go unpunished , " said the official .
But given the regular attacks against al - Qaida in Yemen , these may have a greater impact on American public opinion than on the extremist group .
The US has been conducting a covert assault with drone attacks on al - Qaida bases for about a year , while CIA agents inside the country help direct ground operations .
American special forces have been training the Yemeni military and may have been involved in raids .
General David Petraeus , the American regional commander , and John Brennan , the president 's counterterrorism adviser , both visited Yemen this year .
Joe Lieberman , chairman of the Senate 's homeland security committee , who visited Yemen in August , described the country this week as a focus of the assault on al - Qaida .
" Yemen now becomes one of the centres of that fight .
We have a growing presence there â and we have to â of special operations , Green Berets , intelligence , " he said .
Yesterday , Yemeni forces targeted Nasser Ahmed al - Ahdal , a former prisoner released after renouncing violence but believed to have renewed links to al - Qaida .
One man was injured and captured but Ahdal and two others escaped .
Several al - Qaida members killed in raids by Yemeni forces in the past fortnight had been released or had escaped from prison .
Others who have left jail to rejoin the fight include Nasser al - Wahayshi , the Yemeni leader of al - Qaida , who escaped along with 22 others from prison in Yemen in 2006 .
His deputy , Saeed al - Shihri , joined al - Qaida in Yemen last year after being released to Saudi Arabia from GuantÃ¡namo .
While intelligence officials plan how to hit back abroad , they are under pressure at home after Obama blamed intelligence failings for Abdulmutallab being allowed to board a plane to the US .
The president has ordered that a preliminary report be delivered to him today tomorrow explaining how the young Nigerian managed to smuggle the explosives on to the flight .
The criticism is focused on the CIA and the national counterterrorism centre ( NCC ) established after 9/11 .
The CIA is under scrutiny because it picked up intelligence from Yemen that a Nigerian was involved in a forthcoming attack at about the same time that Abdulmutallab 's father told US diplomats in the Nigerian capital , Abuja , that his son had become radicalised in Yemen and was a possible threat .
That information was shared with CIA officials in Abuja who passed it on to the NCC , but it was apparently not matched with the intelligence from Yemen .
On Tuesday Obama condemned the failure to share information and other intelligence failings as " totally unacceptable " .
Because we 've outsourced so many functions that used to be handled by federal and / or military employees , we 've also lost control of outcomes like this :
Contractors working for the military in Iraq and Afghanistan are fouling the nests of U.S. soldiers with pollution , poisoning the troops in the very bases meant to be their sanctuaries .
That 's the central allegation in a new set of lawsuits filed in Nashville and elsewhere across the country .
The legal actions name as defendants the controversial contracting firm KBR Inc. ( formerly Kellogg Brown and Root ) , as well as Halliburton Co. , of which KBR used to be a subsidiary , and a Turkish general contracting firm , ERKA Ltd .
" These for - profit corporations callously exposed and continue to expose soldiers and others to toxic smoke , ash and fumes , " says the complaint filed in Nashville on Friday , which asks for damages on behalf of two Tennessee soldiers .
" These exposures are causing a host of serious diseases , increased risk of serious diseases in the future , death and increased risk of death . "
The lawsuit , which seeks class - action status , describes " burn pits " at U.S. bases in both military theaters that contain " every type of waste imaginable . "
Reading like a postmodern version of Jonathan Swift 's Description of a City Shower , the catalog of rubbish in the pits includes :
" Tires , lithium batteries , Styrofoam , paper , wood , rubber , petroleum - oil - lubricating products , metals , hydraulic fluids , munitions boxes , medical waste , biohazard materials ( including human corpses ) , medical supplies ( including those used during smallpox inoculations ) , paints , solvents , asbestos insulation , items containing pesticides , polyvinyl chloride pipes , animal carcasses , dangerous chemicals , and hundreds of thousands of plastic water bottles . "
" Flames shoot hundreds of feet into the sky " as the huge pits are set ablaze , the Nashville lawsuit claims .
Noting that " burning plastics emit dioxins , which are known to cause cancer , " the complaint accuses the defendants of negligence , battery and inflicting emotional distress .
Saying an estimated 100,000 soldiers and contract personnel may have been harmed by the smoke from the pits , the plaintiffs want the court to force KBR and the other companies to cover future medical expenses and pay other compensatory damages .
About One in 100 Kids On Autism Spectrum
When actor John Travolta recently revealed in court , apparently for the first time in public , that his late son Jett had been autistic , he confirmed what many had speculated even before the 16 - year - old 's untimely death in January .
Travolta may have preferred to keep his son's condition private , but researchers rely on other parents of kids with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) to share that information in hopes of getting a handle on just how common ASD is .
Research published this morning in the journal Pediatrics reveals that in the U.S. in 2007 about 1 in 91 children ages 3 to 17 were somewhere on the autism spectrum .
That 's more than any previous survey has found , and the numbers put some muscle behind the push to better understand and treat the condition .
Researchers spoke by telephone with parents or guardians of more than 78,000 kids in that age group and asked whether a physician or other health - care professional had ever told them their child had autism or any related condition such as Asperger 's disorder .
Just over 1,400 answered " yes . "
About half of those who said their child had ASD characterized it as a mild case .
The numbers also supported the current understanding that ASD is far more common among boys than girls and among white children than black or Hispanic kids .
Parents also were asked whether their once - diagnosed child still carried that diagnosis ; nearly 40 percent said they no longer did ( leaving just over 900 reporting that their child currently had ASD ) , which suggests that many may have been misdiagnosed from the start .
That finding helps demonstrate the difficulty of pinning ASD down ; though the numbers in this study suggest the phenomenon has grown , it remains unclear whether that growth means more kids have ASD now than have before or whether we 're just getting better at diagnosing these disorders .
Still , knowing that nearly about one percent of U.S. kids have ASD adds urgency to efforts to find ways to treat and even prevent autism .
One such major effort is already in the works :
The federal government 's stimulus package included $ 92 million for research into the genetics of autism .
In the meantime , knowing the extent of the situation helps us assess -- and plan to accommodate -- the enormous private - and public - health costs associated with ASD .
The new study cites earlier research showing that the life - time medical cost of dealing with ASD is $ 1.6 million ; other research cited says ASD - related costs borne by the health - care system rose 142 percent from 2000 to 2004 .
So even if you 've never met a child -- or an adult -- with ASD , you 've got plenty of reason to care about the condition , if not just out of compassion then certainly for concern over costs .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Legislature could be headed for a high - stakes game of chicken as the deadline approaches at midnight Sunday for the governor to sign or veto more than 700 bills that are on his desk .
The governor has made a veiled threat to issue a mass veto unless lawmakers reach agreement on an overhaul of the state 's water system .
A mass veto , legislative leaders said , would be both " silly " and inexcusable , and it would effectively wipe out nearly all the work done by the Legislature the past 10 months .
" Water is an extremely important issue , but the ... bills from the Assembly that are on the governor 's desk represent a multitude of issues that are very important to Californians , " said Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Baldwin Vista ( Los Angeles County ) , after a meeting with the governor and other legislative leaders Tuesday .
She added , " A mass vetoing is never an appropriate use of his veto power . "
Bills on the governor 's desk range from mundane to massive - on subjects such as education , Harvey Milk Day and ammunition restrictions .
Bass and state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , both said they were optimistic that the governor would not issue a mass veto , and Steinberg called the threat " silly . "
But Aaron McLear , a Schwarzenegger spokesman , would not say flatly that it was off the table .
" We 'll consider all the bills on their merits , but right now we 're focused on pushing the Legislature toward an agreement on water , " McLear said .
Investigation sought
Assembly Majority Leader Alberto Torrico , D - Fremont , called on Attorney General Jerry Brown on Tuesday to investigate the governor , saying his veto threat amounted to extortion .
Torrico is a candidate to replace Brown in 2010 .
Brown spokesman Scott Gerber said the attorney general would comment after his office had the chance to review the request .
Legislative leaders and major water interest groups , including environmental organizations and water users , are meeting privately throughout the week trying to resolve a number of major outstanding issues , including how to pay for an overhaul and how to guarantee water rights for entities including the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and the East Bay Municipal Utility District .
Both the governor and Democratic and Republican leaders have a self - imposed deadline of midnight Friday to reach a water deal , which McLear said could mean an agreement could be reached between the leaders and the stakeholders .
The Legislature would then have to vote on the deal .
The Senate plans to reconvene next week , and the Assembly has yet to set a meeting date .
The governor has 30 days to act on legislation after the session 's end , which was midnight Sept. 11 , and he typically works through the bills during that time and announces his actions as he goes .
If the governor takes no action , the bills will become law without his signature , but Schwarzenegger has rarely , if ever , done that .
Only 3 bills signed
Since the end of the legislative session , Schwarzenegger has signed only three bills : deferring some payments for education to help the state 's cash crisis , reinstating money for children 's health insurance and creating a day honoring Vietnam War veterans .
Still on his desk are bills that would provide $ 400 million owed to 500 schools in the state , increase federal funding to hospitals by $ 2.3 billion and create stricter rules for mortgage lenders , among hundreds of others .
More controversial proposals include designating a day to honor slain San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and restrictions on the sale of ammunition , and a phasing out of gun shows at the Cow Palace .
The governor may already have signed or vetoed bills and is holding onto them , but his spokesman McLear said there would be no announcement until the bills are " finalized , " which means either sent back to the Legislature with a veto or to the secretary of state with a signature .
Legislative leaders also could reconvene their houses and pull all the bills back from the governor 's desk and submit them at a later date , which Steinberg said Schwarzenegger has brought up in conversations .
Both he and Bass said they would not take that action .

Cage said his role as goodwill ambassador would be ' challenging '
Hollywood film star Nicolas Cage has been given an award for his humanitarian work by the United Nations in New York .
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon presented the 45 - year - old Oscar winner with the Global Citizen of the Year award for humanitarian endeavours .
Cage has also been appointed as a UN goodwill ambassador on drugs and crime .
The star said his role would be " to shine a spotlight on the need for global justice " .
" My real life role as goodwill ambassador will certainly be even more challenging and meaningful than those I have portrayed on screen , " he added .
" Nicolas Cage 's characters have exposed us to some of the darkest aspects of human nature , " said Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime .
" Now he is championing one of the most noble - the quest for justice .
His star status and strong conviction on these issues will help us achieve security and justice for all . "
Cage , an Amnesty International advocate , has already donated $ 2 million ( Â£ 1.2 m ) to establish a fund to help former child soldiers and also led a campaign around his film , Lord of War , to raise awareness about international arms control .
One Saturday morning , on October 29 , 1966 , a massive 60 - foot - tall painting of a nude pink lady holding flowers suddenly appeared as you headed into the tunnel on Malibu Canyon Road .
As word of the massive pink lady spread , and the traffic on the highway grew to a halt , city officials decided â The Pink Lady â had to be removed .
Firefighters were called to hosing her off the rocks .
It did nât work .
Buckets of paint thinner were thrown on the rocks .
It only made her pink skin pinker .
As county officials worked on figuring out a way to remove The Pink Lady , a 31 - year - old paralegal from Northridge , a woman named Lynne Seemayer , suddenly showed up on the road and admitted that she was the artist who did the piece .
Seemayer said that she was annoyed by the graffiti that was all over the canyon wall ( â Valley Go Home â was a memorable slogan ) and so , over a 10 month period , she started to secretly climb up under the moonlight and suspended herself by ropes to remove the graffiti .
At 8 P. M. on October 28 Seemayer painted the Pink Lady using ordinary house paint .
By dawn it was done .
The Pink Lade lasted only a week .
Seemayer sued LA county for $ 1 million for the destruction of her work , and the county counter - sued for $ 28,000 in removal costs .
Since the painting was on private property , both cases were dismissed by the court .
On Thursday , November 3 , workers covered the painting with 14 gallons of brown paint .
Adrienne Kish , an astrobiologist at the UniversitÃ© Paris - Sud , is an old hand at hunting life - forms in inhospitable environments .
As a 21 - year - old intern at the Kennedy Space Center in 2001 , Kish volunteered to extract effluent from the " volume F wet trash " of space shuttle missions â food scraps , astronaut diapers , and vomit bags â to learn what kind of microbes might be growing in the muck .
She has since turned her exotic dumpster - diving into a profession .
Last summer Kish took her bacterial expertise to Svalbard , a glacier - covered archipelago midway between Norway and the North Pole , as one of 35 scientists testing instruments and protocols for upcoming Mars missions .
" We used Svalbard as an analogue for the Martian environment , " she says .
" They 're similar in many ways . "
Given that a round trip to our planetary neighbor might cost $ 10 billion , NASA wants to do as much preparation as possible .
While studying the hardy microbial life of the Arctic for clues to how and where life might exist on Mars , Kish also helped devise a strategy for selecting samples to bring home for closer examination .
If the effort succeeds , some lucky intern may someday get to sort through the wet trash of a mission to the Red Planet .

The HST appears to be a done deal for Ontario â and a big step closer to reality for British Columbia .
The House of Commons voted 253- 37 Wednesday in favour of a harmonized sales tax for the two provinces .
The Conservatives , Liberals and Bloc Quebecois supported the controversial measure , while the NDP opposed it .
Just hours earlier , the Ontario legislature passed its own legislation and B.C. is expected to follow suit early in the new year .
Using their huge majority , Premier Dalton McGuinty 's Liberals rammed through the budget bill by a vote of 56 - 29 despite objections from the opposition Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats .
Passage of the legislation means that income tax cuts for most Ontarians can kick in on Jan.
1 .
It also paves the way for the blending of the eight per cent provincial sales tax with the five per cent federal GST into one 13 per cent HST ( 12 per cent in B.C. ) as of July 1 .
That business - friendly measure will increase levies on hundreds of goods and services , including home energy costs , gasoline , legal fees , haircuts and tobacco .
Finance Minister Dwight Duncan said the tax reforms would create 600,000 new jobs over the next decade .
" Ontario must attract new business investment to create jobs and encourage economic growth , " said Duncan .
" We are modernizing the tax system so that when the global recession ends , Ontario 's economy will be more competitive and create jobs for our families and communities , " he said .
Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak said the move was a " greedy tax grab " and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the Liberals are rewarding their Bay Street friends on the backs of Main Street .
However , neither Hudak nor Horwath has pledged to repeal the HST if they take power after the 2011 election .

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Ireland âs top Roman Catholic leaders will hold talks with Pope Benedict this week to formulate the Vatican âs response to an Irish government report on a 30 - year cover - up of sexual abuse of children by priests .
Pope Benedict XVI looks on as he leads his weekly audience in Saint Peter 's Square at the Vatican December 2 , 2009 .

Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the pope and top officials would meet Cardinal Sean Brady , head of the Irish Bishops Conference , and Diarmuid Martin , the archbishop of Dublin , Friday .
The meeting was called to discuss and evaluate â the painful situation of the Church in Ireland â following the publication last month of the Murphy Commission Report .
The rank of the participants -- who will also include the Vatican ambassador to Dublin and top Vatican doctrinal officials -- effectively makes it a rare summit about the problem of sexual abuse of children in the Irish Church .
The November 26 report was the latest of several over the past eight years to expose child sex scandals around the world that have rocked the Roman Catholic Church .
It said the Church in overwhelmingly Catholic Ireland had obsessively hid such abuse until the mid-1990s .
All archbishops in charge were aware of some complaints but the Dublin archdiocese was preoccupied with protecting the reputation of the Church over and above safeguarding children âs welfare .
DECADES OF CHILD ABUSE
There was no indication from the Vatican statement about what it could do to respond to the report , which said the Church âs prominence in Irish life was one of the reasons why abuses by a minority of priests were allowed to go unchecked .
One priest admitted abusing more than 100 children .
Another said he had abused children every two weeks for over 25 years .
The revelations came six months after the release of another damning and even more graphic report about floggings , slave labor and gang rape in much of Ireland âs now defunct Church - run industrial and reform schools in the 20th century .
That report too accused state officials and police of abetting a cover-up .
The reports have further eroded a national institution whose moral authority was all - powerful for centuries .
Since the release of the Murphy Report , Irish media have reported that Dublin government officials were frustrated that the pope and the Vatican had not yet responded .
The pope has strongly condemned priestly sexual abuse during his trips to two countries hard hit by widespread scandals -- the United States and Australia .
But critics , such as victims â groups , have said the Vatican and the Church had not gone far enough in handing over suspected abusers to civil justice .
A British prisoner was able to grow cannabis in his jail cell and even decorate a four - foot plant as a Christmas tree thanks to some clueless prison guards .
Twenty - eight - year - old Mohamed Jalloh , who was serving an 8 - year sentence for supplying Class A drugs , succeeded in convincing jail staff that his cannabis crop was tomato plants .
The Sun reports that Jalloh grew his plants for at least five months and that prison officers and bosses at Verne Prison admired his botanical skills .
Jalloh âs agricultural project came to an end when a jealous prisoner reported him to authorities .
According to one source :
You could see the plants from the grounds as his cell looks on to the education department and communal outside area .
They were on show for the world to see .

WASHINGTON , DC , Nov. 10 , 2009 -- Scientists may not be able to tell a good book by its cover , but they now can tell the condition of an old book by its odor .
In a report published in the American Chemical Society 's Analytical Chemistry , a semi-monthly journal , they describe development of a new test that can measure the degradation of old books and precious historical documents on the basis of their aroma .
The non-destructive " sniff " test could help libraries and museums preserve a range of prized paper - based objects , some of which are degrading rapidly due to advancing age , the scientists say .
Matija StrliÄ and colleagues note in the new study that the well - known musty smell of an old book , as readers leaf through the pages , is the result of hundreds of so - called volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) released into the air from the paper .
" The aroma of an old book is familiar to every user of a traditional library , " the report notes .
" A combination of grassy notes with a tang of acids and a hint of vanilla over an underlying mustiness , this unmistakable smell is as much a part of the book as its contents .
It is the result of the several hundred VOCs off - gassing from paper and the object in general .
The particular blend of compounds is a result of a network of degradation pathways and is dependent on the original composition of the object including paper substrate , applied media , and binding . "
Those substances hold clues to the paper 's condition , they say .
Conventional methods for analyzing library and archival materials involve removing samples of the document and then testing them with traditional laboratory equipment .
But this approach involves damage to the document .
The new technique -- an approach called " material degradomics " -- analyzes the gases emitted by old books and documents without altering the documents themselves .
The scientists used it to " sniff " 72 historical papers from the 19th and 20th centuries .
Some of the papers contained rosin ( pine tar ) and wood fiber , which are the most rapidly degrading types of paper found in old books .
The scientists identified 15 VOCs that seem good candidates as markers to track the degradation of paper in order to optimize their preservation .
The method also could help preserve other historic artifacts , they add .

Legalization Bill in Washington State
I had missed this news earlier this week .
6 co-sponsors in the State House are introducing a bill that will legalize marijuana for adults over the age of 21 .
The bill will also utilize the existing mechanisms in place for regulating wine and hard liquor to establish a distribution system that makes our existing state run liquor stores the sole distributor .
One thing that âs not clear yet is whether there will be any limit on people growing plants for themselves .
Interesting development .
Probably not the plan I would have chosen , but this is the great thing about the states being able to try things .
If the Feds can be pushed out of the way , we can learn things from each state and the models they choose .
To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility .
Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to the Nation .
It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may , if its citizens choose , serve as a laboratory ; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country .
â Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis , 1932
Lee Rosenberg at HorsesAss has a nice discussion about the case for regulation .
Telling his people , " If you want peace , prepare for war , " and accusing the US of secretly plotting to invade and seize Venezuela 's oil reserves , Hugo Chavez announced that he intends to send 15,000 troops to his country 's border with Colombia .
The hostile move , which has inflamed diplomatic relations across the region , saw the left - wing president urge his soldiers to " defend this sacred nation called Venezuela " against what he called a creeping right - wing " empire " .
In response , Colombia said it would complain to the United Nations .
" Fellow military personnel , let 's not waste a day on our main aim : to prepare for war , and to help the people prepare for war , because it is everyone 's responsibility , " he said in a televised speech .
" We are going to train military groups , revolutionary students , employees , women ...
The best way to avoid war is preparing for it . "

The comments come amid growing tension between Mr Chavez and his neighbour 's right - wing president , Alvaro Uribe , who has close political ties to Washington and who last month signed a military co-operation pact with the US .
Under that deal , American forces will occupy seven military bases in Colombia for at least the next decade , ostensibly to fight drug traffickers who control much of the region 's cocaine trade .
However , Mr Chavez seems convinced that the move sets the stage for a sudden invasion of his homeland .
" The empire is settling right under our noses , " he told viewers of his Sunday talk show , Alo , Presidente , claiming that one of the US bases would be " 20 minutes " away from Caracas ( which is possibly the case , but only via supersonic jet ) .
" Do n't make a mistake , Mr Obama , " he warned the US president , " by ordering an attack against Venezuela by way of Colombia . "
Posturing by Mr Chavez normally causes little alarm as it has become so common .
In his televised Sunday speeches to the nation , which sometimes last several hours , he has recently railed against enemies as diverse as the Catholic church and the " bourgeois " sport of golf .
However , the recent speech is being taken more seriously , since tensions have been growing between the two nations for years and recently spilled over into violence .
A fortnight ago , the bodies of 11 Colombian men were found dumped over the border .
Aides to Mr Chavez claimed they were paramilitaries who had been killed while training to mount a coup against him .
In October , Venezuela announced that it had arrested several Colombian spies on its soil .
Two months earlier , when Bogota signed its pact with Washington , Mr Chavez announced that the " winds of war " were blowing across the region , and unveiled a series of trade tariffs against the neighbouring country , which is , in normal circumstances , one of his leading trading partners .
Against this backdrop , regional analysts are concerned at the build - up of troops on the border , saying that the smallest spark could now lead to widespread bloodletting .
Venezuela has in recent years spent more than $ 3bn ( Â£ 1.8 bn ) on weapons , leading the US Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , to warn against an " arms race " developing in the region .

Mr Chavez , who spent much of his early career in the armed forces , laid on the bellicosity in his latest speech , addressing it to " all commandants " , and delivering it in front of rows of saluting army officers .
In response President Uribe issued a statement insisting that the US presence in Colombia , which has been criticised by many other regional governments , was purely aimed at helping it fight the battle against the drug trade .
He insisted his country had no intention of attacking its neighbour .
" Colombia has not made nor will it make any bellicose move towards the international community , ( and ) even less so towards fellow Latin American nations , " he said .
" The only thing we are interested in is defeating terrorism related to drug trafficking , which has been so unfair to Colombians for so many years . "
He called for " frank dialogue " with Mr Chavez , adding , " faced with these threats of war by the government of Venezuela , the government of Colombia is considering going to the Organisation of American States and UN Security Council . "
The dispute leaves the US in a tricky position .
Washington sees Mr Uribe 's regime as a buffer against the growing number of socialist governments in the region , but there is little appetite for American troops getting caught up in a fresh foreign conflict .

WASHINGTON Â As the U.S. House prepares to vote on the most sweeping expansion of health care coverage in four decades , President Obama heads to Capitol Hill on Saturday to make a push for a bill that now has the support of powerful groups representing retirees and doctors .
Obama 's meeting with House Democrats comes on the eve of an unusual Saturday roll call and in the midst of a frenzied effort to round up the 218 votes needed to pass the legislation .
Democrats will occupy 258 House seats when Rep.-elect Bill Owens of New York is sworn before the vote , but the size and scope of the health care bill have some Democrats wavering .
Asked Thursday whether she has the votes , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said , " We will . "
On Thursday , the 1,990 - page bill was the subject of last - minute tinkering in the backrooms of Congress and raucous protests in its halls .
After an outdoor rally , opponents of the legislation went to lawmakers ' offices .
Capitol
Hill police said they arrested 12 people outside Pelosi 's office , where opponents and supporters staged dueling demonstrations .
AARP : Support given to House Democrats ' bill GOP : Health care proposal scarier than terrorism , congresswoman says SCOPE : Democrats ' measure would cover few
The legislation got important last - minute support from the nation 's largest association of retirees , AARP , and the American Medical Association .
" It 's not perfect " but " consistent enough with some of our goals to warrant support , " said AMA President James Rohack .
Obama celebrated with an impromptu appearance before White House reporters .
" I am extraordinarily pleased and grateful , " he said .
" We are closer to passing this reform bill than ever before . "
Pelosi on Thursday called the bill " historic , " and said it will provide coverage for 36 million more Americans .
The bill , which the Congressional Budget Office has said would cost more than $ 1 trillion over 10 years , requires nearly all Americans to purchase health insurance by 2013 and creates a government - run program , similar to Medicare , to compete with private insurance companies .
To help cover the costs , the legislation would impose a 5.4 % income surtax on individuals who earn more than $ 500,000 a year and married couples making more than $ 1 million .
Still under negotiation : disputes over coverage of immigrants and abortion .
House passage would represent an important milestone for the most ambitious health bill since Medicare in 1965 .
But the bill faces challenges in the Senate , where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has said he will not rush to get it done before year 's end .

A suicide bomber on a motorcycle killed at least 34 people along a busy commercial strip near Pakistan 's military headquarters Monday as the nuclear - armed South Asian nation struggled to protect its cities amid an army offensive against a remote Taliban stronghold .
The offensive was prompted by a wave of terror attacks that began in early October .

THE GREAT ZIONIST MYTH : The Palestinians never existed before modern Israel was established .
They came from other Arab lands to try to take what the Israelis had rightful claims to .
â Palestinians â pretend to the world and to themselves that they have always been there , but they are delusional and do it all merely because they hate Jews .
The following series of questions has been circulating on the internet for awhile .
It is a piece of trashy Zionist propaganda , meant to make the Palestinians look as though they never existed â a favorite Zionist fairytale .
Note the snarky â humour â and the confused cartoon faces .
I became sick of seeing these questions posted everywhere without answers , so I wrote the answers .
1 . When was the country of Palestine founded and by whom ?
The Land of Palestine was given its name by the Roman Empire .
The Arabs were already there , and the Empire named it Paleshtin ( Palestine ) after the Biblical Pelishtim ( Philistines ) .
Paleshtin = Pelishtim
The Pelishtim descended from their patriarch Pelish ; they were a sea-going people who inhabited the Mediterranean coast long before the Israelites straggled in , and were not likely Arabs ( though it âs not impossible ) .
Nonetheless , the Arabs living there in the later time of Jesus came to be called Palestinians by the Romans , and they accepted the name .
Recall that both Abraham and Isaac made permanent friendship treaties with Pelishti ( Philistine ) kings ( Genesis 21:21-34 & 26:23-31 ) â centuries later the Israelites continually tried to steal their land and warred against them .
2 . What were Palestine âs borders ?
That âs a galling question considering Israel has never declared its border , and in arrogance has changed it constantly since the very first proposal was offered by the Occupying British Empire .
The Roman borders of newly - named Palestine were political borders , set up and tended by the Roman rulers of course , just as the borders of Judea were .
And every other occupying power has decided Palestine âs borders too .
Learn a bit of history .
Palestine has always been occupied by larger empires : Hittite , Egyptian , Philistine , Babylonian , Assyrian , Greek ( all pre-Roman ) in ancient times ; and the pattern continues to this day .
The reason ?
Because it âs always been one of the most important series of ports and trading routes for the world â the gateway between East and West .
It âs a major intersection .
And it has always been occupied by super - powers who wanted to control the trade and collect all taxes .
Just like today .
Note that modern Zionists do not recognize the ancient place defined by the Roman Empire , but expect us to recognize a new place defined a few decades ago by the British ex-Empire , who the new Israelis immediately drove out after they got their country .
British troops were stationed there to quell violence â but the Israelis wanted violence , so they went to war with the British , blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem where the British troops stayed , and hung two British officers , which apparently convinced the British to leave .
From there , Israel went on to expel 700,000 Arabs from their homes , and they bulldozed entire villages into dust ( which they continue to do ) .
This is documented in Dayan âs autobiography and in many quotes by various leaders of modern Israel .
People still living today , who resided in Palestine pre-1948 , say the Arabs and Jews lived in harmony until the Zionist Ashkenazis arrived .
Since then , there has been non -stop war .
For Israelis to pretend that Palestine never existed , and that Palestinians invented themselves merely to stop the Jews and take back something from the Jews is an incredible double standard coming from white - skinned , blond - haired , blue - eyed Europeans who suddenly decided that this land of a brown - skinned indigenous people is theirs , and who came to take it with guns .
Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages .
You do not even know the names of these Arab villages , and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist , not only do the books not exist , the Arab villages are not there either .
Nahlal arose in the place of Mahlul ; Kibbutz Gvat in the place of Jibta ; Kibbutz Sarid in the place of Huneifis ; and Kefar Yehushu âa in the place of Tal al - Shuman .
There is not one single place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population .
â Moshe Dayan addressing the Technion ( Israel Institute of Technology ) in Haifa â Haâaretz , April 4 1969
3 . What was Palestine âs capital ?
4 . What were Palestine âs major cities ?
Incredibly foolish questions .
Palestine âs cities are so old they are listed in the Bible , and they were already there when the Israelites invaded .
Those cities still bear those names today .
Ashdod , Ekron , Beer - sheba , Shechem , Ashkelon , Rehoboth , Beth - El ( House of El , god of the Canaanites ) , and lots more .
How about : Kiryat - Arba â changed to Hebron by ancient Israelites , while a neighboring town now preserves the older name .
Some modern Jews know Hebron is the true ancient Kiryat - Arba and insist it is theirs
â And Joshua went up from Eglon , and all Israel with him , unto Hebron ; and they fought against it .
And they took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof , and all the souls that were therein ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but destroyed it utterly , and all the souls that were therein . â ( Joshua 10:36 - 37 )
â And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave â¦ the city of Arba the father of Anak , which city is Hebron . â ( Joshua 15:13 )
According to Genesis 14:18 , Jerusalem was originally called Salem and seemed to be quite important long before Israelites even existed .
The original Israelites had no interest in it .
Moses never mentioned the city once ; it was not holy to him .
When Joshua invaded , he did nât take Jerusalem .
Centuries later â King â David took it for strategic reasons .
Today it is holy to Jews and Christians only because the Old Testament priests desperately wanted that town as their religious center , and they made such a fuss over it in their writings .
â God âs city . â
People everywhere have fallen for the writings of these priests .
If Palestine ever had a â capital , â it was one declared by a current occupier .
Usually occupiers do nât let you have one , or if they do , you run it the way they tell you â just like today ( Abbas and the â Palestinian Authority â ) .
5 . Name at least one Palestinian â leader â before Arafat .
Just because modern Zionists pretend a people never existed and refuse to acknowledge them , does nât mean it âs the case .
In the Arab world there are local kings , sheikhs .
Many local leaders have lived , ruled , died .
The ancient Israelites noted the sheikhs of many Arab peoples ( Genesis 36 etc ) .
Who are the Jewish leaders during the diaspora ?
Where âs the list ?
Who of world Jewry speaks for all the Jews ?
No one ever .
Can you think of any time in the last 2,000 years when all the Jews of the world followed a single leader ?
Lots of Jewish leaders claim to speak for all Jews , but no one ever has .
Therefore , by the questioner âs reasoning , there has never really been a Jewish people , because they never had a single leader over all of them .
Even today , the leader of Jerusalem has no influence on the average Jew around the world .
And leading rabbis only speak for the Jews who agree with their particular reading of the Torah .
Jews in North America choose their own agendas â some include Israel some do nât .
Jews never got organized until the 20th Century , and they have yet to follow one single leader .
Schneerson ?
Rahm Emanuel ?
Goldman - Sachs ?
Name at least one leader of all the Jews ever .
King David ?
Nope .
Not even him .
Read the Bible stories .
David ignored the Northern tribes and paid all attention to the tribes of Judah and Levi .
This caused unrest which his son was able to use when he challenged his father for the throne .
Even David did nât care about , or represent , all the Israelites .
Israel does nât recognize any Palestinian leaders because it pretends they do nât exist .
Flying overhead in a helicopter to bomb a religious leader in a wheelchair ( Sheikh Ahmed Yassin ) would seem to indicate that Israel saw the man as a very real threat â a Palestinian leader who could influence vast numbers of people .
Why else would Israel so desperately need to get rid of him ?
Israel regularly kills and kidnaps Palestinian leaders and holds them in prisons indefinitely without charges .
Just because they make Palestinian leaders disappear does nât mean there are nât any .
( google Israel + Palestine + â arrest raid â â there have been countless of them )
Israel is running a smoke and mirrors show , and this questionnaire only contributes to the destruction of history .
6 . What was the language of the country of Palestine ?
Another galling question , considering the â Jews â have lost or forgotten their language ( and their Torah ) so many times .
The ancient Hebrew language that the Old Testament was written in , has nât existed since the time of its writing .
In fact , that particular Hebrew language exists mainly in the Bible and nowhere else .
According to the Bible itself , the entire Torah was lost and forgotten for hundreds of years before a priest called Hilkiah rediscovered it in the Temple Treasury ( c640 BCE , just three and a half centuries after David and Solomon ) .
King Josiah was astonished , apologized to the Lord , and immediately changed the laws of the land to adhere to the Torah .
What had they been doing in the meantime ?
They do nât say .
They forgot .
They lost the â Ark of the Covenant â too .
Forgot where they left it !
Modern Jews do nât follow the laws of the Bible .
Their New Year is supposed to be celebrated in Spring ( see Exodus Chapter 12 ) , but they celebrate it in the fall .
They do nât remember when they changed it or why .
They forgot the ancient names of the months of their year and renamed them all .
They do nât remember when they did that or why .
Only four original months are listed in the Old Testament :
â Abib ( 1st month ) â â Ex 13:4 & 23:15
â Zif â ( 2nd month ) â 1 Kings 6:1
â Ethanim â ( 7th month ) â 1 Kings 8:2
â Adar ( 12th month ) â â Ezra 6:15 / Esther 3:7,13 & 6:15 & 8:12 and more .
These names and the other eight ( whatever they were ) have all gone down a collective memory hole .
The â Masoretic Text â was a new writing of the Old Testament circa the 9th Century CE .
The ancient original scrolls were written in Consonantal Hebrew ( no vowels ) and the meaning of each sentence was determined by the reader , since words with no vowels can be interpreted to say many different things .
The original meanings had been lost ; no one remembered what certain passages meant anymore , so the Masoretes wrote a new version , which included vowels in all the words .
It was a modern Hebrew , and it froze the meanings of all the sentences , into what the Masoretes thought they meant or should mean .
It remains one of the â authoritative â versions of the Bible .
Modern Hebrew had to be created , because Ancient Hebrew had been lost â¦ somewhere .
Had there ever been a steady succession of Jewish priests , like we âre supposed to believe , none of these screw - ups would have happened .
Arabs all over the Middle East have always spoken various Arab dialects .
In fact , Hebrew derives from ancient Arabic .
Yiddish is merely a watered - down , simple - man âs version of Hebrew ( from ancient Arabic ) mixed with European languages .
Therefore , by the logic of the Palestine Quiz âs author , the Jews do nât exist .
They do nât have a single language , and the languages they call their own come from older non-Israelite sources .
Claiming that Hebrew is the Jewish language is silly .
Jews do nât speak or teach ancient Hebrew except in Torah class .
The â Hebrew â spoken today is a new version .
Even the word â Hebrew â is an Arabic word ( means : to cross over , or the one who crossed over â and refers to the travels of Abraham as he crossed the desert and the rivers Tigris and Euphrates , in his move to Canaan to start his colony ) .
Today many Jews speak the dialects of the countries where they live and do nât speak any other language .
They may learn a bit of Hebrew at sabbath school , but they forget it and do nât speak it among themselves .
Collectively , all who call themselves Jews ( regardless of what that means to them ) have lost their own â past â and lost their language so many times that there âs little reason to believe they ever had any actual connection to it .
7 . What was the prevalent religion of the â ancient country of Palestine â ?
At what time ?
Again , in ancient times , the Bible already tells .
The Great God : EL .
His son : BAâAL .
The Great Godess : ASHERAH .
Some of the Canaanites worshiped Molech â still worshiped today by a bizarre cult of rich white people who frequent an American resort called Bohemian Grove .
Since Christian and Islamic times , meaning for the last 2,000 years or so , some Palestinians have worshiped Jesus , some Allah , some Yahweh .
Let âs note that there are several Talmuds .
Judaism , the Jewish religion based on The Old Testament , was NOT followed by the ancient Israelites , nor was it even mentioned in the Old Testament .
Today there are hundreds if not thousands of interpretations of the Bible .
Judaism spans from Kabbalist to spiritual lite to harshly primitive â every version exists today as its own Jewish cult .
No two cults agree .
Neturei Karta are arch - enemies of the Kahanists .
There are â Orthodox â Jews promoting Israel , the theft of Palestinian land , and the killing of Arabs .
There are other â Orthodox â Jews railing against this .
There are Jews who say other Jews are nât Jews .
There are Jews who beat and imprison other Jews if they protest Israel âs behaviour in Palestine â they do the same to Zionist Jews if Israel decides to kick them off their settlements and they refuse to leave !
There are Jews who think ALL Jews are sweet and victimized .
There are Jews who hate Zionists and think they âre the scum of the earth .
There has never been One Jew , one Jewishness , one Jewish behaviour .
Although Jews refer to their time in Spain as the Golden Age of Jewry , they always neglect to mention that they were happiest under Muslim rule .
Not only have they NOT been historically persecuted by Muslims , the opposite is actually true .
Jews have always flourished in Islamic countries , and have never been deprived by them of their religion .
Christians , however , have not been so lenient with them .
Do you know why the Iranian Jewish population shrunk from 88,000 in 1975 to 26,000 by 1980 ?
Many Jews feared they would be oppressed , even killed by the Ayatollah âs new Islamic government ( 1979 ) , and so 62,000 of them fled !
They ran !
Some people like to imagine that the Jews were driven out , but that âs not the case .
26,000 stayed and never regretted it .
They are happy there and have absolutely no desire to leave .
They practice their religion openly and with pride , are respected by Iranians as members of a very ancient sect , and are guaranteed representation in the Iranian government .
But can you tell me : what was the religion of the ancient Israelites ?
According to the Books of Samuel and Kings , it changed constantly from the time of the Israelite takeover ( under Joshua ) right up until the story ends with Ezra 600 years later .
The Levites in Jerusalem regularly tried to force their Yahweh religion on the rest of the tribes , with the tribe of Judah supplying their might .
Their success rate was terrible .
They never made a dent in the ten Northern tribes .
In fact , they were persona non -grata .
Their prophets Elijah and Elisha were rejected and driven out .
The Southern religion of the Levites was totally rejected by the ten Northern tribes , and even the Southern tribes of Judah and Simeon at various times ignored these priests .
A couple of kings , like Hezekiah and Solomon , gave the Levites important positions in their government , but still allowed the people to set up private shrines around the country , to whomever they wanted .
Shrines to all kinds of gods were built , even by Solomon himself .
During those times , the Levites found themselves powerless , and they squealed and brayed about how God was furious about it .
Only David and Josiah were totally pro-Levite .
They tore down all shrines and made worship of Yahweh under the Levites at the temple , the only legal religion in the land .
At those times , the Levites ruled the rest of the Israelites , who had to follow their god and bring them animals and cash .
This always had to be enforced by the kings .
But only those two kings ( David & Josiah ) ever allowed the Levites all the power they wanted , which God said they should have .
All over â Israel â , Israelites of every tribe ignored these guys .
As soon as any Levite - supported kings died , the people reverted away from the Levites and set up their private shrines again .
The ancient â Jewish â people had no consistent religion .
The Levite control , and worship of Yahweh , ordered by God himself , was only in place for a very few years , in a very small area , out of five centuries of Israelite occupation of the ancient Middle East .
After Ezra ( c500 BCE ) , Rabbinical Judaism was invented â no rabbinical writings exist earlier than him â and then the tribe of Judah had their own invention â thousands upon thousands of interpretations of what the Old Testament actually means , applied to every word , sentence , paragraph â creating millions of ideas that are not written anywhere in the Bible â¦ all invented by the tribe of Judah , to interpret a bunch of old Levite writings and take control of the Israelite flocks .
So what was the ancient religion of the Jews ?
The fact that the Levites wrote a book about how their religion is the one sanctioned by god , did nât seem to have much effect on the ancient Israelites , nor does it influence modern Judaism .
Only one ancient tribe followed them , Judah , and only sometimes ; and modern Jews have their own religion which ignores the Levite agenda completely .
Does nât the Bible say that when the Southern tribes ( Jerusalem ) went bad â strayed away from the Levite priests â they were even worse than the Northern tribes ?
Did nât the tribe of Judah sacrifice their children in the valley of Gehenna ?
The religion of Judaism can be so many things , depending on which set of interpretations your rabbi favours .
Kahanist ?
Reform ?
Both Judaism .
Two opposite sets of beliefs , among thousands .
What was ever the religion of all the Jews ?
8 . What was the name of Palestine âs currency ?
Palestine âs currency under the Ottoman Empire before 1844 was the Turkish â kurus . â
From 1844 to 1918 it was the Turkish lira .
The Turkish lira continued to be used .
From 1918 to 1927 it coexisted alongside the Egyptian pound .
Then the Palestinian pound was used with the Turkish lira until 1952 .
At that point Israel started mucking everything up .
Today , using guns , tanks , bombs , checkpoints , helicopters , gunboats etc , Israel prevents Palestine from having any money at all .
Nothing is allowed to go in or out .
All financial aid is stopped and confiscated by Israel ; no trade is permitted .
And what have been the currencies of the Jews as they âve moved through the doors of so many countries ?
Obviously , they used the currencies of their host countries , right ?
Does this mean the Jews never really existed because they never had their own currency ?
The â shekel of the Temple â of 3,000 years ago hardly counts .
Even the Israelite priests screwed their own people out of belongings and cash by claiming only priests could evaluate property and set taxes ( which were paid to the priests ) .
The value of the shekel itself was ever - changing .
When you offered a gift to the temple but the Temple did nât need it , the priests would evaluate it and you âd have to pay them what they asked in cash instead .
If they bought something from you , they would tell you what it was worth .
If you bought something from them , they not only decided what it was worth , they could inflate or depress the value of the shekel itself .
It was all up to them .
So , can you give details about ancient Jewish currencies that prove some kind of independence and solidarity throughout the ages ?
Can you show me a single Jewish currency that has been used by Jews everywhere , at any time since the diaspora began 2,000 years ago ?
9 . Choose any date in history and tell what was the approximate exchange rate of the â Palestinian â monetary unit against the US dollar , German mark , GB Pound , Japanese yen , or Chinese yuan on that date .
You say â any date in history â but you talk about the US dollar .
I previously answered about the Palestinian currencies in recent times .
I âm sure you can find the exchange rates yourself .
Do you suppose no one ever imported goods into Palestine before European Jews arrived in the 20th Century and taught Arabs how to do it ?
The Bible says in 1900 BCE , four thousand years ago , Joseph was sold to an Arab merchant caravan traveling through Palestine to Egypt .
Do you really believe Arabs were taught how to buy , sell and trade things by modern European Jews ?
And that they never heard of , or thought of money before ?
How did they â and the rest of the world â manage to survive all these millennia without the life - saving help of modern Zionists ?
So tell us , at any point in history prior to 1948 , what was the exchange rate of the â Jewish â monetary unit against the dollar .
If you ca nât provide one , then , by your logic , Jews never existed until 1948 .
10 .
Since there is no such country as â Palestine â today , what caused its demise and when did it occur ?
Since there has been a country by the name of Palestine since the time of the Roman Empire , we can easily see that its demise began in the 20th Century with the arrival of European Ashkenazi Jews and their firepower .
Said demise has nât been completed ; they have nât yet killed all the non-Israelites , as the Bible instructs them to .
â When Yahweh your God brings you into the land which you are entering to take possession of it , and clears away many nations before you â¦ and when Yahweh your God gives them over to you , and you defeat them ; then you must utterly destroy them ; you shall make no covenant with them , and show no mercy to them .
You shall not make marriages with them , giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons .
For they would turn away your sons from following me , to serve other gods ; then the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you , and he would destroy you quickly . â
( Deuteronomy 7:1-4 )
By the way , according to the Bible and archaeology , the Canaanites , Amorites , Jebusites , Hittites , Horites , Philistines , and many more , were in Canaan long before the ancient Israelites who appear ( archaeologically ) c1150 BCE .
Arabs and Canaanites are from the same tree .
European Jews are not .
Ancient Israel was invaded and taken by violence .
Modern Israel was invaded and taken by violence .
In fact , it is arguable that the modern â State of Israel â has never existed .
The â government â has no written Constitution and makes whatever laws it wants to .
Having no Constitution , it has never had a Social Contract with its people .
The demand to the UN for recognition of Israel âs Independence was served by twenty - six men who had no written agreement with their people ; no set of laws â no written notice that these men spoke for all people within the borders and could negotiate as they fancied .
They had nothing that could ever or has ever been ratified â voted into existence by the people of this new country .
Their â declaration of independence â was a flowery bit of prose about Israel âs plans to be a great democracy concerned for the rights of all humans !
But there is no â We the people â present .
Unratified , this â independence â does nât even belong to the Israelis , since they âve never signed it !
It is the property of the men who negotiated the deal â curiously , a deal that the UN has not made with anyone else .
Did you know that the word Is - ra-el is cobbled from the names of ancient non-Jewish gods : Egyptian : Isis and Ra = IS RA ; and Canaanite : EL .
IS - RA -EL .
So what is Israel , or its god , or its religion , really ?
All derived from other older things , while pretending to be original .
Built on stolen towns .
11 . Why did the Palestinians never try to become independent until after the devastating defeat of invading Arab states in the 1967 Six - Day War ?
See the answer # 2 .
Followed by this :
The PLO started in 1964 , not after the Israeli invasion of 1967 .
Palestinians have been forced by an illegal occupation to fight for their land .
Their way of life has been shattered , walled in , and by attrition Israel hopes to eventually make them all disappear .
The astounding statement , heard constantly from Zionists , is that â Arabs want to push Israel into the sea â â but a glance at the map of Israel and its border expansion since 1948 , you can see that in fact it is Palestine that is gradually disappearing â being pushed into the sea .
In the face of this , Palestinians have been forced to go into world - politics in order to get back what has been stolen from them .
They are forced to go â independent â and be recognized on the world political stage as a â country â because otherwise Israel will disappear them .
They would nât have bothered otherwise , and why should they ?
They live in a giant intersection where trade has flowed for millennia .
No one settles there and says , â This is all mine .
I control it all now â unless they are an Empire .
Ancient Israel tried to take Gaza from the Philistines .
They could nât get close .
Moshe Dayan was ordered to get modern Gaza from the Palestinians .
Gaza still wo nât give it up .
And no way should they !
12 Bonus Question : How Ridiculous Is This ?
Let âs have a look at the original contract signed by Abraham and his god , which ensured that all the Middle East would belong to his family .
Note in this Bible excerpt that Abe âs birthplace is referred to as â Ur of the Chaldeans . â
Ur was the ancient ( 3500 BCE ) main city of the Land of Sumeria .
But the â Chaldeans â ( sometimes Chaldees ) were the Chaldean priests of Babylon c600 BCE when the Jews were in exile .
The Israelite priests hated all other religions , their gods , and their practices .
We see a priest writing here , referring not to the land of Sumeria ( which would be the correct reference to go with the city of Ur ) ; neither to the land of Babylon ( the proper name of the place the priest was currently in exile ) ; but instead to the priests of that land , the â Chaldees â at the time of his exile , exposing that this vignette was written by a Levite around 600 BCE .
This story of Abraham âs contract , however , takes place around 2000 BCE .
â And He said unto him , â I am the Lord that brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give you this land to inherit it . â
And he said , â Lord God , how shall I know that I shall inherit it ? â
And He said unto him , â Take me a heifer of three years old , and a female goat of three years old , and a ram of three years old , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon . â
And he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst [ cut them each in half ] , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds he did nât divide .
And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses , Abram drove them away .
And when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and , lo , a horror of great darkness fell upon him .
And He said unto Abram , â Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ;
And also that nation , whom they shall serve , will I judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full . â
And it came to pass , that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold a smoking furnace , and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces .
In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram , saying , â Unto thy seed have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river , the river Euphrates â¦ â ( Genesis Ch 15:7 - 18 )
Four thousand years ago , Abraham killed some animals and cut them in half .
He laid the halves beside each other on the ground and chased away vultures .
Then he passed out .
Abraham had the horrors while he slept , and God spoke to him and promised him he could own this land of Canaan .
Then a burning lamp hovered in the dark above the split animal parts laying on the ground near him .
Because of this , white European followers of Judaism profess that they have ownership rights to the Middle East .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A disbarred Florida lawyer accused by the FBI of running a $ 1 billion investment scam is expected to be arrested Tuesday on racketeering conspiracy charges , The Miami Herald reported .
Scott Rothstein , who fled to Morocco in late October but returned to Florida in early November , is expected to appear before a federal magistrate in Fort Lauderdale to face the charges , the newspaper said in its online edition .
It cited unidentified sources familiar with the case .
Rothstein has not directly addressed the accusations , though he has said previously that he would do all in his power â to make sure that every single penny is recovered â for those who invested with him .
He has not said how that would happen .
Prosecutors are using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act to charge Rothstein and possibly others , the newspaper said .
The conspiracy law is often used to prosecute members of organized crime , drug lords and others accused of running criminal enterprises .
Rothstein , who was disbarred last week by the Florida Supreme Court , is accused of mail , wire and bank fraud , along with money laundering , the Herald said .
He faces at least 20 years in prison and forfeiture of tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits if convicted .
The FBI said in November that Rothstein , 47 , was suspected of running an elaborate Ponzi scheme that bilked investors out of more than $ 1 billion .
Court documents said he had been selling nonexistent legal settlements to unsuspecting investors since at least 2005 , using new investor money to pay previous investors in the classic Ponzi scheme model .
FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents raided his Fort Lauderdale law office and seized his waterfront home , yacht and other assets in Florida and elsewhere .
The Herald said federal prosecutors would ask a grand jury to consider criminal charges against Rothstein âs alleged co-conspirators , possibly including former employees of his now - defunct firm .
Rothstein , a frequent contributor to political campaigns who was often photographed with politicians , had a lavish lifestyle with opulent homes and a fleet of foreign sports cars .
He used his connections and charm to lure wealthy friends and patrons to invest with him .

The end of each year is usually the period for making analyses of the past year , of forecasts for the next and of numerous comments and surveys .
However , this year is different because beside marking the end of 2009 , in just couple of days we will celebrate the end of the first decade of the 21st century .
And those , inarguably , were 10 years , loaded up with many expectations and that many disappointments from the EU .
In this regard Hugo Brady from the Centre for European Reform - a non-governmental research institute based in London , wrote an essay , entitled " The EU must learn from its mistakes over the past decade " .
Yet in the very first sentence of the essay he writes that the EU needs new thinking because after 8 years of stop - start negotiations , the Union finally has a new rulebook , the Lisbon treaty , which entered into force on the 1st of December .
The member - states are waiting for a new European Commission and a new European Council president to take office early next year .
But , in spite of the shared anxieties about the economic growth , government debt , the stability of the euro , immigration and the environment , there is not yet a clear sense of what the EU 's priorities for the next five years should or will be .
Further on Hugo Brady writes that given the global recession , many assume that the EU 's next ' big idea ' will have an economic focus .
Mario Monti , a former competition commissioner , has already proposed that EU countries should quicken their recovery from the crisis by opening up trade in services in exchange for a deal on harmonising tax bases .
Others expect a new initiative on climate change â like a European carbon bank â or tighter rules on deficit spending to prevent the risk of default in the euro area .
However , to make all this happen , it is necessary the EU to consider carefully the Union 's mistakes and failures over the last ten years .
Mr. Brady lists the successes of the Union in just one sentence : it successfully rolled out a single currency , expanded to 27 members , established the world 's first functioning carbon trading scheme , deployed its first military missions and agreed a common arrest warrant to tackle cross - border crime .
Instead , the failures seem to be much more and among them the name of Bulgaria is also mentioned :
- The EU spent most of the decade following the will o' the wisp of a grand constitution , to the detriment of its reputation both within the Union and in the outside world ( details of the entering into force of the Lisbon Treaty ) ;
- The premature accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Union in 2007 damaged the credibility of EU enlargement , due to persistent problems with corruption and organised crime in these countries .
Now that they are full EU members , reform of public administration and the judiciary has slowed ( an outside and impartial analysis of the first year of Bulgaria 's EU membership you could read on euinside here and an internal estimation you could see here ) ;
- The EU made a similar error in allowing the accession of Cyprus in 2004 .
In doing so , the member - states removed probably the only international leverage that could have helped to push the island 's territorial conflict to resolution .
Since then the Cypriot government has unabashedly used its EU veto to complicate the Union 's ties with Turkey and NATO .
Both of those relationships are critical for the Union 's geopolitical standing ;
- The EU spent most of the decade trying to convince key global players like the US or China to believe that it is an emerging actor in a multipolar world .
Yet it has been unable to overcome internal divisions over its relations with Russia , energy policy and reform of European representation in international organisations ( where the EU is still represented by separate member states like in the G20 , the UN , WTO , etc ) .
Even the Union 's jealously guarded image as a global leader on climate change is exaggerated ( the final deal at the Copenhagen climate change summit was crafted in the absence of the EU ) .
Unless the member - states find a way of summoning the political will to forge common positions on sensitive issues like , for example , how to handle meeting the Dalai Lama , the Europeans will continue to play ping pong while the rest of the world plays chess , Hugo Brady writes ;
- The EU was wrong to lump together its external policies towards non-EU countries in the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe in the so - called European neighbourhood policy .
Within a few years that policy error had to be tacitly acknowledged with the decision to create both a ' Union for the Mediterranean ' and an ' Eastern Partnership ' .
But both these initiatives still suffer from a lack of substance ( you can read more about the Eastern Partnership here ) ;
- With the above the failures do not end .
The hardly achieved compromise in 2005 for the " services directive " was a missed opportunity to boost intra-European trade in services and thus help complete the single market .
If the EU had been able to agree on something like the original ' Bolkestein directive ' ( after the name of a Dutch commissioner ) â before member - states and the European Parliament watered it down â the ability of the eurozone to withstand economic shocks like the current recession would have been greatly strengthened ;
- Also in 2005 the member - states failed to find the political courage to reform the EU 's budget and have so far reneged on a commitment to engage in a serious review of how the Union 's annual expenditure of â¬ 120 billion should best be allocated .
At the moment expenditures , revenues and procedures are all inconsistent with the present and future state of EU integration ( more on the topic of the EU budget for 2007 - 2013 and how the compromise has been reached , you can read on euinside here ) ;
- And another , this type purely institutional failure - the EU's Court of Auditors declined to sign off its accounts at any point throughout the decade , mostly due to irregularities in how funds are dispersed within the member - states .
This , plus a number of scandals over expenses paid to MEPs , have damaged the EU 's credibility with taxpayers .
Any future increase in the size of the EU 's budget would be politically untenable without demonstrable reform .
In the end Hugo Brady concludes his analysis of the first decade of the EU in the 21st century by quoting the eminent Europeanist Ralf Dahrendorf from his essay , written in ... 1996 : " All too often , today 's European Union forces its supporters to apologise for its strange ways : towards democrats for its bureaucratic opaqueness , towards free traders for its protectionism , towards applicants for membership for its apparent lack of a sense of urgency , and towards trading partners elsewhere , notably in the poorer parts of the world , for its crude and at times destructive pursuit of self interest .
If such apologies continue to be necessary , support will wane and eventually vanish .
European reform is imperative if the European Union is to survive " .
As the euinside has written many times , finding the above mentioned political will is impossible when the level of political , economic , social and civil development among member states is so different .
This feeds further the tendencies of some member states to seize European power to protect their own interests .
In fact , such tendencies appeared quite clearly during the election of the first in European history permanent president of the European council - the Belgian premier Herman van Rompuy and the first foreign minister of the Union - the British Lady Catherine Ashton .
The selection of fields of the European commissioners , provoked by the lack of possibility for the European Commission president to select his own team , is also a proof of the differences among member states - the new commissioners are so different in terms of biography , education , institutional experience and fields , that it might not be impossible the European Commission to lose a large part of its leading role in European politics so far .
In other words , it might be a good news that after almost 10 years of search of the most appropriate institutional treaty which could make the EU a stronger global player , we finally have the Lisbon Treaty into force .
Instead , the too many compromises made the treaty something very similar to handicapped horse .
And since the EU will hardly find strength and will to integrate even further , the next decade will probably be vital of the Eu and its future in general .
One of the ne-er - do - wells from the C Street Group House , former Rep. Chip Pickering ( R - MS ) is under investigation for assaulting an opposing team âs youth league soccer coach after what I suppose must have been a particularly intense game .
In a nice extra touch , the unfortunate soccer coach was allegedly already wearing a neck brace when Pickering got all pro wrestling on him .
Pickering was last in the news after his wife accused him of adultery and sued him and his mistress for â alienation of affection â â not unlike fellow C Streeters Sen. John Ensign and Gov. Mark Sanford .

I have a foolproof scheme for cutting crime in Britain .
It would slash court overcrowding , rescue legal aid , empty prisons and calm public fears .
It would save billions of pounds , and all without endangering a hair on a single Briton 's head .
The scheme involves removing thousands of recently " invented " offences from the statute book .
This will not happen , because if there is one thing a macho politician loves , it is declaring any social problem or public disobedience a crime , and hiring more police to confront it .
Constantly extending criminality enables prime ministers and home secretaries to walk tall down Main Street , pistols twirling in their fingers , and with no care for who gets hurt .
In a little - reported case at Oxford crown court on Monday , a 60 - year - old businessman named Philip Bowles , with no previous conviction , found himself jailed for supposedly switching a VAT liability between two companies .
He bitterly protested that he was unable to mount an effective defence because his cash had been seized in advance from his office , as an " asset " under David Blunkett 's crass Proceeds of Crime Act .
In addition his tax records had been taken by administrators .
Bowles was refused legal aid to get a forensic accountant to exhume his seized records , which he thus could not use to defend himself .
After his conviction , an independent financial report into the tax records was submitted to the court but the judge was clearly confused at the sentencing .
He admitted that the documents might have exonerated Bowles and implied that there was a case for the jury decision being overturned on appeal .
He said he was " loth to put a man in prison if he should n't be there " , yet added that the whole thing had " dragged on " .
So he called Bowles a " very serious cheat " , banged him up for three and a half years and demanded he pay Â£ 130,000 in prosecution costs .
To all appearances , a gross injustice has been done to lift a large sum of money from a man carefully rendered defenceless by the authorities to enrich their budgets .
Since the pointless , life - destroying jail term could cost the state as much as Â£ 140,000 , the whole farrago will leave the taxpayer worse off than if Bowles and Revenue & Customs had been left to squabble before an arbitrator .
Another crime is added to the statistics , and work is created for all .
Only the Americans among civilised democracies love prisons more than the British .
For imprisonment Britain leads Europe , jailing convicts for non-violent crimes that most countries handle with non-custodial sentences , or do not regard as crimes at all .
Thousands of British offences are for the " crime " of not obeying a government official .
Last month a Swansea man was jailed for two and a half years for peeping at naked women on holiday .
In October a Newcastle man was jailed for 18 months for letting a toddler smoke a cigarette .
A postman was jailed for four months for failing to deliver letters after being late for work .
A student narrowly escaped jail for drunkenly urinating on a war memorial .
There is a move , led by the children 's secretary , Ed Balls , that could lead to people being jailed for lying about their residence in a school catchment area .
It is only a matter of time before someone is jailed for taking a friend 's child on a school trip without state clearance , under the Stasi - like Independent Safeguarding Authority .
Meanwhile Home Office arrest and conviction targets put constant pressure on the police to pursue such ubiquitous offences as bad driving or drug use .
The iron route to understanding the modern state is to follow the money flow to the professions .
Advocates for restorative justice point out that most victims of minor crime brought face to face with offenders do not want them to go to jail .
They want an apology and financial restitution .
But since restorative justice offers no financial gain to the justice system in Britain , it is not financed , any more than is proper drug rehabilitation .
The Labour government under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has been more obsessed with imprisonment than any predecessor .
Martin Narey , when he led the prison service , complained that in the mid-1990s just 5 % of shoplifters were sent to prison .
Under Blair this rose fourfold .
The number of over - 50s entering the criminal justice system rose by almost 50 % in eight years , largely through the police filling targets by chasing vehicle crime .
Every category saw an increase in the proportion of convictions leading to custody .
Labour has created more than 3,000 new offences since 1997 , of which 1,472 at the last count were imprisonable .
You can go to jail in Britain for not having a licence for a church concert , smoking in a public place , selling a grey squirrel , trans - shipping unlicensed fish , or disobeying a health and safety inspector .
In many cases a prison sentence is casually tacked on the end of a statute , like some macho cherry on a cake .
Parliamentarians , judges , lawyers , prison officers all complain of overwork â but complain all the way to the bank .
An intriguing insight into this process is given in a batch of cases now before the US supreme court , challenging the " over- criminalisation " of American society .
The most prominent is the appeal of the press baron , Conrad Black , against conviction for denying his shareholders his " honest services " .
This catch - all " default offence " is like tax evasion , a gift to federal prosecutors .
Questioning by the court 's justices suggests a growing desire to bring this explosion of state power under eventual control .
One of them , Stephen Breyer , told the US attorney general with reference to Black 's honest services : " There are 150 million workers in the United States .
I think possibly 147 million would flunk your test . "
The smart money is on Black getting off .
The case is one of those championed by an intriguing coalition of lobbyists whose like is not seen in Britain .
It embraces both left and right of the political spectrum under a libertarian banner .
Defence lawyers and the American Civil Liberties Union are allied to the conservative Cato Institute and Heritage Foundation .
A fellow at the latter , Reagan 's attorney general , Ed Meese , has drawn a line at 4,000 federal crimes , pointing out that the US tradition " has always been to construe criminal laws narrowly to protect people from the power of the state " .
The left 's objection to the size of the US prison population thus chimes with taxpayers protesting its cost .
The New York Times reports that constitutionalists are demanding protection for states from federal laws ; property interests object to the arbitrary seizure of " proceeds of crime " ; libertarians claim the honest - service law is so vague that " all Americans violate it every day " , even rightwing Christians want some scope for sinners ' redemption .
To sociologists , the " reconceptualising of social problems as crimes " raises foolish hopes of curing them through the law .
With Labour now leading the imprisonment lobby and David Cameron terrified of being called a hoodie- hugger , the chance of a libertarian coalition in Britain is minimal .
State power still has all the best tunes .
But those who regard the public realm in Britain as over - criminalised , and the imprisonment rate a social abomination , see a new dawn across the Atlantic .
Who would have guessed its harbinger would be a certain Conrad Black ?
Kieron Williamson kneels on the wooden bench in his small kitchen , takes a pastel from the box by his side and rubs it on to a piece of paper .
" Have you got a picture in your head of what you 're going to do ? " asks his mother , Michelle .
" Yep , " Kieron nods .
" A snow scene . "
Because it is winter at the moment , I ask .
" Yep . "
Do you know how you want it to come out ?
" Yep . "
And does it come out how you want it to ?
" Sometimes it does . "
Like many great artists , small boys are not often renowned for their loquaciousness .
While Kieron Williamson is a very normal seven - year - old who uses his words sparingly , what slowly emerges on the small rectangle of paper in his kitchen is extraordinarily eloquent .
This month , Kieron 's second exhibition in a gallery in his home town of Holt , Norfolk , sold out in 14 minutes .
The sale of 16 new paintings swelled his bank account by Â£ 18,200 .
There are now 680 people on a waiting list for a Kieron original .
Art lovers have driven from London to buy his work .
Agents buzz around the town .
People offer to buy his schoolbooks .
The starting price for a simple pastel picture like the one Kieron is sketching ?
Â£ 900 .
Kieron lives with his dad Keith , a former electrician , his mum , who is training to be a nutritionist , and Billie - Jo , his little sister , in a small flat overlooking a petrol station .
When I arrive on a Saturday afternoon , Kieron and Keith are out .
When Kieron returns in football socks and shorts , I assume he has been playing football .
But no , he has been replenishing his stock of pastels in Holt , a chichi little place where even the chip shop has grainy portraits for sale on its walls .

From Jan Lievens to Millais , there have been plenty of precocious geniuses in the art world .
Excitable press coverage has compared Kieron to Picasso , who painted his first canvas , The Picador , aged eight .
" We do n't know who Picasso is really , " says Keith .
" I know who Picasso is , " interrupts Kieron .
" I do n't want to become Picasso . "
Who would he like to become ?
" Monet or Edward Seago , " he says .
These days , however , we are often suspicious of child prodigies .
We wonder if it is all their own work , or whether their pushy parents have hot - housed them .
People who do n't know the Williamsons might think Kieron is being cleverly marketed , particularly when they hear that Keith is now an art dealer .
The truth is far more innocent .
Two years ago , a serious accident had forced Keith to stop work and turn his hobby â collecting art â into an occupation .
The accident also stopped Keith racing around outside with his son .
Confined to a flat with no garden , surrounded by paintings and , like any small boy , probably influenced by his dad , Kieron decided to take up drawing .
Now , father and son are learning about art together .
Kieron is rubbing yellows and greys together for his sky .
" There 's some trees going straight across and then there 's a lake through the centre , " he explains .
Is this picture something you have seen or is it in your imagination ?
" I saw it on the computer and every time I do the picture it changes . " he says , handling his pastels expertly .
Keith ducks into the kitchen and explains that Kieron finds pictures he likes on the internet .
Rather than an exact copy , however , he creates his own version .
This winter scene is imagined from an image of the Norfolk Broads in summer .
Figures at Holkham by Kieron Williamson
At first , Kieron 's art was pretty much like any other five - year - old's .
But he quickly progressed and was soon asking questions that his parents could n't answer .
" Kieron wanted to know the technicalities of art and how to put a painting together , " says Michelle .
Hearing of Kieron 's promise , one local artist , Carol Ann Pennington , offered him some tips .
Since then , he has had lessons with other Norfolk - based painters , including Brian Ryder and his favourite , Tony Garner .
Garner , a professional artist , has taught more than 1,000 adults over the last few decades and Kieron , he says , is head and shoulders above everyone .
" He does n't say very much , he does n't ask very much , he just looks .
He 's a very visual learner .
If I did a picture with most students , they will copy it but Kieron is different .
He will copy it and then he will Kieronise it , " he says .
" It might be a bit naive at the moment but there 's a lovely freshness about what he does .
The confidence that this little chap has got â he just does n't see any danger . "
Garner says his parents have been brilliant at shielding Kieron from the business side and the pressure this invariably brings .
Keith and Michelle are extremely proud , and protective , and perhaps slightly in awe of their son .
They insist that Kieron only paints when he wants to .
" We judge ourselves every day , wondering whether we are making the right choices , " says Michelle .
" Kieron is such a strong character you would n't get him to do anything he did n't want to do anyway .
It 's a hobby .
Some could argue he 's got such a talent , why are n't we doing more for him in terms of touring galleries every weekend .
We are a family and we 've got Billie - Jo to consider ; you 've got to strike a balance . "
Boat at half way house by Kieron Williamson
With all the people wanting paintings , I ask Kieron if he feels he has to do them .
He says no .
So you only paint when you want to ?
" Yep . "
Do you have days when you feel you do n't want to paint ?
" Yep . "
So you only do it when you 're in the mood ?
" Yep . "
How many paintings or drawings do you do each week ?
One or two ?
" About six . "
Is he a perfectionist ?
" You 've got a bit of an artist 's temperament , have n't you ? " says Michelle , softly , as Kieron continues wielding his pastels .
" You get really frustrated if it does n't work out .
You punched a hole in the canvas once , did n't you ? "
That was rare .
Sometimes , however , Kieron will produce " what we classify as a bag of trosh , " says Michelle .
" He 's just got to go through the motions .
It 's almost as if it 's a release .
It 's difficult to explain â it's the process that he enjoys , because there are days when he is not really focused on his work but he just enjoys doing it . "
Sometimes , when they have taken Kieron out on painting trips in the countryside , the little boy has had other ideas : he has gone off and played in the mud or a stream .
He is still allowed to be seven years old .
What do his school friends think ?
Are they impressed ?
" Yep . "
A few Â­ moments later , Kieron pauses .
" I am also top of the class in maths , English , geography and science , " he says carefully , rubbing the sky in his picture .
Kieron explains he is sticking to landscapes for now but plans to paint a portrait of his 98 - year - old nan when she turns 100 .
What does he think about people spending so much money on his paintings ?
" Really good . "
Would he like to be a professional painter ?
" Yep . "
So he does n't want to be a footballer when he is older ?
" I want to be a footballer and a painter . "
Kieron enjoys playing football and , like his dad , supports Leeds United ( " I have n't ever pushed him into it , " says Keith quickly ) .
What other things does Kieron like doing ?
" You played on the Xbox but then you got bored of it did n't you ? " says Keith .
" You said I could have it out when Christmas comes , " says Kieron .
" You can have it out in the holidays , " promises Michelle .
" He 's a bit all - or - nothing with whatever he does , like the artwork .
You have to pull the reins in a bit because otherwise he'd be up all night . "
What would his parents say if Kieron turned around and told them he was not going to paint any more ?
" Leave him to it .
As long as he 's happy .
At the end of the day , he 's at his happiest painting , " says Keith .
" It 's entirely his choice , " says Michelle .
" We do n't know what 's around the corner .
Kieron might decide to put his boxes away and football might take over and that would be entirely his choice .
We 're feeling slightly under pressure at the moment because there is such a waiting list of people wanting Kieron 's work , but I 'm inclined to tell them to wait , really . "
I doubt many artists could paint or draw while answering questions and being photographed but Kieron carries on .
When he finishes , we lean over to look .
" Not bad .
That 's nice , " says Keith , who can't watch Kieron at work ; I wonder if it is because he is worried about his son making a mistake but Keith says he just prefers to see the finished article .
" Is it as good as the one I did this morning or better ? " asks Kieron .
" What do you think ? " replies Keith .
" It 's got a nice glow on it , has n't it ? "
Kieron nods .
I would love one of his pictures but , I tell Kieron , he is already too expensive for me .
" I can price one down for you , " he says , as quick as a flash .
No , no , I could n't , I say , worried I would be exploiting a little boy who is eager to please .
I thank him for his time and hand him my business card .
And Kieron trots into his bedroom , comes out with his business card and says thank you back .
Kieron 's tips for landscape painting
1 " Go on holiday to where you really want to go , and be inspired . "
2 " Start with acrylics , then watercolours , then pastels and then oils "
3 When you set out to do a landscape , " start with the sky first , top to bottom . "
4 " When you do distance , it 's lighter , and when you do foreground it comes darker . "
5 " If you 're doing a figure in the winter , do a brown head , leave a small gap , do a blue jacket and brown legs .
Then with the gap get a red pastel and do a flick of red so it looks like a scarf . "
6 " Keep on painting . "

BBC News , Islamabad
Robbers have stolen at least $ 3.7 m from a bank in Karachi , in what is being called Pakistan 's biggest bank heist .
The robbery took place at the main branch of Allied Bank , one of Pakistan 's largest banks , less than 100 metres from city police headquarters .
Police say the gang was led by one of the bank 's guards .
The robbers broke into the main vault and stole foreign currency worth 311 m rupees ( $ 3.7 m ) .
Police have launched an investigation , but have so far made no arrests .
' Tied staff up '
The Allied bank branch is located on Karachi's II Chundrigar Road , which houses the Karachi Stock Exchange and head offices of trading and financial firms operating in Pakistan .
Police believe the robbers ' leader worked for a private security agency and was employed at the branch using a fake identity .
Officials say he arrived early for his shift on Monday and was joined minutes later by his accomplices .
" The men tied up the few staff present at the time , and then used acetylene gas cutters to break into the main vault , " police said .
The gang then made off with dollars , euros and pounds stored inside the vault .
There were about a dozen bank robberies in Karachi in 2009 , although none approached this one for sophistication and planning .
Most were hit - and - run raids on armoured cars or foreign currency exchange companies .
The last bank robbery in Pakistan in which more than 100 m rupees was stolen was in 2007 when two security guards stole 160 m rupees at gunpoint from a foreign currency exchange company in Karachi .
Several recent bank robberies in Pakistan 's financial capital have been traced to the Taliban .
Police will be looking for any connection between the robbers in this latest case and militants active in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Obama demands security overhaul into syringe bomb fiasco as it emerges Al Qaeda had warned of terror attack just six days ago
Al Qaeda warned of fresh terror attack on December 21
New security measures will mean increased delays at airport
President Obama orders review of airline security
Alleged bomber was on security database but was n't considered threat
Student suspect was barred from Britain
A still from an internet video posted online on December 21 , showing a man who calls himself Mohammed al - Kalwi ( right ) , warning of a new terror attack
President Obama ordered an urgent review of airline security tonight , demanding to know how a former British student identified as a terror risk was allowed to board transatlantic plane before attempting to blow it up .
The move came as a second incident on a plane at the same airport caused a major security scare .
A man was removed from the flight after becoming verbally disruptive on landing .
It later transpired he posed no security risk .
Tonight it also emerged that Al Qaeda had warned of a terror attack just days before the attempt to bring down the jet carrying 278 passengers .
In a chilling video posted on an extremist internet on December 21 , a bearded man in head - dress warned : ' We are carrying a bomb to hit the enemies of God . '
The man , identified as Mohammed al - Kalwi , continued : ' O soldiers , you should learn that we do not want to fight you , nor do we have an issue with you .
We only have an issue with America and its agents , and beware of standing in the ranks of America .
Tonight there were question marks over why known radical Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was allowed to evade security , as it became clear just how close he came to downing the jet .
Even his millionaire father had warned authorities that he believed his son may be a risk .
President Obama wants to know how he was allowed to board the plane and also ordered a review of security watch - lists in the US after it emerged the Nigerian was placed on a list as a terror risk .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said on American news channel NBC the President called for ' a review to ... figure out why an individual with the chemical explosive he had on him could get on a plane in Amsterdam and fly into the United States . '
Dr Umaru Abdulmutallab , the rich father of Delta plane attack suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab
It has emerged that Abdulmutallab tried to emulate convicted terrorist Richard Reid by using the same PETN high explosive the shoe bomber used in his failed airliner attack in 2001 .
After sitting silently for most of the eight - hour flight , he made his move on Christmas morning as the plane approached Detroit .
The 23 - year - old son of a wealthy Nigerian banker was charged in hospital last night with attempting to destroy the aircraft during its final approach to Detroit airport on Christmas Day , the US Justice Department said .
Four weeks ago Abdulmutallab's father told the U.S. embassy in Abuja , Nigeria , that he was concerned about his son 's religious beliefs .
This information was passed on to U.S. intelligence officials .
A page from the FBI affidavit against Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab
The alleged bomber was also on a separate U.S. terror database , but was not considered an immediate threat .
His name was absent from ' no - fly ' lists .
Abdulmutallab , who had previously been living in a luxury mansion block while studying at University College London , was also charged with with placing a destructive device on the Northwest Airlines Flight 253 .
According to an affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint , Abdulmutallab had a device attached to his body when he boarded the aircraft in Amsterdam on Christmas Eve .
As the flight was approaching Detroit Airport , he was said to have set off the device , which resulted in a fire and what appears to have been an explosion .
A preliminary FBI analysis found that it contained a high explosive known as PETN or pentaerythritol .
FBI agents were also said recovered what appeared to be the remnants of the syringe found near Abdulmutallab 's seat , which is believed to have been part of the device .
The use of small amounts of liquids and powder suggests he managed to circumvent the ban on taking all but limited quantities of liquids on to flights .
As a result , beefed - up security measures have been introduced on flights bound for the US .
They include extra body and hand luggage searches at the departure gate and a requirement that passengers remain seated for the final hour of flight .
Drama :
The moment the bomber was taken into custody , as captured on a mobile phone
Air Canada has also said that during the last hour passengers will not be allowed access to carry - on baggage or to have any items on their laps .
Passengers have been told to expect delays .
Meanwhile , the suspect 's former teacher revealed his fellow pupils nicknamed him ' The Pope ' because he was so well - liked .
But Michael Rimmer , a Briton who taught history at the British International School in Lome , Togo , says that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab also defended the Taliban during a lesson and complaining when Rimmer took classmates to a London pub .
Rimmer also revealed how Abdulmutallab had many Christian friends at the school .
In a telephone interview today , he described the school as a multicultural place where Christians students participated in Islamic feasts and Muslims often sang Christmas carols .
US attorney general Eric Holder said : ' Had this alleged plot to destroy an airplane been successful , scores of innocent people would have been killed or injured .
' We will continue to investigate this matter vigorously , and we will use all measures available to our government to ensure that anyone responsible for this attempted attack is brought to justice . '
According to the affidavit , interviews with the passengers and crew of Flight 253 revealed that before the incident Abdulmutallab went to the aircraft 's bathroom for approximately 20 minutes .
When he returned to his seat , he said that he had an upset stomach and pulled a blanket over himself .
Passengers then heard what were described as popping noises similar to firecrackers and some reported seeing Abdulmutallab 's trouser leg and the inner wall of the aircraft on fire .
Film producer Jasper Schuringa from Amsterdam was sitting in seat 20G when the device ignited .
He leapt over the back of the seat and scrambled over four other passengers to pummel Abdulmutallab .
Hero : Jasper Schuringa who tackled Abdulmutallab on Flight 253
Mr Schuringa then saw a â burning object â â which he said resembled a small , white shampoo bottle â between the student âs legs .
Mr Schuringa said : â It was smoking and there were flames coming from beneath his legs .
I pulled the object from him and tried to extinguish the fire with my hands then threw it away . â
He screamed : â Water ! Water ! â as he pulled Abdulmutallab out of his seat and dragged him to the front of the plane .
Fellow passengers poured bottles of water on the blaze , while flight attendants tackled the flames with fire extinguishers .
Mr Schuringa said Abdulmutallab seemed dazed .
â He was staring into nothing , â he said .
The producer said he then stripped off Abdulmutallab âs clothes to make sure he did not have other explosives on his body .
A crew member helped handcuff him .
He said other passengers applauded as he walked back to his seat .
â I do nât feel like a hero , â he said : â It was something that came completely naturally .
I had to do something or it would be too late .
My hands are pretty burned , but I am fine .
' I am shaken up .
I am happy to be here . â

A fellow passenger , Stephanie van Herk , 22 , who was sitting one row in front of Abdulmutallab , said she heard a loud bang , then saw a flame leap from the student âs lap as smoke filled the air .
â The flame was higher than the seat , â she said .
â Then everyone started screaming .
It was panic .
Flight attendants shouted , â What are you doing ?
What are you doing ? ââ
â They called for water and the man began pulling down his burning trousers . â
Another passenger , Melinda Dennis , said : â Abdulmutallab âs entire leg was burned .
But he did nât show any reaction to the pain . â
Abdulmutallab was to have been ' calm and lucid ' throughout the incident .
When one flight attendant asked him what he had had in his pocket , and he replied : ' explosive device . '
On landing , Abdulmutallab was taken to the University of Michigan Medical Centre for treatment to his injuries .
He will make his initial court appearance today .
US District Judge Paul Borman read out the charges to Abdulmutallab in a conference room at the medical centre where he is continuing to receive treatment for burns .
Agents brought him into the room in a wheelchair , a blanket over his lap and wearing a green hospital robe .
Abdulmutallab - who was said to have been travelling on a valid US visa - initially boarded a KLM flight in Lagos , Nigeria , before transferring to the Northwest Airlines flight at Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport .
Following his arrest he was said to have told US investigators that he had been acting on instructions from al Qaeda which instructed him to blow up an airliner over American soil .
Gordon Brown said the Government would take ' whatever action was necessary ' to protect airline passengers .
Security sources said that both the police and MI5 were diverting extra staff and resources to the investigation as a matter of priority in order to establish the significance of the ' London link ' .
They acknowledged that it was possible that Abdulmutallab may have cropped up in the peripheries of other counter - terrorism investigations .
Earlier in London , police search teams were seen entering the imposing mansion block in Mansfield Road , close to Oxford Street , where Abdulmutallab had been living .
Records showed that flats in the block sold this year for between Â£ 1.65 million and Â£ 3.15 million .
Both police and college sources confirmed that Abdulmutallab had been enrolled as a student at University College London on a course in mechanical engineering between 2005 and 2008 .
Alhaji Umaru Mutallab , a former minister and chairman of First Bank in Nigeria , also confirmed his son Umar had studied in London before going travelling .
He said he was not sure of his son's whereabouts but that he had not lived in London ' f or some time ' .
Nigeria's
This Day newspaper reported family members as saying that Abdulmutallab 's father was uncomfortable with his son's extreme Islamic views .
Mr Mutallab was said to have reported his activities to the US embassy in Abuja as well as Nigerian security agencies .
According to reports , the family claim Abdulmutallab was radicalised while attending the British International School in Lome , the capital of Togo .
Briton Michael Rimmer , who claimed to have taught the suspect , told BBC News 24 : ' I remember him talking about Afghanistan - when the Taliban were in control , he thought they were OK .
It did surprise me .'

However , a cousin of Abdulmutallab , Mohammed Mutallab , told the Sunday Telegraph that the family believed the alleged bomber had been radicalised in Britain .
A US law enforcement source said Abdulmutallab's name surfaced on at least one US intelligence database but not to the extent that he was placed on a watch list or a no - fly list .
Intelligence and anti-terrorism officials in Yemen were also investigating claims by the suspect that he picked up the explosive device and instructions on how to use it in that country .
Delays were caused at UK airports today as security was stepped up for passengers flying to the US .
Questions were raised over how the suspect was able to board the plane in Holland and almost cause catastrophe on Christmas Day .
Mr Brown said he had been contact with Sir Paul Stephenson , Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police , because of the ' serious potential threat ' .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said police were working with their American counterparts to establish the full background to the incident .
Transport Secretary Lord Adonis said delays were caused to transatlantic flights as a result of heightened security .
Although general airport security remained the same with no change to luggage and liquid restrictions , passengers travelling to the US were told they could only take one item of hand luggage .
The alleged Christmas Day terrorist had been in one of the U.S. government 's many terror databases since November after his father brought him to the attention of embassy officials in Nigeria .
However , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab came to the attention of intelligence officials months before that , according to a U.S. government official involved in the investigation .
Still , none of the information the government had on Abdulmutallab rose to the level of putting him on the official terror watch list or no - fly list .
Abdulmutallab claimed to have received training and instructions from al - Qaeda operatives in Yemen , law enforcement officials said .
He is also believed to have had Internet contact with militant Islamic radicals .
While intelligence officials said Saturday that they are taking seriously Abdulmutallab 's claims that the plot originated with al - Qaeda 's network inside Yemen , several added that they had to yet to see independent confirmation .
Four weeks ago , Abdulmutallab's father told the U.S. embassy in Abuja , Nigeria , that he was concerned about his son 's religious beliefs .
This information was passed on to U.S. intelligence officials .
Abdulmutallab received a valid U.S. visa in June 2008 that is good through 2010 .
His is one of about 550,000 names in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database , known as TIDE , which is maintained by the U.S. National Counterterrorism Centre and was created in response to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
COPENHAGEN --
Developing countries at the United Nations climate summit demanded that rich nations commit money and accept sharper cuts in their emissions , highlighting the divisions among the world 's rich and poor nations that stand in the way of a new global climate deal .
Representatives of China , the world 's largest greenhouse - gas emitter , said President Barack Obama 's proposal that the U.S. reduce its greenhouse - gas emissions by 17 % from 2005 levels by 2020 is n't ambitious enough .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China on Tuesday warned Western countries against taking up the case of a prominent dissident , Liu Xiaobo , who is facing trial for subversion , after the United States and European Union called for his release .

Liu âs lawyer said last week that Chinese prosecutors had decided to try him on charges of â inciting subversion of state power â for publishing essays critical of the ruling Communist Party and helping organize a petition demanding democratic transformation .
Liu has been among his country âs best known critics of restrictions on citizens â rights , and was detained late last year while helping oversee the launch of the â Charter 08 â petition for political change .
The European Union urged China on Monday to release him unconditionally , while the United States pressed Beijing to respect the rights of all Chinese citizens who peacefully express their desire for â internationally recognized freedoms .
But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said such calls amounted to interfering in the country âs judiciary .
â These accusations are unacceptable .
China is a country of rule of law .
The fundamental rights of Chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law , â she told a regular news conference .
â I want to stress that Chinese judicial bodies handle cases independently .
Outsiders have no right to interfere .
We oppose any external forces using this case to meddle in China âs internal affairs or judicial sovereignty . â
Jiang âs comments underscored that her government is unlikely to heed international pressure growing Liu , who could face trial as soon as next week .
Chinese courts come under Communist Party control and rarely reject prosecution accusations , especially in politically sensitive cases .
If convicted , the 53 - year - old dissident could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison .
A former literature professor , Liu has been a thorn in the party âs side since 1989 when he joined a hunger strike supporting student protesters days before the army crushed the pro-democracy movement centered on Tiananmen Square that year .
Liu âs wife , Liu Xia , told Reuters on Tuesday that he had met with his lawyer on Monday and been told to prepare to stand trial â very soon . â

It seems as though Infinity Ward âs Modern Warfare 2 is out breaking more records .
Last month , the game âs publisher , Activision , proclaimed the game as their most preordered game ever .
Well , this latest record may just top that .
GameStop , America âs biggest nationwide videogame retailer , touting over 6,000 stores , has announced Modern Warfare 2 as the most preordered game in the store âs 25 year history .
The executive vice president for merchandising and marketing Tony Bartel recently spoke about Modern Warfare 2 breaking the nationwide store âs preorder record .
â By all indicators , we anticipate Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 will be the biggest entertainment launch of all time . â
â As of today , the number of pre-order reservations we âve taken for the game is the highest for any title we âve ever sold in our 6,200 store network . â
GameStop did not say what game Modern Warfare 2 topped .
However , it is safe to assume that game may be Take - Two âs Grand Theft Auto IV .
GTA IV , which launched in April 2008 , managed to sell a whopping $ 500 million in its opening week .
Stick with PlayStation LifeStyle for all the latest news about what sure is to be one of the biggest releases of the year .

Modders recently discovered that their customized Xbox 360 consoles were banned from Microsoft 's Xbox Live service .
The latest sweep took out around 600,000 to one million consoles , hunting down modified firmware and locking the units off the network Microsoft said that in order to get back online , modders would need a new Xbox 360 console .
However , website 360 Mods says different , providing a fix to get those custom consoles back on Live .
The new workaround , iXtreme LT ( Light Touch ) , tries to make the altered firmware appear as the original , Microsoft - certified version while keeping the modded information .
The fix may even allow gamers to play backup disks under Microsoft 's nose .
Unfortunately , the workaround isnt simple .
Xbox - Scene reports that the fix is somewhat complex and requires the user to have access to the CPU key of a second , un- modded Xbox 360 console .
Still , the update relies on free tools provided online , however modders should be aware that both the modded console and the un-modded console cannot access Live at the same time ( as both use the same CPU key ) .

Act as if you are happy .
Be active and cheerful .
Get out and do happy things .
Body posture is important too .
Sit up straight rather than slouching .
Adopt an open or relaxed body language position .
Make your whole body say you are happy .
Move happily too , with a spring in your step and with relaxed swinging of your arms .
Verbally align also .
Speak like you are happy , using more positive words like ' love ' and ' great ' .
Refer to yourself less and others more .
Vary the pitch of your voice , especially avoiding a monotone .
Speak clearly and slightly faster ( but still slow enough so people understand ) .
Be pleasant to others .
Nod in agreement .
Laugh at their jokes and ensure they can be happy around you .
Avoid destructive criticism , of them , of others and of yourself .
Even by yourself , try forcing a smile .
Look in the mirror and make your face look happier .
Research shows that you should hold this expression for at least 15 to 30 seconds for it to be effective .
Discussion People who act happy , even when they are not , may not be ecstatic but they do end up happier than if they had just wallowed in their own misery .
The Facial Feedback Hypothesis says that if you just smile , forcing your lips , you will soon feel happier ( Strack et al. 1988 ) .
Research has shown that just clenching a pen lightly between the teeth ( hence creating a ' smile ' ) will soon make people feel happier .
When we do something that is contrary to our beliefs about ourselves , then we feel the tension of conflict between our beliefs and actions .
As a result we will move to resolve this tension by changing one or the other .
When we force ourselves to smile ( and keep smiling ) , then the only option is to change what we believe , and believing we are happy will lead us to actually feel happier .
There is also a reciprocal social effect : when you are happy with others , they will more likely be happy with you , thus setting up a social mood of happiness that will help you all .
It is worth noting that just forcing back your lips will not immediately make you ecstatic .
This is an incremental effect and which needs a little time to work .
' Happier ' is a relative term and if you have a deep unhappiness it will not necessarily go away of its own accord .
Nevertheless , just smiling can provide temporary relief and help you cope with where you are now .

Leaflets were handed out by police in Accrington to try to stop the attacks
An innocent man , who suffered months of abuse in a Lancashire community after false claims he was a paedophile , has died of a heart attack .
Two girls alleged Bryan Davies , 63 , had sexually touched them in August - but police found their claims were false and had no foundation .
His wife Debbie Davies believes the subsequent hate campaign in Accrington caused his death on Friday .
Police said they were continuing to provide support to the family .
" The doctor told me my husband died of a massive heart attack , " Mrs Davies , 43 , said .
" As far as I am concerned those girls are responsible for what happened to Bryan .
As far as I am concerned those girls are responsible for what happened to Bryan
Debbie Davies , widow " They are just nasty individuals .
They have got nothing between their ears , they are morons . "
The allegations were made after the couple refused to let the girls sleep over at their house or walk their dog , Mrs Davies said .
Although the girls ' stories were dismissed by officers Lancashire Police did not prosecute the pair .
A spokeswoman for the force said the decision was based on their ages and a more " informal approach " was taken with the the help of social services .
Police later handed out leaflets to locals in the neighbourhood to state officially the allegations were " false and without any foundation whatsoever " .
But a brick through their window , slashed car tyres and constant shouts of " paedo " and " pervert " in the street increased Mr Davies 's stress , his widow added .
Brick through window
The couple moved homes to another street in the town recently but malicious rumours spread and the abuse continued .
Mr Davies , originally from the Cardigan Bay area of Wales , had a brick thrown through the window of his house last week .
And on Friday he was taken to hospital with a kidney problem but slipped into unconsciousness and later died .
Lancashire Police said they had made " reassurance visits " to Mr Davies 's house on 29 November and again on 1 December .
Insp David Mangan said : " Our neighbourhood policing teams have been working closely with Mr Davies and his wife throughout and every complaint has been taken very seriously .
" This is obviously a very sad time for Mr Davies 's family and we are continuing to provide support for them . "

NEW DELHI : Continuing the commendable trend of the past decade , India 's forest cover increased by 728 sq km during 2005 - 07 â a marginal rise of 0.03 % .
Overall , 21.02 % of the country 's geographical area is now under green cover .
In the 10 years , forest cover in the country has increased by 3.31 million hectares , showing an average 0.46 % increase every year .
These figures are contained in the State of Forest Report 2009 , released by environment minister Jairam Ramesh on Monday .
The biennial report is based on satellite imagery up to 2007 .
Ramesh said India 's increasing forest cover deserved praise , especially when compared to the loss of 2.5 million ha of forests in Brazil every year .
India , however , lagged behind China 's achievement of gaining 4 million ha of forests annually .
While India seemed to be doing well in protecting dense forests , the report indicated that moderately dense forests were n't faring too well .
These are forests which lie mostly outside the national parks and sanctuaries .
Between 2005 - 07 , dense forest area increased by 38 sq km but 936 sq km of moderate forest got degraded .
The report will add weight to India 's demand at the Copenhagen climate talks that countries increasing their forest cover â which work as sinks to capture carbon â should be rewarded .
The debate in climate negotiations has till now tended to favour rewarding only nations which are able to reduce their rate of deforestation â typically countries such as Brazil and Indonesia .
But India and others have contended that this provides a perverse incentive to others to first cut their forests and then reduce the rate of destruction .
Indicating that some benefits may come the way of hill states , the minister said Himalayan states were carrying much of the burden of maintaining the green lungs for the country .
For the first time , the assessment report brought out data of forest cover as percentage of geographical area that can actually bear forests .
Regions above 4,000 metres from sea level ecologically do not have forests .
This significantly alters the forest cover in five hill states .
If areas above the tree line are kept out of calculations , forest cover in Himachal Pradesh increases to 44 % from 27 % , Arunachal Pradesh to 88 % from 82 % , Jammu and Kashmir to 33 % from 12 % , Sikkim to 84 % from 46 % and Uttarakhand to 59 % from 47 % .
The presence of Vijay Kelkar , chairman of the 13th Finance Commission , at the release of the report indicated that the Centre might again suggest a formula to share some revenues based on forest cover as was done under the 10th Finance Commission .
The biggest losses in forest cover , in absolute terms , were recorded in Andhra Pradesh ( 129 sq km ) , Assam ( 66 sq km ) and Chhattisgarh ( 59 sq km ) .
The Northeast , which contains one - forth of India 's forest cover , is peculiar due to traditional practices of shifting cultivation which make a steady assessment difficult .
While Mizoram saw a gain of 640 sq km and Manipur of 328 sq km , Nagaland suffered a loss of 201 sq km and Tripura 100 sq km to swidden agriculture .
West of the chicken neck region , Jharkhand surprisingly showed the most impressive gains by adding 172 sq km of forest in two years .
Orissa also added 100 sq km .
But officials clarified that the methodology followed in reporting the forest cover was unable to discern between natural forests and plantations .
This required more expensive and higher resolution satellite imagery .
Experts have for years contended that the increase in forest cover as a stand alone parameter is not a good measure of the health of forests as increase in commercial plantations does not add as much value to biodiversity in the country .
Growing Green
Forest Cover in 2007 - 21.02 % of geographical area
Tree Cover in 2007 - 2.82 %
Forest cover growth in a decade : 3.13 million ha
Out of the 728 sq km increase in 2005 - 07 , 690 sq km gained in the 188 tribal districts of the country
The forest cover in the hill states is 53.72 % of the possible forest area
Elegant it is not .

The back of the restaurant is a warren of tiny storage areas plus a larger room where Moran âs malt scrolls and cracked - wheat logs with sesame crusts are baked daily â not a viable economic proposition for a restaurant of this size .

When there was too great a demand in Australia for organic butter and he could nât get any , he found organic cream , and now the butter is made on the premises , too .
His cuisine is part home cooking , part Italian , and part gastropub â sturdy food enhanced with pan drippings and plenty of lemon .
Plate arrangements are not elaborate ; the food arrives looking au naturel .
What makes it unparalleled are his products , for Australia takes the concept of organic seriously .
It is not a marketing tool , as in America , but a guarantee of superior quality .
He and his partner , Michael Robertson , live partly in the Blue Mountains , a hundred kilometers away and a thousand meters above sea level , where they have , as Moran describes it , â a shack , a veggie patch , and fruit trees . â
I ate alone , but not for long .
Seated next to me were three Australian women who had ordered exactly the same food so as not to suffer â dish envy . â
They yanked my wooden table closer to theirs â strong Aussie stock , they were â and proceeded to nibble everything that came my way : firm Coffin Bay oysters that had nât spawned ; chunky prawn - and - cauliflower dumplings , much like coarse quenelles , in a prawn broth ; slivers of black truffles , cultivated on Australian soil , with hand - rolled noodles ; and skin - on panfried harpuka , a game fish , with sorrel gnocchi , each course accompanied by a local wine , the term somewhat loosely defined .
My favorite was an â06 Saint Clair Reserve Pinot Grigio from New Zealand .

Everywhere I went , I asked about greatness .
Learning its meaning was as much my obsession as eating at restaurants that demonstrably possessed it .
I worry now and then that I have a rather narrow viewpoint , one limited to my sense of taste , although I know I am occasionally able to expand my parameters to include beauty , kindness , and history .
Michel Troisgros told me that to find greatness in the modern world , â You have to love the work , love the people , and love the life .
That is the same for all professions , but for a chef it is a big responsibility because you take from the planet what it gives you naturally .
I think that is the new thing in cooking today .
It is not like thirty years ago , when our customers were eating for the sake of eating .
People do not want to eat a lot .
They want the experience of eating .
The chef is the artist and the artisan .
He has to interpret what nature gives him . â
For Franck Cerutti of Le Louis XV , the cost of greatness is not sleeping at night , of continually asking himself how he might make his kitchen better .
He says , â Here at Le Louis XV , we are very organized to being sick about organization .
Sometimes I am afraid we lose the instinctiveness from so much of it .
I taste every day , every minute , always questioning myself : Â Is this the way it should be ? â
So much doubt ! â Nadia Santini says that on the day after she married her husband and became part of the dal Pescatore family , her husband âs grandmother Teresa said to her , â We eat well today because we worked very well yesterday , and if we want to eat well tomorrow , we must work very well today .
For thirty - three years , when I arrive in the kitchen , I think what it is to work very well . â
For Moran of Sean âs Panaroma , â It âs all in the attitude , the vibe , that comes out of the kitchen .
If it âs there , you can feel it when you walk into a restaurant . â
Eric Ripert of Le Bernardin adds , â To make a restaurant great , you can not compromise standards .
If I serve truffles , I could certainly fake them with fake truffles and truffle oil and 99 percent of my clientele would not see the difference .
We do nât do that . â
AdriÃ  has the most straightforward explanation of all : â People who are able to make something magic and you ca nât explain it â that is great . â
I expected greatness from these seven restaurants .
I encountered no disappointments .
I ate much more than I expected I would , but perhaps that is the best definition of greatness .
In its presence , a fork is impossible to put down .
SEATTLE Â
A man suspected of fatally shooting four uniformed police officers was shot and killed on a residential street here early Tuesday by a police officer who chanced upon him during a routine patrol when investigating a stolen car , the authorities said .
The death of the man , Maurice Clemmons , ended an extensive manhunt as Mr. Clemmons , 37 , eluded multiple police sweeps and SWAT team investigations of houses and neighborhoods throughout Seattle and nearby Tacoma for nearly 48 hours .
When Mr. Clemmons was killed , officials said , he was carrying a gun that had belonged to one of the four officers , who were shot Sunday morning at a coffee shop near Tacoma .
They also said he had a previous bullet wound to his stomach from a shot fired by one of four officers .
Even as the manhunt ended , the case became layered with arrests of people accused of helping Mr. Clemmons flee the police and continued to raise questions over how he had been released from jail just last week despite multiple pending felony charges and a lengthy criminal history .

Less than three weeks after health officials convened a press conference in Thailand to announce a rare piece of good news in the hunt for an HIV vaccine , some scientists are asking whether the results were overstated .
The large clinical trial of the vaccine was a modest success , but it was plenty exciting for HIV vaccine researchers who have been waiting for years for any sign of progress .
The U.S. Army and Thai researchers who collaborated on the trial found that the vaccine
lowered the risk of infection by about 31 % â a â modest benefit , â they said , but one that was statistically significant , suggesting the finding was not a fluke [ The Wall Street Journal , blog ] .
But the press conference did not trumpet another analysis of the data , which included only those volunteers who carefully followed the experiment 's rules and got the full regimen of six shots at the right times .
This second analysis showed a 26 percent rate of protection , and a much higher chance that the benefit was a fluke .
Some scientists say both analyses should have been revealed during the September announcement , and claim that the way the press conference was handled further undermines the research .
â The press conference was not a scholarly , rigorously honest presentation , â said one leading HIV / AIDS investigator , who like others asked that his name not be used .
â It does nât meet the standards that have been set for other trials , and it does nât fully present the borderline results .
It âs wrong â [ ScienceInsider ] .
The scientists who ran the study are standing by both their work and the presentation of the findings .
Colonel Nelson Michael , one of the researchers , notes that
a paper under review at the New England Journal of Medicine describes both analyses , and all the findings will be discussed on 20 October at an open AIDS vaccine meeting in Paris .
â We tried very carefully to make sure that message was crystal clear , â said Michael .
â There âs now hope .
But that said , we âve tried to be very careful not to oversell this â [ ScienceInsider ] .
Michael 's team also gave private briefings to a select group of researchers after the press conference , in which they discussed both analyses .
Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , believes that the researchers behaved appropriately .
Putting several biostatistical analyses in a news release â would have confused everybody , â Dr. Fauci said , and suggesting that the researchers were engaging in a cover - up is â absurd . â [ But in ] retrospect , he said , the Army âs decision to brief other players in the field before the late October Paris conference â backfired â [ The New York Times ]
, because some researchers began hearing rumors about suppressed data .
The researchers can expect fireworks and tough questions when they present their at the AIDS Vaccine Conference later this month .
And they may find that even some scientists who support the substance of their work take issue with their style .
Some AIDS researchers and activists who have learned of the additional data still think the vaccine shows promise and should be investigated further .
But they worry that not disclosing the study transparently will cause people to conclude the vaccine trial was a failure and undermine support for more research [ The Wall Street Journal ] .

A mathematical model has explained some of the remarkable features of mosquito hearing .
In particular , the male can hear the faintest beats of the female 's wings and yet is not deafened by loud noises .
The new research from the University of Bristol is published in the Journal of the Royal Society : Interface
Insects have evolved diverse and delicate morphological structures in order to hear the naturally low energy of a transmitting sound wave .
In mosquitoes , the hearing of acoustic energy , and its conversion into neuronal signals , is assisted by multiple individual sensory units called scolopidia .
The researchers have developed a simple microscopic mechanistic model of the active amplification in the Tanzanian mosquito species Toxorhynchites brevipalpis .
The model is based on the description of the antenna as a forced - damped oscillator attached to a set of active threads ( groups of scolopidia ) that provide an impulsive force when they twitch .
The twitching is controlled by channels that are opened and closed if the antennal oscillation reaches critical amplitude .
The model matches both qualitatively and quantitatively with recent experiments : spontaneous oscillations , nonlinear amplification , hysteresis , 2:1 resonances , frequency response , gain loss due to hypoxia .
The numerical simulations also generate new hypotheses .
In particular , the model seems to indicate that scolopidia located toward the tip of the Johnston 's organ are responsible for the entrainment of the other scolopidia , and that they give the largest contribution to the mechanical amplification .
Dr Daniele Avitabile , Research Assistant in the Bristol Centre for Applied Nonlinear Mathematics in the Department of Engineering Maths , said : " The numerical results presented also generate new questions .
In our description of the system , for instance , all threads have the same material properties , but their impact on the dynamics of the antenna varies according to the spatial location of the threads : intuitively , an external thread induces a much larger torque than an internal one .
" However , the true physiology of the threads is more complex , due to the curved arrangement of Johnston 's organ , and further research into the effect of the subsequent mechanical variation of each thread needs to be carried out . "
The paper will be published in the January issue of the Journal of the Royal Society Interface , which will be online on 20 November 2009 .

Smoking guns across Australia :
Where âs the warming ?
Looking at 16 other locations
If there was enough money , fame and power on the table ( think seismic proportions , money that moves the economic landscape ) , would it be possible to take a small unproven scientific theory as an excuse and , with the best PR teams in the world , promote it , support it , and make it appear unquestionable ?
If it were cloaked in the most â innocent â of motives , and shrouded in terminology that veils the truth , would it not run unchecked for years , unless some big vested interest opposed it ?
And if there was no particular big vested interest to oppose it , is nât it possible that if the only harm it causes is to the giant disorganized mass known as humankind , there would be no committee of humankind to check its momentum .
On Watts Up tonight , we get some insight into just one specific example of how corrupt science can be .
It âs yet another day in the history of the climate - scam where people may say years from now â¦ remember that night we got the news about Darwin ?
Thanks to Willis Eschenbach âs dedicated analysis .
The blue line is the raw unadjusted data from Darwin .
There are five stations there and their records are a very tight fit .
It âs unusual for all five stations to agree with each other .
Yet one of the three top climate centres in the world has â adjusted the data â using corrections that are graphed in black .
( More artificial adjustments ? )
The raw data shows a trend down of 0.7 degrees C per century .
After adjustment , the data â shows â a trend up of 1.2 degrees warming per century .
It âs the scale of this shift that is so brazen .
We âre supposed to be looking for a rise of one fifth of a degree per decade , and that statistical adjustment gave us half that rise .
Could Darwin be a local anomaly ?
If Darwin had some freak local conditions , then we would expect to see the raw data in graphs from other top - end towns as trending much higher .
Here are the graphs for Wyndham , Derby , Halls Creek and Broome .
The graphs are from WA Climate Net , an excellent data set .
Direct , Broome is 1100 km from Darwin , or 690 miles .
( By road , it âs 1876 km from Darwin ) .
( Thanks to MapCrow for the distances ) .
I thought I would post these graphs to give people a rough idea of the historical warming across the far tropical north of Australia .
Western Australia
none there
Global Warming missed Wyndham too .
Halls Creek is inland , and there is a slight rising trend starting around 1920 .
About 1 degree C ?
Derby is coastal , and again , no global warming â¦
Broome is â¦ running smack on average too .
These towns span thousands of square miles , and yet there is nothing to suggest major warming in any of the coastal ones and only a slight climb in the inland town .
Nothing large enough to drag the average for the region up .
David Evans and I posted a joint paper about six weeks ago â The Future of Climate Alarmism is Bogus Statistics . â
It all seems so tame now , but this was before ClimateGate , and before today âs revelations .
The bogus statistics were there all the time .
Just for a looksee , I alsoo went searching for the warmer tropics in the Northern Territory and Queensland .
What I found was a mixed bag , but long records at outstations ( without major airports ) showed that global warming appears to have more effect on computers at NOAA , than on the northern part of our landmass .
There is some evidence that it affects airports too .
Tropical north Australia
â¦
Northern Territory
Katherine aviation museum ( that âs right , there is hardly any data from the Northern Territory over long periods ) .
Larrimar NT ( 1965 â 2007 )
Daly waters ( 1930 â 1980 ) Cooling trend ?
Victoria River Downs , NT , no warming since 1965 â 2009 .
Queensland ( West )
â¦
Mt Isa , Queensland .
Another airport with a rising temperature , but it matches the towns far to the west and south .
Perhaps it âs a real effect ?
( See Camooweal and Urandangi )
But it âs also near Julia Creek ( unfortunately missing data ) and in the same quarter as Boulia , which has a long term record which is more complete than most of the others , and yet shows no warming .
Julia Creek ( 1965 â 2000 )
Camooweal does appear to be warming .
It âs a small town on the border of the Northern Territory and Queensland
â¦
Boulia , Qld ( More info here , that map tells you a lot â¦ )
An airport with no warming and long continuous records â 1886 â 2009 !
Latitude : 22.91Â° S Longitude : 139.90Â° E ( Just in the tropics ) .
â¦
Two cases of warming !
Urandangi Qld , 150 km from Mt Isa on the border of Queensland and the NT ( yes , inland , south of Camooweal ) .
Queensland ( East )
â¦
Cairns Airport â - another airport with more traffic and larger areas under concrete ?
â¦
â¦
Herberton Qld ( 1910 â 1992 )
No warming in Herberton , and it âs about 100 km from Cairns .
â¦â¦â¦
Townsville Aerodrome shows a clear rising trend since 1940
â¦
But Ayr Research Station 70 km away shows no warming during the same time period ( 1950 â 2009 ) .
Does â¦..
I generated these graphs using the Bureau of Meteorology website , and there are more sites there to look at .
Perhaps you can find the missing warming locations across the vast north that would bring the average up ?
Is there any way the official calculated averages for northern Australia could reflect the data we have on the ground ?
UPDATE : This is the graph from the IPCC ( As from Watts Up ) .

As the fallout from CRUHACK grows , the biggest story is not actually whether data was manipulated in individual cases , although in my view that 's bad .
And it's not that global warming scientists were so arrogant in 2004 as to mock the death of an opponent , although that too is bad .
It 's not that some of these scientists were sitting on taxpayer - sourced slush funds worth tens of millions of dollars each , for an industry total of somewhere close to US $ 100 billion , whilst their supporters raised merry - hell about Exxon sponsoring skeptic research to the tune of a few million , although this too is massively hypocritical .
It 's not that the scientists show signs of being political activists , and even helping promote a global governance agenda .
No , in my view the biggest scandal to erupt from CRUHACK is the death of peer - reviewed climate science .
We now all know â the entire industrialized world â that while global warming scientists and their supporters were publicly ridiculing skeptic 's arguments as " not peer reviewed " because â by implication â the arguments were not good enough , that in fact some of the top scientific advisors to the UN IPCC were conspiring ( and that is the right word ) to sabotage any attempt by other scientists to publish peer reviewed papers challenging global warming .
We now know the UN IPPC / Global Governance lobby had sufficient political clout to intimidate scientific journals into submission and to run roughshod over the integrity of the peer review process .
The next global warming believer who raises " peer review " as a defence of global warming deserves to be metaphorically tarred and feathered and laughed at for the rest of his or her natural life .
The Wegman report to the US Congress found unhealthy links between the IPCC 's scientific advisors .
The CRUHACK emails now prove that festering scientific corruption beyond reasonable doubt .
The integrity of climate science died this weekend .
It will never be the same .
Given that these are the men and women who 've been telling the world 's political leaders " trust us " , as they shore up plans to introduce massive global taxes , this should give every President and Prime Minister cause for concern .
Do you really want to stake your country 's economic future on the advice of scientists shown to have an agenda , and to have corrupted the only process capable of whistleblowing bad science ?
How are we to know from now on whether any of the papers these scientists have been associated with is genuine , and not just rubber stamped by their mates to suit a common goal ?
Now to some of the highlights .
( By the way , if you want to search the emails yourself , enter the file names or keywords into this search engine )
MANIPULATION OF DATA
The emails disclose the IPCC chose , for political rather than scientific reasons , to keep using a 1961 - 1990 baseline for atmospheric temperature measurements .
We 've all been told ad nauseum that 30 years is " a climate trend " .
So by 2007 's AR4 report you 'd have to ask why they were n't choosing a 1976 - 2005 baseline ?
The answer is this :
Neil
There is a preference in the atmospheric observations chapter of IPCC AR4 to stay with the 1961 - 1990 normals .
This is partly because a change of normals confuses users , e.g. anomalies will seem less positive than before if we change to newer normals , so the impression of global warming will be muted .
SOURCE : 1105019698.txt
There you go .
Proof you 've been played for suckers .
More modern data would have disclosed less warming in recent times , because 1961 - 1990 coincided with a cold cycle and that ancient baseline makes modern warming look tropical by comparison , hence it is perfect to overinflate the significance of the warming for political purposes .
Now let 's look at whether we should ever consider anything less than a 30 year climate trend .
Hot Topic contributor , geologist P Scadden , suggests never :
scaddenp November 3 , 2009 at 11:41 am
Boy , am I sick of reiterating this .
CLIMATE is about a 30 year trend .
The models predict what happens on a 30 year trend .
But here 's what a man at the climate coalface , CRU director Phil Jones says in his email about the must - be - adhered - to 30 year trend , as he made the case for picking a 20 year dataset instead :
20 years ( 1981 -2000 ) is n't 30 years , but the rationale for 30 years is n't that compelling .
The original argument was for 35 years around 1900 because Bruckner found 35 cycles in some west Russian
lakes ( hence periods like 1881 - 1915 ) .
This went to 30 as it easier to compute .
Personally I do n't want to change the base period till after I retire !
Cheers
Phil
Extraordinary !
All this time the global warming believers have been stridently insisting that only a 30 year measurement is valid , and then the leaked emails disclose they plucked that figure out of the air , so to speak , and the logic behind it " is n't that compelling " .
Feeling like a sucker yet ?
And if a ten year trend is nothing , officially , then why was UA - based ex-pat Kiwi scientist Kevin Trenberth having this heated debate in early October this year about the fact that temperature increases have hit a brick wall and stopped , in defiance of UN Policy and Greenpeace pronouncements about imminent catastrophe :
Where the heck is global warming ?
We are asking that here in Boulder where we have broken records the past two days for the coldest days on record .
We had 4 inches of snow .
The high the last 2 days was below 30 F and the normal is 69 F , and it smashed the previous records for these days by 10 F .
The low was about 18 F and also a record low , well below the previous record low .
This is January [ winter ] weather [ in early autumn ] ( see the Rockies baseball playoff game was canceled on saturday and then played last night in below freezing weather ) .
The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't .
The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming : but the data are surely wrong .
Our observing system is inadequate .
SOURCE 1255352257.txt
For that matter , this inconvenient truth remained suppressed at the heavily staged media climate briefing I was locked out of recently .
Surely , Trenberth 's colleagues must have reassured him " it 's just weather , not climate " , and " short term data is irrelevant , it 's the 30 year trend that 's important " .
Mick Kelly , another climate scientist with Kiwi connections , was so concerned recently about the fact that the global temperature has stopped rising that he told his colleagues he was erasing that inconvenient truth from his powerpoint presentations so the public would not find out :

Yeah , it was n't so much 1998 and all that that I was concerned about , used
to dealing with that , but the possibility that we might be going through a
longer - 10 year - period of relatively stable temperatures beyond what you
might expect from La Nina etc .
Speculation , but if I see this as a possibility then others might also .
Anyway , I 'll maybe cut the last few points off the filtered curve before I
give the talk again as that 's trending down as a result of the end effects
and the recent cold - ish years .
Enjoy Iceland and pass on my best wishes to Astrid .
Mick SOURCE 1225026120.txt
And I ask the Presidents and Prime Ministers again : how do you know the climate " scientists " briefing you are not fudging the data to hide inconvenient truths from you ?
Little wonder they 're panicking .
One of Europe 's top climate scientists has run the numbers and found no global warming in ten years , once natural variations had been accounted for .
Yep â 0.0C change in temperatures .
As Kevin Trenberth famously said , " Where the heck is global warming ? "
But that 's OK , because we know the UN climate scientists are peer reviewed .
In my new book Air Con : The Seriously Inconvenient Truth About Global Warming , I quoted the case of one climate scientist who was told in an email " we must get rid of the Medieval Warm Period " , in reference to the data that shows it was much warmer a thousand years ago than it is now .
The leaked emails now confirm the author of that instruction was Jonathan Overpeck , and it seemed to be a continuing theme â erase inconvenient data so as not to " confuse " the public .
Michael Mann , of " hockey stick " fabrication fame , wrote this email :
Phil and I have recently submitted a paper using about a dozen NH records that fit this category , and many of which are available nearly 2 K back âI think that trying to adopt a timeframe of 2 K , rather than the usual 1 K , addresses a good earlier point that Peck made w/ regard to the memo , that it would be nice to try to " contain " the putative " MWP " , even if we do n't yet have a hemispheric mean reconstruction available that far back â¦ .
So even though they had no scientific basis to get rid of it , they got rid of it .
The next spotty - faced , Greenpeace - indoctrinated callow little leftie youth I encounter in a blog exchange who uses the word " cherry - picking " in relation to skeptic arguments will also be laughed at long and loud .
PEER REVIEW IS A JOKE
Rather than me re-inventing the wheel , check out Andrew Bolt 's nice synopsis of the corrupting of peer review , then read on here .
This email from Phil Jones to Michael Mann is illuminating , because it appears to suggest among other things that Mann might have been in a position to review studies dealing with his own work ( he produced the MBH paper Jones refers to .
It also shows Jones is peer reviewing a paper criticizing the data produced by Jones ' CRU unit .
If that 's not incestuous , I do n't know what is :

Mike ,
Just agreed to review a paper for GRL â it is absolute rubbish .
It is having a go at the CRU temperature data â not the latest vesion , but the one you used in MBH98 !!
We added lots of data in for the region this person says has Urban Warming !
So easy review to do .
Sent Ben the Soon et al. paper and he wonders who reviews these sorts of things .
Says GRL has n't a clue with editors or reviewers .
By chance they seem to have got the right person with the one just received .
Can I ask you something in CONFIDENCE â do n't email around , especially not to Keith and Tim here .
Have you reviewed any papers recently for Science that say that MBH98 and MJ03 have underestimated variability in the millennial record â from models or from some low - freq proxy data .
Just a yes or no will do .
Tim is reviewing them â I want to make sure he takes my comments on board , but he wants to be squeaky clean with discussing them with others .
So forget this email when you reply .
Cheers
Phil
Again , in my opinion both Mann and Jones have clear conflicts of interest , yet they are effectively peer reviewing their own work and attacking other scientists in the process .
What a joke .
The global warming brigade can try and spin it as much as they like , but even their colleagues are n't buying anymore , as this comment posted on Mann 's website RealClimate by another scientist shows :
Darrell ( 15:18:21 ) :
From the same Real Climate thread :
I see a problem when it comes to suggesting that the " skeptics " need to publish in the peer - reviewed literature ( which is something that I continually push as well ) , all the while working to try to prevent them publishing in the literature .
I can pretty much guarantee that several recent papers that I ( and co-authors ) have submitted to the peer - reviewed literature would have been accepted had they carried different authorship .
And I would bet that this is not only limited to my co-authors .
I grow more suspicious that submitted papers that include particular authors are red-flagged for ' special treatment . '
For a long time I denied ( to myself and others ) that this was the case , but recent experience has me thinking differently .
I hope that I am wrong .
Today 's information has done little to reassure me
The Wall Street Journal found an email in the haul from another scientist worried about the corruption of science by influencing the peer review process :
One email from 1999 , titled " CENSORED !!!!! " showed one U.S. - based scientist uncomfortable with such tactics .
" As for thinking that it is ' Better that nothing appear , than something unacceptable to us ' â¦ as though we are the gatekeepers of all that is acceptable in the world of paleoclimatology seems amazingly arrogant .
Science moves forward whether we agree with individual articles or not , " the email said .
Scientist , Dr Timothy
Ball was taking a similar line to me while I was writing this post , and it's worth including a couple of his observations on the implications :
Professor Wegman showed how this " community of scientists " published together and peer reviewed each other 's work .
I was always suspicious about why peer review was such a big deal .
Now all my suspicions are confirmed .
The emails reveal how they controlled the process , including manipulating some of the major journals like Science and Nature .
We know the editor of the Journal of Climate , Andrew Weaver , was one of the " community " .
They organized lists of reviewers when required making sure they gave the editor only favorable names .
They threatened to isolate and marginalize one editor who they believed was recalcitrant .
And :
Total Control
These people controlled the global weather data used by the IPCC through the joint Hadley and CRU and produced the HadCRUT data .
They controlled the IPCC , especially crucial chapters and especially preparation of the Summary for PolicyMakers ( SPM ) .
Stephen Schneider was a prime mover there from the earliest reports to the most influential in 2001 .
They also had a left wing conduit to the New York Times .
The emails between Andy Revkin and the community are very revealing and must place his journalistic integrity in serious jeopardy .
Of course the IPCC Reports and especially the SPM Reports are the basis for Kyoto and the Copenhagen Accord , but now we know they are based on completely falsified and manipulated data and science .
It is no longer a suspicion .
Surely this is the death knell for the CRU , the IPCC , Kyoto and Copenhagen and the Carbon Credits shell game .
CO2 never was a problem and all the machinations and deceptions exposed by these files prove that it was the greatest deception in history , but nobody is laughing .
It is a very sad day for science and especially my chosen area of climate science .
As I expected now it is all exposed I find there is no pleasure in " I told you so . "
THEY'RE NOT SCIENTISTS , THEY'RE GLOBAL CHANGE AGENTS
" It was good to see you again yesterday - if briefly .
One particular thing you said - and we agreed - was about the IPCC reports and the broader climate negotiations were working to the globalisation agenda driven by organisations like the WTO .
So my first question is do you have anything written or published , or know of anything particularly on this subject , which talks about this in more detail ? "
" I am very strongly in favor of as wide and rapid a distribution as possible for endorsements .
I think the only thing that counts is numbers .
The media is going to say " 1000 scientists signed " or " 1500 signed " .
No one is going to check if it is 600 with PhDs versus 2000 without .
They will mention the prominent ones , but that is a different story . "
These guys were in a battle for public hearts and minds and would spare nothing to push their bigger propaganda agenda .
In fact , one UN IPCC discussion document [ SOURCE 889554019.txt ] contained in the emails and sent to climate scientists and other hangers on explicitly talks of the IPCC 's real agenda in selling the climate change message :
Our approach has been to develop a set of four " scenario families " .
The storylines of each of these scenario families describes a demographic , politico - economic , societal and technological future .
Within each family one or more scenarios explore global energy industry and other developments and their implications for Greenhouse Gas Emissions and other pollutants .
These are a starting point for climate impact modelling .
The scenarios we have built explore two main questions for the 21st century , neither of which we know the answer to :
- Can adequate governance -- institutions and agreements -- be put in place to manage global problems ?
- Will society 's values focus more on enhancing material wealth or be more broadly balanced , incorporating environmental health and social well - being .
The way we answer these questions leads to four families of scenarios :
- Golden Economic Age ( A1 ) : a century of expanded economic prosperity with the emergence of global governance
- Sustainable Development ( B1 ) : in which global agreements and institutions , underpinned by a value shift , encourages the integration of ecological and economic goals
- Divided World ( A2 ) : difficulty in resolving global issues leads to a world of autarkic regions
- Regional Stewardship ( B2 ) : in the face of weak global governance there is a focus on managing regional / local ecological and equity
Easy to see the preferred option .
But of course , as we all know , the UN has no agenda for global governance , because left - wingers like Kevin Rudd tell us it ai n't so .

In some countries FGM is seen as a way to ensure virginity Ugandan MPs have voted to outlaw female genital mutilation - also known as female circumcision .
Anyone convicted of the practice , which involves cutting off a girl 's clitoris , will face 10 years in jail , or a life sentence if a victim dies .
The BBC's Joshua Mmali in Uganda says it is not officially condoned but is still practised in several rural areas .
Rights groups welcomed the move , but urged awareness campaigns to ensure the centuries - old practice stops .
Genital mutilation is seen in some countries as a way to ensure virginity and to make a woman suitable for marriage .
It 's cruel , it traumatises people , it 's led children to drop out of school , it 's a health hazard
MP Alice Alaso
Our reporter says it is still practised by the Sabiny , some Karamojong sub - groups and the Pokot in eastern Uganda and the Nubi people of West Nile .
MP Alice Alaso said the move was " a very significant achievement " .
" It 's a very bad practice .
It 's cruel , it traumatises people , it 's led children to drop out of school , it 's a health hazard , " she told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
" This is a warning signal - whoever dares practice female genital mutilation will be subject to the law . "
Another MP , Lulume Bayiga , said the law would liberate both men and women - who often face being ostracised for shunning the custom .
" Women will start for the first time to enjoy sex and it's going to do away with various diseases , " he told the BBC .
According to the UN , about three million girls each year in Africa are at risk of genital mutilation , with more than 91 million girls and women living with the consequences of the procedure .
These include bleeding , shock , infections and a higher rate of death for new - born babies .

London , England ( CNN ) --
He has played kings , princes , captains and professors on stage and screen , but now actor Patrick Stewart will have a new title all his own : " Sir . "
The 69 - year - old Yorkshire , England , native tops the list of those receiving New Year 's honors from Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II , the Cabinet Office announced Thursday .
Stewart , well - known for playing Capt .
Jean - Luc Picard on " Star Trek : The Next Generation , " will receive a knighthood .
It means he will now be known in Britain as " Sir Patrick . "
Others on the list include designers , restaurateurs and two famous names from Formula 1 racing .
Ross Brawn , who started the Brawn GP Formula 1 team that won the constructors championship in 2009 , will receive an OBE , which stands for Officer of the Order of the British Empire .
Brawn started his eponymous team this year after buying out the existing Honda team .
Mercedes - Benz took over the team last month , announcing that Brawn would remain at the helm and that the team would be renamed Mercedes GP .
Jenson Button , who won the 2009 Formula 1 drivers championship , will receive an MBE , or Member of the Order of the British Empire .
He races with the Brawn - Mercedes team .
The 2008 F1 champion , Lewis Hamilton , received an MBE last year .
British designer Amanda Wakeley , whose designs grace models on the catwalk and celebrities on the red carpet , will receive an OBE .
Two other British designers will receive MBEs .
Cath Kidston is known for putting traditional floral prints on modern accessories , and Luella Bartley was hailed for mixing prim and punk before her label was forced to close last month .
Also receiving an MBE are Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers , who together started the River Cafe in London , along the Thames .
Their passion for Italian cuisine has led critics to call the restaurant one of the most influential in Britain , and the two have written several cookbooks together .
A committee within the British Cabinet Office assembles the honors list , which is released twice a year -- at New Year 's and on the queen 's birthday in June .
Queen Elizabeth awards the honors to recipients in ceremonies at Buckingham Palace .
The awards recognize service and achievement in all fields and are considered a major honor for British citizens .
Noncitizens may also be recognized .
A knighthood is the highest honor .
Men are made knights , after which they are called " sirs , " and women are made dames .
Below that comes CBE , which stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire .
OBE and MBE follow respectively .
Dr. Bernstein cannot say which was more jarring : the news or the way it arrived .
Numb , he kept his composure for 25 minutes , he said .
The administrators explained that the hospital was running a deficit .
The diabetes program was not helping matters .
" It was really not about the medicine but the business , " Dr. Fink said recently about the meeting .
" That did n't make it any easier to deliver the news , especially since I had been one of the main advocates behind getting the center started . "
After the meeting , as Dr. Bernstein walked back to his office , he wondered where he would direct the program 's 300 or so patients .
Still , he remained sympathetic to the hospital 's plight .
" I was not of the belief that we should save the center only to end up losing the hospital , " he said .
For many of the patients , the news was a second strike of lightning .
They had come to Dr. Bernstein only after being cut loose by the closing of the St Luke 's diabetes center earlier that year .
Now they were being cut loose again , to drift back to a life of limited care options : understaffed and overwhelmed clinics ; general practitioners with too little time ; a city with about 100 overbooked diabetes educators surrounded by 800,000 patients ; and a shortage of endocrinologists , the specialists who are often critical providers of diabetes care .
Since endocrinology is one of the lower - paying specialties , there is a national shortage of such doctors .
In New York , with its armies of diabetics , patients must often wait months for an appointment with one of fewer than 200 endocrinologists .
The poorest patients face the biggest problem , as only a fraction of the specialists accept Medicaid .
Once the center had closed , Dr. Bernstein continued to teach at Beth Israel , but he began to devote more and more time to a side project .
He was working on an inhaler that delivers insulin in the form of a mist .
The product is being developed by Generex , and it is designed to appeal to patients who are reluctant to use insulin because they do not like the idea of injections or needles .
